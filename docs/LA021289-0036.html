			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MOST UNLISTED PHONES;  </P> <P> EASTERNERS FINALLY GET LINE ON L.A.  </P> <P> For years, Americans have ridiculed Southern California's fabled rootlessness,  that sense of disconnected ennui, New Age cocooning and traffic-jam isolation  chronicled by unfriendly East Coast writers.  </P> <P> Californians themselves often have been impatient with such analysis and quick  to discount it as envy and sour grapes from people bitter about lack of  sunshine and orange blossoms in their lives.  </P> <P> Now, however, marketing researchers from the frosty environs of Fairfield,  Conn., have produced a troubling survey that seems to back up with real numbers  some longstanding impressions about the self-absorbed West Coast.  </P> <P> Survey Sampling Inc. reports that residents of Los Angeles have become so  disdainful of uninvited contact with the outside world that more than half have  unlisted telephone numbers, far more than in any major city in the country.  </P> <P> The Connecticut company, which sells telephone numbers to market research  firms, said the 56% figure for unlisted numbers in Los Angeles is exceeded only  in Las Vegas, whose residents' rootlessness and nighttime schedules have  produced an unlisted phone rate of 60.3%.  </P> <P> According to the survey, 8 of the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas for unlisted  numbers are in California.  </P> <P> John Lamb, the firm's client-service specialist, said he is not certain what  produced this phenomenon but gives some credence to the notion that "a lot of  people who live in California screwed up something in the East and are trying  to get as far away from that and from other people as possible."  </P> <P> Another factor may be a high percentage of young adults in the West. The survey  shows that, throughout the country, two-thirds of those with unlisted numbers  are under 40.  </P> <P> Unlike older Americans, many of whom apparently consider unlisted numbers  faintly unneighborly, the younger generation appears to see great advantage in  keeping its phone numbers secret from salesmen, fund-raisers and rejected  suitors, even if it costs an extra 30 cents a month.  </P> <P> The average percentage of unlisted numbers for all metropolitan areas in the  country climbed from 21.8% in 1984 to 27.6% last year, and Lamb said the steady  growth will continue.  </P> <P> Charlene Baldwin, spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, said her records show a  somewhat smaller percentage of unlisted numbers. About 45% of the company's 1.9  million customers in Los Angeles County are unlisted, as are about 40% of all  Bell customers in the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Once a Sign of Fame  </P> <P> This goes much higher in areas such as Beverly Hills, "where you don't see a  very large phone book," she said.  </P> <P> Unlisted numbers once were considered signs of fame and fortune, of people too  important to be bothered. But the survey indicates a similar reluctance on the  lower end of the income scale to list telephone numbers, particularly as  computerized campaigns to sell everything from toothpaste to travel packages  flood telephone lines around dinner time.  </P> <P> Many people take their numbers out of the book in the hope of preventing such  calls.  </P> <P> This often does not work, because many firms use random-dialing systems that  catch unlisted numbers anyway.  </P> <P> The resulting customer distress plants potentially profitable seeds of interest  in a new device that will let the discriminating resident screen all calls  while the phone is ringing.  </P> <P> Known as "Caller ID" or "Custom Local Area Signaling Service (CLASS)," the  system uses a small, $80 box that attaches to the telephone and provides a  digital display of the number from which the call is placed. If the number is  unfamiliar or that of an annoying friend or angry boss, the call can be  ignored.  </P> <P> Baldwin said the system is to be introduced in California over the next year  and will include such refinements as a special ring for calls from special  friends whose numbers have been programmed into the device.  </P> <P> In New Jersey, where the system is available, initial response was "three times  what we expected," said New Jersey Bell spokesman James W. Carrigan.  </P> <P> Washington ranks only eighth among major metropolitan areas and 47th overall in  unlisted numbers, but its 26.2% -- very close to C&amp;P Telephone Co.  estimates -- is enough to suggest a healthy market for Caller ID.  </P> <P> Telephone surprises, unpleasant or otherwise, then would diminish. Life would  proceed more quietly in self-sufficient cocoons of automatic telephone  monitoring, videocassette recorders and shopping by cable, letting  introspection continue without further interruption.  </P></p>

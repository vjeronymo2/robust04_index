			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Boots 15% ahead as chemist shop sales advance A STRONG performance from Boots' chemist shops and a return to profits from Halfords, its chain selling car accessories and bicycles, helped the retail and pharmaceutical company increase pre-tax profits by 15.6 per cent to Pounds 187.8m in the first half of its financial year. However, a fall into losses by the do-it-yourself joint venture and disappointment that a patent extension on one drug would not be possible contributed to a 10p drop in the share price to 487p. Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, said in the current economic climate the results were 'very good'. Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said although consumer confidence was still low, 'it would require a very bad Christmas overall for Boots to have a bad Christmas'. Group sales rose 7.9 per cent to Pounds 1.85bn in the six months to end September, and trading profit was 6.6 per cent higher at Pounds 198.2m. There was a fall in interest payable from Pounds 23.5m to Pounds 10.4m, of which Pounds 8.8m was due to the conversion of bonds into shares. Earnings per share rose 11.5 per cent to 12.6p and the interim dividend is up 7 per cent to 4.6p. The Boots the Chemist chain increased trading profits by 20.8 per cent to Pounds 117.4m, in spite of a Pounds 5.6m charge resulting from an inquiry by the National Health Service into discounts. This represents half the expected charge for the full year. Sir James said the chain's sales of fine fragrances were not being affected by discounting by rival retailers. Among its other retail chains, Halfords made a profit of Pounds 1.2m, against a loss of Pounds 6.2m, while Boots Optician profits rose from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 2.8m and Childrens World losses fell from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.6m. AG Stanley DIY business suffered a fall in profits from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 1m while Boots' share of the Do-It-All joint venture loss was Pounds 4.9m compared with a profit of Pounds 4.2m. Losses from Sephora, the French perfume business, increased from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.2m. The pharmaceutical division's profits fell from Pounds 67.2m to Pounds 64.8m as an extra Pounds 8m was spent on marketing Manoplax, a new drug for congestive heart failure. This was launched in the UK in September and Sir James hopes for US approval by next March. Profits from the property division fell from Pounds 30.8m to Pounds 30.2m, including profits on property sales of Pounds 2.8m, up from Pounds 2.3m. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets: Markets like M&amp;G's 36% rise - At a glance A 36 per cent increase in the final dividend meant that the results of fund management group M&amp;G were well received by the markets this week. The group has benefited from the strength of world stock markets and from a revival in its own relative investment performance, since sterling left the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday. M&amp;G follows a value approach to stock-picking which does badly in recessions. However, the company's consistency is reflected, not only in the performance of its unit trusts, but in its dividend paying record; the payout has increased eightfold since 1984.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 21 Mar (TANJUG) -- A meeting was held in  Pale today between Dr. Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska  republic [RS], and Stanislav Galic, commander of the  Sarajevo-Romanija corps of the RS army, on the one hand, and  Dutch General van Baal, UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] chief of  staff for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the other. The aim of  the meeting was to clarify the latest controversy surrounding  UNPROFOR accusations that a small amount of Serb heavy weapons  was found inside the 20-km exclusion zone around Sarajevo in the  locality of Cekrcici, north of Sarajevo and in the vicinity of  Visoko.    "Today we came to the conclusion that we had used different  maps to identify the central point inside the Sarajevo exclusion  zone. This led to misunderstanding between UNPROFOR and the Serb  side," General van Baal said after the talks. He went on to add  that an agreement was reached today to "start work on defining  the positions tomorrow," in order to identify the central point  in the controversial zone. Meanwhile Karadzic will talk by  phone with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's envoy. We  were in complete agreement regarding the situation in connection  with the weapons inside and outside this zone and I think that  today we achieved great success in the resolution of this  problem, General van Baal said, expressing his gratitude to the  Serb side and President Karadzic himself for their extremely  good cooperation and understanding.    Sarajevo-Romanija Corps Commander Major General Stanislav  Galic said the meeting today was very successful. He stated  that the misunderstanding arose due to different interpretations  about where the center of Sarajevo is. "These misunderstandings  have now been resolved, which is yet another illustration of the  effective cooperation between UNPROFOR and the civilian and  military authorities of the Srpska republic," General Galic said.    UNPROFOR and Srpska republic representatives also met today  at the Bratstvo-Jedinstvo bridge which is to be reopened to  traffic on 23 March. UNPROFOR representatives for the Sarajevo  sector and the Serb authorities in Sarajevo have agreed on  details and technical particulars regarding the flow of traffic  across this very sensitive location. UNPROFOR has been carrying  out intensive preparatory work, the necessary marking and the  protection of the bridge, and it is indicative that on the Serb  side of the bridge, Russian UN troops were replaced by French  UNPROFOR soldiers this morning.</p>

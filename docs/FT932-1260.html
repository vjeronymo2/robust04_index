			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lucas issues release in move to avoid criticism - 'Price sensitive' information available for all LUCAS INDUSTRIES, the engineering group, will issue a three page press release this afternoon summarising information which will be given to 26 stockbroking analysts who are visiting one of the company's factories today. By doing so Lucas hopes to avoid any suggestion that it is favouring analysts with price sensitive information not available to all shareholders. The move follows last month's Stock Exchange censure of London International Group, the photo-processing and toiletries company. LIG rang 13 analysts and four large shareholders advising them to cut profit forecasts, and the share price fell sharply. Since then the question of how companies should communicate with shareholders has been hotly debated. The Stock Exchange feels unable to issue any guidelines until the Criminal Justice Bill, which contains new insider trading rules, is enacted. Mr Bernard Carey, director of corporate communications at Lucas, said that the company and its advisers had decided 'what we will be saying tomorrow may be considered to be price sensitive'. He said analysts present would also be told that Lucas would not answer questions on certain issues. Lucas said the press release would contain 'all material provided and discussed' and would be issued 'to ensure that all requirements are met in line with the London Stock Exchange directives'. Mr Carey said that any points raised by analysts which elicited answers considered to be price sensitive would be covered in a release tomorrow. However, the move may have backfired as analysts who heard about the planned press release jumped to the conclusion that Lucas would be announcing bad news, possibly that it would not be able to maintain the dividend. Last week Lucas hosted a dinner at the Paris air show attended by some analysts who reported that they had received a bleak view of current trading conditions, causing share price weakness. Lucas issued the text of the speech made at the dinner the following day. One analyst who attended the dinner said yesterday, 'I got lots more out of the meeting than from the synopsis given to the Stock Exchange. You need to be there to get the tone.' Lucas wrote to newspapers yesterday alerting them to the forthcoming press release, which will be published at 3pm, at about the time the analysts at the plant in Gloucestershire will be free to make phone calls back to their offices. Mr Carey said it had been the group's normal practice to alert newspapers' stock market reporters of analysts visits, and today's press release 'was planned weeks ago'.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Two guilty of Hani murder MR Clive Derby-Lewis, a prominent right-wing politician, and Mr Janus Walus, a Polish immigrant, were yesterday convicted of murdering Chris Hani, the prominent South African black leader. Mr Justice CF 'Frikkie' Eloff found Mr Derby-Lewis's wife Gaye not guilty on all counts. The three were charged with murdering Mr Hani, conspiring to murder him and eight others, and illegal possession of a firearm. The eight included Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, Mr Joe Slovo, chairman of the South African Communist party, Judge Richard Goldstone, who heads an investigation into political violence, Mr Ken Owen, editor of the Sunday Times, and Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister. A large crowd gathered outside the court dancing, waving placards and chanting the controversial slogan 'Kill the Boer, Kill the farmer'. The death of Mr Hani - found by an opinion poll earlier this year to be the most popular South African after Mr Mandela - brought the country to a virtual standstill for 10 days as politicians and police struggled to control the anger of his supporters.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REGULATIONS SOUR SWEET SMELL OF FRESH BREAD  </P> <P> Baker Frank Fornaca Jr. is one of many people who think of the aroma of baking  bread as one of life's simple pleasures. But, when government air-quality  control officials in December branded the smell a pollutant, Fornaca knew that  tough times were ahead for the baking industry.  </P> <P> Indeed, pending regulations would force Fornaca and other bakers to retrofit  their ovens so as to curb baking emissions. That's a costly requirement for all  bakers, but especially for smaller independent operations, said Fornaca, vice  president and general manager of Fornaca Family Bakery -- San Diego county's  largest independent, family-owned and operated bakery.  </P> <P> "Our retrofitting costs could be as much as $2 million," said Fornaca, citing  another reason why being an independent baker is not easy these days.  </P> <P> The emission-control ruling is just one of many problems confronting the  independent baker. Others include the high cost of equipment, fierce  competition, consolidation and a younger generation's aversion to long baker's  hours, problems that have led to a steady shrinking of the independent bakers'  ranks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Number Fell  </P> <P> From 1935 to 1980, for example, the number of independent U. S. bakers  plummeted from 10,000 to 1,000, industry officials say. Now only about 600  remain.  </P> <P> But, at a time when bread baking doesn't appear to be a good way to make dough,  the Fornaca Family Bakery is thriving.  </P> <P> Established in 1912 by Italian immigrant Mario Fornaca, the bakery is now under  the reign of a third generation of Fornacas. Still based at the National City  bakery where Mario, Frank Jr.'s grandfather, delivered bread by horse and  buggy, Fornaca now has about 100 distributors that take its products to  customers as far north as Santa Barbara and east to El Centro.  </P> <P> The bakery has endured a shortage of workers during World War II, as well as  during the Depression, and adapted to a changing environment to preserve a  family business. Instead of competing head-to-head with plentiful and powerful  white-bread bakers, such as Wonder Bread, Fornaca succeeded by carving a niche  in a crowded marketplace. It won loyal customers by baking specialty and  mixed-grain breads.  </P> <P> "We've been successful because we haven't tried to force-feed white bread,"  Fornaca said.  </P> <P> But not all bakers recognized the changing marketplace, industry experts say.  Nor were they willing to experiment with new products.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people who do it (bake white bread) and they're all  competing for a fairly fixed market," said Bill Lockhart, a spokesman for the  American Institute of Baking. The Manhattan, Kan.-based organization runs  seminars about industry issues, operates a baking school, conducts nutrition  research and inspects bakeries.  </P> <P> The combination of rising equipment and ingredient costs plus thin profit  margins has persuaded many independent bakers to sell their businesses.  </P> <P> "To compete against Wonder Bread, you've got to buy the speedier, more rapid  baking equipment," said Robert Pyle, president of the Independent Bakers Assn.,  a national trade association based in Washington. "Such production lines are  very expensive, which means you have to put money back in to the bakery. Not  everyone is willing to do that.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Baking Is Hard Work  </P> <P> But, more often than not, economic factors aren't the principal ones behind the  death of a family bakery.  </P> <P> "Baking bread is hard work," Pyle said. "The younger generation doesn't want to  get up at 3 a.m. to run the bakery. They would rather be at the beach."  </P> <P> But the Fornacas say they were destined to bake bread and are striving to  maintain a family tradition. In fact, Fornaca has rejected several suitors who  have offered to buy the bakery.  </P> <P> "We're good at what we do," Fornaca said. "Besides, this is all we know how to  do."  </P> <P> Mario Fornaca immigrated to Los Angeles from Italy via Ellis Island in 1907.  After learning the baker's trade, he moved to San Diego to start his own shop  five years later. Mario turned over the company to his two sons, Frank and  Felice, in 1952. Back then, the bakery had 25 employees and turned out about  540 loaves each day.  </P> <P> Today, the family bakery has 235 workers and bakes about 100,000 loaves daily,  including such well known brands as Bohemian Hearth, Holsum Grain, Deli Breads  and others.  </P> <P> The Fornaca bakery produces more than 1 million pounds of bread each week.  Fornaca revenues are expected to reach $30 million in 1989, a 10% increase from  last year.  </P> <P> Although the Fornaca Bakery has undergone impressive growth in the past, new  obstacles such as oven-emission controls, threaten its success.  </P> <P> On Sept. 20, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District in San Francisco is  expected to pass a regulation that will require bakeries that produce more than  100,000 pounds of bread daily to install "after-burners" in existing ovens to  reduce the ethanol emitted into the air. The regulation will also require new  ovens to be equipped with such devices.  </P> <P> "Ethanol (a baking by-product) is a volatile organic compound that is a  precursor to the formation of ozone," a pollutant that the local air quality  boards are charged with lowering, said Lucia Libretti, a spokeswoman for the  San Francisco region's air-pollution-control district.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Targeting Bakeries  </P> <P> The Bay Area is the first, and so far, only district in the nation targeting  bakeries in efforts to lower pollution. But the baking industry is watching  events there closely because it fears that other districts will follow suit.  </P> <P> Indeed, the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District and the South Coast  Air Quality Management District -- which oversees Los Angeles, Orange,  Riverside and San Bernardino counties -- have listed the installation of  oven-emission controls as objectives in their pollution control plans.  </P> <P> But Fornaca maintains that the amount of ethanol put out by bakers is so small  that it seems almost ridiculous to go after it.  </P> <P> "Installing after-burners on any new ovens that we construct is one thing, but  asking us to go back and retrofit all the old ones is asking a little too  much," Fornaca said. According to air quality officials, it would cost $400,000  to install after-burners in existing ovens. Building new ovens equipped with  such controls would cost $800,000.  </P> <P> Another problem concerns bakers' delivery trucks. The Los Angeles City Council  is considering a law restricting delivery trucks on freeways during rush hours  to reduce congestion. The South Coast Air Quality Management District is  considering a similar curb on a regional basis in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Such restrictions could disrupt and complicate delivery of baked goods to  customers, Fornaca said. Nevertheless, he is confident the family bakery will  find ways to overcome these problems. After running a successful business for  77 years, Fornaca has reason to be optimistic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Rocket Science  </P> <P> "We're not talking about rocket science here," Fornaca said. "Bread baking is a  basic business. As long as we do the basics right, provide a good product and  good service, we're going to do all right."  </P> <P> At first, the Fornaca bakery only produced French and Italian breads. But, when  Mario Fornaca's two sons inherited the business in the 1950s, they diversified  the product line. They introduced Hillbilly bread, a light wheat bread  considered unique at a time when grocers' shelves were stocked almost  completely with white bread. The introduction of other brands followed,  including Bohemian Hearth, Holsum Grain, Deli Breads, Italiano and Poulsbo,  which is a bread made from sunflower seeds.  </P> <P> Although the bakery does most of its business with major restaurants and  supermarkets, Fornaca also owns seven thrift stores (small bakery shops). Five  of the outlets are in San Diego County, one in El Centro and the other in  Riverside County. The Fornaca bakery also sells to chains such as Price Club  and supplies Camp Pendleton.  </P></p>

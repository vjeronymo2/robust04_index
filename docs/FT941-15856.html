			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Liability 'hampers' coal sell-off Prospective purchasers of coal mines are warning the government that privatisation of the industry is being severely hampered by requirements that the new owners of mines must take on historic liabilities for subsidence. The liabilities could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds. In 1992-93 alone British Coal paid Pounds 46m for subsidence damage. Potential purchasers say that past liabilities may outweigh the likely business benefits of mining coal in some of the five areas for sale if the requirements remain intact. The liabilities issue is adding to the problems of a difficult privatisation, with large companies such as Hanson and RTZ showing scant interest, and smaller companies that are considering bids warning that there are limits to what they can offer for a business with an uncertain future. Potential buyers are pushing for a redrafting of the coal industry bill which spells out that the new owners will assume liabilities irrespective of when the damage was caused. The bill is likely to be given a second reading within the next month and possibly early next week in readiness for royal assent in July. Prospective purchasers argue that the liabilities should be taken on by the Coal Authority which will be established to license pits and supervise the industry. The coal industry bill introduces the concept of an area of responsibility through which the 'responsible' party will be either the holder of the licence to mine if it occurs in his or her area of responsibility or, in all other cases, the Coal Authority. Prospective buyers are concerned about the definition of the word 'area'. The liability also extends to water pollution which can become problematic after a mine is closed. Similar rules apply, although they appear to be less clear-cut than those applying to subsidence. The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that requiring coal operators to assume responsibility for all subsidence liabilities would simplify the process for people claiming for damages against subsidence. Although the Labour party may baulk at taking up a cause aimed at easing the privatisation the government will come under pressure from its backbenchers to re-assess its stance.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Valid Range Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The valid range limits in both the Simple and Complex Models  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify the range for each fuel parameter outside of which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> models cannot be used for the evaluation of emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performances. These limits ensure that the models will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for extremely high or low fuel parameter values which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compromise the validity of the models. Thus the valid range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits were instituted as a means toward maintaining the accuracy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the compliance calculations, and thus the integrity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency made every attempt to make the valid range limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as wide as possible to provide flexibility to refiners while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintaining a focus on the need for accurate performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates. This was especially true for the conventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline valid range limits, as EPA wanted to avoid, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent possible, establishing provisions which would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refiners to reformulate their conventional fuels. To provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional flexibility, the Agency also allowed the extension of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specified valid range for the Complex Model for conventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline when a refiner's individual 1990 baseline fuel exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the valid range in one or more fuel parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since publication of the final rule, the Agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that the flexibility provided to refiners in the valid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range limits requires some revision and clarification to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary and costly refinery modifications which have no long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term environmental benefit. The changes to the regulations can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be separated into two categories: changes to the specified valid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range limits, and clarification of the provision for extending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the valid range for individual refiner baseline fuels. Both of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these topics will be described in detail below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Revised Valid Range Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The valid range limits for the Simple and Complex Models  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were based on two different sets of data and were developed using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different assumptions. The Simple Model valid range limits were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined following the regulatory negotiations held in 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complex Model valid range limits were based upon an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination of the sufficiency of data in the Complex Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> database and the accuracy of extrapolations (See the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact Analysis for the final rule, Section IV.D). Because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid range limits for the Simple and Complex Models were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established independently and through different processes, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid range limits for the two models were different from one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another. Since promulgation of the final rule, the Agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> learned that the specified valid ranges may force refiners to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make refinery modifications to comply with the regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are unwarranted under the Simple Model, and unnecessary under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Model. Thus EPA is revising the valid range limits for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygen content, RVP, aromatics content, and benzene content for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Simple Model, and oxygen content for the Complex Model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Change to High End of Oxygen Valid Range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The high end of the valid range limit for oxygen in both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Simple and Complex Models was based on the maximum amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygen that an oxygenated fuel was expected to lawfully contain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of all the oxygenates that will likely be used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline program, ethanol has the highest oxygen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content at 0.35 grams of oxygen per gram of ethanol. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used this value as a benchmark in determining the high end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid range for oxygen, assuming a 10 volume percent ethanol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blend. However, since promulgation of the final rule, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has learned that density variations in gasoline blendstocks may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in wide variations in the oxygen content of an oxygenated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel on a weight percent basis despite the fact that the volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent remains fixed. For instance, blending 10 volume percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethanol into a higher density gasoline could produce a blend with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an oxygen content as low as 3.4 weight percent, while blending 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume percent ethanol into a lower density gasoline could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce a blend with an oxygen content as high as 4.0 weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the largest excise tax exemption available to refiners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the use of ethanol in gasoline blends is for oxygenated fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contain 10 volume percent, many ethanol blends will contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 volume percent ethanol. Thus it is essential that the high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the valid range for both the Simple and Complex Models be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised to 4.0 weight percent. This change will allow fuels which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are already being produced to be evaluated with the Simple and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complex Models. The change will also guarantee that no fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygenated with ethanol will be excluded from the reformulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline program due to an oxygen content that is outside the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of the model, as long as it complies with the volume limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable in a waiver issued under section 211(f) of the Clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air Act. Since fuels with oxygen contents of 4.0 weight percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are already being produced, the change will have no additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on vehicle driveability. Also, since the models continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be accurate between 3.5 and 4.0 weight percent, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards are not being changed, this change to the high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the valid range for oxygen content will have no adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The source said that 47 Thai timber merchants have  concessions in Burma but the Rangoon government decided last  December to end them in a bid to save natural resources.    The Thais have been hauling logs out but some fallen logs  remain in the concession areas and it may not be possible to  remove them by the deadline.    The source added that Thai timber concession holders have  submitted their proposals to remove the fallen logs, but the  Burmese government is still considering them.    Some Thai timber merchants have also submitted proposals to  take on Burmese partners in setting up sawmills and furniture  factories in Burma.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry source said that Burma's State  Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), in consultation with  several ministries, has outlined the following policies on the  timber trade:    -- The government will extend timber trading until March for  the fallen 4,777 logs as an exception in the Maw area within the  Northeastern military command;    -- The Forestry Ministry will exclusively carry out timber  trade. The Forestry Department will report transactions to the  government for which the forestry ministry will draw up a yearly  reverse sales plan, decreasing sales by 50 percent, 25 percent  and 10 percent respectively;    -- The Forestry Ministry will also oversee all timber  production within Burma, shutting out local and foreign private  enterprises;    -- Internal timber trading and will be done on tender basis  [sentence as published];    -- Cooperatives and private enterprises will not be allowed  to export timber but will be allowed to process and export wood  products;    -- People holding stakes in joint ventures will also be able  to buy timber under a tender system based on current prices  abroad;    -- The military will not be allowed to deal in timber  trading;    -- Cooperatives and private enterprises will be encouraged  to  produce processed wood for export.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Chretien says No to helicopter order MR Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister-elect, yesterday reaffirmed his intention to cancel a CDollars 5.8bn (Pounds 2.9bn) order for 50 European-built helicopters shortly after his Liberal party takes office towards the end of next week. The Liberals won 178 out of 295 seats in last Monday's general election. Cancellation of the helicopter order was among the Liberals' most frequently repeated campaign promises. The European consortium, led by the UK's Westland Group and Agusta of Italy, together with its main Canadian partner, Paramax of Montreal, had hoped to make a last-ditch appeal to Mr Chretien to include the helicopter order in a wide-ranging defence policy review. Speaking at a press conference in Ottawa, Mr Chretien said he would discuss implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with President Bill Clinton in Seattle on November 19. Although the Liberals plan to seek a a renegotiation of both the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement and Nafta, which includes Mexico, Mr Chretien hinted that the new government would avoid any precipitate action. He noted that under the 1989 deal, the US must negotiate a subsidies and anti-dumping code within seven years. 'This is a treaty with the US and they have to proceed with it,' he said. Business leaders believe the new cabinet will be more sympathetic to business than the interventionist Trudeau administration, the last Liberal government. 'Times have changed immensely,' said Mr Tim Reid, Canadian Chamber of Commerce president. 'I think the Liberals have learned something from being in opposition for nine years.' At least two economic ministries are expected to be filled by veteran MPs with backgrounds in commerce and industry. Mr Paul Martin, who ran one of Canada's biggest shipping lines before entering politics, is a leading contender for the finance or industry portfolio. Mr Roy MacLaren, who is expected to become either trade or industry minister, is a shareholder in a Toronto publishing business.</p>

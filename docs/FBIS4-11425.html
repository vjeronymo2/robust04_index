			<p>BFN     [Text] Alfredo Jordan Morales, minister of agriculture and  a Politburo member, has said in Bayamo that Basic Cooperative  Production Unit [UBPC] workers are capable of developing many  more initiatives to solve problems. Jordan, who participated in  the initial phase of the Miscellaneous Crops National Council  held in Granma, pointed out that the UBPCs have to be helped and  supported; in this connection, he stressed the importance of  housing construction. Jordan announced that the agriculture  sector built 7,000 materials-efficient homes in 1993, and 1,400  in the first quarter of 1994. Granma Province is the leader in  this effort.    Jordan pointed out the need to turn performances in  miscellaneous crops production around, nationwide, by using good  seeds, preparing the soil properly, planting on schedule, and  weeding consistently.</p>

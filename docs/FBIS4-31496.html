			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovene President Milan Kucan by Gian Luigi </F> Paracchini in Ljubljana; date not given]    [Text] Ljubljana -- "Relations between Slovenia and Italy?  I hope that both sides' politics will not spoil the friendship,  exhibited at the cycling Tour of Italy, between the two peoples.  We are waiting to understand the Italian Government's real  thinking; Slovenia's positions and behavior will depend solely  on this. President Milan Kucan of the Slovene Republic is  cautious but chilly.    [Paracchini] President Kucan, from your tone one would say  that relations with Italy have considerably worsened. Can you  explain this to us?    [Kucan] I am thinking of Italy's understanding and  friendship  during our march toward independence, and in particular during  the war against Yugoslavia. Understanding and friendship which  were particularly significant in Friuli Region.    [Paracchini] And what has changed nowadays?    [Kucan] I am concerned at certain declarations which, even  if  made on a personal basis, are far from that climate of  cooperation. But apart from the concerns, there are worrying  facts.    [Paracchini] For example?    [Kucan] I am thinking of the East-West meeting in Warsaw  where Slovenia was not accepted as a full member, precisely at  Italy's insistence. And I am thinking of the Paris summit where  again our country was not mentioned among those with a future  European potential. And who insisted that this be so. Italy  yet again.    [Paracchini] If Italy officially asked you to review the  Osimo Treaty, what would you reply? Would Slovenia concede  anything?    [Kucan] The Osimo Treaty settles a whole series of  questions,  and as long as the treaty is valid we ought to stick to it. We  are fully entitled to benefit from it as we are Yugoslavia's  legal successors. Osimo did not solve the problems in an ideal  fashion, but if something has to be changed, we need first of  all to find common bases. And these changes need to safeguard  our mutual interests in a just fashion.    [Paracchini] And borders?    [Kucan] Borders should not be a problem in Europe. Rather  than change them we should eliminate them from our consciousness.</p>

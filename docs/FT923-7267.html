			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Business Law: Financing techniques to counter depressed property market The announcement last month of an imaginative capital-raising exercise, involving the issue of Pounds 100m zero coupon bonds backed by an agreement to sell part of the issuer's property portfolio to institutional investors, heralded new financing techniques which counter the problems posed by the bear market in property. The new techniques can be used by companies which are not, in the traditional sense of the word 'property' companies, such as retailers, manufacturers and distribution companies, all of which often have substantial property assets. Companies in this category historically looked to the banking sector to provide finance on either a secured or on an unsecured ring-fenced basis. In view of the UK banking sector reducing its exposure to the property market, such conventional financing techniques are no longer readily available. To the extent that this type of financing is on offer it has become much more expensive and therefore less attractive. The new financing techniques provide a useful and competitive alternative. The Pounds 100m zero coupon bond issue is a good example of the innovative and creative financing techniques which can be used to tap the capital markets to absorb property risk. This risk can be removed from the bond holders in the following way. The property owner  - a company with substantial property assets  - can enter into a put-option with an investing institution, which entitles the property owner to require that institution to buy the property at a fixed rate at a specified date in the future  - five or eight years from the date of the put-option, for example. The duration of the put-option matches the maturity term of the bonds. The price the institution is obliged to pay for the property matches the amount necessary to redeem the bonds. The bonds are secured on the put-option rather than on the properties. The institution has therefore absorbed the property risk while the bondholder's risk becomes a credit risk on the institution  - which would typically have an AA or AAA credit rating. Institutional investors would be paid a commission fee to underwrite the value of the portfolio of properties. There are a number of advantages to this type of financing. The property owner raises a sum of 60 to 70 per cent of the property's value at an attractive rate of interest while retaining total ownership of the properties, and any increase in value passes only to the company. Management and letting control, together with the ability to dispose of the property at any time, are also retained by the company, provided cash collateral equal to the put-option price of the property can be provided. If cash collateral equal to the put-option price of the property is provided at any time prior to the bonds' redemption date, the put-options would fall away. From the viewpoint of the institutions, underwriting property values is attractive business  - being at a discount of 30 to 40 per cent of the property's current value. The institutions also have the expertise to assess the property risk and can retain monitoring powers and control to ensure that the value of the properties is preserved. While the capital value of the properties is one element of the property risk, the other element is the rental income stream, where the risk is a function of the credit rating of the tenants. A zero coupon bond is not dependent on the rental income stream and this element of risk is sidestepped. Where a coupon is payable, this would be serviced from rental income and it is therefore important in this context. Credit enhancement would almost certainly be required by way of a rental guarantor with an appropriate credit rating. The rental guarantor would absorb the credit risk of the underlying rental stream and the bondholders would ultimately look to the rental guarantor. The financing structure described above concerns the situation where the property owner wants to retain the property assets. If a company wants to dispose of the whole, or a significant part of its interest in a property, an attractive commercial alternative is the factoring of the rental income stream. This simply involves calculating the net present value of the total rental income stream from a property  - typically this will be equal to a yield of 50 to 80 basis points above the appropriate gilt rate. Continental investors have shown interest in paying a premium for appropriate rental streams because they fit in well with the provisions of annuities. As the buyer is taking a straight credit risk on the tenant's covenant, the latter's credit rating is fundamental. Rental stream factoring can be used where a new lease is being created incorporating guaranteed minimum periodic increases in the rent, for example, on a new development. By adjusting the rental stream level and profile, this structure can be tailored relatively easily to meet the requirements of the company and investor. The final technique to be considered is that involving the separation of the right to receive rental income from the property and the right to share in its capital growth. This technique can be used where a company wants to retain at least half of its interest in the property. The structure can best be illustrated in the context of a sale and leaseback transaction. The property owner occupies the property but wants to realise a substantial part of its interests in that property. The owner sells the property to a company incorporated solely for the acquisition of the property and, once acquired, the latter would lease the property back to the company. The lease would have guaranteed minimum periodic rent increases. This part of the financing technique is identical to the factoring arrangement already described and the same considerations apply in structural rental levels, the size of rental increases and the rental profile to meet the investors' and company's needs. The specially created company would raise the finance to buy the property by issuing two classes of bearer instruments. One would entitle the holder to participate in the rental income and the overall value of this class would equal the net present value of the rental stream. As the investors are taking a credit risk on the tenant, credit enhancement by means of a rental guarantor may be appropriate. The other class of bearer instrument would entitle the holder to participate in the value of the property after the lease has expired  - the reversionary interest in the property. As the lease term runs to its maturity the allure of the property class of instrument would gradually increase while the value of the rental income instruments would reduce. The financing techniques outlined illustrate the variety of ways in which a company can raise finance at competitive rates by utilising its property assets. By using the appropriate structure, a company can raise the necessary finance while selling as much or as little of its property interest as it wishes. Using such techniques enables a company to make full use of its property assets. The success of the recent coupon bond issue shows that these types of structured financing deals are welcomed in the capital markets and can provide substantial commercial benefits to property-owning companies.

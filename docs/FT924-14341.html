			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford appoints Jacques Nasser as chairman of European operations FORD, the US car maker, yesterday appointed Mr Jacques Nasser as the next chairman of its loss-making Ford of Europe operations, write Kevin Done in London and Kevin Brown in sydney. Mr Nasser, a 44-year-old Lebanese Australian and presently chief executive of Ford of Australia, is to replace Mr Lindsey Halstead, 62, who is to retire after a 40-year career with Ford. Mr Halstead has been chairman of Ford of Europe since 1989. Mr Nasser becomes chairman-elect of Ford of Europe with immediate effect and will take over from Mr Halstead on January 1. He is to be succeeded in Australia by Mr John Ogden, currently director of car programmes for Ford's North American automotive operations. Mr Nasser faces a formidable challenge to lead the restructuring of Ford of Europe, which suffered record losses last year and which is forecast to make another loss in 1992. Ford, which was narrowly the leader of the west European new car market in 1984, has slipped to fifth place among the big six volume car makers in Europe. Mr Nasser's appointment confirms his reputation as one of the company's rising stars, and he will take over a European organisation, which last year had a workforce of just under 100,000 and produced 1.8m vehicles. He started his career as a financial analyst for Ford in Melbourne in 1968, but has moved rapidly up the international management ladder since beginning a 14-year stint overseas in 1975. He returned to Ford Australia as chief executive in 1989 from Autolatina, Ford's joint venture with Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina, which he helped set up and where he became the first finance director in 1987. Always an outspoken manager, he has taken tough action to prepare Ford Australia for stiffer competition, prompted by a rise in vehicle imports from 30 per cent of the market three years ago to 50 per cent this year.</p>

The figure also represented a 6.08 percent increase compared  with September of this year, the MOEA tallies showed.    From January to October 1993, Taiwan received a total of  US$71.13 billion worth of foreign orders, a growth of 6.25  percent over the same period of 1992.    MOEA attributed the increase in October foreign orders to  increasing foreign demand.    Increased orders were placed for plastic and rubber  products,  textiles, and electronic products, while the precision machinery  industry saw a decline in orders.    In terms of area, orders from Europe increased the most, up  17.35 percent over September 1993 totals.    However, Hong Kong was responsible for the most orders,  registering increases of 21.4 percent and 30.68 percent when  compared with October 1992 and the January-October period of  1992, the statistics showed.</p>

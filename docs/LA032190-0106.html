			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NO YOKE -- SPRING IS HERE;  </P> <P> A LITTLE MADNESS IN THE SPRING IS WHOLESOME EVEN FOR THE KING. -- EMILY  DICKINSON  </P> <P> Or even for a city councilman.  </P> <P> For example, on Tuesday afternoon, the Honorable Earl J. Prescott was on his  hands and knees on his patio deck in Tustin, his face nearly scraping the  concrete.  </P> <P> He was carefully balancing six dozen eggs upright on the broad ends of their  shells. They stood at attention like a marching band.  </P> <P> This is what Prescott likes to do on the first day of spring.  </P> <P> "It's an old Chinese tradition," he said.  </P> <P> Some say it's Japanese. Others say it's Scandinavian. Some say it's doo-doo.  </P> <P> Regardless, believers insist that on the vernal equinox, when the sun is  directly over the Equator, the alignment of Sun and Earth affects gravitation,  allowing eggs to balance more easily.  </P> <P> It also happens to be the official beginning of spring.  </P> <P> It occurred Tuesday at 1:19 p.m. Pacific time, when Prescott was just about  done erecting his eggs. A breeze made the task more difficult and, by 2 p.m.,  had blown them all over, but they stood long enough for Prescott to claim that  he had scientifically proved his point.  </P> <P> He said he first heard about equinox egg balancing on a TV newscast and tried  it successfully during the autumnal equinox, the beginning of fall. And when he  tried at an off-time, during the winter, he failed.  </P> <P> "It's a real phenomenon. It's something you can't do at other times of the  year," he insisted.  </P> <P> Scientists tend to put this "phenomenon" in the category of old wives' tales.  Prescott's wife, however, insists that her husband "has both oars in the  water."  </P> <P> "I challenge anyone to refute this," Prescott said. "I challenge anyone three  months from now to duplicate what I did today."  </P> <P> To duplicate it will require a research grant totaling $13.26, or the cost of  two dozen extra-large white eggs, two dozen extra-large brown eggs and two  dozen jumbo white eggs.  </P> <P> It also will require an impartial observer because there are ways to cheat:  like shaking the egg to break the yoke and concentrate more weight at the  bottom; or cracking the egg slightly at the bottom to flatten it; or sticking  wax to the bottom. Prescott swears he didn't do any of that.  </P> <P> How serious is Prescott, really?  </P> <P> "I intend to make this a family tradition," he said. "It's to celebrate, to  welcome in spring."  </P> <P> To others less occupied with ritual, Tuesday must have seemed more like summer  than spring. Inland temperatures soared -- 88 in Santa Ana, 87 in Anaheim, 85  in El Toro -- falling just short of the 90-degree record two years ago for this  date.  </P> <P> "Hot and muggy," reported Paul Leighton at Caspers Wilderness Park east of San  Juan Capistrano. "It feels like summer." he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / South Africa's bitter foes snatch defeat from the jaws of victory THE battle for political power in the new South Africa yesterday began in earnest. For many frantic hours, the two largest political groups, the mainly white National Party and the mainly black African National Congress (ANC), clashed and retreated, fought and finally abandoned hope of deciding whether South Africa should be governed by majority rule, or by power-sharing. It was a momentous failure of will by those charged with determining the political future of South Africa. Only two months after the stunning referendum victory in which white South Africa finally voted out apartheid, hopes of multi-racial power-sharing were frustrated yet again and violence looked set to intensify. An agreement already reached to establish a multi-racial interim government cannot now be implemented. Multi-party control of the security forces, crucial to contain the violence which has left 11,000 people dead since 1984, cannot be established. Remaining economic sanctions, which would largely have been lifted on installation of an interim government, will remain in place. Normalised relations with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) remain a distant prospect. Popular protest will intensify, under the direction of the ANC which is likely to stage a general strike. South Africa risks a period of even worse political violence. Mr Chris Hani, Communist Party leader, threatened last night that Codesa would 'hear the voice of our mobilised masses.' Angry ANC officials yesterday accused the government of sabotaging democracy, and insulting them to boot. Government negotiators reverted to the Cold War rhetoric of the apartheid past, accusing the ANC of wishing to impose a 'Communist-Marxist' constitution on South Africa. Voices shook with anger, or failed altogether under the strain of days of crisis talks. A furious Mr Joe Slovo, senior leader of the ANC, accused the government of insisting on a minority veto: 'We can only conclude . . . that what they fear, like nothing else, is democracy.' But Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister, called democracy to his defence as well, claiming that the government supports democratic federalism; he damned the ANC for wanting a centralist, unitary and majoritarian state. The fragile trust built over the past four months in the conference rooms of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) - where hundreds of officials spent thousands of hours in the unfamiliar practice of talking to one another - did not survive the day. The 19 parties to the talks, representing liberation leaders, discredited homeland governments, ethnic leaders and the government, acknowledged deadlock. Mr Zach de Beer, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, bemoaned the fact that 'defeat has been snatched from the jaws of victory.' South Africans watching yesterday's slanging match on national television must have found it difficult to understand the root of the dispute. But behind the complex proposals tabled by both sides lay a basic disagreement over how decisions should be taken in the elected body which will eventually write a post-apartheid constitution. The National Party tabled proposal after proposal designed to allow it, in alliance with other ethnic minority parties, to veto decisions of the constitution-making body. This would be achieved either by imposing a requirement that decisions be taken by 75 per cent majority; or a specially elected senate, with disproportionately large representation for regional and minority groups, would veto decisions of the main body. The ANC proposed a two-thirds majority (which it assumes would exclude a National Party veto). It offered to accept a 70 per cent majority (with 75 per cent to approve the bill of rights), but then insisted that a popular referendum be called if that majority could not be achieved. But when the last acrimonious word had been said to the television cameras, the 200-odd delegates filed sombrely into the conference hall to debate again. Delegates agreed that Codesa had reached deadlock, but not disaster. It is not clear whether the constitutional talks at Codesa will continue , or whether the warring factions will observe a temporary or extended truce. But from the two opposing camps - the ANC-led group, which included liberation movements and some homeland governments, as well as the government-led group, which included the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party and other ethnic parties - the message was the same. They have no alternative but to return to Codesa .. whether in a week, a month, or a year. When they do, they will come with eyes open and illusions dashed, and each will know his enemy much more clearly than before. Minds will have been concentrated on the real battle ahead. As one veteran negotiator commented, a propos the talks which brought Namibian independence: 'There are two elements to any successful negotiation: fear and pain.' Early or late, those two forces will propel South Africans back to the negotiating table.</p>

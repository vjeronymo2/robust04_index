			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Study highlights differences in French and UK acquisitions French companies are more strategic in their acquisition of businesses while their UK rivals are more obsessed with detailed numbers, according to a survey published yesterday by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK accountancy firm. More than half of the French companies surveyed considered consolidating their core business as the principal reason for buying others - at the expense of carrying out much financial analysis, the survey showed. Acquirers tend to be haphazard in the way they buy other companies, with time frames and deadlines often imposed by the target business. In one-third of cases, there was no due diligence to assess the companies, and one-third had no direct contact with the target before making an offer. Mr Alec D'Janoeff, chairman of Coopers' French market sector group, said: 'British acquisitions are all very calculated while the French make their decisions on strategic grounds. I believe it reflects a different intellectual approach to doing business. Both have their advantages.' The findings were based on interviews with a representative sample of executives in French and UK companies. These showed that 70 per cent of French companies did not develop a plan to cope with integration until after an acquisition had taken place. In three-quarters of the cases studied, the mergers and acquisitions had been supported by the target's board of directors and was not in any way hostile. Mr D'Janoeff said one of the implications of the study was that UK-based multinationals should be prepared to pay a premium when acquiring French businesses if they wanted to be able to compete against French rivals interested in a target primarily for strategic reasons.</p>

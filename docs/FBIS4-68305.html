			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Valentin Rudenko, </F> Santiago-Moscow, under the rubric: "Russian Arms": "On the Sales  Crossroads: A Chance Has Appeared for the Aircraft Builders in  the Markets of Latin America--But Time Will Tell If They Will Be  Able To Take Advantage of It"]    [Text] Our correspondent has already stated in his  reports from Santiago that the Russian exposition was the  largest and most representative at the FIDAE-94 International  Aerospace Show that occurred at the end of March 1994 in the  Republic of Chile. As for military aviation--the MiG-29, Su-27  and Su-30MK fighter aircraft--there simply weren't any  competitors for them there. Everyone recognized that.    But today, a month after the conclusion of FIDAE-94, we  would like to talk a bit not so much about the triumph of  Russian aviation as much as about the results and the lessons of  the airshows.    Russia had never previously participated in airshows in  Latin  America. And although they say that you can't expect perfection  on the first try, that folk wisdom was not confirmed in this  case. If you assess the results of our participation in FIDAE-94  on the whole then, as Russian Official Delegation Head Air Force  Commander-in-Chief Colonel-General of Aviation Petr Deynekin  noted, this was a real breakthrough in the skies of Latin  America which must provide an impetus to the broad development  of military-technical cooperation not only with Chile but also  with other countries of this region. Previously, as is well  known, we maintained contacts on the military line here only  with Peru, Nicaragua and Cuba.    The majority of FIDAE-94's Russian participants acted under  the aegis of the recently formed "Rosvooruzheniye" [Russian  Arms] State Company. But there were also those firms that  independently displayed their products and latest technologies.  Among them was Moscow Aviation Production Association (MAPO).    Two years ago, this association obtained the right to  independently, naturally under state monitoring, conduct  negotiations and sign contracts on the subject of deliveries on  the world market of one of the world's best light frontal  aviation fighter aircraft--the MiG-29.    As at previous airshows, the MAPO delegation consisted of  not  only association specialists but also representatives of MiG  ANPK [Aircraft Scientific Production Combine] imeni A.I.  Mikoyan, and also of the primary enterprises-subcontractors,  suppliers of radar gunsights, avionics, onboard weapons, and  other systems. According to "Vympel" GosMKB [State  Machinebuilding Design Bureau] Chief Designer Gennadiy  Sokolovskiy, Ryazan Instrument Plant Head Designer Yuriy  Zelenyuk, the heads of other firms, and MAPO partners, this is a  very proper approach. When there are developers, manufacturers  and component suppliers on one team, then you can conduct  substantive negotiations not only on the delivery of the fighter  aircraft themselves but also on their possible modernization,  providing maintenance, supplying spare parts, and other issues  already during the course of the airshow.    The Chilean airshow, although the largest in Latin America,  still is regional in nature in contrast to Le Bourget or  Farnborough. The displays consist of, first and foremost, what  can actually be sold in the countries of this region. It's  possible that some people will not agree with me, but we also  underestimated this factor. For example, many experts think that  the simultaneous participation of the MiG-29, Su-27 and Su-30MK  in this airshow was hardly advisable.    Yes, our fighter aircraft were a sensation in the Chilean  skies. Yes, their journalists christened FIDAE-94 a "show of  stars". But we did not fly 17,000 kilometers to conduct aerial  performances, but to offer our combat aircraft for sale. For  those people who know very well the aircraft market situation,  the financial capabilities of the Latin American countries, and  the specific features of their military doctrine, it was already  clear in Moscow that it is practically impossible to sell MiG's  or Su's here. Therefore, we needed to determine which of the  aircraft had a greater chance to penetrate the Latin American  market and to assign a priority to it.    First of all, this would substantially reduce our  expenditures for participation at the exhibition and, second, it  would permit us to concentrate the attention of potential buyers  on one object of sale.    For many foreign experts, the models of weapons and  technologies displayed by Russia at FIDAE-94 became a real  revelation. They did not find out about them from the  advertising brochures or catalogs that were disseminated on the  eve of the exhibition, but at the airshow.    Advertising costs money. And quite a bit of money. But we  need to resort to these expenditures if we seriously intend to  present ourselves on the international market. Moscow Aviation  Production Association has learned this truth well. A small MAPO  delegation, which settled all of the organizational issues,  visited Chile several months prior to the airshow and met with  the leadership of the ministry of defense, the Chilean Air  Force, FIDAE, and conducted a series of press conferences. As a  result, more than a dozen articles, which discussed the  enterprise and MiG-29 fighter aircraft, were published in the  local press already prior to the airshow's opening.    It would be unjust to not say kind words here directed at  "Menkh" Publishing Group and specifically its Moscow Bureau,  which assumed responsibility for the information support mission  for the airshow's Russian participants. We received xerox copies  of the most interesting articles from the central and Moscow  newspapers on a daily basis. A series of articles on our weapons  that were displayed at this exhibition were published on the  pages of the magazines published by "Menkh".    Arms sales are a delicate matter with a mass of nuances,  including in a political context. Even if there is a marvelous  aircraft or helicopter, that still does not mean that they will  mandatorily manage to sell it. Although the arms business is  considered to be one of the most ancient businesses, we still  have not properly mastered it.    And yet, do we have a chance to conquer the Latin American  aircraft markets? Or were the hundreds of thousands of dollars  spent by Russia for participation in FIDAE-94 cast to the wind?    At the present time, there are 123 combat aircraft in the  Chilean Air Force inventory. These are primarily F-5, A-36,  A-37, FGA-71 Hunter, and Mirage-50 fighter and fighter-bomber  aircraft. Approximately half of them were accepted into the  inventory in 1967 and 1975-76 and the remainder in 1982. Today,  the question is being urgently raised on the replacement of  obsolete aircraft with more modern aircraft. A special program  has been developed on this score.    The Chilean Government intends to purchase approximately  18-20 "second hand" aircraft to replace the old Hunter fighter  aircraft. The Republic of South Africa, Israel, England, France  and Belgium are competing for this contract. Unfortunately,  Russia is not on this list. However, a majority of experts admit  that our fighter aircraft made a very favorable impression on  the Latin Americans.    According to the statement of FIDAE President General Estey,  who completed a more than one hour flight in a MiG-29 with  Mikoyan Chief Pilot Roman Taskayev, this "aircraft permitted him  to do things which he had never previously experienced". Chilean  Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Vega, who flew with Sukhoy  Test Pilot Igor Votintsev in a Su-30MK fighter-interceptor, also  provided a flattering assessment. But, despite such favorable  comments, our chances to win the already existing order are not  great.    At the same time, we should not forget that in the future  the  Chileans plan to replace a second squadron of Pantera (former  Mirage) combat aircraft. And here Russian fighter aircraft can  already pose serious competition to the Swedish Gripen aircraft  that are competing for that order.    "If preference is given to our fighter, we are prepared to  equip the MiG-29's accepted into the West with navigation  equipment so that expenditures for the replacement of the ground  system are minimal, and to ensure in the entire range of  aircraft operation guaranteed maintenance, at the level of world  standards, and the supply of spare parts," said MAPO General  Director Vladimir Kuzmin.    During the course of the airshow, the Moscow Aviation  Production Association delegation visited ENAER national  aviation enterprise that is the foundation of Chile's aviation  industry. This enterprise specializes in the production of the  Chilean Air Force fleet and, in the event of the purchase of  Russian fighter aircraft, we could develop a technical center  based upon it for the maintenance of our aircraft which would be  supplied not only to Chile but also to other Latin American  countries. According to the assessment of MAPO Head Engineer  Viktor Puzanov, there are all of the conditions for that here.    As for Western countries' combat aircraft, the reports from  the airshow have already noted that it was very, very modestly  displayed at FIDAE-94, primarily obsolete models of aircraft  that are in the inventories of the Chilean and Peruvian air  forces. For example, the United States in general decided not to  demonstrate its combat aircraft here. Why? There are the most  varied opinions on this score. Some assert that there simply  isn't a need to do that because they already know American  aircraft well here. According to others, this is linked with the  strict position of the U.S. Congress that still maintains Chile  on a "black list" of states to which the export of American  military equipment is prohibited. We also had the opportunity to  hear this version: The absence of American aircraft--this is a  punishment for the Chileans for the invitation of Russian  aircraft to FIDAE-94.    But, be that as it may, one thing is certain: The United  States has had an impact on the world combat aircraft market and  will have a very large impact in the foreseeable future.    But then again, there are no grounds to disparage our  possibilities to conquer aircraft markets. Many experts think  that the Latin American countries would like to do business with  us and not with the Americans. The FIDAE-94 Airshow convincingly  confirmed that. I had an opportunity to see the sparkle in the  eyes of the generals of the air forces of Chile, Venezuela,  Argentina, Brazil and Peru when they shared their impressions  from the flights being conducted by our fighter aircraft.  Without words, it was clear that they liked our aircraft.    Negotiations were being conducted from morning to night in  the chalet of "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, MAPO, and  "Aviaeksport" V/O [Foreign Trade Association]. And although no  serious contracts whatsoever were concluded directly at the  exhibition, it is of course early to make hasty conclusions with  regard to its commercial results. We sowed the seeds which must  mandatorily produce sprouts. And we need to considerately tend  it in order for a harvest to appear. It's possible that this  will take years.    In short, with the conclusion of the exhibition, work on the  promotion of our aircraft in the Latin American market has not  been completed but has just begun. FIDAE-94 provided Russian  aircraft builders a chance and it would be a sin not to take  advantage of it.</p>

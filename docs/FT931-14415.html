			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Eggar in talks on electricity costs MR TIM EGGAR, the energy minister, met industrial leaders yesterday to hear their concerns about rising electricity prices. The meeting followed reports that the government is looking at ways to enable large industrial users of electricity to tap into the power system more cheaply. British Steel, a member of the group, said that nothing had been resolved at the meeting. 'If anything is going we would like a slice of it,' the corporation said. It added that it could not 'emphasise too much that we are paying 30 per cent more for our energy than our non-UK competitors'.</p>

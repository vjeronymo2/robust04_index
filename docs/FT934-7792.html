			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Swiss travel group slides 20% at nine-month stage REISEBUERO Kuoni, the Swiss travel agency group, said net income tumbled 20 per cent in the first nine months of 1993 to SFr35m (Dollars 23.35m), reflecting depressed demand and prices in the travel sector. Sales were off 6 per cent to SFr1.8bn. The group, in which Kaufhof of Germany last year bought a 50.1 per cent stake (with 26.4 per cent of the votes), forecast that net income in the full year would fall 18 per cent to SFr40m. It described this performance as 'satisfactory, given market conditions'. Business was off in all regions, except the UK and Germany. In the UK, the group's biggest market outside Switzerland, sales were flat in Swiss franc terms, at SFr343m, in the first nine months, reflecting near-16 per cent growth in sterling terms. German sales were up 15 per cent to SFr117m. The group, controlled by the Kuoni-Hugentobler foundation, said revenue from tour operating was up 4.5 per cent, while retail business was off 4.3 per cent to SFr400m. Business travel turnover was down 3.1 per cent to SFr155m.</p>

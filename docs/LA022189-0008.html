"The older girls mainly  wanted to know what it was like kissing Michael Douglas" in the movies  "Romancing the Stone" and "Jewel of the Nile," Turner said. "I told them 'he's  not bad.' " Turner, whose mother has been a Girl Scout volunteer since the  1960s, said she grew up with the Girl Scouts. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

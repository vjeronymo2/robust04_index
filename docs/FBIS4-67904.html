			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 2--The Government has decided not  to induct Agni, the indigenously-developed intermediate range  ballistic missile (IRBM), into the armed forces at this stage,  though the missile was successfully test-fired on February 19 as  a technology-demonstrator.    Instead, the Government for the time being, wants efforts  concentrated on refining certain parameters of Agni, it is  learnt.    When the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme was  conceived in 1983 and the decision taken later to have three  test-firings of the missile, it was not decided what to do after  this was achieved. However, the issue was considered in some  detail at the highest political level recently.    India's decision to develop its own IRBM was frowned upon by  the West, especially the United States, because a missile of  Agni's capability can deliver a nuclear payload and leave the  enemy with no response time. However, no foreign power has made  any public pronouncement after India's capability was proved in  the IRBM field last month. Nor did other Governments express  themselves through official or diplomatic channels.    It is to be seen if the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State  for  South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, broaches the subject when she  comes here for discussion this month.    Among the parameters of Agni that the decision-makers want  refined is the guidance system of the missile so as to reduce  the Circular Error Probable (CEP). The effort is to increase the  accuracy of the IRBM.</p>

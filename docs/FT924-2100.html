			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Royal love letters disappoint: Saleroom THERE WAS disappointment for Sotheby's yesterday when the most important group of historical English letters to appear at auction for many years was unsold. The collection of 43 letters had been written by the Earl of Essex to Queen Elizabeth I of England in the 1590s and, in parts, went beyond the conventions of courtly love. Bids of more than Pounds 400,000 were expected but not forthcoming. The letters had been in the hands of the Hulton family for more than 300 years. A letter by Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, about the Spanish Armada, also failed to sell, but a letter by Sir Francis Bacon made Pounds 13,200. Another setback was the failure to dispose of John Osborne's autograph manuscript of Look Back in Anger. Osborne was selling it in the hope of raising Pounds 40,000 for dental work. Among successes were a rare letter by William Blake, which made Pounds 19,800, and a Byron draft of a satire about George IV and his estranged wife, Queen Caroline, which sold for Pounds 14,300. In the trivia, Muhammad Ali's notes for a press conference in 1978, appealing for a rematch with Leon Spinks, were unsold, but one of the last letters written by Ruth Ellis in 1955 before her execution for murder made Pounds 1,100. In the morning Sotheby's sold the Jeffrey Young collection of books and manuscripts for Pounds 411,070. It was more than 13 per cent unsold and included such gems as the dismissive letter Charlotte Bronte, signing herself C. Bell, sent to the publishers Smith, Elder &amp; Co, accompanying her manuscript of Jane Eyre. The manuscript was accepted immediately and the novel published within six weeks. The letter sold for Pounds 66,000.</p>

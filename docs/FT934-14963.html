			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Ex-Timex staff may end dispute FORMER employees of Timex in Dundee will vote today on whether to accept ex gratia payments from the US-based company to end the 10-month dispute that led to the closure of the plant. In spite of the shutdown of its Dundee operations, Timex has continued to face industrial action including a global boycott from the strikers. British Telecommunication's 9,000 telephone operators are to vote on taking industrial action - including a possible strike - in a dispute over allowance payments. The union said BT had proposed the withdrawal of extra payments for duties including night duty, weekend working and bank holidays.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> BONES MAY BE THOSE OF PROSPECTIVE SAINT  </P> <P> Skeletal remains found in Manhattan were believed to be those of a former  Haitian slave under consideration for sainthood, a medical examiner said. The  former slave, Pierre Toussaint, was buried at the cemetery where the bones were  found after his death in 1853 at age 87.  </P> <P> As a preliminary part of the Roman Catholic Church's consideration for  sainthood, his skeletal remains were sought and were scheduled to be moved to  St. Patrick's Cathedral. They eventually would be distributed in Haiti and  prominent churches if the church makes him a saint. Toussaint was born a slave  in Haiti and moved to New York with his owner's family in 1787. After becoming  a hairdresser, he supported his owner's wife and child for 20 years after his  owner died. Officials have said they hope Toussaint could be approved for  sainthood by the time Pope John Paul II visits Haiti in 1992 to celebrate the  500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus.  </P></p>

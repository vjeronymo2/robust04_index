Kim, before departing  for China after a three-day visit to Tokyo, extended the  invitation again to the imperial couple as they bid farewell to  Kim and his wife Son Myong-sun at the Akasaka Palace, said  Kiyoshi Sumiya, the agency's grand master of ceremonies.    Kim told the couple during the 20-minute meeting that he  wishes to invite them to visit South Korea at a proper time.    During an audience at the imperial palace on Thursday, the  president officially invited Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko  to visit South Korea to forge a new future-oriented  relationship. At that time, the emperor replied the Japanese  Government would decide on whether he will go to South Korea.    The visit by Japan's monarch, however, is still a sensitive  issue in South Korea, which was under Japanese colonial rule  from 1910 to 1945.    During his stay in Tokyo, Kim urged Japan to work together  to  solve North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development  program, which has heightened tension on the Korean peninsula,  and stressed the importance of forward-looking bilateral  relations.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / US workers 'must share in decisions' Sustained employee participation in decision-making is a critical factor in increasing economic performance, a panel appointed by the Clinton administration reported yesterday. The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, chaired by former labour secretary John Dunlop, over the past year undertook one of the most comprehensive examinations of US labour-management relations in 60 years. In its 150-page report the Commission found that viable, high-quality employee participation arrangements are rare because the structure of US labour law, which has not changed much since the 1930s, makes managers wary of changing traditional decision-making hierarchies. A survey by the commission shows that 40m to 50m US workers would like to participate in critical decisions on their job but have no opportunity to do so. 'Employee participation has grown and is designed to increase efficiency, performance and quality,' Mr Dunlop said. '(But) the high performance workplace may well be limited in the eyes of employers by our existing statutory arrangements.' The report says only 5 per cent of employee participation programs can be classified as 'high performance' - a full partnership between management and labour resulting in increased productivity - even though one fifth to one third of all employees are involved in such programmes. The Commission has not yet published its recommendations, which could change such fundamental aspects of US law as the National Labour Relations Act passed under the New Deal. The Dunlop Commission's recommendations are due out this autumn. The Commission also found that most sectors of American society support workers' right to unionise and participate in collective bargaining. In practice, it discovered employees cannot always organise and elect representatives in a manner free from coercion and interference, by either management or union officials. The labour secretary, Mr Robert Reich, said yesterday cases of illegal employment practices had increased recently among a small number of US employers. Mr Dunlop also said his panel found that the tremendous increase in rights and protections granted to individual workers in the last 50 years by both state and federal legislatures has led to a flood of litigation that could often interfere with workplace productivity. Mr Reich said that last year 46,000 complaints of alleged labour law violations were brought to the Department of Labour alone. The Dunlop Commission report explains this on US reliance on the civil court system to resolve labour disputes and rights violations, whereas other nations use specialised, tripartite employment courts. At time of decreasing rates of productivity growth and stagnating inflation adjusted wages (wages for males actually fell for the first time in 75 years) the Commission hopes to be able to find common ground between management and labour unions, Mr Dunlop said. Mr Reich also said business and government should be alarmed by Commission findings on the growing income gap in the US, currently the largest of any industrialised nation. Over time, this increasing difference between rich and poor, and educated and uneducated, would lead to a sharp erosion in both productivity and competitiveness, he said.</p>

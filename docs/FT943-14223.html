			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Kitty Little pays FFr75m for L'Amy Kitty Little, the USM-quoted consumer goods manufacturer, is acquiring Groupe L'Amy, France's largest maker and distributor of sunglasses and spectacle frames, for FFr75.2m (Pounds 8.9m). The cash acquisition is funded by a placing of 29.8m new ordinary shares at 30p. The company is also raising Pounds 9.5m through a placing and 3-for-2 open offer of 31.6m shares at 30p for working capital. Kitty Little's shares were suspended at 41p on April 11. Mr Warren Kanders, chief executive, said the company also planned to join the main market and change its name to Eyecare Products. The deal is expected to give Kitty Little a larger share of an eyeware market worth Pounds 5.9bn in western Europe and Pounds 8.2bn in the US. Under a lengthy financial reconstruction L'Amy made provisions of FFr105m last year to cover the cost of overhauling its core business. Before provisions, operating profits for the 1993 year were FFr4m (FFr14m losses) on sales of FFr568m (FFr636m). Mr Martin Franklin, chairman of Kitty Little, blamed the problems on debt-financed acquisitions, which have since been closed. Nevertheless, he predicted the enlarged group, with a market capitalisation of Pounds 24.7m, would expand with strategic alliances and more efficient production. Under the terms of the acquisition, which brings with it designer brands such as Lacoste and Nina Ricci, the Pounds 8.9m raised by the placing will be used to acquire loans of FFr225.3m owed by L'Amy to various banks. The banks will also receive Class A warrants for an aggregate of 4m new ordinary shares, exercisable at 100p per share. Another tranche of warrants, also exercisable at 100p, will be issued to banks providing on-going medium-term facilities of FFr16.3m. Dealings are expected to begin on August 9.</p>

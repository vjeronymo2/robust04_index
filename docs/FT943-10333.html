			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: RBS buys NatWest's share registrar Royal Bank of Scotland is buying the share registration business of National Westminster Bank in a move which will make it the UK's second largest registrar with 25 per cent of the total market. The purchase comes as UK share registrars face requirements for significant investments in technology in order to meet the requirements of Crest, the Bank of England-sponsored system for paperless share settlements. Share registrars have shouldered a large portion of the blame for the failure of the Taurus paperless share settlement system in March 1993 and the Bank of England is insisting on tough performance criteria for registrars in Crest. It has proposed fines for registrars who do not swiftly handle client transactions. Yesterday, NatWest insisted that the decision to sell the registrar business, which registers the shares of 430 companies for 6.3m shareholders, was 'not at all connected with the requirements of Crest'. The share registration business was not earning the desired return on capital, it said. In a statement, Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, said: 'Following an in-depth review we have concluded that while NatWest Registrars is producing profits it does not fit with our strategic objective.' The value of the transaction was not disclosed but the book value of the assets sold is Pounds 3.89m. NatWest employs about 550 staff in its share registration business while Royal Bank employs about 330. Royal Bank said it did not expect to make any redundancies when the two operations were merged.</p>

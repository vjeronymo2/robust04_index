			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALTADENA;  </P> <P> RESTAURANT FACES DELAY  </P> <P> Construction of a proposed McDonald's restaurant at the northwest corner of  Altadena Drive and Lake Avenue will come under closer scrutiny as a result of  an urgency ordinance extended Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Under the provisions of the ordinance, which will be in place for the next 10  1/2 months, the restaurant developer must secure a conditional-use permit  before beginning construction.  </P> <P> The requirement means that a public hearing must be held before restaurant  plans are approved.  </P> <P> Residents who organized against the restaurant said it would bring increased  traffic and create safety problems. They asked the Board of Supervisors to halt  the restaurant construction. But because the restaurant plans comply with the  site's commercial zoning and both the County General Plan and the Altadena  Community Plan, the supervisors could only ask for a more detailed review under  a 45-day urgency ordinance imposed Feb. 13.  </P> <P> Although representatives of the McDonald's corporation argued that the  extension of the ordinance for another 10 1/2 months would be unfair, the  supervisors voted 4 to 1 to extend it. Supervisor Pete Schabarum sided with  McDonald's and voted no.  </P></p>

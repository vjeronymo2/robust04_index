			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with South African Foreign Minister </F> Alfred Nzo by Gerald L'Ange in Tunis; date not given]    [Text] Tunis -- South Africa will not intervene  unilaterally in political crises in Africa but will act in  concert with regional and international organizations, according  to Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo.    In an interview in Tunis, where he is attending the  Organization of African Unity conference, Nzo confirmed that the  Cabinet had decided to provide humanitarian assistance in  Rwanda, but had not yet decided on the form it would take. The  decision, he said, might be influenced by proposals emanating  from the OAU conference, which might assign specific tasks to  certain member states. The Minister said the types of  assistance contemplated by South Africa included helping to ease  the burden imposed on Tanzania's resources by the influx of  thousands of refugees from Rwanda. This could include food and  medical aid.    While South Africa was not ready to contribute to any  international military force sent to enforce peace in Rwanda, it  would inevitably become involved in such operations in future  crises, he said. South Africa would, however, place much  greater emphasis on mediation, recognising that peace could not  be imposed from outside, as had been demonstrated in Somalia.    "That would be the ideal -- for African countries themselves  to try to resolve their problems in an African way, which would  mean that mediators should come from African countries. We have  expert negotiators in our country who could very well be  deployed to assist in negotiations."    Asked whether these negotiators might become involved in the  Angola dispute, Nzo said this might happen if the Angolans  wanted it. The recent upgrading of diplomatic relations between  South Africa and Angola enhanced the opportunity to discuss the  situation with Angolan government representatives. The contacts  would not be with the MPLA government alone, however. "Unita  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] must not  be made to feel that sides are being taken because that could  produce an unfortunate result ...that would be  counter-productive."    On the question of changing the nature and title of the  Frontline states now that confrontation with South Africa was no  longer necessary, Nzo said exchanges were taking place at the  OAU conference as a follow-up to the recent meeting of Frontline  leaders in Harare, where agreement was reached in principle to  the changes. Whatever body was set up in place of the Frontline  states would be structured to deal primarily with regional  co-operation on security matters. He believed that while the  grouping should still be confined to southern African countries,  it should be enlarged to bring in states like Swaziland and  Lesotho.    He said no policy had yet been worked out by the Government  on membership of or relations with the existing regional  economic groupings: the Southern African Customs Union, the  Southern African Development Community and the Preferential  Tariff Agreement grouping.    Expressing his appreciation for the warm welcome given to  South Africa at its first OAU conference, Nzo said he saw this  not as a honeymoon that would fade but as a beginning that had  to be consolidated. He rejected any concept of South Africa  inevitably dominating its neighbours. "There must be relations  of mutual benefit all the time. We want from the beginning to  have relations based on trust, on total friendship."    Nzo confirmed that President Mandela would visit Morocco on  his way to Tunisia for the OAU summit next week. The purpose  was to complete talks that could not be finalised during his  previous Moroccan visit.</p>

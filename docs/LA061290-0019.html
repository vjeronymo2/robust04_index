			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Higher at Auction: The Treasury sold $8.6 billion of new  three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.73%, up from 7.69% last  week.  </P> <P> Another $8.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount  rate of 7.64%, up from 7.62% the week before. The new discount rates understate  the actual return to investors: 7.99% for three-month bills, with a $10,000  bill selling for $9,804.60, and 8.06% for a six-month bill selling for  $9,613.80. The discount rate reflects the discount received when government  securities are purchased at less than face value. In a separate report, the  Federal Reserve reported that the average yield for one-year T-bills fell to  8.08% last week from 8.18%.  </P></p>

"Payment of debts to regional radio and TV centres for the  fourth quarter of 1993 has begun today and will be carried out  according to a schedule approved by the Finance Ministry",  government spokesman Valentin Sergeyev said on Thursday quoting  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.    He added that all the debts will be paid in the first three  months of 1994.    According to the spokesman, the prime minister will meet the  demand of leaders of the communication trade union who urged a  meeting with him.    The prime minister "understands the complexity of the  situation and requests the heads and work collectives of  regional radio and TV relay centres to continue work", according  to the spokesman.    On Wednesday the prime minister promised that the debt would  be paid by stages, however, communication workers said they had  heard enough of such declarations and urged a concrete decision  on the matter.    In the meantime, communication workers in Azerbaijan decided  to follow suit and threatened to cut off broadcasts from Russia  if Moscow fails to its half a billion rouble debt for leasing TV  relay stations in Azerbaijan.</p>

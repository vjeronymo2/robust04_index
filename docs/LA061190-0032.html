			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> KUWAIT;  </P> <P> OPPOSITION SCORNS VOTE FOR LEGISLATURE  </P> <P> Kuwaitis elected 50 members of a transitional parliament in voting boycotted by  opposition leaders, who are challenging government claims that the new body  will advance democracy.  </P> <P> No results were available, and it was unclear when they would be announced.  Unofficial estimates put the all-male turnout at about 55%. The opposition is  insisting on the restoration of the original 50-member legislature instead of  the 75-member transitional chamber, which includes 25 members appointed by the  emir of the small, oil-rich state.  </P></p>

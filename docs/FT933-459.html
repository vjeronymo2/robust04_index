			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Airport TV may buy live news PLANS ARE well advanced for the launch early next year of Airport Television, a service for passengers at six of the UK's largest airports. It will be on air 17 hours a day with a mixture of news and light entertainment. Sky Sites, the company launching the service, said yesterday it was discussing with news providers the possibility of live news for Airport TV, which will be financed by advertising. Sky Sites holds the concession to advertise in the six British Airport Authority airports - Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Mr Sohan Singh, deputy managing director of Sky Sites, said yesterday he was talking to the BBC, Sky News and Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network about a live news service. Sky News is provided by British Sky Broadcasting - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. CNN already operates a dedicated airport television service in the US and is interested in extending the concept. The six BAA airports will be linked by land lines, perhaps moving later to satellite distribution to a larger number of airports.</p>

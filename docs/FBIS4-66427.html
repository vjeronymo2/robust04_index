			<p>CSO     [Text] The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development  Organization (NEDO) will tackle the development of a  high-performance industrial furnace and boiler that will consume  less energy than conventional furnaces and boilers. NEDO will  use experimental facilities that produce a phenomenon in which a  micro-gravity environment, like that in outer space, is obtained  when objects fall naturally, and will elucidate the basic  mechanisms of combustion to design the high-performance  industrial furnace and boiler. NEDO will receive grants from  MITI and plans to invest &yen;5 billion in a seven-year effort  starting this fiscal year. The goals are to improve upon the  thermal efficiency of present-day industrial furnaces and  boilers by 30% and 5%, respectively.    Heating furnaces, heat-processing furnaces, aluminum-melting  furnaces, and other such industrial furnaces used today account  for about 15% of the total energy consumption in Japan.  Reducing that energy consumption is also viewed as important  from the standpoint of preventing global warming. On the other  hand, there has come to be brisk research into the details of  combustion in micro-gravity environments, where buoyancy and  convection effects are not felt. Consequently, NEDO decided to  build upon these new research results and develop methods for  increasing combustion efficiency and reducing harmful exhaust  gases by controlling the state of the flame within the furnace.    The Japan Space Utilization Promotion Center will be  commissioned to conduct basic experiments on combustion  phenomena and to develop the control technology. In addition to  the Hokkaido Kami-sunagawa-machi drop-test facility operated by  the third-sector Underground Zero-Gravity Experimental Center  (Sapporo City), NEDO will use Bremen University's drop tower in  Germany, and France's system that uses airplanes for  zero-gravity environment experiments. NEDO will also exchange  information on research results.    The Japan Industrial Furnace Society and the Japan Society  of  Industrial Machinery Manufacturers will be commissioned to  develop a test furnace and evaluate its performance. If the  industrial furnace becomes practical and goes into widespread  use, a rough calculation shows that it will bring about a  5%  reduction in Japan's total energy consumption.</p>

Ronald Domnitz.  </P> <P> Flores is one of two people charged in the Aug. 9 slayings of April Gilhousen,  20; her son, Bryan, 3, and Kevin Chandler, 29, all of whom lived in the  Clairemont house where they were killed.  </P> <P> The co-defendant is Christopher Box, 20, a former football player and wrestler  at Clairemont High School, who is awaiting a May 1 trial on the three murder  charges.  </P> <P> A Juvenile Court judge on Wednesday ordered that Flores, also a high school  football player, be tried as an adult at the conclusion of a weeklong hearing.  </P> <P> Domnitz ordered a Jan. 18 preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office has filed special circumstances allegations  against Box and will seek the death penalty if he is convicted.  </P> <P> Special circumstances allegations cannot be filed against Flores because he was  a minor at the time of the crime, even though he has been certified to be tried  in adult court.  </P> <P> Prosecutors claim the three were killed during a robbery that involved a  marijuana sale.  </P></p>

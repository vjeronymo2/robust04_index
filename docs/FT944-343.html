			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Dominating a niche market - 1994 has seen Inspec catapulted into the world league In a remote corner of Kansas, a small British chemicals company has hit on a formula which has enabled it to defy the twin pressures of raw material price increases and sluggish demand. While margins have been squeezed for almost every maker of speciality chemicals - used in products such as washing powder and paint - Inspec has emerged as an unexpected star of the sector, with a forward price/earnings multiple of 19.5, second only to ICI. The company, floated at 160p in March this year, has found itself in that enviable position by dominating the market for some highly specialised products that command premium prices. Its UK operations have been sustained by its role as the leading European supplier of niche products in such areas as synthetic lubricants and ingredients for fragrances. But it is in North America that it has begun to enjoy margins which are the envy of the sector. Concerned that rivals could try to pick off its customers, Mr John Hollowood, chairman, is coy about the figures. Sitting in the offices of Allco, the group's main US subsidiary near Galena in Kansas, he says obliquely: 'At the end of the day, this business makes quite a lot of money. It's been a find in every respect with a large market presence and good margins in a niche market.' All he will admit is that Allco - a former explosives manufacturer - has improved its position since this time last year when Inspec paid Lenzing, the Austrian chemicals group, Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.8m) for the business. It enjoyed operating margins last year of 36 per cent, and industry analysts believe the figure is now closer to 40 per cent. Its profits - totalling Dollars 4m on sales of Dollars 11.2m last year  - depend on two main products: BTDA, a basic component in fire resistant foams and fibres, and PMA, the intermediate chemical for use in powder coatings. Their share of the world market exceeds 90 per cent, a position which Inspec has exploited by cutting costs and seeking multiple applications. In August, it further enhanced its US presence by acquiring Imitech, one of Allco's main customers, for Dollars 17.3m. Imitech is the world's sole maker of polyimide foam - used mostly in insulating naval vessels and aircraft fuselages - and therefore commands gross margins estimated by City analysts at 70 per cent. Although Inspec still derives most of its profits from its two UK plants - inherited from a buy-out of BP's fine chemicals business - most analysts expect the US arm to play an increasingly important role. The outperformance of the shares reflects the opinion among investors that Inspec's management got to this position by design rather than luck. After looking at hundreds of potential acquisitions, a buy-out team led by Mr Hollowood persuaded BP to sell its well equipped fine chemicals business just when the conglomerate was looking to generate cash; and they then picked up the two US plants from companies keen to concentrate on core activities. By going for margin rather than mass volume, it has also cornered part of the market where other manufacturers apparently consider it too costly or complex to set up rival plants. 'There will come a time when we face serious challenges,' says Mr Hollowood. 'We will have to be defensive about it, even though it would not be easy for a rival to compete.' Inspec says it is now ready to expand its activities in North America and Europe. 'We are looking at at least one company a month, and we'd be prepared to spend up to Pounds 100m,' says Mr Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive. Although the Imitech deal pushed gearing above 100 per cent, the former Courtaulds executive claims interest cover of 13 times would enable it to use debt for further purchases. Even with robust interest cover, however, the group's lenders may be reluctant to endorse further large deals while it remains dependent on relatively few customers. Imitech, in particular, relies on the US Navy for half its orders; while there is just one large customer for Allco's PMA: an international chemicals group which uses the ingredient to make epoxy hardeners. To counter that dependence, the group has extended its UK manufacturing of hydroxy monomers, the reactive chemical ingredient used mainly by paint manufacturers, and begun seeking new applications for polyimide foams. It aims to sell these foams to manufacturers of such products as storage heaters and soft furnishings, while exploiting demand for heat resistant insulation from civil aircraft manufacturers. The company is also investing some Pounds 8m to increase output from its UK and US plants, currently running at about 80 per cent capacity. By increasing output and tying new customers into long-term contracts, it should be able to protect its market share and generate enough cash for acquisitions without pushing gearing too much higher.</p>

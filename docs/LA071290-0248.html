			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSBITES: FROM ANTIPASTI TO SEMIFREDDO  </P> <P> This week, a look at some Italian restaurants:  </P> <P> * Enzo Selvaggi, who sang romantic ballads in four languages at several Orange  County restaurants, is back after eight years in Italy. He and his trio will  perform soft dinner music at Ciao Bella Restaurant and Bar in Los Caballeros  Sports Village, 17272 Newhope St., Fountain Valley, Wednesdays through  Saturdays from 8 to 9 p.m., and music for dancing from 9 to 11:30. To celebrate  Selvaggi's return, Ciao Bella owner Jay Mastoianni has designed a special  four-course dinner with a choice of appetizers, salads and entrees, and  semifreddo (vanilla ice cream, espresso and whipped cream) for dessert. Prices  are $16 and $18, depending on the entree. (714) 546-7426.  </P> <P> * For light diners, Il Ristorante Bagatta at 3012 Newport Blvd. in Newport  Beach has introduced "a Mediterranean Experience," antipasto with a selection  of pasta dishes, Mondays through Thursdays, from 6 to 7:30 for $13. Sundays at  Bagatta, "A Taste of Milano" offers a sampling of foods from the Lombardy  region of Italy: risotta alla Milanese, vitello tonnato, pasta e fasoi and many  other northwestern favorites. You get to choose between three appetizers, first  courses and entrees; the price range is $16 to $24. Or, you may order from the  regular menu. (714) 675-4020.  </P> <P> * The newly refurbished patio at Carmelo's, 3520 E. Pacific Coast Highway in  Corona del Mar, has opened in time for our Mediterranean-type weather. Between  2 and 5 p.m., you can relax under a red umbrella in the midst of bright flowers  and enjoy cappuccino, espresso, cocktails or desserts. Then, from 5 to 9 p.m.  Sundays through Thursdays, you can order a light, informal supper from the  "Intermezzo" menu. Antipasti range from roasted bell pepper salad with capers  to fennel salad. There's soup, three pizzas, a dozen pastas, from pennette with  eggplant to gnocchi with pesto, homemade desserts -- and everything's under  $10. Look for expanded al fresco service soon. (714) 675-1922.  </P> <P> * Meanwhile, back at the old Nieuport 17 location, 1615 E. 17th St. in Santa  Ana, owner Bill Bettis and operator Jeff Altman open That Other Place  Ristorante this week. The restaurant, which has a new front entrance, accents  continental cuisine with a central-northern Italian flair. The chef is Ali  Dundar, formerly of Chez Dante in Newport Beach and Lawry's Prime Rib in  Beverly Hills. And yes, there's still a piano bar. It's open Mondays through  Fridays for lunch and Mondays through Saturdays for dinner, with full dinner  prices in the $20-22 ballpark. (714) 541-9511.  </P> <P> Table Talk: Could La Vie en Rose, at 240 S. State College Blvd. in Brea, be  Orange County's answer to Schwab's drug store in L.A., where at least one film  star is said to have been discovered? Mike Riley was a waiter at La Vie until  ABC-TV found him and snatched him away to host Merv Griffin's new Saturday  night game show, "Monopoly." The network filmed Mike's last night at the  restaurant several weeks ago. . . . BEVERLY BUSH SMITH  </P></p>

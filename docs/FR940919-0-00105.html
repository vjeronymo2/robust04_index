			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's review of IMWIR data indicates that less than 2 m3/yr of treatment capacity is available that can accept mixed low-level debris, an amount that exceeds the estimated annual generation. In addition, DOE has not yet been authorized to begin placement of MTRU wastes into the WIPP. As a result, DOE faces a treatment capacity shortfall for mixed transuranic debris. Therefore, EPA is granting a two-year national capacity variance to debris contaminated with mixed radioactive wastes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Required and Available Capacity for High TOC Ignitable, TC Pesticide, and Newly Listed Wastes Injected Into Class I Deep Wells <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained in previous rules concerning land disposal restrictions (see e.g., 52 FR 32450, August 27, 1987; 53 FR 30912, August 16, 1988; 55 FR 22520, June 1, 1990), EPA is allocating available capacity first to those wastes disposed in surface units, second to wastes resulting from CERCLA and RCRA clean ups, and finally to underground injected wastes. Based on this hierarchical approach, the Agency is promulgating the following effective dates for injected wastes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA still has very limited information which differentiates high TOC D001 ignitable wastes from low TOC D001 ignitable wastes, particularly with reference to the type of Class I injection well (i.e., nonhazardous versus hazardous) into which the wastes are disposed. The information the Agency does have indicates that both D001 ignitable wastes and D012&hyph;D017 TC pesticide wastes are deep well injected into Class I hazardous wells with no-migration variances. EPA is concerned that since these wastes are being generated, the potential exists that diluted D001 ignitable wastes and D012&hyph;D017 TC pesticide wastes are also being injected into Class I nonhazardous wells. In the proposed rule, EPA estimated that, based on management practices, low volumes of diluted high TOC ignitable waste were injected into Class I nonhazardous wells, and less than 420 tons of D012&hyph;D017 pesticide wastes are deep well injected into Class I nonhazardous wells. However, several commenters to the proposed rule, and other industries with Class I injection wells, have indicated that it would be extremely difficult to identify, segregate, treat, and/or arrange for disposal of these waste streams in a short time frame. This may be particularly true if waste volumes for high TOC D001 ignitable wastes are discovered to greatly exceed earlier estimates. The facilities, depending on their Class I injection wells, would have to reconfigure their disposal systems, which may include the construction or rearrangement of wastelines or piping. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To allow sufficient time to address these logistical problems, EPA is granting a one-year national capacity variance to allow the Class I injection facilities an appropriate lead time to identify their decharacterized high TOC D001 and D012&hyph;D017 waste streams and to create an infrastructure that allows their alternative management consistent with today's rule and the statute. This may include installation of equipment to segregate wastes. For operators applying for no-migration petitions, the variance will allow time for conducting the modelling or other analysis, for EPA review, and for the operators to make alternative arrangements if the petitions are not granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following wastes are the newly listed wastes for which numerical standards are being promulgated, and which current data indicate are not being underground injected: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Coke By-Product Wastes: K141, K142, K143, K144, K145, K147, K148 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chlorotoluene Production Wastes: K149, K150, K151 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency requested further comment on whether any of these wastes are being injected. Comment was also requested on what quantities of wastes are being injected, and on the characteristics of these wastes. However, no comments were received on this issue. EPA is therefore not granting a national capacity variance for coke production wastes (K141&hyph;K145, K147, K148) and for chlorotoluene production wastes (K149&hyph;K151) injected into Class I deep wells. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Required and Available Capacity for Hazardous Soil and Debris Contaminated with Newly Listed and Identified Wastes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This capacity analysis focuses on hazardous soil and debris contaminated with wastes whose treatment standards are promulgated in today's rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA used several data sources to estimate the total quantity of land-disposed hazardous soil and debris. These sources include: responses to the Advance Notice to the Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) for the newly identified wastes (56 FR 55160); the TC Survey; information provided during a series of roundtable meetings held by the Agency in May and June of 1991 with representatives of companies involved in the management and disposal of hazardous debris and soil; the Biennial Reporting System (BRS); Records of Decision (RODs) of Superfund sites; the TSDR Survey; and the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA conducted the surveys during 1987 and 1988 to obtain comprehensive data on the nation's capacity for managing hazardous waste and the volumes of hazardous waste being land disposed as well as data on waste generation, waste characterization, and hazardous waste treatment capacity in units exempt from RCRA permitting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Waste Generation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> a. Hazardous Soil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The hazardous soil covered by this rule includes soil contaminated with D018&hyph;D043 organic TC wastes, and soils contaminated with coke by-product wastes and chlorinated toluene wastes. The largest quantity of hazardous soil affected by today's rulemaking is hazardous soil contaminated with D018&hyph;D043 organic TC wastes. At the time of the proposal, the Agency estimated that approximately 233,000 tons per year of TC soils would require off-site treatment and the majority of these TC soils was expected to be generated from surface impoundment closures. Based on new data received from owners/operators concerning surface impoundment closure practices, the Agency now estimates that the annual quantities of TC soil that is land disposed and subject to the LDRs ranges from 70,000 to 120,000 tons. Because TC soil generation from surface impoundment closures is somewhat discretionary, decisions by owners/operators of facilities concerning closure methods significantly changed the generation rates previously estimated in the TC Survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency contacted facilities expected to generate TC soils from surface impoundment closures in 1993, 1994, and 1995 to confirm generation rates. Nearly all of the owners/operators revised their estimates for TC soil generation downward. Most owners/operators revised their closure practices to minimize or eliminate TC soil generation. Some facilities closed impoundments prior to today's rulemaking and other facilities are closing their impoundments as landfills. In closing as a landfill, a facility closes the impoundment with the waste in place. The facility owners/operators remove all free liquids, stabilize the sludges, cap the impoundment, and establish a ground water monitoring system. Therefore, for these facilities, no LDR treatment capacity would be necessary for TC soils. Of the facilities that predicted TC soil generation in 1994 and 1995, no facility currently expects to ship TC soils generated from a surface impoundment closure off-site for LDR treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

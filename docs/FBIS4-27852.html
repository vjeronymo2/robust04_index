			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  stressed that a special inspection of two undeclared nuclear  facilities is indispensable [pilsujok] to examine North Korea's  diversion of nuclear material, and called for full-scale  cooperation from North Korea.    Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna:    [Begin Cha recording] Reporting on the status of the  replacement of fuel rods to its Board of Governors during its  informal meeting held yesterday [3 June] afternoon, the IAEA  pointed out that the decisive opportunity [kyolchongjogin kihoe]  to examine North Korea's diversion of nuclear material has  already been lost.    The IAEA reported to its 35 Board of Governors member states  that providing additional information, which has been demanded  from early last year, and a special inspection of two undeclared  facilities are indispensable for determining the exact amount of  plutonium produced in North Korea. Thus, full-scale cooperation  from North Korea is urgent.    At yesterday's Board of Governors meeting, Olli Heinonen,  head of the inspection section who inspected the replacement of  fuel rods in Yongbyon, stressed that because nearly all of the  fuel rods were replaced in the portion where sample-taking is  definitely required, the result of analysis cannot be trusted  even if samples are taken.    Councilor Yun Ho-chin from the North Korean side and Kim  Su-kil, researcher in the DPRK Foreign Ministry, who came from  Pyongyang, attended the informal Board of Governors meeting  yesterday. They repeatedly referred to North Korea's special  position of withholding the withdrawal of Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, and persistently refused interviews by  reporters. [end recording]</p>

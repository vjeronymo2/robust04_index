			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Sergeyev, chairman of the </F> Independent Trade Union of Miners of Russia, by A. Zhukovskaya;  place and date not given: "Strike: What the Miners Want"]    [Text] Aleksandr Sergeyev is the chairman of the  Independent Trade Union of Miners of Russia, which was founded  at the second congress of miners in 1991. He was born on 5  August 1960 in the city of Mezhdurechensk in Kemerovo Oblast. He  graduated from the institute, worked in mines as a mine foreman  and a mechanic. He has been in the workers movement and a member  of the strike committee of the city since 1989. He was an  organizer and member of practically all strikes. He is married  and has two children. He rents an apartment in Moscow.    [Zhukovskaya] Aleksandr Andreyevich, why are you striking?  Do  you want to hang the losses of your mines on us, the taxpayers?    [Sergeyev] First, we are coming out against closing mines  without job placement for the workers that are released.  Further, we are trying to fight for a structural restructuring  of industry and its entry into the market. The third item of our  demands: To achieve the establishment of safe work conditions.  It is not known to this day how the state subsidy is being used  and, in general, the resources of enterprises, and what  contracts and how many were concluded. Without verification and  control, any subsidies will vanish, as in 1992--36 billion  rubles [R] and last year--R1.5 trillion.    When we tried to come to the administration of the  enterprises with an inspection--we were not given access to  documents, and we were assured that this was a commercial  secret. On our insistence a comprehensive check was made at the  Polysayevskaya mine in the city of Novokuznetsk, and we found  outrageous facts of poor economic management and criminal  proceedings were instituted against the directors.    [Zhukovskaya] Thus, perhaps, instead of strikes, clarify  relations with the administration in the localities, and then  some of the problems will be resolved.    [Sergeyev] Everything is not that simple. We have been  trying  to remove the directors of the Severnaya mine for one and a half  years. And at the Central mine in Chelyabinsk, where an  explosion occurred and people died, the director prospers, while  saying: There is no money to pay wages.    [Zhukovskaya] But how do they explain to the miners that  there is no money? After all, everyone knows about the subsidies.    [Sergeyev] They say that they have not arrived from the  government yet. Only now, once again at our insistence, have the  presidential structures started to get involved in verification  of the transmission of state support. Along the chain of the  Ministry of Finance, the Rosugol association...    [Zhukovskaya] But the court? After all, you can dislodge the  money through the court.    [Sergeyev] What kind of court? In Norilsk, our organization  brought a suit against the general director of the mine and  metallurgical combine three times. But Judge Sokolovskaya denied  our case, arguing that "the economic condition of the country  does not permit observation of the law."    [Zhukovskaya] Of course, strikes are an extreme step. What  have they brought you?    [Sergeyev] At our insistence, the government established an  interdepartmental commission for resolution of socioeconomic  problems of the coal-mining regions. We have pinned a lot of  hope on this. It was headed at that time by Gaydar, but with his  departure, it is now two months and the commission has not met  even once--it seems no problems exist. What is more, attempts  are being made now to change the situation concerning this  commission. But, after all, it could conduct an analysis, and it  could decide where and how much money is needed in the first  instance, and in the second...</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Wei (2621 1550)] </F>   [Text] Nanjing, 3 June (XINHUA) -- Secondary industry is  being gradually shifted to rural areas while tertiary industry  enjoys rapid development in urban areas. Such a new urban-rural  relationship has become increasingly distinct in the  economically developed cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou in  Jiangsu Province.    Thanks to the spread of urban industries, village and town  enterprises rose like a new force suddenly coming to the fore in  the fields beside Tai Hu in the early 1970's. They opened a new  chapter in the annals of industrial revolution in China's rural  areas. After more than 20 years of pioneering work and  development, southern Jiangsu's rural areas ended an era of  "grass-roots industry" and entered into a new phase of  industrial development with scientific and technological  advances and the export-oriented economy playing the dominant  role and with a rational distribution of village and town  enterprises being relatively concentrated in satellite towns.  At present, the three cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou  boast 50,000-plus village and town enterprises. Over 70 percent  of their equipment is of the advanced level of the 1980's and  the 1990's, surpassing the technical and equipment standard of  urban industries. On the average, every township and town set up  more than 10 "three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned  enterprises." According to statistics, staff and workers of  village and town enterprises already accounted for over 80  percent of the labor force in southern Jiangsu's rural areas.  The ratio captured by village and town industries in the whole  industrial sector of southern Jiangsu already exceeded two  thirds. On the list of China's top 100 village and town  enterprises made public recently, 45 are located in southern  Jiangsu.    The successful process of industrialization in the  countryside has filled the chasms that have chronically divided  urban and rural areas. In southern Jiangsu, all townships and  towns have been interconnected by highways, most of the villages  are now illuminated by streetlamps at night, and the  overwhelming majority of townships and towns have installed  program-controlled telephones. On the basis of "feedback" from  village and town industries, southern Jiangsu has initially  realized farming mechanization, and more than 90 percent of the  villages have set up general agricultural service stations.  Fair-sized operations on land and socialized agricultural  service networks have developed significantly, turning age-old  heavy farm jobs, which peasants performed with "their faces  turned toward the yellow soil and their backs toward the sky,"  into "pieces of cake." Various social services, including  culture, education, and medical and health care, have all  advanced side by side. The dream of urbanizing the countryside  is slowly coming true.    The economic take-off in rural areas has posed endless  challenges to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, setting even stricter  demands for building up the multipurpose functions of key  cities. Faced with this task, the cities in southern Jiangsu  have aggressively reversed the old pattern of lopsided  development in secondary and tertiary industries as they have  begun implementing a new blueprint for giving modern cities a  new lease on life. In recent years, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou  cities have successively designated tertiary industry as a new  economic growth sector to be developed on a priority basis.  This will turn the cities into the hubs of manpower, material,  capital, and information flows. Traditional commodity exchanges  and catering businesses aside, such burgeoning tertiary  businesses as finance, communications, post and  telecommunications, scientific and technological consultation,  and information media services are on the rise. New service  industries, which are primarily of a knowledge-intensive type,  have sprung up incessantly, breathing powerful life into urban  economies, and lending strong support to the further development  of rural economies.    People in economic circles commented: The shift of secondary  industry to the countryside and the growth of tertiary industry  in the cities have eroded the traditional notion of an  "industrial city." This will blur the boundaries between urban  and rural areas, bringing about a new pattern in which the  integration of urban and rural economies is accelerated.</p>

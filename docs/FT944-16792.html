			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Lamont says it may be necessary to pull out of EU Britain should consider leaving the European Union if it cannot halt the process of European political integration, Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said yesterday as Europe dominated the first day of the Tory conference. In a hard-hitting speech to an audience of rightwingers on the conference fringe, Mr Lamont said it was 'simplistic' to say that the option of leaving the EU was 'unthinkable'. But he stressed he was not suggesting that Britain should 'today unilaterally withdraw from Europe'. In an interview, he said he would advocate withdrawing 'if we cannot get the sort of political deal I think we deserve and ought to stand for'. But Lord Tebbit, former Conservative chairman, shouted down rightwing hecklers' demands to withdraw from Europe at a separate fringe meeting, saying: 'There's no need to get out. We have the weight to make a difference if we have the will.' Lord Tebbit said he had little doubt that Britain could deal 'a fatal blow' to those seeking to create a European superstate if it made plain it would veto plans for a political union with the continental powers. He said enlargement of the EU would require a 'massive change' from the 'centralised Europe of Maastricht' to 'a Gaullist Europe of nation-states, some of whom may wish to integrate, others of whom may wish to disintegrate'. 'Those states should be bound by treaty to do at supranational level only that which is necessary to ensure the free movement of goods, services and capital.' Mr William Cash, the Eurosceptic Tory MP for Stafford, urged the government to 'force the issue' of a single European currency by saying ''No' now' to any such step. Mr Lamont, describing the outcome of the Maastricht negotiations as 'a sort of Band-aid to our problems', said one possible course of action would be for Britain to say at the intergovernmental conference in 1996 that 'we do not want to participate in any further political development in Europe'. The IGC would force Britain to make 'a fundamental choice' over whether to subscribe to a Europe with a 'federal character,' he said. 'Being part of a federal Europe is not what the British people or the Conservative party want . . . Britain is on a collision course with its partners unless we can find a means of resolving the different aspirations.' He could not, he said, pinpoint 'a single concrete economic advantage that unambiguously comes to this country because of our membership of the European Union.' Mr Lamont added: 'It is a tremendous opportunity now that Tony Blair has committed himself uncritically to a single European currency, to a more centralised Europe. 'I believe we should exploit this and home in on a much more distinctive Conservative European policies.'</p>

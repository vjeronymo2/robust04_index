			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (1): Talent needs intelligence too - In the competitive international markets of the 1990s, design is more important than ever. European companies must use it more imaginatively if they are to prosper Locked in a secret room in the labyrinthine headquarters of Thomson Consumer Electronics in Paris are a dozen or so television sets which, or so the company hopes, will bring it back into the black after years of losses and spark a revolution in the recession-scarred European electronics industry. The televisions, which will remain shrouded in secrecy until their launch this September, are the legacy of Thomson's liaison with Philippe Starck, the superstar French designer who became its artistic director last year. Most 'new' electronic products look like updated versions of their predecessors - or competitors, but these designs ooze lateral thinking. They seem so fresh and so different from anything else on the market that it looks as though Starck must have started from scratch by dreaming up the type of television the company's customers would like to own. Thomson knows that the iconoclastic designs are a gamble. Yet it is convinced that European consumers are so bored by what Starck calls the grey boxes now on the market that they are ready for something new. 'For years companies have been trying to sell new products with a new techno-this, or new techno-that,' says Starck. 'People take technology for granted these days. What they want are warm, friendly products - something to seduce them.' Thomson is not the only European company to have come to the conclusion that, after a frustrating decade of losing market share to the Japanese and Americans, it could regain a competitive advantage by adopting a more imaginative approach to design. Olivetti, the Italian information technology group, is revising its design strategy as part of its corporate overhaul. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, the German car companies, are taking a fresh look at their new models for the mid-1990s following Renault's success with the Twingo, its funkily futuristic new city car. The concept of design as a competitive tool has been conventional wisdom since the early 1900s, when Peter Behrens, a German architect, transformed the fortunes of AEG's industrial empire with a crack team of designers including Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe, the founding fathers of the Bauhaus. Iconoclastic design has since been central to other European successes - from Flaminio Bertoni's 1955 Citroen DS19, to Ettore Sottsass's 1969 Olivetti Valentino typewriter. Europe still has an abundance of design talent. Gert Dumbar, Fabien Baron and Neville Brody are among the world's most influential graphic designers, as are Philippe Starck, Jasper Morrison and Marc Newson in furniture; and John Galliano, Vivienne Westwood and Martin Margiela in fashion. Some companies have exploited their skills, such as Vitra of Switzerland, which has become a world leader in office furniture (and last week won one of this year's EC Design Prizes), thanks partly to its liaison with designers such as Starck and Morrison. Yet successes are still outnumbered by failures. There is still a dearth of European companies which have made the most of design on a large scale. The excuses are legion: everything from failure of nerve and the lowly status of designers in the corporate hierarchy to disillusion with the superficial use of design as a styling tool in the 1980s. Is it realistic to expect European companies to adopt a more intelligent approach in the future? The blunt answer is that they do not have a choice. It cannot be a coincidence that some of the new converts to design, notably Thomson Consumer Electronics and Renault, are in dire financial straits. Volkswagen's decision to unveil Concept 1, the acclaimed new Beetle prototype, at this year's Detroit Motor Show was interpreted as an attempt to distract attention from its industrial espionage row with GM and atrocious US sales figures. There are also positive reasons why European industry might re-assess its approach to design. One is the significant shift in consumer attitudes. The increase in prosperity from the 1950s onwards encouraged consumers to purchase a range of new gadgets such as refrigerators, freezers, colour televisions and video recorders. Today's consumers are less impressionable, more discerning, aware that unnecessary expenditure is bad for their ecological consciences, as well as their bank balances. This means that manufacturers must work harder to attract consumers by adopting more imaginative strategies. Design can play an important part in that process, providing it is properly integrated with other areas such as production planning and communications. 'Public perceptions are shifting from quantity to quality,' says Stefano Marzano, design director of Philips, the Dutch electronics group. 'New technology dominated product development in the 1980s, but it's not an end in itself. Why redesign a washing machine with 15 programmes so it has 20 or 25, when you know the consumer only uses six?' At the same time, consumers do seem to be responsive to genuinely innovative products, which are visually stimulating as well as efficient. Renault almost lost its nerve when the Twingo's pre-launch research showed that 40 per cent of the market 'actively disliked it'. The launch went ahead after Patrick Le Quement, design director, argued that '10 per cent would fall in love with it'. The Twingo is now France's second best-selling car. Consumer pressure for innovation comes at a time when many industries are accelerating product development plans in anticipation of enforced structural changes in their markets. The car industry is accelerating the development of micro-compact and electric cars to accommodate tighter environmental controls. The new multimedia industry will create new areas of design such as interfaces for home shopping and information systems. It should also fuel demand for new products in sectors such as office electronics and even furniture for those who want to work from home via modems. Olivetti, which has used design successfully during past periods of transition, hopes to do so again as its old information technology activities are subsumed into the multi-media industry. 'We know there'll be deep changes in the structure of our industry, but we don't know exactly what they'll be,' says Michele de Lucchi, design director. 'What we can do is use design as a tool to guide us - and our customers.' In practical terms this means that Olivetti is developing new products, notably multi-function machines such as combined fax and photocopiers. De Lucchi is also refining its styling by using bright colours and tactile materials so the sophisticated new machines appear accessible and easy to use. This new era of product development coincides with structural changes within industry which are eradicating one of the old deficiencies of European design management: the failure to integrate design with other activities. Manufacturing systems are now so complex that it is increasingly difficult to separate different functions and to relegate design to the role of a superficial styling tool. The Twingo's development was facilitated by Renault's adoption of a Japanese team-based product development system. Such changes create new opportunities, but they also pose huge challenges. European companies are under pressure to invest more intellectual energy in design - and to take adventurous decisions - at a time when confidence is still depressed by recession. But the time is ripe for change. The defeats of the early 1990s must surely have shattered any lingering illusions about the play-it-safe policy of producing yet more over-programmed washing machines. The Twingo's triumph suggests there is an appetite for inventive European design. Thomson Consumer Electronics hopes to prove that when it unlocks the secret room containing Philippe Starck's television sets.</p>

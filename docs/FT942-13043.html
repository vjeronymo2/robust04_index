			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Banknote thieves told to pay Pounds 1/2 m The Bank of England yester-day won its High Court action against three former employees whose families it claimed had been living the 'life of Riley' on more than Pounds 500,000 stolen from its banknote destruction depot. But it was believed last night that the Crown Prosecution Service had ruled out criminal action against Mrs Christine Gibson, 44, Mr Kenneth Longman, 34, and Mr Michael Nairne, 39, because there was insufficient hard evidence to secure a conviction. Judge Norman Rudd ruled that the three had systematically stolen cash from the depot at Debden, Essex, between 1988 and 1992. He said they had been fully aware of where the money had come from. Their explanations for their extravagant lifestyles were 'wholly incredible and totally unsupported'. It was alleged that Mrs Gibson had smuggled thousands of pounds out of the depot by stuffing it into her underwear. Mrs Gibson's husband, Mr Peter Gibson, who the Bank claimed had never done an honest day's work in his life, sniggered and said 'prat' as the judge gave his finding. He ordered the Gibsons to return Pounds 250,000, the Longmans Pounds 150,000 and the Nairnes Pounds 110,000. Enforcement of the judgment was suspended for 28 days pending an appeal and the Bank was granted a continuation of asset-freezing orders against the three families. The families, who are all from Loughton, Essex, were also ordered to pay costs estimated at Pounds 400,000. The costs order against the Longmans and the Nairnes was not to be enforced without leave of the court as they were on legal aid. Another former Bank employee, Mr Kevin Winwright, admitted three counts of theft totalling Pounds 170,000 and was jailed for 18 months in January 1993.</p>

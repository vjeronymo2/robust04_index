When Premier Li Peng inspected the Three Gorges project  toward the end of last year, he explicitly set out requirements  on a series of issues, including building of Yichang's  Huanglongsi airport, the Yi-Huang highway, and telecommunication  undertakings that have a direct bearing on the Three Gorges  project.    At the very beginning when he started work, Governor Jia  Zhijie put it bluntly that the Three Gorges project is located  in Hubei, and the province is duty-bound to do a good job  concerning the project. Regarding the several issues Premier Li  Peng showed concern for, they must be implemented and launched  immediately. [passage omitted]    It was decided at the meeting to handle official business  that the provincial authorities would invest 23 million yuan in  the Huanglongsi airport project, and have it completed by the  end of 1995. New channels for investment should be  enthusiastically opened so the Yi-Huang highway is completed by  the end of 1995. [passage omitted]    The meeting made clear-cut decisions on improving Yichang's  environmental quality, moving key enterprises that have  pollution problems out of the city, and building the Yunci deep  water harbor. Governor Jia Zhijie said, the six major issues  related to the Three Gorges project were resolved in only half  day. This showed that all departments have grasped the Three  Gorges project as a top priority for the whole country and  province, and embodied the spirit of breaking conventional rules  and resolving specific problems in specific ways. In this  spirit, the whole province from top to grass roots should make  still greater direct contributions to the building of the Three  Gorges project.</p>

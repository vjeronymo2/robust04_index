			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices fell sharply on the lLondon Metal Exchange in after hours trading, pressured by a savage contraction in the cash premiums, dealers said. The cash to three months premium narrowed from Dollars 60 to Dollars 20 in about 30 minutes, as influential quarters, believed to be linked to the recent squeeze, lent metal (sold cash and bought forward). The cash price was last traded at Dollars 1,875 a tonne, down from Dollars 1,928 on Wednesday and more than Dollars 2,000 just over a week ago. The three months price ended at Dollars 1,850 a tonne, down Dollars 31.50 and Dollars 100 below the level reached at the height of the squeeze. One possible reason for the sudden collapse in the tightness was talk that the major Far Eastern company believed to be supporting the market had concluded a large long-term physical pricing deal. Among the other LME contracts Tin's inexorable slide continued, establishing fresh 20-yea lows, and nickel moved ominously close to the Dollars 2-a-lb mark that some analysts have suggested will trigger substantial production cuts. The three months price closed Dollars 80 down at Dollars 4,437.50 a tonne, equivalent to Dollars 2.01 1/4 a lb. Compiled from Reuters</p>

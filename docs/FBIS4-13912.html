			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ali al-Salih and Ilyas Nasrallah: "AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT Asks About Fate of Palestinian Madrid Delegation"]    [Excerpts] London -- A well-informed Palestinian source in  the occupied territories has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Dr.  Sa'ib 'Urayqat, present head of the Palestinian delegation to  the Washington peace negotiations, suspended since the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, failed to persuade any  member of the Palestinian delegation that participated in the  Washington negotiations before the Oslo agreement to join him in  the latest rounds of negotiations, held in a secret location in  the U.S. capital in January and February.    The source said that most members of the delegation, which  was headed by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, differ in practice with  the present PLO position on the negotiations, and are openly  opposed to the declaration of principles agreement reached  following the secret negotiations in the Norwegian capital,  Oslo, away from the Washington negotiations and without the  negotiators' knowledge.    This position has been confirmed in an exclusive statement  to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi himself. He said:  "Actually I believe that the task of the declaration of  principles agreement reached in Oslo ended the responsibility of  the negotiating delegation in Washington. Yes, the delegation's  mission ended the moment the Oslo agreement was signed, as our  first task was to negotiate the transitional phase."    'Abd-al-Shafi went on: "I did not participate in the Oslo  negotiations, nor was I consulted on the Oslo agreement. I  personally criticized the agreement and believe it is bad.  Because it did not tackle Israel's claims regarding the  occupied territories, on the basis of which Israel built the  settlements. The outcome of the failure to tackle this issue is  clear in the current negotiations in Cairo. The current  situation is worrying. And as long as the settlement building  process is continuing, the possibility of achieving a just peace  is out of the question." [passage omitted]    Asked about his position -- as a former delegate -- on the  current negotiations in Cairo between the PLO and Israel and the  agreements they have achieved, Ghassan al-Khatib said: First of  all, we are not informed officially -- neither as a delegation  nor as political forces -- of what is happening in Cairo.  However, I believe that Israel is retrieving in Cairo what it  offered in Oslo. What is happening there is a victory for the  Israeli methods which they tried to impose in Washington but  failed, such as fragmenting the topics under negotiation into  parts isolated from one another. [passage omitted]    Al-Khatib warned that "if the Cairo agreement is  implemented,  it contains very dangerous time bombs. This is because of the  agreement to keep thousands of armed and aggressive settlers,  allowing them to move freely in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho  area. This is in addition to the presence of thousands of  Palestinian policemen, who will be in an unenviable position in  the event of any attack on Palestinian by a settler. Because it  will be difficult for them to take a neutral position, and it  will also be difficult for them to punish the settlers. Hence  the danger of another Bosnia in the Gaza Strip."    Answering the same questions, Dr. [Hanan] 'Ashrawi said over  the telephone from her home in Ramallah: "There is no longer a  thing called the delegation to the Washington negotiations,  because the negotiations are now direct between the PLO and  Israel." [passage omitted]    On the way the negotiations are run at present, 'Ashrawi  said: "There is Israeli diktat in the negotiations. In my view,  the peace process is consolidating Israeli terms and priorities,  including the method of separating the people from the land, the  employment method instead of geographical jurisdiction, and the  continued political blackmail. In brief, the peace process has  lost the foundation on which it was launched."    'Ashrawi stressed that she is in favor of correcting the  course of the process and intervening in a manner that prevents  sliding into discussing the fine details while ignoring the  essence. She said that the "form has become more important than  the substance." She urged reexamining the entire process and the  way it is run.    'Ashrawi attributed the deterioration to world pressures and  internal Palestinian political considerations, the political  contradictions produced by the peace process at the Palestinian  public opinion level, and political orientations in the PLO.

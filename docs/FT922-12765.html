			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Norweb to compete in gas market NORWEB, the regional electricity supply company, is to start marketing gas. It will be the fourth regional electricity company, after Midlands, Eastern, Seeboard and Scottish Power, to try to undercut British Gas by competing in the gas supply market. The gas will be marketed by Northern Gas, a joint-venture between Norweb and UtiliCorp United, the US electricity and gas company. Norweb has 75 per cent of the venture. The move will put more pressure on British Gas, which has agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to halve its share of the industrial gas market by 1995. Northern Gas will begin by distributing North Sea gas to 50-100 small and medium-sized industrial and commercial consumers using over 25,000 therms. The gas will initially be supplied by UtiliCorp which has interests in the Indefatigable and Leman oil fields.</p>

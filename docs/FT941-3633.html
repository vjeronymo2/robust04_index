			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hysan Development surprises with leap Hysan Development, the Hong Kong property investment company with a strong presence in the office and shopping district of Causeway Bay, has surprised analysts with a 53 per cent leap in net profits to HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194m) for 1993, up from HKDollars 980m previously. Hong Kong's buoyant property market, with limited supply and strong demand, led to big improvements in the office leasing market, while luxury homes saw continued healthy demand. Rental levels on the retail side were firm, the company said. The company also unveiled a massive upgrade in its net asset value following an independent revaluation of its properties and investments portfolios, to HKDollars 36.41 per share against HKDollars 19.24 in 1992. Directors are recommending a final dividend of 58 cents, up from 44 cents a share the previous year. Earnings per share rose 40 per cent to HKDollars 1.58 against HKDollars 1.13.</p>

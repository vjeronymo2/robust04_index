			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Books: Anything but fossilised - JDF Jones gets hooked on rocks THE HIDDEN LANDSCAPE by Richard Fortey Jonathan Cape Pounds 19.99, 310 pages I know next to nothing about geology - my only acquaintance with fossils comes from The French Lieutenant's Woman - and I had never thought to give the matter my attention. This book shows me to be a fool. I have read The Hidden Landscape in a state of sustained fascination, and commend it to all the other fools out there. Richard Fortey's theme is the connection between the geology of the British Isles and our landscape: he shows how today's beautiful, diverse and threatened countryside is the result of events that took place unimaginable millions of years ago. It is, he says, 'a book about connections between geology, natural history, and ourselves. The intention is to inspire a way of looking at the landscape . . .' This is not, I suggest, a book to be read at a single sitting - it is too rich, too dense, for that. Rather it should join Pevsner and Hoskins and Rackham, if not in the car at least on the shelf below the Barbours and above the wellingtons. (It is a pity that the index is not quite full enough, since you will frequently want to look up place names from your travels.) I am not remotely qualified to say so, but I suspect we have here a new classic. We start in the North-Western Highlands of Scotland and finish on the fast-eroding shores of East Anglia. Like all geologists, Fortey is a bit of a nut, and certainly a romantic: when he gets behind the gasworks in Haverfordwest, cracks a rock in two and discovers a trilobite, 'there was astonishment in suddenly finding this complex creature, so perfect though so old, with a pair of petrified eyes visible to the naked eye even in the misty light of a Welsh afternoon, eyes that had last seen the world more than 400 million years ago - before the first, humble liverwort had colonised the dampest shore, before sharks, before flies, and how unimaginably far before humankind'. There you have a reminder of the time factor. This is not a book for Fundamentalists: the Earth is 4,600 million years old - 'one of those immutable facts that should be filed in the mind, along with the date of The Battle of Hastings and The French Revolution'. Britain apparently contains as great a variety of rocks in a small area as anywhere in the world, and Richard Fortey rolls back the skin of vegetation and buildings so as to lay bare the hidden landscape that has shaped our nation and its character. (In a typical aside he cannot resist quoting Catherine in Wuthering Heights: 'My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath - a source of little visible delight, but necessary'.) This is popular science at its best; it is beautifully written, constantly witty, and excellently illustrated. The language is certainly accessible to the layman. Consider, for instance, the tiny agnostids - 'Blows have been exchanged over the question whether agnostids are or are not really trilobites. They have been thought of as Cambrian parasites or, more plausibly, as Cambrian plankton . . . They changed through time, so just by looking at these little enigmatica the expert can tell what part of the Cambrian the fossils come from. This is practically useful in tracing correlative beds from one part of the country to another, or even throughout the world. Some of the same agnostids that lurk in the cliffs at St Davids's are found in Sweden, China, Australia, even Siberia. I once had a visitor from Kazakhstan whose command of English was rudimentary, but we got on perfectly well by merely exchanging smiles and the names of agnostids . . .' That illustrtes the style of an engaging book. There is no particular thesis: this is a journey around the British Isles, describing, explaining, analysing, digressing, making clear many things we may never have taken time to consider. The range of Fortey's enthusiastic scholarship seems limitless: he talks in passing about the quality of bottled mineral water, the Moine Thrust, the Loch Ness monster, cream teas, Gerard Manley Hopkins' 'dappled things', the 'grass of Parnassus' on Lindisfarne, DH Lawrence's ambivalent response to coalfields, the Cheshire salt industry and its origins, pargetting, the importance of Welsh slate and Portland stone for British architecture, the demise of truffle hunting, elephant fossils in East Anglia, the true extent of the Ice Age, the peat industry in the 14th-century Norfolk Broads, the nature of (real) amber, the link between churchwarden pipes and lip cancer, the fact that 'on the summit of Mount Everest there are Ordovician fossils really quite like those from North Wales' . . . And so on and so forth.</p>

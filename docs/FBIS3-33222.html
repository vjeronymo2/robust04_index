			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Alberto Briceno] </F>   [Text] Economy Minister Roberto Rojas has announced that  on 8 February the government contacted Jose Maria Figueres to  ask him his opinion on the free trade treaty negotiations with  Mexico.    By presidential order Rojas spoke with Figueres' economic  advisers in order to inform the Mexicans [of Figueres' views].  "The president-elect's position is very important to us because  he has made statements to the effect that he wants to reach an  agreement with the approval of the private sector, which has  been our policy," Rojas said.    On 9 February Rojas met with President Calderon and assured  him that he expected white smoke from the following week's talks  [with Figueres' advisers]. Calderon pointed out that with  Figueres' approval he will be able to guarantee his Mexican  counterpart, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, that the agreement will  be confirmed by the Legislative Assembly without any problem  whatsoever.    The agreement has been held back by farm-related  regulations,  specifically those that would give Costa Rican meat, sugar, and  milk access to Mexico's market of 90 million consumers.    On 11 February Luis Tellez, Mexico's Assistant Secretary of  Agriculture, is expected to arrive in Costa Rica, and on 14  February Rojas will travel to Mexico City to continue the  process with his counterpart, Jaime Serra Puche.    Rojas warned that agreements have already been reached on  issues such as intellectual property, investments, and a  well-balanced tariff package. Mexican producers will receive  the same protection given to Costa Rican producers. "We are  guaranteeing an active system to resolve any expropriations that  may emerge." In the industrial sector, he said, there is  consensus regarding the disproportional tariff system and a  temporary solution has been established through the original  regulations. The idea, he concluded, is to have products such as  textiles accepted as if they were local raw material from the  countries that signed the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA): United States, Mexico, and Canada.</p>

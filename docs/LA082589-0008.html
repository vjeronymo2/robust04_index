			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNION COVERAGE  </P> <P> I'm still unhappy with your story ("Unions' Future Questioned After Summer of  Setbacks," Aug. 15) on the AFL-CIO convention in Chicago. It presented a gloomy  view of organized labor's problems with, of course, some optimistic balance  from Lane Kirkland and the like.  </P> <P> Inexplicably, though the story rated a half-column on page 1 and a half-page  inside, it never mentioned the Beck decision (Communications Workers of America  vs. Harry Beck) by the Supreme Court last year, establishing the right of all  union members to withhold their dues from any union agenda relating to  political or social activities with which they disagree, while retaining full  union representation, pension and welfare benefits. This is the single most  significant event in the American labor movement in 50 years. It's a dark  thunderhead looming over the future of the AFL-CIO.  </P> <P> The Writers Guild strike last year, one of the longest (five months) and most  bitter in the history of the film industry, collapsed a few weeks after the  Beck decision, when a dozen major writers threatened to claim limited . . .  membership under its terms. Beck ended mandatory union solidarity as a  condition of employment. Because of this, I predict there will never be another  major strike in the film industry.  </P> <P> It's widely suspected among union activists that the media are participating in  a conspiracy of silence on the Beck decision. ("If we don't report it, it  didn't happen, it doesn't exist.") Your coverage of this story supports that  unsavory conclusion. The Times is one of the nation's major newspapers. Don't  you think you should cleanse your reputation on this issue?  </P> <P> CHARLTON HESTON  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

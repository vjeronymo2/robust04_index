			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHATTERING PERCEPTIONS ABOUT RAPE  </P> <P> Dianne Klein's Commentary, "Shattering the Silence on Rape" (May 24), was  outstanding. Again, however, an "authority" on rape has alluded to men's  insensitivity to rape victims by stating, and thereby reinforcing, the  perception that, "a lot of men are . . . very uncomfortable talking about rape  . . . see the woman as having been dirtied . . . it was her fault . . . they  are damaged goods."  </P> <P> I am offended by (counselor) Marlene Phillips' statement.  </P> <P> I state categorically that among my friends and acquaintances, with men whom I  meet while traveling or socially, I have yet to hear a man describe a rape  victim in terms other than those of sorrow, frustration, sympathy; the  perpetrator as anything but an SOB; and the act as anything but pure,  unadulterated savagery.  </P> <P> While I'm on the subject: In 30 years as a police officer, I have never seen an  officer regard the victim of a rape except as the victim of the most horrendous  crime, short of murder. Believe it or not, policemen do take their badges off.  And when they do, they become fathers of daughters, husbands of wives and  brothers of sisters.  </P> <P> JOHN A. McALLISTER  </P> <P> Deputy Chief, Los Angeles Police Department (Ret).  </P></p>

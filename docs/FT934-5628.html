			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Markets: Why Japan isn't a bargain - yet - Global Investor Just how much worse does the outlook for Japan have to get before the pessimism is overdone and the country starts to look like a bargain? The economic statistics due out this week - unemployment, car registrations, maybe third-quarter GDP - will provide one answer. But there is also a simpler, more cynical answer: it depends on when the government starts buying. The ferocious bear squeeze of summer 1992, instigated to prop up the banking system and burn the fingers of westerners who believed the market had further to fall, shows just how rapidly the stock market can move when the government is determined to push it upwards. Then, the Nikkei index went from about 14,000 to nearly 19,000 in a matter of weeks. In the past month, the Nikkei has fallen almost as fast as it rose then. It closed on Friday at 16,726.4, only 17 per cent higher than its low point of August 1992. The speed of the decline owes something to the decision to replace the 225-share index with a more modern Nikkei 300, a move intended to make it harder to manipulate the index by dealing in the illiquid stocks that formed a high proportion of its contents. With no reason to hold these stocks, their price has plunged, driving the index down faster. Still, that is only part of the story. The broader Topix index has also fallen - down 15 per cent in the past month - a reflection of the crisis of confidence that has engulfed the Japanese markets as it has become clear that the economy has taken a further downward turn. The underlying economy is certainly suffering: J P Morgan is forecasting continuing contraction in the Japanese economy until midway through next year and no better than sluggish growth until at least the end of 1995. Corporate profits continue to slide. Falling share prices should make companies look cheap, but the drop in profits keeps price/earnings ratios at levels well above those in other developed countries. Though companies continue to stress the need for cost cuts, they have not yet embarked on wholesale restructuring. From that point of view, Japan does not yet look like a bargain. Still, perceptions could change rapidly if the market started to move decisively upwards, under the stimulus of sustained government-led buying. So when will the government intervene? And will it work as well this time as it did in 1992? There are two possible reasons why the government has held back from propping up the market. One is that it sees no need to as yet: though the Nikkei is within striking distance of its 1992 lows, the Topix index is still comfortably above them; it would need to fall another 22 per cent before it entered last year's danger zone. And last year's intervention had a specific purpose: to prop up the banks by preserving the value of their big holdings of securities. For most of this year, with their Basle capital-adequacy ratios safely met, fear about the banks has lessened. Perhaps a resurgence of concern about the banks, intensified by last week's poor results, will again produce a desire to prop them up. The second possible reason for the government's failure to encourage stock market support may well be more significant: political paralysis. The new coalition government may not share the belief of its predecessors in intervention to prop up financial markets; or tensions between the bureaucrats and their new political masters may be preventing decisive action. If the policy log-jam breaks, government-inspired buying will probably be able to generate a new rally. As last year, this could be very substantial, especially if it coincides with further easing of monetary policy and a fresh commitment to stimulatory fiscal policy in 1994. It will prove no more sustainable than last year's stock market recovery, however, until there are clear signs of a double Japanese restructuring: a shift of the economy towards deregulation and domestic consumption; and a shift on the part of companies towards profits rather than revenue growth. One important imminent test of the first of those restructurings will be public reaction to the secret deal to open part of the rice market to imports, to be announced - so Japanese newspapers were saying over the weekend - around December 10. Trend Two indicators that financial markets are starting to get above themselves: a brand-new Ferrari being delivered to an address in the City of London earlier this month; and the comment of a Swiss banker last week. 'People are getting greedy,' he said. The investment managers who work for him 'think they are heroes, when all they are doing is following a trend.' Indicators The Bundesbank meets on Thursday, accompanied by a clutch of economic indicators - German unemployment figures, manufacturing output, and new orders. The year ahead is stuffed with German elections: including local, regional, European parliament, presidential and federal parliament elections, there are 20 due in 1994. Add this much political uncertainty to the growing belief that 1994 could be a year of further economic contraction, and further cuts in German interest rates seem inevitable. Traditionally, Germany only starts to emerge from recession when the yield curve is positively sloped - that is, when short-term interest rates are lower than long-term ones. Short-term rates are currently at 6 1/4 per cent, and long-term rates are nearly half a point lower. So, no recovery in sight yet. Will it take a recovery in the German economy to push smaller European stocks ahead of their larger counterparts? As the chart shows, the relative outperformance of smaller and medium-sized European shares ended at the beginning of 1992 and has yet to reappear. The chart is slightly misleading, however: second-tier British stocks have outperformed their blue-chip rivals, an effect masked by the relative underperformance of smaller companies on the continent. The German industrial production and manufacturing output numbers, due out towards the end of the week, will give an indication of how Germany's export-oriented manufacturing heartland is doing. Though the biggest German companies are making heavy weather of their restructuring, their smaller compatriots do not face the same political scrutiny and have far less opportunity to delay the moment of decision. If second-tier German businesses are indeed responding urgently to the economic pressures they face, their share prices will in time start to respond. Evidence From an international investor's viewpoint, the contents of Kenneth Clarke's UK Budget this week are probably of less importance than the growing evidence that the Bank of England is acquiring a flavour of autonomy. A truly independent central bank becomes so because of the attitudes and expectations of its leaders, the political classes and the electorate, not because of the nominal powers entrusted to it by law. It is not clear what the electorate thinks, but the new team at the Bank obviously believes independence is a state of mind - and the politicians are willing to give them some room to exercise it. Deficit A country with a truly independent central bank - Switzerland - is at last about to see a return to its traditional low inflation. Though Swiss inflation was still around 3 1/2 per cent in October, the November figure should drop to around 2 1/2 per cent and, says Hans Kaufman of Bank Julius Bar in Zurich, it will drop below 1 1/2 per cent next year. The growing government deficit has created a peculiar situation: the government bond issue is yielding 4.14 per cent, while the average yield on issues from private-sector Swiss corporations is only 4.12 per cent. That unfavourable spread helps explain the need for Switzerland's new VAT, approved by the voters yesterday. The shift from a sales tax will help exporters, such as the pharmaceuticals and engineering companies, and hurt service businesses, including the banks, which will now have to charge VAT on their portfolio management services.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total return in local currency to 25/11/93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              % change over period                US     Japan   Germany    France     Italy       UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week         0.06      0.05      0.12      0.13      0.17     0.11 Month        0.27      0.21      0.55      0.57      0.73     0.49 Year         4.00      3.59      7.69      8.94     13.44     6.69  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week        -0.18      0.87      0.08     -0.20     -1.10    -0.10 Month       -0.69      1.45      1.01      0.32     -1.62     0.73 Year         9.75     10.82     12.94     16.73     24.74    11.89  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week        -0.98      0.42     -0.27     -0.29     -2.30     0.59 Month       -1.93      1.57      0.43     -0.37     -3.06     0.76 Year        13.76     13.02     16.51     22.23     32.38    17.41  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week         -0.3      -5.1      -1.8      -1.2      -2.0     -0.8 Month        -0.3     -11.1      -1.1      -3.6     -10.3     -2.5 Year         10.2      15.5      37.1      30.6      32.5     21.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Best performing stocks from FT-A World Indices in local currency to 25/11/93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           % change                               Close     Week    Month      Year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bandar Raya Dev.

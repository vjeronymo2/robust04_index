			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Colonial Rule Is Going To End"] </F>   [Text] There are still people who, in their flights of  fancy, want to continue colonialism in an alternative form and a  surrogate colonial rule with which to resist the return of the  sovereignty over a land to its sovereign state when, globally,  colonialism is on its way out. Britain is producing a Hong Kong  version of "sunset imperial power" in a vain attempt to preserve  its political and economic interests in Hong Kong. It signed  the Sino-British Joint Declaration, committing itself to  cooperating and negotiating with China on the handover of  political powers and a smooth transition in the latter half of  the transition period. However, after he came to Hong Kong,  Chris Patten reneged on the promise, refused to cooperate and  negotiate as required by the provisions of Annex II, set up his  own agenda, and deliberately created a situation which is not  going to converge with the Basic Law. The presentation of  Patten's package to the Legislative Council [Legco] shows that  the British have determinedly turned their back on convergence  and cooperation.    Premier Li Peng responded firmly to Britain's attempt to  continue its rule in his Government Work Report to the National  People's Congress [NPC]: "Britain's colonial rule over Hong  Kong is going to end. This is something no force can resist."  "Whatever the twists and turns, the Chinese Government and  Chinese people are determined and capable of restoring  sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintaining its long-term  stability and prosperity."    The phrase demonstrates the solemn position of the Chinese  government. What Britain is now pursuing in Hong Kong is  colonial rule. This is a fact. If Britain is sincere in  implementing the Joint Declaration and pursuing friendly  cooperation, its interests thereby reside in the joint  declaration. However, since Britain has refused to cooperate,  naturally it has to be responsible for the consequences that  flow from the refusal.    Colonialists do not have any political, legal, or moral  right to dictate the future of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] or to continue its influence and  extend its terms of rule by doing what is properly the SAR  Preparatory Committee's work, that is, organizing the first  government and legislature for the SAR. The Chinese Government  will work firmly in accordance with the Joint Declaration.  Britain's colonial rule over Hong Kong has to end. The council  founded on the Letters Patent and Royal Instructions will die "a  natural death" when the hour strikes. On 1 July 1997, China  will restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong and the councils  erected on Patten's package will end on the same day. China  will form the first government, legislature, and the two  municipal councils in accordance with the Basic Law and NPC  resolutions. This is a changeover of sovereignty, not a change  of government within a country. The Joint Declaration announced  long ago that colonial rule would end. Nobody can resist this  historical progress.    Before Patten's package was presented to the Legco, there  was  still a possibility of the convergence of the political systems.  The Chinese Government still hoped that Britain would repent but  Britain pushed the matter beyond the point of no return by  presenting Patten's package to the Legco; there will not be  cooperation in the transition of the political system and China  does not entertain any illusions about Britain. China will not  do anything useless. Since there is no possibility of  cooperation, China can only open an effective road toward  restoring sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintaining Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability.    The Chinese people are blessed with the courage of not being  daunted by difficulties or rugged terrain. If the Chinese  Government wants to restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong, it  will have the ability, together with Hong Kong citizens, to  achieve a smooth transition and form the SAR government and  legislature to enable Hong Kong's prosperity and stability to  continue. By pretending to enter into negotiations Britain has  wasted China's valuable time for arranging for the SAR. Premier  Li Peng's discourse in his government work report on the problem  of Hong Kong indicated that the Chinese Government will count on  the power of the Chinese people and rising national power,  intensify and speed up the Preliminary Work Committee work,  unify Hong Kong compatriots on a broad basis, and successfully  pursue the early-phase preparations for the SAR government and  legislature with one mind and through joint efforts. This  historic task must see results before 1996. The Preparatory  Committee must be created in 1996 to ensure that the political  powers are effectively taken over.    The government work report is a great encouragement for all  patriotic and Hong Kong-loving people. The Hong Kong people  will not let their motherland down and will do their best to  make the establishment of the SAR a glorious chapter in their  history. Britain's attempt to resist China's restoring its  sovereignty over Hong Kong will end in total failure.</p>

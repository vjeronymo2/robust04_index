			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Hewlett-Packard Co.: The Palo Alto computer and scientific instrument maker's  third-quarter profit fell 3% from a year ago to $187 million, reflecting the  acquisition of Apollo Computer Inc. and continuing problems predicting demand  for its products, the firm said. Without the $476.4-million acquisition of  Apollo, profit would have risen 15%, the firm said. Revenue, helped by an  increase in orders, rose 23% to $3 billion.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Potsdam (DDP/ADN): The first direct satellite link  in the civilian sector between Brandenburg and Russia went into  operation today. A 2.5 metre dish in Golm on a building of  Potsdam University is connected to the Dubna nuclear research  institute near Moscow. The institute in Dubna will have access  to international scientific networks via the Potsdam link. The  Institut fuer ComputerIntegriertes Engineering (CoIn) [Institute  of computer-integrated engineering] in Potsdam is involved on  the German side. EuroDATA Berlin, which established the  communications needs of both sides on behalf of the state of  Brandenburg, provides the service. Both the Dubna institute and  the satellite project are supported by the Federal Research  Ministry.    Presently, 64,000 bits per second can be transmitted.  According to the Brandenburg Transport Ministry, the system is  to be expanded technically and related systems for links to Kiev  and Minsk added to it. Scientists will thus gradually have  better opportunities for exchanging data and pictures, and using  future systems they will be able to hold video conferences.</p>

The Munich-based Eurofighter consortium said no date had  been  fixed for the flight, which was postponed last autumn because of  difficulties with the jet's computerised flight-control system.  But the aircraft was in its "last test phase."    The first prototype of the twin-engine Eurofighter 2000  being  developed jointly by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, is due  for trials at Manching in Germany in the next few weeks. An  initial private flight is expected at Manching in March or April  before it appears in public. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence  procurement minister, has told the Commons that the fighter  might be on display at September's Farnborough air show.    Although the industry consortium has played down the  importance of the first flight in the overall development  programme, senior managers are extremely anxious to avoid  further delay, fearing it could undermine political support for  the Eurofighter and jeopardise production prospects.    British Aerospace, the principal UK partner, has meanwhile  agreed to take joint responsibility for the flight-control  system with Deutsche Aerospace, which has headed this part of  the project. The new arrangement is designed to make the two  directly answerable to the partner governments and put pressure  on them and their sub-contractors -- notably GEC-Marconi which  is supplying the crucial software -- to meet their contract  dates.    The partners decided to hold further tests on the system  after crashes of both the Swedish Gripen and the U.S. F-22,  which also depend on sophisticated flight-control technology.    The consortium is still in talks with government  representatives over a new contract price for the roughly 10  billion pound development programme. This follows changes to  the programme agreed in late 1992 which were designed to reduce  the eventual production cost.    The companies are seeking price increases to reflect the  longer development period now planned. On the other hand the  governments hold the consortium responsible for delays caused by  technical hitches.    The Ministry of Defence would have to seek Treasury approval  for any increase in Britain's share of the cost.</p>

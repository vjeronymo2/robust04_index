Speaking to reporters accompanying him today, he reiterated that  it was necessary to form a completely new party through  unification of the ruling to establish a two-party system under  which changes of power become possible.    Foreign Minister Hata said: There are moves toward forming a  new party or political alliance in the Diet. But while seeking  appropriate ways to deal with elections to be held under the new  electoral system, it is necessary to form a new political group  to compete with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP].    His comments indicate he believes it is necessary to unify  the ruling parties to establish a two-party system.    He was asked what he thought of the view, held by members of  different parties within the government, that Prime Minister  Hosokawa should lead any such new party.    He said: I have no objection to this idea because the prime  minister is in charge of the government now.    As the deadlock in Diet interpellations is becoming  prolonged, support is growing for the possibility of dissolving.  Commenting on this, Hata said: Our task is to establish a  political system which reflects people's opinions through the  new electoral system. We are not in the position of needing to  dissolve the Diet in the face of a host of domestic and foreign  relations problems.    His comment showed he did not want the Diet dissolved under  the current electoral system.</p>

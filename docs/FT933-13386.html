			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Global agreements 'will hit food supply' - Report sees big companies roaming the world in hunt for cheap produce ATTEMPTS to reach global agreement on trade and tariffs will not make the world's food supply more secure and are likely to jeopardise the environment, according to a review of world trade published today, Press Association reports. Accords such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and regional food regimes like the European Community's agricultural policy are pushing the food trade in the wrong direction, it says. Food should be produced as close to where it will be consumed as possible, argues Mr Tim Lang, director of Parents for Safe Food, and Mr Colin Hines, co-ordinator of Greenpeace International's economics unit. In the review - The New Protectionism - they say global agreements simply promote a trend in the food trade for increasingly powerful companies and countries to roam the world looking for cheaper food supplies. 'This may benefit some consumers in the short term, but the world loses in the long term. Long-distance food should be the last resort, not the first.' Increased world trade, rather than local trade, means food routinely travelling the globe, when this should only happen in emergencies. Intensive production methods push out small producers, to the detriment of the environment. Starvation and plenty exist side by side, with Kenyan green beans flown by supermarkets to lighten British winter dinner tables, when there is starvation in nearby Mozambique. Orange juice is shipped from citrus plantations in Latin America when Greek oranges are being dumped. Consumers should be encouraged to eat more seasonal and locally grown foods where possible, the report adds. The New Protectionism, published by Earthscan, 120 Pentonville Road, London N1 9JN.

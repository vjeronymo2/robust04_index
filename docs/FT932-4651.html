			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: TCI enters Japanese cable TV market THE WORLD'S largest cable television operating company, Telecommunications (TCI) of the US, is entering the Japanese cable TV market via an investment in a unit of Sumitomo Corp, the Japanese trading house. TCI is taking an 18 per cent stake in Cable Soft Network, a supplier of cable TV programmes serving Japan's 160 cable TV operators. It is currently 100 per cent-owned by Sumitomo. The investment, which will cost TCI about Y300m (Dollars 2.8m), reflects growing interest in the budding Japanese market from US cable TV companies. It follows a deal by Time Warner Entertainment Japan - 50 per cent-owned by Time Warner of the US; 25 per cent by Toshiba; and 25 per cent by C Itoh, the trading house - to provide technical assistance to a cable TV operator based in Fukuoka, in southern Japan. TCI's investment in CSN will provide Sumitomo with valuable marketing and operations management expertise. The Japanese cable TV market is still in its infancy compared with the US market. CSN, for example, was only founded in 1989, while TCI started in 1955. The US cable TV company serves more than 10m customers in 49 states, while the entire Japanese market is estimated to be only about 700,000 households. However, the deal will provide TCI with an early entry into a small, but growing, market. The forecast for the year to March 1994 is for cable TV in Japan to reach 1m households. The deal will also expand TCI's global interests. It already has interests in 17 franchise areas in the UK to provide both cable and telephone services in partnership with US West, the telecommunications group. Time Warner said although it was interested in Japanese cable TV, it had no specific plans yet to enter that market.</p>

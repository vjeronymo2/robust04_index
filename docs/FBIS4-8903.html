			<p>BFN     [Text] Janez Jansa, president of the Social Democratic  Party [SDSS], today explained the reasons that his party left  the government coalition. Robert Skerjanc reports from the news  conference:    [Begin recording] [Skerjanc] The SDSS president, Janez  Jansa, for this anticipated decision of the party council, put  forward three basic reasons for why the party's presidency  proposed that the SDSS leave the coalition:    [Jansa] The first reason is a gross violation of the  coalition agreement, not merely in this latest case when the  prime minister proposed my replacement, but gross violation of  the coalition agreement from December onwards. The second  reason for our departure from the coalition and this decision is  a fact that the work of the majority in the coalition and the  government was geared to the creation of conditions that not  only did not prevent corruption, but created circumstances that  actually facilitated it. The third reason for our departure from  the coalition is entirely political, namely, the balance of  power has changed following the unification, that is to say,  merger or drowning of the Democrats, the Eco-Greens, and the  Socialists into this big Liberal Democracy.    [Skerjanc] The party council yesterday also made an  important decision by which it authorized the party presidency  and its president to start negotiations with the Slovene  Peoples' Party, the Christian Democrats, and the Greens of  Slovenia, or, if the Christian Democrats will not leave the  coalition, the National Democrats, about the formation of a wide  political coalition whose aim would be a democratic and socially  and morally just Slovenia.    The coalition plans to appear seriously at the local  elections. In case the Slovene Christian Democrats would leave  the coalition, the SDSS also sees the need to hold extraordinary  parliamentary elections, which could be organized simultaneously  with the local elections.    Jansa also spoke about the anti-corruption rally scheduled  for tomorrow. He said that the Christian Democratic Party took  part in its organization too, which is, according to him, a good  omen for future negotiations about the joint coalition. [end  recording]</p>

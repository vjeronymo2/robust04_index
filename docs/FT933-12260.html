			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Brooke bites back - Off The Wall IS THE game up for the Arts Council? Is Heritage Minister Peter Brooke attempting to achieve by stealth what his predecessor, David Mellor, failed to pull off by force? In a remarkably honest moment, Mellor wondered what was the fun in being paymaster to the arts if you could not decide how the money was spent. Brooke, an ingrained politician, would never be so blatant. This week he gave a ringing affirmation to the arm's length principle. He scrapped most of the report into the Council's operations that he had paid Price Waterhouse Pounds 60,000 to produce. Yet behind the affirmation of faith in the Council there were glimpses of steel. Brooke wants the Council to be more accountable; he stressed that there would be occasions when he could act as the conduit for public and political opinion. And he drew attention to the disquiet expressed by MPs at the prospect of the Arts Council withdrawing its grants to 10 regional theatre companies. The less than subtle hint was that the Council should think again about cutting its money for drama by Pounds 1m, or 3.5 per cent, next year. Anthony Everitt, secretary general of the Council, is still holding firm that the Council must take strategic decisions, must back winners and punish losers, must encourage the cutting edge of the arts, which it currently sees as contemporary dance and the visual arts, at the expense of regional theatres. But behind the scenes there could be some back tracking. The drama panel, many of whom were against the cuts, is looking again at the matter. It must apparently save the money from somewhere, but there are alternatives to threatening the theatres at Plymouth, Greenwich, Hammersmith, Watford, Oldham, Coventry and the Bristol Old Vic, among others, with possible closure. It could cut 3.5 per cent from its grants to all drama clients. Project funding could be halted. The theatres might be encouraged to survive by the Council financing visits to them by touring companies to make good the loss of their home-created productions. Then, the government may decide not to go ahead with its projected cut of Pounds 5m in the Council's grant next year, which would take away most of the pressure on drama. As usual in the arts, compromise, wheeler dealing and procrastination are back on the agenda. The most likely scenario is that having shown the Arts Council who holds the purse strings, Brooke will allow it to continue with its apparent autonomy. He might even give back some of the Pounds 700,000 he wants the Council to come up with in savings by October. In return the Council will not create a scandal by hitting well-loved theatre companies. One thing seems certain: by choosing a time of reduced budget to switch money between arts forms, the Council has played into the government's hands. The Council, not the government, appears to be the spoiler of the arts. Of course if this was an election year the government would restore its planned cuts and claim the credit for rescuing the arts. But this is not  -yet - an election year.                           *       *       * Few industries are as bolshie, back biting and temperamental as the pop record business, so the success of the Mercury Music Prize last year was a surprise. This was designed to uncover the best British album of the year and it gave generally lacklustre album sales a definite shot. The winners, the Scottish band Primal Scream, added 30,000 to sales, pushing its album Screamadelica above the 100,000 mark, as well as picking up a Pounds 20,000 prize. From an entry of over 120 albums the judges this year have come up with a controversial list of 10 to fight for a Pounds 25,000 prize. They have cocked a snook at the big record companies. There is nothing from EMI, Warners or BMG on the short list; no mention of nominated albums by Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, or Paul McCartney. Artists in the frame are New Order, Apache Indian, Sting, Suede, Stan Tracey, Dina Carroll, Gavin Bryars, The Auteurs, PJ Harvey and Stereo MC. Suede have been made the obvious favourite, but a flutter on outsider Apache Indian, which fuses Indian Bhangra music with Jamaican Ragga, might be productive.                           *       *       * The Mercury Prize is commendable in giving a boost to lesser-known artists who might have something to offer the public. Can the same be said of the Turner Prize, which also produced a short-list this week for the Pounds 20,000 it will hand out on November 23 to the British artist under 50 who produced the best exhibition of the past year? Two of the four, the two British-born, have not actually shown in the UK. Hannah Collins, who blows up photographs and prints them on canvas, lives in Barcelona, while Rachel Whiteread, a 1992 nominee who makes casts of commonplace objects, works in Berlin. The Laotian Vong Phaophanit, an installation artist, has lived in the UK for eight years and showed at the Serpentine. Irish-born Sean Scully did have a Waddington exhibition this year. The Turner judges have put themselves in a ridiculous position. Scully, a painter of the Mark Rothko stripey-colour-abstract school, stands head, shoulders, and waist-line above the others in terms of achievement, status, and contribution to art. He is an artist of international stature; the others are flavours of the month. It would be appalling behaviour to short-list him and then pass him over. And it would be nice for a painter to win the Turner: it has not happened since Howard Hodgkin in 1985. Of course Scully mostly lives and works in the US, but that is just a reflection on the lack of British interest in contemporary art - a lack of interest that the Turner has done little to redress.</p>

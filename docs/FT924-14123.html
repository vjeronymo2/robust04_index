			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / The Monday Interview: Enduring symbol of stability - Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, talks to Robert Graham In a country where intrusive journalism thrives, one institution and one figure have remained above the fray - the Bank of Italy and its governor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. The mystique, close to reverence, surrounding the bank and its 71-year-old governor endures in spite of Italy's bruising experience on the currency markets in recent weeks. The lira was forced to devalue by 7 per cent on September 13 and four days later to begin floating outside the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). Mr Ciampi was the leading advocate of the 'strong lira' policy, which placed the currency within the narrow fluctuation band of the ERM. But this policy was based on the premise that Italy had to put its public finances in order. The governor has emerged from the crisis with his prestige intact because he has been powerless to control fiscal policy, as he has never ceased to remind the politicians during his 13 years as governor. His speech at the bank's annual meeting in May now looks prophetic. Urgent measures, he said, had to be taken within 'a matter of weeks' to keep the lira stable within the ERM. With the studied caution of an intensely private person Mr Ciampi says: 'The crisis that emerged last month could have been avoided if the member states had grasped the opportunity provided by the German-Italian proposal of September 12 for a general realignment - within the bounds set by an appreciation of the D-Mark and equal depreciation of the lira, coupled with a decrease in interest rates in Germany. 'Unfortunately the realignment was limited to the lira/D-Mark exchange rate, so that the accompanying reduction in German rates was only small. This left plenty of scope for the markets to mount further speculative attacks against other currencies.' This is not simply wisdom with hindsight. In private Mr Ciampi scarcely conceals a great sense of disappointment, even bitterness, that an opportunity was missed and for which both Italy and other members such as Britain paid dearly. On the weekend of September 12-13 Italy and Germany were the sole countries to discuss realignments in face-to-face meetings, he points out. Discussions with other members were done over the telephone, which, Mr Ciampi says, was not the best way of breaking down the resistance of other European Community members to a more general realignment. The Italians also pressed in vain for a convening of the EC's monetary committee during that weekend, although by the following Wednesday the committee was convened at even shorter notice to endorse the suspension of sterling and the lira from the ERM. Mr Ciampi is convinced that the Bundesbank would have reduced interests rates by more than a quarter of a percentage point on September 14 if the realignment had not been limited to Italy's devaluation. Indeed, he knows German culture well, having studied German literature at university at Pisa and having established a close relationship with Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president. The governor does not advocate significant changes in the ERM to resolve the problems that have emerged recently. 'The crisis is not the result of shortcomings in the system, but rather of the unwillingness of countries to implement - as the rules actually require - closer and more effective economic and monetary co-ordination.' In other words it is the application of the rules which has been faulty. Recent events have not undermined the Maastricht treaty, he argues. Indeed, they have only cast doubt on its 'gradualist' timetable towards European union. 'The crisis has clearly revealed the difficulty of maintaining orderly conditions for five or seven years during the advance towards the third stage of monetary union. The process needs to be accelerated (towards an institutional arrangement with a single monetary policy).' Mr Ciampi is an ardent supporter of closer European integration and believes Italy has to be fully part of this process; hence Italy's commitment to re-enter the ERM as soon as possible. To achieve this he turns to the politicians, saying budget proposals to tackle the huge public sector deficit must be approved and 'resolutely implemented'. But here he finds himself and the bank in a curious position. The Bank of Italy, through its carefully guarded independent status, can take decisions in monetary policy and foreign exchange matters. The government, however, is hampered by a cumbersome bureaucracy and a fragmented political process which creates long delays before fiscal policies are implemented. The government's difficulties in enacting a 1993 budget, which may take until the end of November to approve, are creating considerable uncertainty in the markets. Mr Ciampi is one of the main proponents of a European Community stand-by loan to sustain international confidence in the Italian economy and help repay loans extended by the Bundesbank to support the lira. The proposal is now under discussion. Despite the depletion of reserves, he insists that Italy is in a position to honour all its obligations contracted with the Bundesbank and the Belgian central bank during recent weeks. And he is adamant that Italy's gold reserves will not be touched. In making such assurances, there can be no doubt that Mr Ciampi has past experience to draw on, having seen 11 devaluations of the lira during his tenure as governor. 'The moments of greatest tension in the markets have passed,' he says. He started out life intending to be a naval officer, a natural profession for someone born in the port of Livorno. Though he was invalided out of the service because of problems with his eyes, he smatters his conversation with nautical metaphors and sounds very much like a naval officer in describing his philosophy: 'It is necessary to hold steady, avoid over-hasty decisions and provide the liquidity (to the financial system) that is required while pursuing a rigorous monetary policy.' But he is well aware that this will not be enough to satisfy the financial markets and reassure investors. 'It is crucial that uncertainty and doubt be eliminated; investors' fears that constraints will be imposed on government securities are out of place, as is concern that the freedom of capital movement will be restricted. The public debt will continue to be managed according to the rules of the free market.' Mr Ciampi will not be drawn on what sort of parity the lira might re-enter the ERM or the precise timing of such a move. But he says: 'The depreciation of the lira that has occurred in the absence of ERM obligations is far in excess of any reasonable estimate of the need to improve the price competitiveness of Italian industry.' By the end of last week the markets bore out this view of the overshoot in the floating rate, with the lira recovering to L880 against the D-Mark, compared with L1,000 in earlier trading. Devaluations, Mr Ciampi says, rarely solve problems; rather they underline the previous failure to solve them and make their resolution even more urgent. This is a message he hopes will be understood by the politicians. His relations with the government of Mr Giuliano Amato are good, and there is agreement on where the dividing line lies between political decision-making and the role of the bank. This has been important in co-ordinating positions over the past month since ultimately the decision for Italy to realign was a political one. So too will be the decision on ERM re-entry. Such co-ordination was not always evident, notably with the previous government of Mr Giulio Andreotti - the governor and the former prime minister did not meet formally to discuss bank business for two years. Mr Ciampi is now beyond normal retiring age, and indeed has waived his salary and merely draws his pension. He claims he is ready to go whenever necessary, handing over a ship in perfect working order. But he has become such a symbol of institutional solidity that it is hard to see when such an opportunity will arise. It would be surprising if he was not in office when the Bank of Italy celebrates its centenary next year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1920 Born, Livorno.

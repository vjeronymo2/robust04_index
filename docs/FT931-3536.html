The 30 large estate agency companies covered by OCEA handle about half of UK house transactions. Last month they agreed 40,534 sales after taking account of cancellations. That was 11.2 per cent more than in February last year and the highest monthly total for at least 15 months. Net sales last month were 27 per cent higher than in the previous month. A sale is recorded only if finance has been arranged, solicitors have been instructed and no chain is involved, says OCEA, which started compiling sales figures in December 1991. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'These latest results are encouraging.

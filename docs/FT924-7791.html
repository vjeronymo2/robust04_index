			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Ozone layer shrinks to lowest level THE world's ozone layer dropped to its lowest levels in decades during 1992, the World Metereological Organisation (WMO) said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox, Environment Correspondent, writes in London. The evidence that ozone depletion was worse than predicted comes days before the start of a two week international convention in Copenhagen which intends to bring forward deadlines for phasing out ozone-damaging chemicals. The WMO, a United Nations agency, said that between January and March, average levels of ozone in the atmosphere above Moscow, Scandinavian capitals, cities in northern Germany and most of Britain were between 15 and 20 per cent below normal. It is feared that thinning of the protective layer could lead to an increase in human skin cancer and lower yields from farm crops. The WMO attributes this year's unusual thinness to continued use of man-made chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigerators, aerosols and cleaning fluids, and to natural chemicals thrown into the atmosphere by the volcanic eruptions last year. The Copenhagen conference, which starts on Tuesday, is expected to back phasing out CFCs by 1996, with provision for some exemptions, compared to the original deadline of 2000 set in the 1987 Montreal Protocol. Ozone thinning is a seasonal phenomenon which is affected by weather conditions, and the report says that during the past three weeks the Antarctic ozone 'hole' has been slowly shrinking. This week's meeting of signatories to the London Dumping Convention, a worldwide treaty governing dumping waste at sea, looked set to end last night with no resolution to the controversy over radioactive waste dumping.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Liang Kuo-jen (2733 0948 0088): </F> "Beijing Leadership Is Worried About Great Risk Resulting From  High-Speed Development, and Instructs Various Localities Not To  Overestimate the Risk-Enduring Capacity of the Public"]    [Text] Facing the present situation in which major reform  measures are expected to be put into effect one after another in  the new year, the Beijing leadership has already been aware of  the possible "high risks" resulting from efforts to speed up  reform and development. Recently, the central authorities  issued a document to all localities, instructing the leaders not  to overestimate the "risk-enduring capacity" of the public. At  a time when reform measures are being announced, all localities  are required to draw up emergency measures, "which may look  casual outwardly but strict inwardly," which aim at dealing with  shocks and contingencies which may break out any time. The  "Emergency Center" of the Central Bank is also "ready for  battle," preparing to cope with any unexpected changes in the  exchange market.    Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the State Planning Commission,  admitted that the panic purchases of grain in parts of China  since last November have served to prepare the public for future  price rises. He claimed that reform is not aimed at bringing  about a general rise in commodity prices, and the state will  take steps to stabilize prices.    Relevant sources have disclosed that China's four major  specialized banks, namely the Bank of China, the Industrial and  Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, and  the People's Construction Bank of China, has sent urgent cables  to their branches in all parts of the country, summoning  directors of all provincial- and regional-level branches to  attend a meeting in Beijing next week to discuss issues  concerning deepening reform and the anti-corruption struggle.  It has been learned that the major agenda of the meeting for  branch heads will be the possible impact produced by the  unification of the existing dual rate system of renminbi, as  well as the commercialization of specialized banks.    It has been noted that the Beijing leadership has showed  concern over the possible impact produced by the announcement of  a series of reform measures this year, and is also plagued by  unsatisfactory results of the anticorruption struggle which was  launched at an early time, for fear that all these may serve to  further impair the reputation of the government. In order to  prevent "a fine start and poor finish" for the anticorruption  campaign, the central authorities recently sent instructions to  all localities, warning that though they can tune down their  propaganda pitch a little, no localities are allowed to claim to  have attained "accomplishments at the present stage" of the  anti-corruption campaign, for only the CPC Central Commission  for Discipline Inspection has the right to say so. At present,  the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is carrying  out intensive investigations into several "super-large cases,"  yet at a very slow pace. The leadership cherishes the hope that  the cracking of several major cases can set off another upsurge  of the anti-corruption struggle and show all nationalities the  determination of the central authorities.  <H3>  The Central Bank Gets Prepared for Unexpected Changes, and  Sets the Bottom Line of the Exchange Rate at 10 to the Dollar </H3>   Sources have revealed that before it scrapped the dual-rate  currency system, the People's Bank of China (the central bank)  made full preparations for possible big ups and downs in the  exchange market when it began to float the yuan. Although  nothing serious happened during the first three days, the  24-hour emergency center (the duty room) still "maintains its  combat readiness." It has been learned that the leadership has  set the bottom line of the renminbi exchange rate at 10 to the  dollar, and once the exchange rate drops to this level, the bank  will strive to stabilize the rate with all necessary measures,  including selling U.S. dollars and resuming a number of  administrative methods previously in use.    Predictions show that the exchange rate of renminbi will  remain relatively stable before the Chinese New Year, mainly  because most foreign businessmen stationed in Beijing have  returned to their own countries for the Christmas holidays and  enterprise demands for foreign exchange are also relatively low.  After the Chinese New Year, however, along with the "rise of  temperature" of the entire economy, the exchange rate of  renminbi will go through real tests.    In recent days, an apparent rise has been registered in  Beijing's commodity prices; imported electric home appliances,  in particular, are often in short supply. Stories have it that  shortly after an advertisement for Sony brand electric home  appliances was published on the newspaper, citizens rushing to  the shop were surprise to find an increase of more than 10  percent over the advertised price; while prices of ordinary  Japan-made hi-fis also went up from over 4,000 yuan to over  5,000 yuan, registering an increase of more than 20 percent.  Prices of grain, oil, and some basic consumer goods remain  relative stable under state control.    It has been learned that when the policy of unifying dual  exchange rate was first announced, Foreign Exchange Certificates  (FEC) traded in Beijing at 1 to the yuan; though the rate later  rose to 1 to 1.45 yuan, FEC dropped again yesterday to 1 to 1.25  yuan. In the black market, people only want to buy, they do not  sell, U.S. dollars, for most people intend to buy U.S. dollars  for future use. The black market rate generally remains at  around 8.68 to the dollar in a recent period, similar to the  state swap rate. In Harbin City, center of Sino-Russian trade,  however, people are trading the yuan at 9 to the dollar. Rates  in coastal port cities, like Yantai and Weihai, are higher that  those in inland areas.</p>

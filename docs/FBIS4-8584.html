			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Edi Paloka: "Is the Greek Government </F> Responsible for the Crime in the South of Albania?"]    [Text] Albanian blood has been shed on Albanian soil by  Greek terrorists who wore the uniform of the Greek Army and who  vented their criminal venom in the Greek language.    Nothing can disgust an Albanian more than such a thing: A  foreigner violating your home and murdering in the night. Crime  disgusts everyone, especially a crime as ugly and macabre as  that of recent days. However, the Greek Government has reacted  to it in a peculiar way. In its first responses, it not only  failed to express sympathy for the victims, which in human terms  was the least it could do, but government spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos spoke about an Albanian "provocation." This shows not  only levity, but malice, especially at this time.    The progovernment Greek daily TA NEA did the same.    Meanwhile, a previously "unknown" group of Greek terrorists  has shouldered responsibility for the crime. However, Venizelos  seems not to be interested in this fact. In a way, the  terrorist group's claim to the crime frees the Greek Government  and Army of responsibility for organizing it. However, facts  testify to a group wearing Greek Army uniforms, carrying the  weapons of special units, and heading for a Greek border post.  Anybody could telephone the editorial board of a newspaper (in  this case ELEFTEROTHYPIA) and claim responsibility for this  crime in order to let off the true culprits. However, let us  suppose that this terrorist group exists and the government did  not organize the incident. Is the Greek Government responsible  for the crime? Venizelos' reply was that the Greek Government  bears no responsibility. It is easy to shirk responsibility in  a couple of words, but...    Despite attempts toward understanding, Albanian-Greek  relations have often undergone very fraught periods. Even  today, although the democratic Albanian Government makes every  effort to foster not only a calm but friendly atmosphere with  Greece, no such predisposition is apparent from the other side,  and serious incidents recur. One might ask what responsibility  the Greek Government bears for a crime committed by a group of  terrorists.    Does the Greek Government bear responsibility for public  statements issued by its members, such as the former minister  Sotiris Kouvelas? Is the Greek Government responsible when such  a creature as Sebastianos, who God knows why is called a priest,  has founded a radio station that does nothing but rant against  Albania and openly spread warmongering propaganda to its  neighbor?    Is the Greek Government responsible when it deceitfully  talks  of 400,000 members of the Greek minority in Albania and when it  issues bogus protests about alleged violations of the rights of  this minority, which lives better on Albanian soil than the  Albanians themselves?    Are all these things not a direct incitement to such crimes,  whether they are planned by "independent" terrorist groups or by  organized Greek military forces?    It is inexcusable for the Greek Government to maintain such  a  position, in such a serious situation in the Balkans, when any  incident could lead to a conflagration. The Greeks have already  come out as allies of the Serbs, but a EU member-state cannot be  allowed to behave with such a barbaric mentality.    Thousands of Albanians work in Greece today, but thousands  of  members of the Greek minority likewise work on Albanian soil.  These members of the minority cannot be used as Trojan horses,  because we are no longer in the era before Christ and the  Albanians are not besieged Trojans. The members of the Greek  minority came to Albania and worked the Albanian land they still  work today; Albanian kindness must therefore not be rewarded  with malice, as Greek political representatives have often done.    Under these conditions, the present Greek Government would  do  well to control its policies, in which it is lining up not only  alongside the Slavic heathens of Belgrade but against the whole  of Europe, and possibly setting off on a path fraught with  consequences for Greece and the Greek people themselves.</p>

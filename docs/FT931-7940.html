			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Arts: Don Pasquale/Turandot - Opera Patrick Mason's version of Donizetti's subtle comedy arrives at the Coliseum with clod-hopping coarseness from Opera North, for whom it was conceived with much of the same cast three years ago. Time has done nothing to mellow it or lend any discrimination to its relentless, elbow-nudging jokiness. Some of the excesses have apparently been trimmed back, but more than enough of the deadly gags remain to ensure that the production remains irredeemably vulgar and unperceptive. A fair proportion of the audience did laugh heartily at Friday's opening, but to me it seemed as glum an evening at a comic opera as one could have the misfortune to encounter. Early in the preparations for this staging the production team appears to have decided that Don Pasquale is so weak dramatically or musically, perhaps even both, that it needs all possible help to come alive on stage. If even this Donizetti agnostic can hear that the opera is both a fount of delightful music and a subtle and affectionate comedy of manners, one can wonder how that basic perception managed to escape Opera North and now ENO, which is proud to announce this as the company's first new Donizetti production for 25 years. Mason and his designer Joe Vanek set Don Pasquale in the Rome of the 1990s; Pasquale is a hard-nosed property developer, Ernesto a feckless yuppy, Norina a fashion-follower who runs a pavement kiosk. The updating works smoothly, but brings no fresh insight or perspective. Instead there are just added opportunities for feeble jokes, each one repeated several times, about gawping American tourists, Italian motor scooters, indolent house painters, bimbos from aerobics classes. The level of humour never rises above the obvious; most of it wouldn't be out of place in a Christmas pantomime, so that one half expects a song sheet to descend from the flies in the final scene. Musically, though, it does pass muster. Andrew Greenwood conducts with breezy efficiency, even if understandably in the circumstances he never seeks out the melodic buoyancy of the score. Within the parameters set for him Andrew Shore was again a model of comic timing and style; no depth is required of course, and his patter with Alan Opie's Malatesta was slick and expert. Adrian Martin was a plausible, full-toned Ernesto until his vocal line took him above the stave, when the sound became constricted. Best of all was Rosemary Joshua's Norina, entering fully into the spirit of the production, catching the double-takes with assurance and getting around her coloratura with aplomb. In a non-vintage season at ENO, Ms Joshua's deserved emergence as a principal is a precious highlight. English National Opera at the Lon- don Coliseum; performances until April 5.

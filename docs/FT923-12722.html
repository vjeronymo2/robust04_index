			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: RJR signs Russian cigarette venture RJ REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the large RJR Nabisco food and tobacco group, is to begin manufacturing cigarettes in Russia. The US group announced it had reached a partnership agreement with AS-Petro, a Russian cigarette manufacturer. It claims that this is the first large investment by a foreign company in a private cigarette enterprise in Russia. RJR said it would make a 'substantial investment' in new equipment for the factory, but disclosed no figures. It said that after the new machinery was installed, RJR-Petro's annual production capacity would rise to 22bn cigarettes, to make it Russia's largest cigarette producer. American-blend brands 'will be phased in as component sourcing is resolved'. The former Soviet Union is seen as one of the biggest potential new markets for US cigarette manufacturers, which face steadily declining demand in their home market. An acute cigarette shortage in Russia two years ago was eased by emergency imports from the West, but RJR estimated yesterday that an annual shortage of 100bn cigarettes still existed.</p>

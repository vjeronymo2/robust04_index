			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Letter: Life products should have statutory minimum cash surrender value Sir, I believe it is impossible to analyse the expenses of any organisation, other than the smallest of one-man-bands, without human judgments having to be made about the allocation of those expenses, and that the moment this happens any notion of absolute accuracy evaporates. It is, therefore, fruitless to waste time on such crudities as the 'expense ratios' which you published ('Hidden costs that can make life policies so expensive', February 22). In my view both the Association of British Insurers and Securities and Investments Board are chasing a mirage in striving for practical ways of disclosing 'expenses'. The satisfactory solution is to free the life and pensions industry from statutory disclosure of commission to intermediaries and the vain quest for an equivalent for life office employees and tied agents. Let the industry run its own affairs unhindered and make whatever remuneration and commission payments it wants, but exact a stiff quid pro quo by way of a statutory minimum cash surrender value formula applicable to all life and pension products. I would suggest that the secretary of state for trade and industry, acting on the advice of the government actuary, be empowered to determine the formula which should be: equitable to all parties; simple enough to be easily understood and remembered; tough enough to force any badly run life office really to discriminate in its recruitment of sales staff and in its choice of intermediaries with whom it will do business, while also not being intolerable to any rigorously run office. A tentative minimum cash surrender value formula might be: 'X per cent of all premiums paid, less Pounds Y if surrendered during policy year N', where X could be 80, 85, 90 and 95 for N 1, 2, 3 and 4 and all greater durations. Y could be a flat Pounds 100 for all durations, but since the value of money can change, the secretary for state would be empowered to alter Y as and when he thought fit. I would emphasise that any such formula would yield only a minimum value, allowing competition to produce higher values from the better-run offices, and should be applied to all life and pension contracts, without exception, written after an appointed day about two years hence. Judiciously chosen, such a formula could do much to eradicate the evil of the public being lumbered with inappropriate and unnecessarily expensive policies.

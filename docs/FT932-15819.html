			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Doubts on Reuters A presentation by Reuters' chief executive prompted some analysts to take a somewhat less enthusiastic view of shares in the electronic information group. Mr Peter Job, at a presentation late on Tuesday, cast doubt over the anticipated bonus to shareholders from the company's Pounds 700m cash mountain. He also said prices for some of the company's services would be held down for the next year. The media team at French-owned investment house SGST said it 'found no reason to change our view that the stock is expensive' and reiterated its sell stance at the morning meeting. The shares lost 15 to 1330p on turnover of 1.3m. British Petroleum's recent excellent run was halted in midsession when dealers picked up hints that the latest well, on its Cusiana project in Colombia, was dry. The oil field, discovered last year, is BP's biggest find since Forties, in the North Sea, and Prudhoe Bay. The Cusiana speculation pushed BP down to 302p before it closed only fractionally off at 306p. Turnover came to 7.9m. Lasmo came under renewed downward pressure as the series of post-results meetings with big institutional shareholders - many disillusioned by the results and dividend cut - continued. Lasmo eased 4 to 154p on 2.2m traded. Sun Alliance rose strongly ahead of today's preliminary figures, closing 12 higher at 354p, mostly reflecting a stock shortage, according to dealers. Analysts expect the group to reveal domestic mortgage indemnity losses of around Pounds 200m, leading to pre-tax losses of between Pounds 140m to Pounds 165m. GEC, boosted in recent weeks by a series of bullish broker circulars, delivered another strong performance, with SG Warburg said to have been one of the keenest supporters of the shares yesterday. They closed 6 up at a 10-year high of 323p on good turnover of 11m. A buy note from James Capel on Marks and Spencer was the highlight of a dull stores sector, although the stock saw an initial gain eroded to close only a penny firmer at 339p. Elsewhere, Kingfisher continued to respond to recent positive broker comments and added a penny at 581p. Dixons put on 2 at 210p after announcing the sale of its Supasnaps chain to Sketchley. Food retailers bore the brunt of negative comment over Tuesday's results from Tesco, with fears of a price war worrying some. Tesco shares tumbled, but managed to rally towards the end for a net loss of 3 at 229p. J. Sainsbury slipped 8 to 464p, Kwik Save 10 to 742p and Argyll 7 to 326p. One reason why the sector has been under a cloud was evident in figures from Nurdin &amp; Peacock with an upbeat view of the group's Club Warehouse concept, the US-style discount store scheme currently worrying food specialists. Together with good figures, this sent the shares forward 9 to 218p. A gloomy drinks sector was further clouded by a cautious statement from Heineken, the big Dutch brewer, which announced results yesterday. The group said the European drinks trade was 'one of stagnation without any likelihood of a substantial improvement in the short term'. Predictably, the worst casualties were stocks combining international exposure and famous brand names. Allied-Lyons fell 12 to 558p, Grand Metropolitan 8 to 418p and Guinness 14 to 464p. Hotel stocks stabilised, in spite of Savoy Group's report of losses for the first time in its history. The tightly traded Savoy, in which Forte owns 42 per cent of the voting rights, slipped just 2 to 738p. Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations. Forte shares defied continued talk of a dividend cut next week, and rumblings of a rights issue to fund any fire sale purchase at the suspended Queens Moat Houses, to rise 3 1/2 to 181p. Defence group Hunting closed 8 lower at 230p, after it surprised the market with a 2 for 9 rights issue to raise Pounds 36.8m, as it reported full year figures ahead of market expectations. British Steel remained under pressure and the shares eased 1 3/4 to 78p, as several brokers continued to urge investors to sell the stock. Analysts fear that demand for steel will continue falling. Turnover was 5.9m shares. The reduction of profit estimates by several brokers earlier this week continued to weaken BAA and the shares closed 9 lower at 779p. GKN gave up 7 to 449p, on worries concerning the weakness in the German economy previously a lucrative market for the company. A profits warning from dry cleaner Sketchley sent the shares falling sharply to close 14 lower at 96p. Accountancy practice worries continued to dog Morgan Crucible leaving the shares to fall 9 1/2 to 277 1/2 p.</p>

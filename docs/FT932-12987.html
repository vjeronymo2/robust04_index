			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Benchmarking gains ground BRITISH companies have turned to benchmarking in the past five years to measure their performance internally and against competitors, and 80 per cent of them believe it has been of benefit. These are two of the main findings of a report published today by the Confederation of British Industry, based on a Gallup survey for the CBI's national manufacturing council and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm. Gallup questioned 1,000 of the UK's largest companies - 50 per cent of them involved in manufacturing. Some 67 per cent of the companies claimed to be using benchmarking; more than 90 per cent said it acted as a catalyst for change and none felt it had been unsuccessful.

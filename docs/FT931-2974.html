			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rautaruukki kept in red by currency losses RAUTARUUKKI, the Finnish steel group, cut pre-tax losses to FM524m (Dollars 86.46m) in 1992 from FM926m a year earlier, but for the second year running it will pay no dividend. The group said a FM568m foreign exchange loss, following the markka devaluation, was the main reason it stayed in the red, but it also blamed higher interest payments and difficulties at its Transtech rolling stock subsidiary. Operating profit before depreciation nearly doubled to FM1.06bn from FM541m, amounting to 16 per cent of turnover which eased to FM6.51bn from FM6.85bn.</p>

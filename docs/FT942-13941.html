			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Leading Article: The good news from the IMF It would be foolish to judge the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook by its forecasts, which are virtually bound to be wrong. So a sensible reader would ignore the soothsaying and concentrate on the IMF's underlying story instead. This is not to say that the IMF's recent forecasting record has been all bad. A year ago it thought world output would expand by 2.2 per cent in 1993; in the event, it expanded by 2.3 per cent. But this excellent forecast did, as might have been expected, reflect offsetting errors. While world output may grow at 3 per cent in 1994 and 3.7 per cent in 1995, as the IMF foretells, there will almost certainly be a larger dispersion among individual performances than it suggests. The IMF's story is still the interesting part. A central element of it is the end of the recession of the early 1990s in industrial countries. The economies of the US, UK and Canada are all growing strongly. Those of Japan, Germany, Italy and France are bottoming out. The IMF argues that further reductions in short-term interest rates would help support recovery in Japan and the European continent 'without jeopardising reasonable price stability'. It also believes that interest rates are likely to fall in Europe. It is right on the first point and deserves to be proved right on the second. Sorely needed Encouragingly, inflation in industrial countries is at 'levels not seen for almost three decades'. The Uruguay Round has been completed, so setting the stage for further integration of the world economy via expanded world trade. In addition, there have been significant efforts at fiscal consolidation in a number of industrial countries. As a result, says the IMF, 'structural budget positions are projected to improve during the next few years'. Such efforts were sorely needed, given the earlier deteriorations in the fiscal positions of the US, Germany, France and the UK, and the dire position in Italy. Further afield, the positive feature of the world economy that stands out is the dynamic growth of Asian developing countries. Both in 1992 and 1993 the region's economic growth was over 8 per cent, led by the 13 per cent achieved by China in both years. This growth has become self-sustaining. Short of a depression or fierce protection, what happens in the industrial countries no longer determines the fate of many developing countries. One reason for this is the increase in the proportion of exports from developing countries going to one another, up from 30 per cent in the early 1980s to almost 40 per cent today. African decline Between 1984 and 1993, those developing countries with incomes per head that grew faster than the average for industrial countries saw their income per head rise at 5.7 per cent a year. These countries, which included China and India, also possess 68 per cent of the population of developing countries. Needless to say, the IMF would not be the IMF and the world would not be the world if there was no reason to worry. About 16.5 per cent of the population of developing countries lived in countries, many of them African, which suffered average annual declines in income per head of 1.2 per cent between 1984 and 1993. Again, a few former communist countries in transition are beginning to pull their economies round, but almost all the members of the former Soviet Union have chosen neither shock reform nor gradual reform, but no reform at all, with predictably dire results. Back in the industrial countries, European structural unemployment is frighteningly high, while effective policy to reduce it is hardly on the horizon. Yet what is needed is obvious, as two telling statistics show. The youth unemployment rate in France is 22 per cent. In Germany it is 4 per cent. France has high minimum wages for young workers and underdeveloped training programmes, while Germany has no minimum wage for young workers and an extensive apprenticeship system. Naturally, things never go well everywhere. But what has been going right should at least make it easier to deal with what has been going wrong. Policymakers must not be complacent, but they can at least take credit for things that have worked out.</p>

Mr. Musyoka  said this today while holding a conference with the visiting  foreign affairs subcouncil of the Transitional Executive Council  of South Africa at his office.    A representative of the council, Princess Stella Sigcau,  said  Kenya had supported the democratization process in her country.  She said the world was monitoring the election process in South  Africa and there was need for this process to be fair.    The delegation arrived in the country to assess the  possibilities of establishing a mission. They will visit other  parts of Africa and Middle East for the same purpose.    Earlier, Mr. Musyoka had met and held discussions with the  Saudi Arabian ambassador to Kenya, Mr. Ibrahim al-Sallum.</p>

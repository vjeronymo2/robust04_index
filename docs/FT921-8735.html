			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Property: A Portland life in miniature A NEWLY re-marketed property in repossession offers car fanatics the opportunity of a marble-floored double garage, plus home, just off Portland Place, London W1. The vast houses on Portland Place itself were too large for all but the grandest of families, even from the time they were built. Fortunately, they provided impressive homes for the country's war heroes in the years after 1778, when Robert and James Adam started laying out the street. The military bias long out-lasted those early generals and admirals who had won 'a nation's gratitude' - and often substantial state pensions - for their efforts in the continental wars. Even at the beginning of this century Field Marshall Lord Roberts could have gathered a quorum of the Army General Staff to his Portland Place house by sending a runner. These days any such call would show how the road has become institutionalised. Embassies and institutes now fill the street-front houses, leaving only the mews properties for the individual buyer. Duchess Mews, which takes its name from Margaret Harley, Duchess of Portland at the time of the development, is one among the jumble of surviving back streets that rarely fail to surprise visitors to London. Because no one got around to redevelop the backs of the grand houses, London is fortunate in having thousands of these freehold or near freehold houses in the heart of areas with otherwise severely restricted leaseholds. Aron Nakar, of Ellis &amp; Co's Regent's Park office (071-723-8955) explains that the 951-year leasehold on the mews house he is marketing in Duchess Place reflects an overlap of basement areas with a neighbouring building. 'The only reason that it is not freehold is that space.' The Grade II-listed, three bedroom, three bathroom house, pictured above, has been on offer for more than a year. As new agents, Ellis &amp; Co has agreed a price cut with the mortgagee and Aron Nakar reports bargaining interest around the asking price of Pounds 400,000. The large floorspaces that come with these former stable buildings give a big drawing/dining room and scope, downstairs, for a 12-jet whirlpool bath. The off-beat opportunity for an owner's cars to escape central London's yellow lines and rest instead on marble comes with the current snooker room  -exile the table (keeping the news from what certainly would be a horror-struck interior designer) and you would have room for two to three cars.</p>

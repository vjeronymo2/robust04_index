			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] We telephoned Mario Nobilo [in New York]  this evening and asked him to explain his alleged statement  regarding an attack on Serbs in the occupied Croatian  territories in case sanctions are introduced [against Croatia].  May we just warn that this statement orbited the entire world  via REUTERS and caused considerable concern among the  international public. Here is the explanation of our UN  ambassador:    [Begin Nobilo recording] The threat that Croatia will  declare  war against Krajina if sanctions are introduced was simplified  and taken out of context. Journalists insisted on knowing what  would happen if sanctions were to be introduced. My opinion is  that sanctions would move Croatia and the entire region closer  to war. Apart from this, they would create a new wave of  refugees throughout Europe, and disturb the balance of forces  because Serbs would then be in a more favorable position with  all the unforeseeable consequences this would entail. Croatia,  as the victim of aggression, would find it difficult to accept  sanctions as far as its morale is concerned.    In any case, both the Bosnian ambassador and I are trying to  place this whole new situation within the context of successful  talks expected at the next round of Croatian-Muslim talks on the  settlement of the remaining controversial matters.

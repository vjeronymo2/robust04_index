			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: VETERAN RETAILER LEN WILLIAMS TAKES PIC 'N' SAVE REINS  </P> <P> Pledging to return a bargain-basement flavor to Pic 'N' Save discount stores,  veteran retailing executive Len Williams on Tuesday assumed the post of  president and chief executive officer of the Dominguez-based retailer.  </P> <P> His selection Monday ended months of pressure by dissident shareholders to  replace Lewis B. Merrifield III, who at one time was chairman, president and  chief executive.  </P> <P> Arthur Frankel, who replaced Merrifield as chairman for four months, resigned  last week. He was succeeded by Peter S. Willmott, former chairman, president  and chief executive of Carson, Pirie Scott &amp; Co.  </P> <P> "I'm a hard-core merchant," Williams said. "In a bargain-oriented store,  impulse creates business, and mass creates impulse."  </P> <P> Williams, former president of Caldor, a division of Associated Dry Goods, and  former chief executive of Gold Circle, a division of Federated Stores, was  elected unanimously, according to board member David Batchelder, who heads the  La Jolla investment group that pushed for Merrifield's ouster.  </P> <P> Williams, 53, reported for work at 7:30 a.m. Tuesday and immediately launched  plans to woo back shoppers who considered the messy, jumbled stores a  bargain-hunter's paradise. Under Merrifield's guidance, management had  organized the merchandise and tidied up the stores, which critics and some  shareholders said hurt sales.  </P> <P> "I want to make the merchandise accessible and the stores really full," said  Williams. He said the stores reported very strong Halloween sales and predicts  that business will pick up as shoppers try to stretch their holiday dollars.  </P> <P> Williams, who will be moving to Southern California from Westport, Conn., said  he will be earning less than the $975,000 that Merrifield received.  </P> <P> "I'll be at a more market-related, realistic salary," he said.

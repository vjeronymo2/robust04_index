			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Monday Profile: Cagey advocate of labour skills - Tony Blair, shadow secretary of state for employment, speaks to David Goodhart and Ian Hargreaves He is no doubt tired of hearing it said, but Tony Blair is the very image of the would-be modern, eloquent and moderate Labour party. There is a wilted red rose in a basket on the table of his Holiday Inn style office near the Commons; there are papers and books in cheerful confusion and steady interruptions from a young man in big blue braces who seems to be dealing with media inquiries. A barrister, educated at public school and Oxford, 38-year-old Blair has worked hard to get to this point. Since 1989, he has been charged with distancing Labour from the trade union excesses which so damaged the party in the 1970s, while developing a policy line with something distinctive to offer union members. Within the party, his efforts are considered a success. But the election campaign will demonstrate whether they can withstand ordeal by fire; it is no doubt the imminence of this ordeal which explains the number of occasions during a 90-minute interview when Blair pauses lengthily and begins: 'I must choose my words carefully here.' The message as he would like it presented is as follows: there was an old agenda of trade union law, strikes and strife. This has been superseded by 'a new agenda which is about training, skills, dealing with low pay, better opportunities for women and partnership in the workplace. The individual should be subject to the full rigours of the market, but should be protected by certain rules against unfair treatment'. It is a moral vision in tune with Blair's committed Christian beliefs, but it is also wordly wise. 'There's no future for this country in being a low-skill, low-tech, economy. We have to compete on the basis of skills and quality . . . You can't do that either through the old restrictive practices or with management's unqualified right to manage,' he says. Or, more ambitiously: 'The new Keynesianism is in active intervention in the labour market, not in the belief that you simply pump demand into the economy, because you are going to be constrained from doing that.' This emphasis upon individual rights in the workplace is something Labour finds embodied in the EC social charter, to which it will accede as quickly as possible upon achieving office. This, says Blair, is a question of agreeing a European framework, not offering an open door for every ill-conceived Brussels directive. Again choosing his words carefully, he risks the view that 'a vibrant and positive trade unionism is a vital part of a democratic society'. But he also says: 'Unions need modern methods of communication and clear objectives  -then people will decide whether they're needed or not, as part of the service sector.' There is, as often with Labour, a bright golden haze when it comes to detail. There will be a minimum wage at half of average male earnings, a retreat (permanent?) from an initial target of two thirds. And some of the trade union laws of the last decade will be relaxed: the use of legal injunctions in industrial disputes will be made more restrictive, certain kinds of secondary action and picketing will be allowed again and sequestration of unions will not be allowed to prevent them from functioning. Beyond that things get still fuzzier. There will probably be a right to trade union recognition where 50 per cent or more of the workforce vote in favour of it. There will also be 'binding rights' for employees to consultation, although Blair says, 'I'm not insisting on one particular model'. Another labour market de-regulation to be reversed is the extension from six months to two years of the period before employees are covered by unfair dismissal laws. Will Labour return to six months? 'Not yet decided,' he says. The party's lack of clarity on these issues has been obscured by the inclination of Blair's key adversary and fellow barrister, Michael Howard, the employment secretary, to focus his attack upon wildly exaggerated costings of Labour's plans on, for example, the minimum wage. Although in general, Labour's trade union connection is still considered a likely electoral liability, it is by no means certain that sound-bite to sound-bite, Mr Howard will outgun Mr Blair on the hustings. But the blackest hole in Blair's portfolio of arguments is not the detail of trade union law, but the unknowable matter of how the party will behave on wages, especially in the public sector. Mr Blair does not dissent from the dour 'no promises' line of the shadow chancellor, Mr John Smith, on this point, but it is a touch disconcerting to find Labour's employment spokesman declining a view on the structure of public sector pay. Does the Labour party support the introduction of performance pay in the civil service and the NHS? Or the extension of pay review bodies? No ready answer. On training and 'active intervention in the labour market' he does speak with conviction. 'The central difference between the Labour party now and 15 years ago is that we believe that unemployment must be tackled through intervention in the labour market rather than relying on expanding demand'. This points to the 'new Keynesianism's' skills revolution - 'our greatest single priority' - along with a shorter-term emphasis upon measures such as reforming the employment service, better training opportunities for the unemployed and work experience. Blair supports the nationwide structure of Training and Enterprise Councils created by the government, but says his adversaries lack a policy framework for the Tecs. 'They have been seen as a substitute for policy and a means of disengaging from training,' he says. The Tecs, he believes, must become central to improving in-company training and not just delivering government schemes for the young and the unemployed. That needs money, some of which will be raised from a levy on employers who do not voluntarily devote sufficient resources to training. Blair says it will start as 0.5 per cent of the wages bill but, as in France, from where the idea is borrowed, it is likely to rise. Having studied Swedish experience, he believes that training and work experience schemes can, cost-effectively, more or less abolish long-term unemployment within one parliament; he also thinks this can be achieved without copying Sweden's benefits regime. Labour's central problem, however, is that long before any 'active labour market' measures will have had a chance to work, Britain's ERM-constrained economy may well be pushing unemployment even higher. With Britain's wage-setting system already delivering annual increases in earnings at three percentage points above inflation, Labour's commitments to the low paid, a more supportive view of trade unions and potential vacillation in the face of public sector demands, could release a new inflationary surge, with the unemployed again taking the strain. Tony Blair may be the first post-war Labour employment secretary to announce unemployment passing the 3m mark. Or perhaps a new model Labour government would succeed, where others have failed, in reforming the UK's pay bargaining system to produce a better trade off between pay and jobs? Blair refers to Labour's proposed national economic assessment and more open budget-making process, but is cagey about any attempt to seek consensus on pay guidelines. 'I can see the rational purpose behind ensuring better co-operation in the management of the economy. What I don't believe is that you can force it on industry, and at the present time there's enormous resistance, any talk of it is dismissed as corporatism or semi-Marxism'. He regrets that. 'If you accept that it is sensible for government and industry to work out a training policy together it seems an affront to common sense that with nearly 3m unemployed, a skills crisis, the huge discipline of the ERM, that the principle actors in the economy are not allowed to sit down to work out common objectives.' 'Someone of my generation (he was 30 when he entered the Commons in 1983) can see how sensible some form of social partnership is. But it has to be said that there are those who have been so badly scarred by the past that they cannot learn from it'.

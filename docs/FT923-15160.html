			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Managed funds industry seeks its freedom - Barbara Durr on the US sector's efforts to have speculative position limits removed THE US managed futures industry is winning important ground in its battle to persuade the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the futures industry watchdog, to raise or eliminate altogether speculative position limits. The CFTC has given permission for the Chicago Board of Trade to remove position limits on 30-year Treasury bonds and five and 10-year Treasury notes, three of its most heavily traded financial contracts. Since the commission's decision mirrors a similar ruling earlier this year allowing the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to end position limits on a clutch of currency contracts, the two moves mark an increasing accommodation of the influential funds. They also set the stage for a far more controversial step by the CFTC. The exchange is now considering raising position limits on a number of agricultural contracts, such as wheat, maize, soyabeans and cotton. Speculative position limits are caps on the trading positions held by participants who do not produce or use the underlying commodity and are therefore considered speculators. They are meant to prevent price manipulations, such as cornering and squeezing the market, as well as excess volatility. Managed futures, which in the past decade have gone from nowhere to everywhere, have an estimated Dollars 21bn under management. They have long pressed the CFTC and the US futures exchanges to either raise or eliminate position limits. They argue that position limits have pushed US traders overseas to foreign futures markets where no such constraints exist. Some of the largest managed funds place as much as 70 per cent of their money outside the US. Spurred by the loss of business to foreign exchanges, the CFTC is reviewing its stance on speculative position limits generally. So far, it has been willing to act relatively quickly to remove position limits on financial futures. These have always been relatively high, but the commission concluded that they were unnecessary in contracts where the underlying products - major foreign currencies and Treasury bonds, for example - enjoyed deep, liquid and efficient markets. CFTC officials said that two criteria have guided their decisions on the cases so far: that the supply of the underlying products was adequate and manipulations, and that traders conducted ample arbitrage between the futures and the liquid cash instrument markets. Managed funds, while happy that limits have been stripped from key financial futures contracts, are especially eager to see position limits lifted on traditional physical commodities. According to Mr Peter Matthews, a partner in Mint Investment Management Company, some of the industry's fattest returns have been in agricultural contracts. Agricultural markets tend to be less efficient with wider bid-ask spreads than financial futures markets. Thus, when an agricultural future moves and a trader has the right position it can yield big profits. As funds hit their position limits in agricultural markets, however, they must move to financial futures, where the returns are slimmer. Fund managers contend that position limits restrict a fund's ability to diversify so its performance is impaired. They claim that a smaller presence of physical commodities in a trading portfolio reduces its value as an inflation hedge. Mr Morton Baratz, editor of Managed Account Reports, the specialised industry newsletter, says that position limits affect managed funds as they grow larger, particularly after they pass the Dollars 200m mark. The stickiest issue for raising agricultural position limits is that there is a finite supply of deliverable commodities for these futures (whereas financial futures are generally cash settled). The farm lobby is opposed to the CFTC's proposal to raise the limits on agricultural contracts because they contend that this could subject farmers and agricultural product distributors - who hedge their exposure - to damaging price fluctuations as large funds pile in or out of a commodity. The American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest US general farm organisation, is also concerned that any change of limits could lead to market manipulation by floor traders and brokers. In order to handle large orders by funds, local traders might form alliances with brokers who would be dividing up such orders, it said. They then may lose interest in servicing small orders typical of many hedgers. This could mean hedgers facing an increased bid-ask spread to entice broker groups to execute them. The CFTC has taken these concerns on board. But it says the last increase (in 1987) in limits on agricultural products went smoothly. There was no increase in volatility while the higher limits helped boost trading volume and made the markets more liquid. The period for public comment on the CFTC's April proposal on agricultural position limits ran out on June 12 but was extended by 45 days to allow a wider study of the proposal. Ironically, it has historically been hedgers - not speculators - that have been responsible for big squeezes and other market manipulations. Such ploys are harder to execute with today's more sophisticated market surveillance systems. These factors aside, the combined forces of the managed funds industry and the exchanges themselves - which sorely want the managed funds' business - will continue to argue vehemently for greater regulatory accommodation. Trading volume at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rose 25 per cent to top 66.7m contracts in the first six months of 1992. CME futures trading rose 23 per cent while options recorded a jump of 33 per cent. Interest rate products, including futures and options on Eurodollars, one month Libor and 90-day Treasury bills, set the pace with an increase of 69.6 per cent. Agricultural contracts volume fell by 3 per cent. Trading volume at the Chicago Board of Trade also rose but by a more modest 8.4 per cent during the half year. Trading of futures and options contracts totalled 75.4m for the six months, up from from 69.7m a year ago. The CBOT's largest contract, the 30-year Treasury bond, has been relatively quiet, but trading in shorter maturity Treasury contracts rose substantially. Futures volume on 10-year Treasury notes jumped 52 per cent and options on the same rose by 169 per cent. Futures on five-year Treasury notes rose 103 per cent, and options on the five-year notes jumped 314 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Gossip" [Bula-Bula] page] </F>   [Excerpts] A question with a ready answer is doing the  rounds in diplomatic circles. These are always fertile ground  for subtle comments. The question is: How many members does  Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] have? Some say it has  two, but there are doubts about one of them. There are doubts  about Afonso Dhlakama, but there is certainty about FRG  ambassador to Mozambique Helmut Rau [name as published].  [passage omitted]    Diplomatic gossip about the FRG ambassador stems from Helmut  Rau's commitment to his country's decision to equip Renamo with  a radio station which will operate with FRG assistance.    The situation has given rise to conflicting commentaries.  The FRG ambassador alleges that his government's intention is  to put Renamo on an equal footing with the Frelimo [Mozambique  Liberation Front] government in order to guarantee democracy.  Others comment that it is a clear case of interference in the  political affairs of another country, and that the FRG  Government failed to assess the legal aspects of the situation.  The Frelimo government has no radio station. There is a public  radio station in Mozambique, which, according to its statutes,  is independent from the political decisionmaking bodies. Renamo  has access to that station.    The FRG ambassador has already realized that his gesture  (his  country's) has upset Frelimo, and according to reliable sources  he is believed to have tried to remedy the situation, arguing  that it is pointless to make an issue out of it since it is a  short wave station which will be heard by very few people -- a  view shared by Renamo -- and that Frelimo could apply for air  time on Renamo's radio.    Frelimo leaders have reacted: "Wait a minute!" That means  to give Renamo the status of a government. They have asked:  "What has made the FRG support Renamo when there are many  political parties in Mozambique, which, for the same reasons,  need radio stations?"    The controversy behind closed doors has not ended. It is  clear that diplomacy's subtly will result in new commentaries,  riddled with radiographic hints.</p>

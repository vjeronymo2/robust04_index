			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Sport: Champions face a fierce challenge - Cricket IT GOES without saying that the first day of a new cricket season is played in cold, wet weather. This year the traditional hostility of the elements excelled itself, to the point of hail-storms and gale-force winds last week on the few first-class grounds where play was possible at all. The handful of fans who turned out in the hope of seeing some cricket and the restless, track-suited cricketers hoping to oblige them sat in the pavilions agreeing that this year must be better than last. Essex, of course, would be happy for this year to be the same as last year. The Britannic Assurance Championship was fiercely contested and Essex's confidence was as important as their range of talent through all areas of the game, holding them secure against strong pressure from Warwickshire and latterly from the ever unpredictable Derbyshire, who reached top form in dazzling style, too late. Essex have lost none of that confidence, and welcome Mark Waugh back from Australian national batting service to his county batting slot, profitably occupied last year by Salim Malik. But they are an odd team, Essex, with an unpredictable element about them, which led them into disaster in the one-day games while they were doing so well in the county championship. It was quite an achievement to get themselves all out to Lancashire for 61 last Tuesday in the Benson and Hedges Cup. But that is what Essex are like. If they fail, they fail pathetically. If they do well, they do very well indeed - witness the eight Lancashiremen Neil Foster removed at Manchester for 99 runs last year. One of Essex's most impressive features was good captaincy, by Graham Gooch and by Foster when Gooch was on Test duty. Foster showed enterprise and both were good ambassadors for age and experience in a game increasingly dominated by concern for youth and fitness. The newcomers, Durham, are keenly recruiting young players. They boast a fair number of local youths already, tempered with the battle-wisdom of outsiders Wayne Larkins, Paul Parker and Ian Botham, along with their overseas import, Dean Jones. Jones began the season in belligerent form on Easter Sunday, his 114 dominating the day's play as Durham's 246 for 4 proved just enough to open the Sunday League with a win over Lancashire. The main force behind Jones's batting is its aggression and David Graveney will have his work cut out keeping that focussed on the enemy without. Though Durham bring with them a breath of fresh air, they also bring a lot more travelling, one of the most unpopular aspects of modern cricket. Lancashire found it so tiresome that they started hiring a coach to take them to all their fixtures, so they could rest and talk on the way. Last season Glamorgan, not to be outdone, chartered an aeroplane to fly to one of their home games. This season's championship, grossly over-punctuated by one-day games, promises to be tight. Lancashire are keeping Neil Fairbrother as captain. His leadership will have to pull the team together for they are a temperamental lot. They were too inconsistent to do themselves justice last year. With Mike Atherton injured, they missed his spin bowling as well as his batting. Atherton is one of a tradition of English batsmen, useful for tweaking out entrenched Test batsmen and it was good to see him loosening his arm at Chelmsford last week with his spinners and drifters. A generation earlier, I remember the cavalier Bob Barber and dogged Ken Barrington breaking up partnerships when brought on to bowl for short stretches. After two years at the bottom, Sussex rocketed to 11th last year and if I had to pick an outsider to do well in the championship this year, it would be Sussex. I respect their policy of recruiting and training young home-grown players. It is time that bore full fruit. The sad departure of Parker to Durham, when asked by Sussex's committee to give up the captaincy after four unsuccessful seasons in office and 17 happy and successful seasons at the club, made way for Alan Wells, 'Bomber' of Newhaven and brother of Colin Wells, another 'Bomber' of Newhaven, to become only the fourth Sussex captain since World War II born in Sussex. Newhaven, in fact. He is a man with a proud sense of county identity and if he can pass that on to the team and lead it happily, it might do well. For some time it has had to be a sharp fielding side, to keep enemy batsmen's excesses within limits, and it even boasts that most welcome of rarities: a young leg-spinner, Ian Salisbury, just back from a good England 'A' tour to the Caribbean. I look forward to watching him bowl this summer.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips consolidate as bonds lose steam Wall Street BLUE CHIP issues spent the day consolidating their position after Monday's strength on the back of a surge in bond prices, the latter being only slightly higher by yesterday's close. But the over-the-counter stocks set another record peak, agencies report from New York. Amid the currents of quarter-end window dressing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator, which finished on Monday night some 24 points higher, drifted within an 11-point band before ending 1.68 down on the day at 3,566.02. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.27 at 461.53, but the Nasdaq composite rose 3.71 to another all-time high of 763.66 and the American SE composite was up 0.68 at 457.12. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 243m shares. Market participants commented that there was little news to affect the overall market, although traders were keeping a watch on developments in Russia. The day's economic news did not inspire activity after the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index had risen to 62.6 this month from a revised 59.3 in August. Analysts said they did not detect much reaction in the equity market to congressional testimony by First Lady Hillary Clinton on health care reform. She said a national board would study the suitability of drug prices, but not set them. One analyst said some drug stocks reacted negatively to the pricing comments. Bookstore chain initial public offering Barnes &amp; Noble headed the Big Board volume list, ending at Dollars 29 3/8 after being priced at Dollars 20. Spectrum Information jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 6, topping Nasdaq activity. It received a patent for technology connecting portable computers to cellular telephones. Among strong technology shares, Microsoft advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 84, while Intel rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 72 3/4 , Cisco Systems Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52, Novell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 and SynOptics Dollars 1 to Dollars 25 1/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks finished lower after moderate activity, with little to inspire the market, and dealers said the tone would remain soft as election uncertainty mounts. An analyst said there was a little bit of end-of-month window dressing. The TSE 300 index was off 5.0 at 3,978.8 and declines led advances by 377 to 326 after volume of 51.3m shares. The 14 stock groups were evenly divided between winners and losers. The financial services index was down 1.03 per cent. Transportation stocks recorded the day's biggest change, falling 2.12 per cent. BCE dipped CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 44 3/4 . Its Bell Canada unit announced a number of cost-cutting measures designed to reduce expenses by CDollars 466m in 1994. The measures include work cutbacks equivalent to removing 5,000 employees from its workforce. Bell added that it will cut its 1994 capital budget by CDollars 300m.</p>

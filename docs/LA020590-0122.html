			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SAMMY DAVIS UP, WALKING AFTER SEEING TV TRIBUTE  </P> <P> Sammy Davis Jr., who was treated for throat cancer last year, was up and  walking in his hospital ward Monday after watching stars such as Frank Sinatra  and Michael Jackson pay tribute to him in a television special, a hospital  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Davis re-entered Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles 10 days ago for treatment  for a tooth infection possibly caused by radiation treatment he underwent after  having the cancerous growth removed in September, the spokesman, Ron Wise,  said.  </P> <P> Davis thoroughly enjoyed the television program celebrating his 60 years as an  entertainer, Wise said. Bob Hope, Dean Martin, Gregory Peck and Goldie Hawn  were also among the stars who paid tribute.  </P> <P> Davis has been able to leave his bed and appears to be making progress, Wise  added.  </P></p>

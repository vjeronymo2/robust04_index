			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Earnings forecasts 'over-optimistic' ANALYSTS' forecasts of earnings are unreliable in predicting the figures companies report and are nearly always over-optimistic, a study has found. The predictions become increasingly less reliable the further away from the results announcement they are. And more than one year before a company reports they are little more accurate than drawing a straight line from the previous set of figures, according to Strathclyde University re-search presented at the conference. The research supports recent anecdotal evidence of the inaccuracy of investment houses' research, such as recommendations to buy the shares of Queens Moat House hours before they were suspended, or Polly Peck days before the company collapsed. The study was based on a database containing 69,258 forecasts of earnings per share made by analysts between January 1988 and December 1990, compared with the reported earnings of the companies studied.</p>

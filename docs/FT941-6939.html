			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Into Europe, and What Happens Next? (16): Other countries are privatising, too - Will public flotations of state industries around the world tempt UK savers to diversify their tax-free investments? PEPs have traditionally been sold as core investments, but some fund managers argue that it is time that substantial investors introduced a little diversification into their tax-free portfolios. Those who have invested the maximum permitted amount into general and single-company Peps since 1987 have now ring-fenced Pounds 46,200 from tax, or nearly Pounds 100,000 if a husband and wife have both contributed their full Pep allowance. And unless these investors have been very unfortunate (or inept) the capital value of their Pep holdings is worth considerably more than this. Martin Harrison, GT's marketing director, says: 'Most Pep portfolios are stuffed with UK income equities or UK blue chips. This is fine as long as investors don't think that it is the end of the story. It is about time people started to look at diversification.' Judy Delaforce, Fidelity's manager of product development, agrees. She says: 'We are finding that people will always go first to their home market; but, now that we have had six or seven years of Peps, investors are becoming incredibly overweight in the UK, and we are seeing much more diversification.' Fidelity's European funds are currently the second and third most-favoured home for the group's new Pep money. Since 1991 there have been two routes to Pep diversification. Investors can move outside UK equities and into the Far East, or Japan or the US by contributing the maximum Pounds 1,500 to a non-qualifying fund. More satisfactorily, they can put the full annual contribution into a fund that invests in EC equities. Ken Emery, technical manager of investment products at Save &amp; Prosper, says the argument for diversifying into Europe 'depends on how much money you have put into your Pep, and how long you have been contributing. I think one's first Pep investment should be a UK fund, but the ability to go into European equities is certainly helpful in enabling people to spread their investments rather more widely.' There is no shortage of European unit trusts and investment trusts available to enable investors to diversify. For example, Framlington is concentrating part of its 1994 Pep marketing on its Continental Smaller Companies trust. Fund manager Stephen Watson says: 'We have the possibility of interest rates coming down further and of some economic growth. But the point we are trying to emphasise is that, after three years of underperformance, smaller companies could be due for a bounce back.' New 'pepable' European investment vehicles are also appearing with some regularity. GT, for example, recently launched a European Equity and Bond fund which replicates what investors can do with a European Pep. The trust will never have less than 45 per cent of its portfolio in European bonds, or more than 55 per cent in European equities. Harrison says: 'We believe that there is a big opportunity to persuade people that they ought not to be limiting their Peps to UK equities, and this fund has a zero investment in the UK. Europe is behind the UK in the interest-rate cycle, so many domestic investors in continental Europe still have money on deposit. We expect interest rates will fall in 1994 and that these investors will start to look at equities.' Harrison forecasts that the catalyst for a change in investment sentiment will be the European privatisation programmes, which are already attracting intense investor interest in the UK. The two new European privatisation investment trusts, from Mercury Asset Management and Kleinwort Benson, look set to attract more than Pounds 1bn between them - Mercury had 65,000 inquiries to its share information office before its public offer opened on February 3 - and Fidelity hopes to launch a global privatisation unit trust shortly. All three funds will qualify for Pep investments. Jonathan Ruck Keene, director of Mercury Asset Management Private Clients, says: 'Pep investors are part of the target market for the Mercury European Privatisation trust. The Pep will contain warrants, so there is a slight element of gearing in it, and that adds a little bit of spice.' Recent estimates by JP Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley International suggest that European privatisations totalling at least Pounds 100bn are possible over the next five years. France, Italy and Spain have already announced big privatisation programmes; but Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Trusts, says: 'Almost all countries have potential privatisations: Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Holland and Sweden and the former Eastern bloc countries. This is an enormous market.' White believes the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust Pep will be 'particularly suitable for those who have a potential CGT liability.' But he adds: 'It is not the first investment that one should Pep. First, one should look at the high-yielding shares in one's portfolio.' As with any Pep, too, basic-rate taxpayers must weigh up whether the tax benefits will outweigh charges on the plan. The ability to add European equities to a Pep has clearly widened investor choice - as S&amp;P's Emery says, 'It is another refinement' - but few Pep managers believe that there will be further substantial improvements to the Peps scheme. Although there have been no innovations since 1991, they point out that Peps have been generously enhanced since the fledgling scheme was first unveiled in the 1986 Budget. Some even fear that constant pressure for further concessions may prove counter-productive. They suggest that misdirected lobbying for greater Pep freedoms could combine with economic pressures to prompt the government to look again at the revenue cost of encouraging savings through tax reliefs. Emery says: 'I get incensed when people keep asking for increases in the annual limit. I think it is very generous.' However, there is considerable agreement among unit trust managers, at least, that it would be helpful to investors if there was freedom to place the whole of the Pep allowance in a gilt or bond fund. Fidelity's Delaforce comments: 'This would make Peps more suitable investments for a bear market.' Lobbyists for this measure argue that gilts Peps could play a useful role in assisting the government with the funding of its borrowing requirement. For this reason, optimists believe that a relaxation on the use of gilts may be the favoured option if the chancellor of the exchequer decides to enhance Peps in his next November budget.</p>

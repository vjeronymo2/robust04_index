			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Accountants attack audit plans THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has launched a strong attack on the proposals on the future development of auditing issued by the Auditing Practices Board late last year. In response to the board's consultative document it expresses disappointment that the board failed to provide more detailed evidence or to draw firm conclusions. It says the primary focus of auditors must always be on the historical accounts, not on prospects.</p>

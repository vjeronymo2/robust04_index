			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] After the results of the second round of the  parliamentary elections, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]  is forced to give up the possibility of recommending a nominee  for the post of prime minister to the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist  Party], which finished first in the election. This was  discussed, among other things, at the SZDSZ press briefing.  Judit Laszlo reports from there.    [Laszlo] [passage omitted] Considering the chances for a  coalition, party Chairman Ivan Petoe said that the SZDSZ did not  view the distribution of ministries purely as a mathematical  exercise. Were the MSZP-SZDSZ coalition to come into being, it  would be the result of a historic compromise, Petoe said.  [passage omitted]    The price of the compromise is that the would-be coalition  should implement a liberal economic program but the SZDSZ would  like to see the personnel guarantees for this too, Petoe said.  He also stressed that the SZDSZ would be able to conduct  coalition negotiations only with a united MSZP, because the  SZDSZ does not wish to set itself up as a judge to decide over  the issues of dispute that exist between the various wings of  the MSZP.    An MSZP-SZDSZ coalition is inconceivable unless a compromise  solution is arrived at in respect of the person of the prime  minister. At the same time, the SZDSZ is not in a position to  make recommendations for the person of the prime minister, it  was said at the press briefing. [passage omitted]</p>

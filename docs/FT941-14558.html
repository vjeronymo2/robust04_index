			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Telecoms chief's death shocks Hong Kong Hong Kong's business community was shocked yesterday by the announcement that Mr Michael Gale, chief executive of Hongkong Telecom, had died suddenly on Monday evening, Simon Holberton writes. Mr Gale, 53, died in a local hospital to which he had been admitted last week for a back operation, of a heart attack. He is survived by a wife and two children. Lord Young, executive chairman of Cable and Wireless and chairman of Hongkong Telecom, a subsidiary, said Mr Gale had brought 'enormous wisdom and experience' to bear in the performance of his duties. Mrs Anson Chan, acting governor of Hong Kong, described Mr Gale as one of the colony's most dynamic and respected citizens. Hongkong Telecom had planned to announce yesterday that Mr Gale was to be made the company's deputy chairman. He was to relinquish the chief executive's role to devote more time to the development of Cable and Wireless' business interests in Asia. The company went ahead, however, with the planned announcement that Mr Linus Cheung had been appointed chief executive. Mr Cheung will take up his duties at the beginning of May. He is currently deputy managing director of Cathay Pacific Airways responsible for the airline's worldwide commercial activities and the most senior Chinese executive at the airline. His job will be taken by Mr Simon Heale. Mr Cheung's appointment was seen as serving a number of interests. With Hong Kong returning to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 it was seen as politic to have a Chinese executive at the helm. He is seen as an effective ambassador for Hongkong Telecom both in the colony and, importantly, in China, where the company has ambitious plans for ex-pansion. Hongkong Telecom has long held that if China is to meet its ambitious plans for telecommunications development, Beijing will have to permit foreign investment in the operation of regional telecommunications networks. It is working closely with telecommunications authorities in both Guangdong and Fujian provinces. See People column</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: United Newspapers pays Pounds 27m for picture library United Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily and Sunday Express and a range of regional newspapers and business magazines, has paid Pounds 27m cash for Visual Communications, a stock picture library, on behalf of its Express Newspapers subsidiary. Visual Communications sells high-quality photographic images in 30 countries, to various sectors including advertising, marketing, corporate publishing, books, news-papers and magazines. The company's images are marketed by agents through a series of catalogues. Mr Andrew Cameron, managing director of Express Newspapers, said: 'On a world scale the stock picture market has increased substantially in recent years. The ability to store and transmit images digitally, the development of multimedia products and other similar factors will ensure that this growth continues. 'Express has developed its own digitally-based picture library for commercial exploitation, and there is considerable potential synergy between the two businesses.' Visual Communications doubled turnover between 1991 and 1993. Last year the company, which will be managed as a separate business unit within United Newspapers, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m on turnover of Pounds 10m. Net assets at the end of December were Pounds 2.1m. Last summer, United Newspapers raised Pounds 190m through a rights issue and a further Pounds 73.5m from the sale of Extel Financial, the financial information group, to Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times. Since then, the group has made a number of acquisitions, including the Dollars 100m purchase of Harmon Publishing Company, and the acquisition of Hong Kong International Trade Fair Group for up to Pounds 29.5m as part of its strategy of expanding in east Asia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "An Important Warning"] </F>   [Text] There were certain segments of His Eminence  Ayatollah Khamene'i's speech on 13 April that were not carried  by IRNA. In view of the importance of the warning by the great  leader, we present the following points:    --Remain alert and vigilant in the trenches, because a  wounded enemy is more furious.    --Their struggle gets more serious and fraught with anger  the  more unsuccessful they are.    --They are trying to tarnish the revolution; this is what is  going on in the sphere of politics.    --Anyone in this country undertaking constructive activity  or  entrusted with some task should be alert and vigilant. The  enemy has not been able to strike, but he has not given up hope.    --We should strengthen our strong points. Of course, we do  have weak points that we should strive to eliminate, too.    --You can see that smugglers and other individuals who  smuggle in videocassettes full of sex, erotic pictures,  pornographic literature, magazines, or nude and titillating  photographs are not truly earning their livelihood. I should  state on the basis of my information that their livelihood comes  from other sources. They have been assigned to propagate and  popularize this quagmire of lust and immorality among the  Iranian people, especially the youths and their families.    --Today, there are some who wield their pens in the same  manner as those they see being favored and paid black money by  the American CIA, which gives them a few dollars! They go ahead  and write that the Iranian nation erred when it staged the  revoluton. In this manner, they denigrate the greatest, most  courageous, and inspiring action by the Iranian nation and say  that the Iranian people regret they staged the revolution. May  the hatred and disgust of the Iranian nation be upon such pens.    --We will collar the big powers in all parts of the world,  as  they are tyrants who oppose us, and we do not spare tyrants.    --We are not the kind of people or government that will  ignore an aggressor or tyrant so that he can continue his work.    --Formerly, when the powers of arrogance came, they did so  overtly and occupied a country. Today, they use more advanced  means for dominating and usurping nations and their resources.</p>

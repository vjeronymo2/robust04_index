			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Woolworths relisting lifts market in Australia SHARES in Woolworths, the Australian retailer, relisted publicly yesterday at a hefty premium, pushing the Australian stock market to its highest level since 1987 and paving the way for a deluge of new company flotations. Woolworths shares, issued at ADollars 2.45, closed at ADollars 2.81 after trading as high as ADollars 2.98 following a three-hour extension of normal trading by the Australian Stock Exchange. The strong Woolworths trade, involving almost 92m shares worth ADollars 260.6m (USDollars 174.8), pushed total market turnover to ADollars 613m. The float, Australia's biggest ever, consisted of 1bn shares at ADollars 2.45 each. The vendors, Industrial Equity, received applications for 2.66m shares worth ADollars 6.52bn and were forced to scale back allocations to both institutional and public applicants. Analysts said last night the lively showing meant that demand was likely to spill over into other proposed Australian share issues, especially the ADollars 90m raising by AAPC, incorporating the Australian assets of the Accor Asia Pacific hotel group, and an ADollars 112m offering of gold interests held by Ashton Mining, the Australian diamond producer. The Australian government has also announced plans to float a further 19 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia around September this year while Burns Philp, the Australian industrial group, is also believed to be considering an ADollars 400m float of its hardware division.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications.  </P> <P> Disposable Diapers: The Arizona company that makes TenderCare disposable  diapers is developing a flushable diaper. RMed International reports that it  has come up with a product called TenderSoft that can be flushed in a toilet  like other degradable wastes. Procter &amp; Gamble abandoned a similar product  in the 1960s after tests showed consumers were more apt to throw it away than  flush it. Now, with the world's growing ecology consciousness, P&amp;G or  Kimberly-Clark may be ready to try the idea again. Cleveland Plain Dealer  </P> <P> Corporate Cleanup: Payless Drug Stores Northwest and the Fred Meyer drugstore  chain have started programs to increase recycling and reduce waste at the  corporate level. Payless is pushing its people to recycle 98% of their paper.  It will also set up recycling stations for employees to drop off household  materials. Fred Meyer says it will tell customers about environmentally  friendly products, stock more of them and use office cleaning materials that  break down easily. Portland Oregonian  </P> <P> Healthy Hospitals: Traditional general hospitals soon may be a thing of the  past, according to creators of popular new hospitals in south Florida. While  still providing most general services, the hospitals tout themselves as  specialists in sports medicine, gynecology, emergency care and other fields.  Older hospitals in south Florida and elsewhere may have to fall in with the  trend or lose business to the newcomers. South Florida Business Journal  </P> <P> Nonstop Competition: Some regional airlines are thriving in the shadow of big  competitors. Midwest Express, based in Milwaukee, is determined to compete with  Northwest Airlines on Western routes. It is adding two MD-88s to its fleet of  11 smaller DC-9s and by mid-March will carry passengers nonstop to San  Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. In contrast, Texas-based Conquest  Airlines shuns competition with the major carriers and concentrates on routes  between the state's smaller cities. Conquest believes that it will break even  this year, a feat for a 2-year-old airline. Houston Chronicle, Milwaukee  Journal  </P> <P> Price Hitches: Frozen Food Express, a trucking service in Dallas, has been  struggling with rising fuel costs since last summer and finally decided to add  a fuel surcharge of 4% to 5%. If fuel costs continue to escalate, industry  experts believe that other trucking firms will add a surcharge or raise rates  outright. Dallas Business Journal  </P></p>

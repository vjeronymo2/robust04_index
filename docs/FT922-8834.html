			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: The railway bazaar Shrewd players of Monopoly, the board game for would-be property punters, will be aware that London railway stations can be extraordinarily valuable assets. Thanks to the government's renewed determination to hand over large chunks of British Rail to the private sector - as outlined in last week's Queen's Speech - it looks as though businessmen will be able to try the real-life version. As with other privatisations - or creeping denationalisations as this one is probably better described - there are implications for the public finances, as well as for those companies which may care to get involved. Ministers naturally dismiss the idea that a latter-day Beeching plan is in the offing. But at the very least, a rethink about the costs, value, and size of the network is now assured. In particular, the process will expose cross-subsidies in the system now hidden by the provision to BR of a single block grant. Take BR's freight business, for example, which mostly loses money because of fierce competition from road hauliers, but which benefits from paying a relatively small charge for access to the track. In theory, InterCity services are all pitted against road and air alternatives. In practice, profits from near monopoly positions on medium-haul routes like London to Birmingham help prop up other parts of the service. Cash disposals are clearly part of the government's plan. But in view of its commitment to maintaining the level of services, the proceeds from selling off the lucrative bits like coal transport will in part be offset by the need to replace the cross-subsidy which these activities provide. Against that, the hope is that subsidies will fall as operators compete for the unprofitable services. But it might be a mistake to think that the government is mainly in this one for the money. Even the stations may not be as juicy as they appear on the Monopoly board. Complications include planning constraints - Paddington, for example, is a listed building - while developers will surely be obliged to retain the working bits like platforms and concourses, under BR supervision.</p>

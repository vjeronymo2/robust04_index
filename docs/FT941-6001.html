			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: GiroCredit bid opposed by savings banks Austria's savings banks were yesterday opposing a bid by Bank Austria to buy a majority stake in GiroCredit, the savings banks' clearing institution. The bid was announced on Monday - to widespread surprise - as part of an initiative by Bank Austria, Austria's biggest bank, aimed at forcing through a reorganisation of the savings bank sector. At a meeting in Vienna yesterday, the savings banks decided instead to press ahead with earlier proposals, which involve Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse, the second-largest savings bank, establishing a new company. This holding company would be formed by a consortium comprising Erste, Austria Kollegialitat Versicherung, a leading insurance company, and the savings banks. The consortium would offer to buy around two-thirds of Bank Austria's 31 per cent stake in GiroCredit. The meeting called on Erste to make preparations immediately to establish the company, and to start negotiations with Bank Austria to agree a 'fair price' for its shares in GiroCredit. Erste is to be joined by three representatives from provincial savings banks in the negotiations. Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, Bank Austria's chief executive, confirmed that the bank intended to pursue its bid for GiroCredit, worth up to Sch400 a share. Bankers say the outcome of the takeover tussle is likely to hinge on whether Bank Austria's offer will find enough sellers among savings banks to give the bank the extra 20.4 per cent of GiroCredit's shares which it needs to have a majority.</p>

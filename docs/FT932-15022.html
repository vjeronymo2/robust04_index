			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Bronfman groups simplify their financial web SEVERAL senior holding companies controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family have announced a restructuring of their financial arrangements with one another. The changes, the start of an effort to simplify the web of interlocking private and public companies, will relieve Edper Enterprises and Hees International Bancorp of contingent obligations relating to Brascan Holdings. Brascan is a private company which holds 49 per cent of Brascan Ltd, a publicly-listed Bronfman holding company. The changes are complex, reflecting the intricate cross-holdings and financing arrangements within the Bronfman empire. As a first step, Edper will contribute CDollars 279m (USDollars 221.40m) of junior preferred shares to Brascan Holdings. Edper will also have the right over five years to require Hees to buy its common share holdings in Brascan for Hees common shares or an equivalent security. Hees, which owns CDollars 765m of Brascan senior preferred shares, will be released from an obligation to buy Brascan preferred shares to fund future purchases of Brascan equity securities. Hees will also be assured of a more stable earnings and dividend flow from its investment in Brascan. The complex structure of the Bronfman empire has made it difficult for outsiders to judge the extent of recent financial pressures on the group. But the group has this year disposed of some of its most prized assets, including controlling stakes in John Labatt, the brewer and entertainment group, and MacMillan Bloedel, the forestry company. As a result of the latest changes, Edper has reduced the carrying value of its 50.1 per cent stake in Brascan. The CDollars 140m charge pushed Edper to a CDollars 298.6m loss in 1992, compared with net earnings of CDollars 19.4m the previous year. On completion of the transaction, expected in early May, Hees will record a corresponding gain.</p>

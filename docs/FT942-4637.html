			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Denmark Voting Today. The Danish parties broadly oppose a federal Europe. Out of the 10 parties contesting the election, the opposition Liberal Party, set to win four or five of Denmark's 16 seats in the parliament, is the only one in favour. The party's annual conference in March backed a two-chamber system of government for Europe, giving the European parliament legislative powers. All the Danish parties support the social chapter. The Social Democrats, heading the four-party coalition, goes furthest, advocating supranational regulations to protect workers and prevent social dumping. On monetary union, Denmark obtained a special opt-out in 1992. The opposition Liberals and Conservatives favour eventual Danish participation in monetary union, but the issue has not played a role in the campaign. Danish membership would in any event require approval by a referendum. LIKELY RESULT: The Social Democrats and the Liberals both stand to win 24 per cent, according to a Gallup poll this week. The anti-European alliance of the June Movement and the People's Movement Against the EU may win 18 per cent. The Conservatives would gain 12 per cent.</p>

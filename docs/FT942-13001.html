			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Arts: Dirty linen aired in public - Television in Italy The corpse of Mussolini dangling by his feet, and being prodded by jeering Milanese, is not a pretty sight. Even seen at the distance of 49 years, the image raises troubling questions about the human condition and how the once mighty can be humbled to the point of indignity. The Mussolini shot was one of many remarkable images from archive film shown by the RAI state broadcasting organisation in the run-up to the celebration of the anniversary of Italy's liberation from fascism on April 25. It was the first time such a concentrated effort has been made to come to terms with the more uncomfortable aspects of the period of 1943-45 when the country was divided both because of those areas occupied by the Allies and the Germans, and by the bitter civil war between those who still backed the fascist regime and the 'partisan' guerrilla movement. Quite by coincidence, this year's anniversary coincided with the imminent entry into government of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance Party, which draws its inspiration from Mussolini and whose leader, Gianfranco Fini, recently declared Il Duce to be the greatest statesman this century. The electoral success of the MSI has emboldened its supporters to embark on a major exercise in historical revisionism, trying to highlight the positive aspects of the Mussolini era and play down the negative side. In this atmosphere, any attempt by television to deal with the 'liberation' risked exacerbating existing prejudices and thus losing any educative function. All the more so since the new right is determined to end the near monopoly over cultural attitudes exercised by the Italian left since the second world war - not least in television. However, the RAI proved to its credit that television can be a highly effective means of jogging the collective conscience as well as act as a forum for national reconciliation. It is perhaps significant that the commercial channels, dominated by the three owned by future premier Silvio Berlusconi, produced nothing original or controversial for the occasion and limited their contribution to the traditional chat shows which fill the screens for up to three hours nightly. The centre-piece of RAI's programming was a series called Combat Film, based round previously unseen material contained in the archives of the US army in Washington. (From the subsequent discussion programmes, it was clear the material was also unknown to historians.) The film was shot by US combat camera crews following the army through Italy and was shown often unedited, giving an extra rawness to the images. The style was incredibly matter of fact, a simple recording of events without judgment or emotion, and shown on RAI usually without direct sound. Some of the events were 'historical', like that of the dead Mussolini strung up in Milan alongside his mistress, or the Allied entry in Rome. But much was the casual incidence of war and fratricidal conflict: the fascist spy calmly smoking a cigarette, arms tied to a pole a few moments before his body crumples under the impact of bullets from a firing squad; orphans being entertained by GIs at Christmas; a small barefoot boy striding ahead of a column of gaunt refugees along a dusty road. These images were constantly commented on in the studio - often by interrupting the film or re-projecting selected passages - by a group of historians. But from the general public's point of view, the events were brought alive by the programme organisers researching some of the individuals in the clips and bringing them into the studio. Others subsequently rang in recognising themselves and their relatives. Thus the bare-foot boy was found, a burly military man in his fifties; a partisan came forward whose unit was betrayed by the shot spy who explained how the man lived with them for two weeks dissimulating friendship. The emotions of these people in the studio, confronted with the power of the image on memory, managed (just) to avoid the sentimental. These were all people caught up in events bigger than themselves. Although they had never forgotten, or wanted to forget, time had produced if not a catharsis, at least a sense of reconciliation. As so often in Italian television, the impact is diluted by the length and unstructured nature of the ensuing discussion programmes. Nevertheless, on this occasion some of the historians had the merit to make brutal judgments. One in particular observed that the 300,000 celebrating in Milan the April 25 Liberation Day was greater than the total number of partisans: in other words most of Italy was caught in the middle and shifted from one side to the other when the tide turned. This historian also caused one reel to be slightly rewound to reveal a remarkable sequence in the liberation of Bologna: a man is seen giving the fascist salute to a passing Italian flag; a companion points out his mistake and the salute transforms rapidly into a clenched fist . . . The image of changing Italy, he said . . . But television has not only been the conscience of Italy's past. It is being used to dramatic effect to expose the state of present corruption that has brought down an entire political class. The final stages of the first major corruption case to come to trial have been compulsive viewing over the past week. It has been shown live for as much as four hours a day and all channels have offered selective replays and commentaries in the evenings. The trial is of Sergio Cusani, a cool disdainful figure who was one of the key intermediaries organising the flow of illicit funds from big business to politicians through a host of intermediaries. He is alleged to have handled some Dollars 150m in four years. The case has far more drama than a Perry Mason series: the nation is seeing the dirty linen of a corrupt political system being washed in public. The public prosecutor, Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's most prominent investigative magistrate, has a marvellous down to earth sense of humour. And he has conducted his summing up with the latest computer wizardry. For the first time an Italian court has seen computer graphics (tracing the complex routes of illicit funds) and audio-visual aids with replays of witnesses' statements. But is this fascinating trial by television legitimate viewing and does it further the cause of justice? The cynics would say that television channels, state and private, are desperately short of funds and this is a cheap and easy way of providing entertainment. Even if this argument is not wholly true, this 'video-justice' is served up basically as entertainment - rather than as how a system of justice works, or as a didactic exercise in the evils of the old corrupt ways.</p>

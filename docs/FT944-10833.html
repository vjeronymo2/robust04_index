			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Life is not yet a beach for business leaders: Roderick Oram finds delegates uneasy in spite of the more benign climate Rather than basking in the most benign economic climate for years, business is worrying that the government could turn the recovery into a wash out before the next election. Delegates to the CBI's annual conference were also concerned that rising output and low inflation had failed to solve some of business's most persistent problems such as lack of finance. Business is also having to cope with some new difficulties. The most pressing is how to persuade customers to accept price increases to cover higher raw-material costs. Mr Simon Eccleston, chief executive of Trans-Tech Industries, said: 'I'm scared something will go wrong again.' The west Midlands manufacturer of automation equipment has survived the recession, but, added Mr Eccleston: 'We have to trust politicians but now we can all see through them.' Mr John McKeown, a director of Allied Domecq and managing director of the Tetley Pub Company, said its pubs across the country have seen a slow improvement in business over the past six months. The future is now promising, 'provided someone doesn't over-correct near the next election'. Mr Ernest Kidney, managing director of Balcas, said: 'We need continuing stability, not just for a few years but longer-term.' His Ulster-based wood processor depends on the rest of Britain for some 85 per cent of its sales in construction, packaging and other fields. Calls for government policy action ranged widely across fields from transport and environment to training and education. Business also pressed for more effort from the government on European integration. The dominant theme, however, was that industry could solve many of its problems through its own investment, but only if the government made tax changes to encourage the process. The CBI has made capital allowances and similar measures the central plank of its Budget submission. The need to spend more on infrastructure, particularly transport, was a concern expressed by business leaders from diverse industries. Mr Pat Lee, development director of Wincanton, a distribution company based in Wincanton, Somerset, said the south-west, for example, was ill-served by its transportation links. Many delegates welcomed private finance of infrastructure projects, an approach reaffirmed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, at the conference yesterday. Some Pounds 500m of private sector funding will have flowed into transport projects this year, he said. Mr Ivor Warburton, managing director of the West Coast Line, said securing such funding was the key to rebuilding the railways. He said: 'It's a race to do it before we get caught in a downward quality spiral' as existing equipment wears out. The pressure to invest in infrastructure and other capital equipment appears to be building rapidly judging by the brisk rate of growth across the spectrum of economic activity. Inevitably, of course, a few areas are struggling. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said: 'It wouldn't be much fun standing on a doorstep trying to sell pensions.' Two barometers - train trips and packing cases - give a guide to the breadth of the upturn. Mr Warburton said leisure travel on the West Coast Line began to grow at the turn of the year and business travel in March. Mr Kidney of Balcas said demand for packing cases, flat for the past two years, began to recover about three to six months ago. Mr Bill Good of Sterling Tubes, which supplies seamless stainless steel tubes for process industries, said: 'Business is recovering but margins are tight and I'm worried about unfair competition (from foreign suppliers).' Of the few clouds gathering on the economic horizon, it is rising prices and lack of finance which appear to worry business leaders most. With paper costs up 30 per cent over the past year, for example, it has been hard for Kenrick &amp; Jefferson, a large printer based in the west Midlands to pass them on to customers used to unchanged prices over recent years. Mr Stephen Adams, a divisional director of the company, said: 'It could be easier next year when people have built them into their budgets.' Mr Peter Pring, director of corporate affairs of 3M UK, said: 'We're a little concerned with the trend of raw material prices.' It has, however, managed to keep in check the prices of its 60,000 products across a range of markets from consumer to healthcare and industrial. Mr Eccleston of Trans-Tech, which makes of automation equipment, said: 'Demand is marvellous, but we can't do some of the business because we can't finance it.' He believes that it is a widespread problem, judging by his experience as a board member of Walsall's Training and Enterprise Council. 'Of 1,500 companies the Tec ran a health check on, over half were concerned about a lack of funding,' he said. His unhappiness was echoed by several other delegates who, although they were satisfied by the general state of the economy and their business, were heading back to work to tackle this and other lingering problems.</p>

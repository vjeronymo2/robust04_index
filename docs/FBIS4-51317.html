			<p>BFN     [Text] Lusaka, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Ambassador to  Zambia Yang Zengye, on behalf of the Chinese State Physical  Culture and Sports Commission, presented the Zambia's Ministry  of Foreign Affairs with sports facilities on Tuesday [24 May] to  support reformed Zambian national soccer team.    These facilities, worth a total of ten thousand U.S.  dollars, included sports wearings, footballs and soccer shoes.    Among those attending the ceremony was Zambian Foreign  Minister Remmy Mushota.    Eighteen former Zambian national soccer stars were killed in  an air crash in April 28, 1993. The players were on their way  to Senegal to take part in a World Cup qualifying match.    The new national team became runner-ups in this year's  African cup soccer tournament in Tunis after their reformation.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Travel: Bathing in five-coloured hot waters - Lesley Downer visits Japan's most fashionable resort, cycles past lava beds and watches a prince and princess play tennis EVEN before I arrived, I knew that Prince Akishino and his doe-eyed bride, Princess Kiko, were in Karuizawa. Somehow everyone knew - though quite how word had got round I don't know. I also knew that they were staying not in their usual summer residence but in the Mampei Hotel. Once I was settled in I hired a bicycle and began to explore the back streets, until I was stopped by a mass of people. Peering over the sea of heads I saw the wire netting of the tennis courts, the red-roofed mock-Tudor changing-rooms, and the familiar figures of the prince and princess, lobbing a ball back and forth. Karuizawa was the scene for the great Japanese fairytale romance of all time. It happened in 1957. Akishino's father, the then crown prince, Akihito, had had a rather lonely boyhood, being groomed to take over the solitary post of emperor. In those days the imperial family was even further removed from the public than it is now. Most people had never even seen the emperor's face. If he chanced to pass by, you had to bow to the ground and not look up until he was gone. After the war, young Akihito was assigned an American tutor, a Quaker called Mrs Vining. In the summer she used to retire to the hill station of Karuizawa, where she had a villa, and Akihito, too, became fond of the place. It was here in 1957 that he found himself playing tennis opposite Michiko Koda, the beautiful daughter of a wealthy industrialist. When they married, most Japanese saw it as the seal on their new-found democracy; no emperor had ever dreamt of marrying a commoner before. I went to Karuizawa last August, along, it seemed, with half of Tokyo. Due, no doubt, to its imperial associations, it is now Japan's most fashionable resort. When Tokyo is unbearably hot and steamy, Karuizawa is blissfully cool, and many Tokyoites have second homes there, designer villas hidden away in the larch woods around the town. The train that day was completely packed. I was sharing the compartment with a group of ladies on their way to a 'spiritual seminar' on the teachings of Rabinadrath Tagore. We trundled across the plains, laid out with neat paddy fields and little square houses, then climbed steeply up into the rugged landscape around Usui Pass. Dark wooded crags, which looked as if they had been brushed on to an ink painting, soared around us, mist drifting in the hollows. We plunged into a long tunnel and finally came out into the uplands of Karuizawa. Karuizawa sits right at the foot of Mount Asama, said to be the highest active volcano in Japan. In summer it is often hidden by clouds, but then the weather clears and you suddenly see it, looming over the town, a plume of smoke floating ominously above it. A little way out of town are lava beds, relics of the last great eruption of 1783, which engulfed several towns and villages and left the area scattered with grotesquely-shaped giant lava boulders. Besides Mt Asama, Karuizawa is noted for its larch woods and for the many artists and writers who go to live there. It is a pleasant, breezy place, with long avenues skirting woods, lakes and hillocks - until, that is, you cycle into the centre of town and suddenly find yourself in a mini-Tokyo: coffee shops, clothes shops, jewellery shops, crowds, restaurants, noise, canned music and traffic jams, bursting out like some dreadful growth right in the middle of these peaceful hills. Cycling is the only sane way to get around. I gave Karuizawa a couple of days, hiding out, like the prince and princess, in the gracious Mampei Hotel. It opened 99 years ago, in the days when westerners could still afford to come to Japan for an inexpensive holiday, and boasts cherrywood panelling, carved ceilings, stained-glass windows and passable French food. I did not find any French food in Nagano. It is an hour further up the line from Karuizawa, but more like several decades away from the sophistication and glittering lights of Tokyo. No one comes here for 'spiritual seminars', and I very much doubt that the emperor has a summer villa here. To most Japanese, Nagano equals mountains. It is a small city at the heart of mountain country, full of climbers and golfers in the summer and skiers in the winter, en route to the spectacular peaks which soar not far away. Nagano is on the brink of great changes. It is to be the site of the winter Olympics in 1998, and already many building projects are under way. There will be grand new hotels with restaurants, banqueting halls and nightclubs. The citizens want to put Nagano on the map and are looking forward to the coming of 'internationalisation', in the form of an influx of western visitors. For now, though, it remains a city of shadows. I arrived early on a Saturday evening, when most Japanese towns are just coming alive, and discovered that Nagano had already gone to bed. Around the station there were still some lights, with people gathered like moths around a candle. But outside of that charmed area the city had shut down. A mile-long mall of dark shuttered shops led straight up the hill to a temple gate the size of a small house, where two muscular guardian deities like huge goblins glowered in the blackness. Beyond that was a cobbled street straight out of a Hiroshige print, lined with ricketty wooden houses. Occupying the entire summit of the hill was Zenkoji Temple, vast and dark with lanterns and candles glimmering inside, vases of flowers and ancient images rubbed smooth from the hands of the faithful. It is one of the area's most famous pilgrimage places, and is already preparing for the expected influx of visitors in 1998. While most temples sell good luck charms from little stalls, at Zenkoji you buy them day or night from a vending machine. Goshiki-no-yu was darker still. From Nagano I took a local train out to the foot of the hills, then changed to a bus which careered along narrow unlit roads, zigzagging up the mountainside until we came to a single lonely house, halfway up. The master of the house came out to greet me. Mr Mizuno is 73 and has kept the inn there ever since he got back from the war, nearly 50 years ago, in the days when the only lighting was from oil lamps. He shepherded me to my room, made sure I was well provided with bedding, and instructed me in the intricacies of the bath. The gentlemen guests, he informed me, had already bathed, so I would be able to bath in privacy. In Japan it would be unthinkable to go on holiday for a few days without taking the waters. The glory of Goshiki-no-yu is that the baths are outdoors, and the water is said to change colour depending on the weather (go-shiki no yu means 'five-colour hot water'). You leave your dressing-gown in a small changing shed, then, with nothing but a handkerchief-sized towel to preserve modesty, stumble out into the night. Ghostly swirls of steam rose from the pools and streams and there was a nose-wrinkling rotten-egg smell of sulphur. I dipped my toe into the murky depths to test the temperature, then eased in and sat back with a sigh of bliss in the steaming water. I was all alone in the darkness, with just the stars and moon, scudding clouds, the silhouette of the hillside against the night sky and the lights of the inn flickering behind me. Inside, a gourmet dinner was awaiting me: tiny river crabs, the size of a 10p piece, deep-fried whole, legs and all; an assortment of leaves fried in tempura batter, and various wild plants. While I ate, Mr Mizuno settled down to tell me his stories. In the daylight Goshiki-no-yu was less magical. The mystical coloured water turned out to be black - so black that you couldn't see your own body in it. This was no doubt on account of the weather, and I remain convinced that it is truly go-shiki: on other days it is undoubtedly green, blue, grey or even purple. Mr Mizuno had asked me to write a poem to commemorate my visit, an offer which cannot be refused in Japan. After much head-scratching, this is what I came up with: Life by lamplight Seventy-three years of memories Goshiki-no-yu Japan Air Lines (JAL), British Airways, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Virgin all fly non-stop between London and Tokyo. The standard return Pex fare is a little over Pounds 1,000; bucket shop tickets start at about Pounds 550 for Aeroflot. Before you leave, buy a Japan Rail Pass, which allows you to use all the JR trains, including the Shinkansen (Bullet Train). A week's pass costs about Pounds 150. There are also two- and three-week passes. Available from JAL or the Japan Travel Bureau (JTB), 14 Maltravers St, London W1, 071-836-9393; not available in Japan. Getting around: a railway timetable costs Pounds 2 from any station kiosk; ask for jikokuhyo. It can be deciphered with a little effort and will prove invaluable. Accommodation: as Japan's premier resort, Karuizawa is not cheap. The grandest hotel in town is the Mampei (0267-42-1234; twin rooms from about Pounds 125 per night). Those in search of budget accommodation should go one stop up the line to Naka-Karuizawa, where there are some cheaper inns; for details, ask the Japan National Tourist Organisation (see below). In Nagano, the Ikemon (0262-27-2122), opposite the station, has cosy rooms for about Pounds 32 per night. At Goshiki-no-yu there is only one inn: Goshiki-no-yu ryokan (0262-42- 2500; about Pounds 85 per head, including dinner and breakfast. If pressed, Mr Mizuno's son can speak some English. Both in Japan and elsewhere, the Japan National Tourist Organisation (JNTO) is an invaluable source of information and supplies excellent (free) city maps. In London: 167 Regent Street, London W1R 7FD (071-734-9638/9). In Japan look for the Tourist Information Centres, (TIC), run by the JNT0, at Narita Airport and in Tokyo and Kyoto. The fall in the pound and other currencies against the yen has hit travellers to Japan severely. As a result, the guide prices quoted above may lack precision.</p>

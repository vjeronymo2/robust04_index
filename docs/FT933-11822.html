			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Spain seeks accord on budget deficit cut TRIPARTITE talks with employers and unions opened yesterday in Madrid and are seen as a key test of the government's ability to restore investor confidence in the troubled Spanish economy. At issue is whether the government will achieve a negotiated agreement to contain a spiralling budget deficit and reduce rising labour costs that have damaged Spain's competitiveness. 'Unless the government courageously deals with the deficit and introduces flexibility to the labour market, Spain will soon be immersed in a vicious circle of inflation and devaluation,' said Mr Luis de Guindos, chief executive of managed funds at Madrid security house AB Asesores. The talks, which will seek to negotiate what the government calls a 'social pact for employment', have become more urgent because of the deteriorating economy and pressure on the peseta. Officials said the main purpose of yesterday's meeting was to establish a timetable for the negotiations. Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy and finance minister who is chairing the talks, has however warned that if no agreement is forthcoming well before the end of this year, the government will act unilaterally to cut social spending, hold down wage increases and revise existing labour legislation. The government has already proposed a thorough reform of existing laws on hiring, job classifications and sacking. Mr Solbes, a non-Socialist in the Socialist party-led government, wants to reduce the budget deficit, currently running at around 5 per cent of GDP and nearly double the forecast figure, to 4.5 per cent next year and to 3 per cent in 1996. To achieve this the government will almost certainly have to cut back on social spending and also possibly raise taxes on consumer goods. Mr Solbes' second task will be to persuade the unions that high wages and rigidities in the labour market have eroded Spain's competitiveness and are a direct cause of a dramatic increase in unemployment. Salary rises this year have averaged 7 per cent, more than two points above the headline inflation rate. The unions are likely to offer salary moderation but talks will be tougher over reduced social benefits and proposed changes to labour legislation. Mr Solbes has two trump cards. One is that Spain is in its deepest recession in living memory and that radical measures are required to rectify the situation. The minister has forecast below zero GDP growth this year and quarterly employment figures which will be released later this week are expected to reveal that more than 100,000 jobs were lost in the past three months, raising the jobless total to over 3.5m. The other card is that unless the financial markets perceive that the government is addressing the fundamental problems of its economy, preferably through negotiated settlements, the peseta will come under sustained pressure.</p>

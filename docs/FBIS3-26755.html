They have  recovered nearly 350 million yuan for the victims, an increase  of 500 percent over the previous year.    Shanghai seized nearly 600 fake imported color televisions  in  two months last year and in the second half of the year, 180  sets of counterfeit Mitsubishi 5G6 air conditioners were seized.  From April to June last year, a Taiwanese businessman purchased  and brought 1,537 used suits to Shanghai, where he hired some  people to wash and sort these clothes out. Then he attached  labels of trademark he brought from Taiwan to these clothes and  put them on sale at a stall he had rented in a garment center in  Shanghai. Some 590 suits were sold at 180,000 yuan or more.  Smuggling, trafficking, fraud in sale and purchase based on  economic contracts, and other activities are getting more  rampant than ever and have shown signs of spreading from  individuals to enterprises.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Healthcare deals top Dollars 18bn in first half More than Dollars 18bn changed hands in mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare industry in the first six months of 1994 and deal-making is continuing at a fast pace, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the management consultancy. Deals worth Dollars 18.4bn (Pounds 11.9bn) were completed in the first half of 1994. At least another Dollars 18bn worth of bids and deals have already been struck in the second half of the year. 'The entire US healthcare system is being turned upside down,' said Mr Robert Esposito, US national director of KPMG's biotechnology and life sciences practice. 'New legislation is being stalled in Congress but the healthcare industry is restructuring itself ready for a new environment.' Of the 37 mergers and acquisitions in the first half, all but seven involved US companies. The two biggest deals were American Home Products' bid of almost Dollars 10bn for American Cyanamid and Roche of Switzerland's Dollars 5.3bn for California's Syntex. Two deals were vertical integrations - unusual for the drugs industry - as Eli Lilly of the US and SmithKline Beecham of the UK bought drug distributors PCS and Diversified Pharmaceutical Services respectively. The busiest company was SmithKline which has concluded three deals - two as buyer, one as seller - worth a total of Dollars 6.2bn. Only one of the ten deals the merger of Akzo of the Netherlands and Nobel Industrie of Sweden, was wholly non-US. Mr Esposito argues that the deal-making will continue as drug companies struggle to maintain revenues. As well as healthcare legislation, they face patent expiries - drugs with annual revenues of Dollars 20bn a year will lose US patent protection over the next decade. Many drug companies are turning to the biotechnology sector, rich in research possibilities but in need of funding, to complement their own research programmes. KPMG recorded more than 200 new alliances established between drug companies and biotechnology companies in the first half of the year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 SUCCESSFUL BIDS THIS YEAR IN HEALTHCARE-RELATED COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Buyer                   Target             Price    Comment                                          (Dollars)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- American Home Products  American Cyanamid   9.7bn   One drug company (US)                    (US)                        buys another Roche (Switzerland)     Syntex (US)         5.3bn   One drug company                                                     buys another Eli Lilly (US)          PCS (US)              4bn   Drug company buys                                                     distributor Sandoz (Switzerland)    Gerber (US)         3.7bn   Drug company                                                     diversifies into                                                     foods SmithKline Beecham      Sterling Health     2.9bn   SB boosts consumer (UK)                    (US)(consumer drugs)        drugs side/Eastman                                                     Kodak exits health Akzo (Netherlands)      Nobel (Sweden)      2.4bn   Chemicals companies                                                     merge SmithKline Beecham      DPS (US)            2.3bn   Drug company buys (UK)                                                distributor Sanofi (France)         Sterling Health     1.8bn   Elf Aquitaine unit                         (US)                        expands/Eastman                         (prescription drugs)        Kodak exits health Bayer (Germany)         Sterling Health       1bn   Bayer reclaims US                         (US)                        brand names/                         (part of US operation)      SmithKline disposal Ivax (US)               Zenith (US)          600m   Generics                                                     manufacturers merge  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: KPMG/FT Research  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hungarian privatisation, Page 27</p>

The report states that according to data from Epidemiology,  some 800,000 square kilometers of the country's territory has  been affected by this illness and are classified as malaria zone.    The report adds that some 2,500,000 persons live in this  zone, many of whom have contracted the illness, and the majority  are in a state of risk.    The malaria zones are in the departments of Santa Cruz,  Beni,  Pando, and Cochabamba; there are also malaria zones north of La  Paz and Potosi, and in areas of Tarija.    With respect to Oruro, the report indicates that this  district is free of the disease, due to its being surrounded by  areas of other departments that do not have the disease.    In recent years, 2,559 infants have been recorded as having  the disease, but they are the only sector of the population  counted because they are treated for one thing or another in  health centers.    The campaigns making vaccination of infants almost  obligatory  have facilitated such records, which is not the case for adults.    In many cases, he added, adults who have suffered from  malaria and recovered or died, have not been reported to the  health centers or authorities so that this could be recorded.

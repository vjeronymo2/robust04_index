			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / George calls for a cut in recriminations As Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, put it last night, improving the financing of Britain's 2.5m small companies is 'an amorphous sort of problem'. The Bank's paper, following its inquiry among banks and small business groups last year, does not propose any simple solution. Instead it argues that the two sides have more in common than is generally thought, and should work to improve understanding further. Mr George last night rebutted the notion that banks are to blame for the 55,000 failures among small businesses each year. He argued that a more stable economy 'would go a very long way to reducing the tensions that have grown up'. He had been encouraged by the amount of agreement in spite of the 'exaggerated expectations' of some small businesses and 'insensitivity' of some banks. The debate should be 'carried forward in a constructive way, with rather less mutual recrimination'. The conclusion that the two sides should talk to each other more is uncontroversial. But Mr George seems to have decided that someone should say it. The exercise can be seen as part of Mr George's effort to establish independence from the Treasury. By setting its own terms, the Bank has distanced itself from inquiries into loan margins ordered in 1991 and 1993 by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor. The Bank reaches seven conclusions, which it says are its own rather than agreed principles. But it nevertheless tried to ensure that they were backed by banks and small companies. It held a meeting of all sides last month to discuss a final draft. The paper's conclusions are: Banks are committed to the finance of small business, and are trying to provide alternatives to lending through overdrafts. Other forms of financing include medium-term and long-term loans at fixed and floating interest rates. Bank managers will have to be better trained to assess the right mix of finance. Most small companies accept the need to improve financial and management skills. According to one estimate, just 10 per cent of very small businesses produce adequate accounts. Some banks may consider offering better terms to small businesses with well-trained managers. Late payment of bills remains a significant problem for many small businesses and may lead to them collapsing. A change of business culture is needed, and both banks and small companies increasingly support a statutory right to interest on unpaid bills. The government is consulting on this now. There should be measures to encourage equity investment in small companies. Banks may find this costly because of the management expertise required, but venture capital companies and 'business angels' should be encouraged. A replacement for the Unlisted Securities Market could be 'valuable'. There are worries about the impact on small businesses of new legislation such as the Consumer Credit Act and changes in the insolvency rules. Banks have argued that if their claim to assets in insolvencies is weakened, this will make them less likely to lend to small businesses. Small companies have particular difficulties entering new export markets. This may be helped by selling unpaid debt at a discount through methods including factoring and invoice discounting. All parties involved in the discussions accept that banks are not public utilities, and need to 'price risk realistically'. The risks and costs associated with small business lending are relatively high. One difficulty with these principles is that they are not worded precisely enough to form targets. Although the British Bankers' Association emphasised yesterday that the proportion of fixed-term lending was rising, its leaders said this figure could not be used to measure future progress. This means that the problem may not only be amorphous, but have an intangible solution. Mr George appears to think that the initiative will be judged by whether public acrimony between banks and small businesses has eased when he re-examines the problem later this year.</p>

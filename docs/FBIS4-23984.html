			<p>BFN     [Text] The Liberia Peace Council [LPC] says the first  national [word indistinct] newspaper must retract its front-page  story of 18 June [word indistinct] captioned [word indistinct]  Checkpoint Accusing ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] of Transporting Arms for the  LPC. In a release issued this afternoon, the LPC says the story  is of blatant lie calculated to lend support for the NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] charges that the ECOMOG  supports the LPC. The LPC says it has never received arms and  ammunition from any contingent in ECOMOG, nor has any carrier of  ECOMOG transported arms for the organization.    The LPC in a release states categorically that it has not  imported any arms into Liberia and the NPFL is its principal  supplier of arms and ammunition since the NPFL's arsenal in the  invasion of Sinoe County and the Liberia Agriculture Company,  LAC, provided enough supplies to the LPC for its advances  against the NPFL. The LPC further says Mr. Taylor's recent  national call is part of the NPFL campaign to discredit ECOMOG  and would not allow its organization to be used by NPFL  loyalists masquerading as journalists who are supporters of  ECOMOG.    The LPC in the release pledges support for the ECOWAS,  [Economic Community of West African States], ECOMOG, and all  international organizations for working to restore peace and  constitutional democracy to Liberia.    Meanwhile, ECOMOG has termed as speculation the front-page  story in the 11-17 June edition of the [words indistinct]  newspaper, captioned War in Buchanan, stating that (?10)  peacekeepers died at the front. ECOMOG says the story was only  intended to embarass ECOMOG and create unnecessary stampede in  Buchanan for reasons known to the paper. ECOMOG says there is  no medical record in ECOMOG headquarters to accord the story any  credence. ECOMOG noted that the paper did not seek to  crosscheck facts to achieve [words indistinct] was an important  element in news reporting. The ECOMOG release is again advising  the media to always cross check facts, rumors, and speculations  concerning ECOMOG before publication.</p>

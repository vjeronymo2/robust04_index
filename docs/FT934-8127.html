			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / People: Lankester replaces Holland at education Sir Geoffrey Holland, permanent secretary at the Department for Education, has announced that he is to leave the job only ten months after moving to the department. The department is currently in the throes of a review by the consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, aimed, according to Whitehall sources, at 'rooting out the left-wing educational establishment', from the department. Right-wing think-tanks believe the department deliberately sabotaged the government's national curriculum reforms. However, Sir Geoffrey's move seems more to save commuting time than to escape hot water. He has lived for the last six years in West Cornwall and commuted weekly to London. His new job, as vice-chancellor of Exeter university, which he will start next April, means he will no longer need to be so familiar with Paddington station. Sir Geoffrey is still only 53, and moved to the education department after five years as permanent secretary at employment. His successor at education, Tim Lankester, perhaps significantly, is also being drafted from outside the department. Lankester is a former banker and economist who started his civil service career in the treasury, followed by a stint working as Margaret Thatcher's private secretary. Aged 51, his current post is second permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration.</p>

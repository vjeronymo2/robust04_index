			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 8 Jan (AFP) -- UN Under Secretary  General Marrack Goulding was present today at meetings between  the Guatemalan Government and guerrillas, which began three days  ago in Mexico City.    Goulding continued the process that began Friday during  which  both delegations are meeting separately with UN officials,  including mediator Jean Arnault.    The secrecy surrounding the topics discussed and whether a  consensus has been reached was maintained again today.  Guerrilla Commander Pablo Monsanto, however, said that "the  meeting is taking place under positive terms" and thus did not  rule out the possibility of reaching an agreement if the current  pace continues.    Goulding's unexpected arrival has caused observers to  believe  that an agreement could be reached on Sunday, when the current  round of talks is scheduled to end.    The topics discussed include human rights, the situation of  Conciliator Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada, whose mediation the  government no longer recognizes, and the participation of  civilian society in the solution of the conflict.    Meanwhile, leaders of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary  Unity rejected accusations by the Army that the URNG is linked  to the guerrilla uprising in the Mexico's Chiapas State.</p>

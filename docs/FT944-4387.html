			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Avon Rubber falls to Pounds 8.55m - Lossmaking operations, since sold, behind decline Lossmaking operations, which have since been sold, reduced Avon Rubber's annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.55m, from a restated Pounds 11m. But on continuing activities, the group achieved a 16 per cent rise from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 13.5m. Turnover on continuing activities in the 12 months to October 1 increased 7.6 per cent to 272m (Pounds 253m). Mr Stephen Willcox, chief executive designate, said: 'I think it is a year when we've done quite a lot of sorting out and are now well-positioned to go forward.' Disappointment at the figures caused the share price to be marked down 26p to 494p. The final dividend of 11.5p maintains the total at 16.5p. Basic earnings per share were 14.2p (30p) and on continuing businesses 32p (32.4p). During the summer, Avon Rubber disposed of its inflatables business, which accounted for about 5 per cent of group sales and had lost Pounds 3m in three years. A 30 per cent stake in Motorway Tyres and Accessories was sold to the majority holder, SP Tyres. Mr Willcox said the group, which employs 5,700 people, was now shaped into the divisions it wanted, consisting of one division in North America and three in Europe. 'We are beginning to see a strengthening in all our major markets.' The acquisition in October last year of a two-thirds holding in Avon-Rubena in the Czech Republic had performed better than expected. Automotive components, the main division, increased operating profits by 79 per cent to Pounds 6.98m, on sales up 23 per cent to Pounds 122.6m. Capital expenditure of Pounds 20m included investment in Avon-Clevite in Europe and Cadillac in the US, which were reported to be progressing strongly. A net cash outflow this year had been expected and gearing rose from 23.8 per cent to 42.2 per cent. Mr John Harper, finance director, said the rise in base rates would not have a significant effect.</p>

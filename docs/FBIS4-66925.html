			<p>BFN     [Text] On Tuesday, Edouard Balladur did not rule out "a  possible resumption of nuclear testing."    "France never accepted linking the suspension of nuclear  testing to the negotiations" on a treaty which would ban testing  forever.    The prime minister has thus signalled that he has a  different  position from that of Mitterrand.    The president said on Thursday that those who succeed him  will not resume nuclear testing.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Fishing: Long to rain over us . . . MORE RAIN. As I write, it is still belting down. Water is cascading off the roof and gurgling in the gutters. The rivers are threatening to burst their banks. Amid such plenty, it is odd to recall the scourge of drought. Two years ago, the land cracked and baked, the rivers shrank until they were rivers no more and it seemed the dry spell might never end. The merchants of doom wrung their hands, predicting irreversible ruin. Even then, though, I did not give up hope entirely. I knew the wonderful capacity of rivers to renew themselves. If only, we prayed, if only it would rain again as it should in England, salvation was still possible. I remember, three Septembers ago, visiting a stretch of the upper Kennet on which I had received my rudimentary self-education in dry fly fishing a decade or so before. Then, early in the 1980s, it was a lovely piece of water to behold, crystal clear, bright with weed and golden gravel, alive with the right sort of insects and fine, canny trout. On my return, it was as if a plague had struck. The bed of the stream was dark and lifeless, the weed and gravel smothered in silt. The water itself was thick with gobbets of algae, the surface still and scummy. The trout which remained darted through the murk, as if searching in vain for the river's innocent past. The curse was lack of water. The aquifers had been sucked dry and the springs were defunct. What water there was hardly moved. Without current, the river had ceased to be a river and had become something else - a ditch. John Hounslow, the keeper of that fishery - a bright, purposeful, energetic man - did not try to disguise the scale of tragedy. But even then, in his despair, he never lost hope. Given two or three decent winters of rain, he said imploringly, the river he loved would be reborn. So, this autumn, to obtain a condition check, I went to see him again. It was a grim day, the sky the colour of coffin lead. As we made our way down to the river, the heavens opened and remained open. Once, he explained, river-keeping had been a simple game. You kept the banks clear, cut the weed, stocked the fish, cleared the hatch gates and listened politely to the anglers. Now, though, he had of necessity become a self-taught hydrodynamic engineer. The problem he faced was this. A chalk stream must have the right sort of weed if the insects and the trout are to flourish. The right sort of weed is ranunculus, and it will grow only on a gravel bottom kept clean of silt by an adequate current. He showed me where, with back-breaking labour, he had narrowed the water course to increase the flow; and where he placed tons of rock on the river bed to create little groynes, or underwater breaks; anything to accelerate the passing of the water. Along one stretch, the whole had been shifted sideways to restrict its spread and squeeze the flow. It was working. Everywhere were signs of returning life: in some places, a mere trail of ranunculus; in others, true beds of weed, thick green masses nourishing shrimp and nymphs, creating larders for trout. And the water, clear and pure as ever, was moving again. The sickness. however, had by no means departed. Despite several weeks of almost constant rain, the level of water was still pitifully low compared with what I remembered of this fishery in its prime. The top stretch, for instance, remained virtually barren of weed, even though the bed has been kept clean. The springs which feed the Kennet at its source are still too depleted to provide the volume of water needed to restore complete well-being. So, the patient is convalescent. There is life where, a year or two ago, all one could see was a creeping death. Strength is returning, but slowly, slowly. For a full recovery, time is needed, and the constant care and attention of a dedicated keeper. Ultimately, though, the fate of the river is beyond the power of mere men to determine. Nature must do its stuff. Let the gentle rain drop from heaven - and keep dropping.</p>

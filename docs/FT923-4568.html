			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Collecting: Bargain times in antique country - Antony Thorncroft visits the Cotswolds where dealers are waiting out the recession with quiet resignation IT WOULD be stretching credulity to pretend that all is well with the dealers in the Cotswolds in south central England, the second greatest concentration of traders in important antiques outside London. The recession has hit them hard for two years. Turnover has slumped - and there are few signs of any immediate improvement. But unlike London, few Cotswolds dealers have closed their shops. Most own their premises and their running costs are much lower than in London. They can survive on less custom and they have adapted to reduced circumstances. Many are working more aggressively to attract business. The factors which persuaded them to open in the Cotswolds - the relaxed pace of life, the beauty of the countryside, the proximity of fellow dealers and connoisseur customers - are helping them get through the quiet times with good-natured resignation. Their main complaint is that fewer buyers are making the pleasant, speedy run up the M40 from London to the Cotswolds. In particular trade purchases have virtually disappeared. In the past the Cotswolds were a clearing house of quality antiques. Runners (who sniff out bargains from auctions and traders all over the UK) brought goods to the Cotswold dealers, most of whom are conveniently clustered in such centres as Stow-in-the-Wold, Burford and Broadway. These were then sold on to the London trade. But now dealers, often under orders from their banks to cut back on their overdrafts, and with fewer customers to sell to anyway, have reduced their stock greatly. This is specially true of the interior decorators, who found many choice items of early pottery and furniture in the Cotswolds. The Americans, the other traditional source of custom, have also become rare birds of passage. They have been falling away for some time. In the recent past the American desertion was made good by continentals but although there are still Italians and Germans passing through their numbers are down too. The Cotswolds have also been hit by the troubles of Lloyd's, the London insurance market, and the collapse of the housing market. Many of the richest Lloyd's 'Names' live in the area and in happier times spent their wealth on antiques; many more used the Cotswolds to furnish their second, country, home. They have stopped buying; indeed some are forced to dispose of antiques, causing problems for those dealers that guarantee to take back the goods they sell. However, it is the dearth of new home purchases that has been most keenly felt, plus the problems of the luxury country hotels which were also voracious buyers of antiques. Many Cotswold dealers specialise in antiques that are ideal for furnishing country mansions: a revival in the property market would stimulate business. Most dealers have come to terms with the recession. It helps that they tend to be general traders, concentrating on furniture, the sector of the antiques market which has held up best. The main casualties in London have been the picture dealers, especially those selling contemporary art. Most people do not need another painting, but they do need something to sit on or eat off. The Cotswolds have few dealers specialising in pictures and even fewer who stock the avant-garde. John Noott of Broadway probably has the largest stock of pictures in the region, ranging from the 17th century to the present day. 'Now I only buy pictures I think I can sell; I cannot afford to buy for stock. Most of my business is with old customers. New clients who buy on impulse are very rare.' Sales are perhaps half the level of two years ago and 'I can't see many rays of hope. We need a return of the 'feel good' factor. Still, if you are cash rich and take a long view this is now a good time to buy'. Noott is thinking of closing his second gallery which concentrates on contemporary works, but will continue to sell contemporary paintings: 'They are cheaper'. Among the artists Noott will show at the 20th Century Art Fair at the Royal College of Art in London this month is his son. By a nice coincidence the Swan Gallery in Burford, run by Dominic Pratt, is decorated with works by his father, Jeffery. Obviously keeping things in the family is cost effective. Pratt is one of the few Cotswold dealers who seems busy and buoyant. He concentrates on country furniture from 1680 to 1730. He pursues a policy of buying furniture of good colour at the right price and selling it quickly. His margins are lower but he stays busy. Pratt points to a Queen Anne chest of drawers of 1710. 'It is priced at Pounds 2,200. It would have been Pounds 4,000 two years ago. I will probably take Pounds 1,800 for it. That Charles II corner chair would have been Pounds 750 two years ago. It is marked at Pounds 475, and I might let it go for Pounds 400.' Undoubtedly prices are lower, mainly because dealers are acquiring stock more cheaply, partly because they have reduced their margins, often from, say, 40 per cent to nearer 20 per cent. This should bring in buyers. After all, you can buy genuine 18th century items of furniture at prices lower than it would cost to make a reproduction. It is impossible to tour the Cotswolds antique dealers without being struck by the bargains on offer - Victorian desks for Pounds 800; Georgian clocks for Pounds 1,200; a pair of Chippendale chairs for Pounds 6,500 (at David Pickup in Burford, who also has a three piece William Morris suite for Pounds 5,500). There is also the knowledge that dealers will trim prices, or deliver for nothing, or take payment over a few months. This is especially true at warehouses such as Gateway Antiques in Burford, where the young owners buy the best pieces from the local auction houses, add on a small margin and expect to turn over stock quickly - three times a year. Gateway sells at the lower and medium price range - up to Pounds 15,000. Duncan Baggott, who has a vast stock scattered through a clutch of sites in Stow-on-the-Wold, has antiques from Pounds 16.50 to Pounds 50,000. He is perhaps the bell-wether Cotswolds dealer, long established and a beneficiary of the 1980s boom. Three years ago most of his business was through his trade warehouse; now it is through his two shops. Then he might have turned his stock round five times a year; now he turns it over once. But it is more expensive stock: he has seen income rise and profit fall. He also has to sell that much harder. When I met him he had just sent two items to London on approval: if they fitted well into the prospective buyer's home they would stay. Selling things on spec' is one way of helping to clinch a sale. Another is to take antiques in part exchange. Free delivery is also on offer. All the goods in Baggott's shops carry typed labels with their price and history: anything to keep the discounts down. In a buyer's market, says Baggott, 'somebody will offer Pounds 6,000 for an item priced at Pounds 12,000. I might settle for Pounds 10,500'. Dealers margins are already squeezed by such expenses as higher bank charges and business rates and they cannot give too much away. Stow, Broadway and Burford attract thousands of visitors a day in the summer  -but they rarely buy antiques. The dealers tend to have a few jokey items that might catch their fancy. Baggott was offering 19th century Lancashire clogs at Pounds 65 a pair. He also had golf clubs for Pounds 50 or so, but anyone seriously interested in golf clubs and sporting memorabilia would know about Manfred Schotten's shop in Burford, which has one of the largest collections in the UK. He has recently purchased one of the late 19th century bright red jackets worn by members of the Leicester Golf Club to show their presence on the course. He can offer golf clubs of the 1860s for Pounds 4,500; garlanded Eton rowing boaters for Pounds 200; and a rare and prized item, an 18th century real tennis racket for around Pounds 3,500. Business in this specialist sector has slowed. Schotten usually buys only with a collector in mind and sends out many more mailing shots to likely purchasers. You must hunt for business these days. For Huntington Antiques of Stow this means buying in the US. Michael Golding finds that the weak dollar enables him to re-patriate some of the English furniture that went across the Atlantic in the 1930s. Ironically his best customer is an American collector who is furnishing his Missouri home with Pounds 250,000 worth of early English furniture, the Huntington speciality. Many dealers can hardly be bothered talking about the recession and the lower level of demand. Of more concern are two other restraints - the attitude of the banks, and robberies. The local banks, under pressure from their head offices, are making things more difficult by increasing charges or reducing overdraft levels. Robberies are the unwanted hassle. Some dealers have been 'ram raided', their shop fronts smashed in by cars. Some have been burgled many times and rarely are the antiques recovered. But the dealers keep their spirits up. The Cotswolds Antique Dealers Association helps with promotion and encourages a feeling of co-operation. English furniture is now cheap compared with French and American antique furniture and the bargains on offer must be appreciated soon. Anyone who lost interest in antiques when their prices rocketed in the late 1980s should take another look. Not only are prices considerably lower but dealers are willing to bargain: bank managers want sales as a sign of activity. Anyone feeling like a country break could do much worse than motor down to this bucolic region and window shop. I would be very surprised if they did not come back with at least one purchase.</p>

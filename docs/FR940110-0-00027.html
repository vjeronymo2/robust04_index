It also makes minor changes in response to public comments on the interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim rule was necessary to implement section 4201(d)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90).

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chronic renal failure (CRF) is a progressive and usually irreversible decline in kidney function that does not always require regular dialysis. However, CRF patients who have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) do require a regular course of dialysis or kidney transplantation in order to sustain life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 299I of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (Pub. L. 92&hyph;603) established the Medicare ESRD benefit by extending coverage to any individual who requires either dialysis or transplantation and meets the following requirements: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Is fully or currently insured or entitled to monthly benefits under title II of the Social Security Act; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is the spouse or dependent child of the insured or entitled individual. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The methods and amounts of payment for services to ESRD patients have changed over the years and are currently set forth in &sect;&sect;410.50, 410.52, and 413.170&hyph;413.179 of the HCFA rules. Law and program policy have moved over the years towards encouraging greater use of self-dialysis and home dialysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 1, 1989, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the generic drug epoetin which we commonly refer to as ``EPO''. EPO is a sterile, colorless, preservative-free, liquid, biologically engineered protein that stimulates the bone marrow to make new red blood cells. EPO may be covered under the Medicare program when used to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure. Most chronic renal failure patients are anemic because their kidneys are unable to produce sufficient amounts of a substance called erythropoietin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Patients with chronic renal failure include those who require renal dialysis and are eligible for Medicare under the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) provisions of the law. In accordance with the labeling approved by the FDA, EPO may be administered either intravenously or subcutaneously for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure or anemia induced by the drug AZT used by patients with the HIV virus. Individuals with chronic renal failure use the drug to elevate or maintain the red blood cell level (as measured by the hematocrit or hemoglobin level) and to decrease the need for blood transfusions. Chronic renal patients considered for initiation of EPO therapy should generally have a hematocrit of less than 30%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In July, 1989, we issued instructions in the Provider Reimbursement Manual_Part 1 (Chapter 27, Transmittal 11) authorizing Medicare contractors to start paying for the drug EPO, as of June 1, 1989. Coverage instructions were issued in November 1989 in the Intermediary Manual_Part 3 (Transmittal 1449), Carriers Manual_Part 3 (Transmittal 1329), Hospital Manual (Transmittal 576) and the Renal Dialysis Facility Manual (Transmittal 42). The effective date of the coverage instructions was also June 1, 1989. The Medicare regulations were not amended at that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before enactment of Public Law 101&hyph;508 (OBRA '90), home use of EPO was not covered. For patients who dialyzed at home to receive Medicare payment for EPO, the drug had to be administered either in an ESRD facility or as a service ``incident to'' a physician's professional services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Statutory Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4201(d)(1) of OBRA '90 amended section 1861(s)(2) of the Act by adding a new subparagraph (Q) that_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Provides for coverage, effective July 1, 1991, of EPO that is used by home dialysis patients who are competent to use the drug without medical or other supervision and for coverage of items related to administration of the drug; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Requires the Secretary to establish by regulation methods and standards for the safe and effective use of the drug at home. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

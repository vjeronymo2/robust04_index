			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TORNADO CLEANUP UNDER WAY IN SOUTH  </P> <P> Thousands of work crews took to the streets across Georgia and Alabama on  Sunday to clean up from a barrage of powerful thunderstorms and tornadoes that  wrecked dozens of homes and knocked out power to 600,000 utility customers.  </P> <P> Some 38,000 homes in Alabama and 14,000 in Georgia remained without power  Sunday as utility crews worked to clear away fallen tree limbs and replace  downed power lines, authorities said.  </P> <P> At the height of Saturday's storms, 500,000 homes were without power in  Georgia, mostly in the Atlanta area. The storms cut electricity to 112,000  homes across Alabama.  </P> <P> Up to 13 tornadoes and straight-line winds to 90 m.p.h. tore through the South  on Saturday, killing at least four people and injuring scores of others.  Tornadoes were reported in Georgia, Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, Florida and  South Carolina, the National Weather Service said.  </P> <P> "This really qualifies as the worst storm we've had since 1973," said Tripp  Cagle, a spokesman for the Georgia Power Co. "We're hoping we can get everyone  on by Sunday night."  </P> <P> More than 2,000 cleanup crews from sheriffs' departments and other law  enforcement agencies were clearing debris and downed trees all over Georgia,  officials said.  </P> <P> The weather service said the most serious tornado struck in south Cobb County  in suburban Atlanta, leveling six homes and damaging 44 others in one  subdivision. The weather service said the tornado's winds reached 115 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Four people in the Atlanta area were killed by falling trees.  </P> <P> In Alabama, Lawrence Bowden of the state Emergency Management Agency said a  damage survey showed more than 300 mobile homes and houses were destroyed and  as many as 50 businesses were either destroyed or damaged. A dollar estimate on  the damage had not yet been made, he said. More than 40 people were injured,  nine requiring hospitalization.  </P> <P> Some homeless Alabamians were put up in shelters Saturday night but most stayed  with relatives, Bowden said.  </P> <P> In the Pacific Northwest, another wave of Pacific storms pushed ashore in  Washington and Oregon, triggering heavy rains and snow above 500 feet. A  half-inch of rain soaked the coastal town of Astoria, Ore., during a six-hour  period.  </P> <P> Storms over the last two weeks have dropped 85 inches of snow over the  Washington Cascades, forecasters said.  </P> <P> Winds gusting to 60 m.p.h. prompted the weather service to post high wind  warnings for eastern Washington. High wind warnings also were in effect for  parts of Idaho and Montana.  </P> <P> Showers and thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain in southern Florida.  Nearly an inch of rain fell at Ft. Myers and a half inch at Vero Beach during a  six-hour period.  </P></p>

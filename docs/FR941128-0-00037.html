			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The 1988 final rule was subsequently challenged in Federal District Court. On August 30, 1990, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order in the case of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Wildlife Federation, et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Manuel Lujan, Jr., et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  31 Env't Rep. Cas. (BNR) 2034, 2042 (D.D.C. 1990) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NWF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The district court remanded the rule to the Secretary to be withdrawn or revised on the basis that the Secretary's arguments supporting the rule were inconsistent with the inspection frequency requirements of Section 517(c) of the Act. However, the district court conceded that the rule was practical, that it comported with common sense, and that it is not wise to spend a lot of time and effort inspecting abandoned sites every month when nothing changes. To implement the court's order, OSM suspended those parts of the 1988 rule that related to inspection frequency at abandoned sites. The definition of ``abandoned site'' at 30 CFR 840.11(g) and 842.11(e) and the provision at 30 CFR 843.22 allowing regulatory authorities to refrain from issuing additional enforcement actions at abandoned sites were unaffected by the court order and remain intact today (56 FR 25036, June 3, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In appealing the district court decision, the Secretary asked the United States Court of Appeals to vacate the district court's remand in order to allow him to promulgate a new regulation redefining ``abandoned sites'' to include only those sites where a permit has expired or been revoked. Under this approach, Section 517(c) of the Act would not apply to abandoned sites because the inspection frequency requirements of that section speak only to surface coal mining and reclamation operations covered by a permit and a permit that is expired or revoked is no longer considered to be in existence. Without expressing any view about whether the Secretary's proposed reading of Section 517(c) of the Act was permissible, the court of appeals pointed out that the district court remanded the 1988 rule to the Secretary ``to be withdrawn or revised'' and, in light of this statement, the district court's decision does not stand in the way of the Secretary proceeding with an alternative rulemaking on the subject of inspection frequently at abandoned sites. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NWF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Civ. Action Nos. 890136, 88&hyph;3345 &amp; 88&hyph;2416, U.S. App. Ct. (DC Circ., December 10, 1991) mem. op. at 10. Accordingly, on December 18, 1992, OSM proposed for public comment an alternative abandoned sites rule upon which today's final rule is based (57 FR 60410).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is required under section 201(c)(2) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1211(c)(2), to publish necessary implementing rules. Since regular inspections of abandoned sites are a counterproductive use of limited resources, and since fewer inspections are not likely to result in increased environmental harm, the rule being promulgated today is necessary and is consistent with the district court's opinion in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NWF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which struck down the previous 1988 abandoned sites rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In promulgating the 1988 rule on abandoned sites, OSM concluded that repeated inspections of abandoned sites at the frequency required under the existing rules are ineffective expenditures of resources and that fewer inspections would not result in increased harm to the environment or reduce the likelihood of ultimate compliance at abandoned sites. The time inspectors spend at abandoned sites detracts from the time they can spend at other active or inactive sites working with viable operators to abate present violations and prevent future violations. Thus, reducing the frequency of abandoned sites improves the overall quality and effectiveness of inspection programs under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Arthur Young is fined Pounds 100,000 by regulator ARTHUR YOUNG, the accountancy firm, was yesterday fined Pounds 100,000 by its regulatory body for failing to highlight 'seriously misleading' figures in the 1984 accounts of Milbury, the collapsed house-building group controlled by Mr Jim Raper. The penalty is the largest yet imposed through the Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the self-regulatory mechanism of the institutes of chartered accountants in England, Wales and Scotland, and the Association of Certified Accountants. A committee of inquiry set up under the disciplinary scheme said Arthur Young, which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, 'fell below the standard which should be displayed by, and which may reasonably be expected of, a firm of chartered accountants serving as auditors of a public company'. Mr David Brierley and Mr Christopher Wilson, two directors of Milbury who are chartered accountants, were also 'admonished' by the committee, which launched its inquiry after a critical report by the Department of Trade and Industry on the company was published in 1988. Milbury collapsed in 1985 leaving Pounds 15m owing to creditors after issuing annual accounts for 1984 which showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m, and interim results which referred to increased operating profits and favourable expectations. The DTI criticised the Stock Exchange, Arthur Young and individuals associated with the company. Its report said Mr Raper was 'a devious man (whose) motivation is out-and-out self-interest'. Arthur Young was accused by the DTI of failing to ensure that Milbury's accounts complied with accounting standards, with the result that its profits were 'materially inflated'. The disciplinary scheme concluded that the treatment of an acquisition and loans held by the company breached accepted accounting standards; that policies for interest and advertising costs were 'inappropriate and imprudent'; and that the 1984 annual report gave a misleading impression of cash balances. It added that it had 'taken account of the absence of any acknowledgement by Arthur Young of their failings during the committee's inquiries'. Arthur Young has also been asked to contribute Pounds 40,000 towards the costs of the proceedings. Although it no longer exists, its partners at the time of the final audit remain liable. Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner at Ernst &amp; Young who was not connected with the former Arthur Young, said yesterday he was 'clearly disappointed'. The firm would probably pay the fine but, he added, 'we believe the accounts did give a true and fair view at the time.'</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE LABOR POLICIES STIRRING U.S. REBELLION  </P> <P> At a time when the auto industry is introducing Japanese-style labor practices  in American factories at an unprecedented pace, a wave of protests against  those techniques is surging across the country.  </P> <P> Production workers from Detroit to Van Nuys, from General Motors to Mazda, are  demanding an overhaul of the "team-oriented" Japanese labor-relations policies  that management experts and academics once saw as the salvation of the American  auto worker.  </P> <P> Although the dissenters are still in the minority and the United Auto Workers  union leadership still supports the team approach, the movement is gathering  momentum.  </P> <P> Increasingly, workers and dissident union officers charge, Japanese-style labor  practices are being abused by American managers and supervisors -- both at the  Big Three and at the new U.S. plants run by the Japanese -- to speed up  assembly lines, eliminate jobs and increase work loads.  </P> <P> Workers have also become disillusioned by what they contend are management's  broken promises. Although they were told that they would have job security and  a say in the management of their operations under the new, more flexible "team"  approach, many now find that layoffs still happen and supervisors still have  the last word.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Workers 'Aren't Satisfied'  </P> <P> "There is no question there is a rebellion going on," said Don Douglas,  president of a union local at a GM plant in Pontiac, Mich., and the leader of a  grass-roots dissident movement within GM. "People aren't satisfied with those  Japanese ideas.  </P> <P> "These companies are trying to get lean and mean, and the Japanese style is how  they do it. But all it is is a maximization of labor, pushing people to the  brink, treating people like robots."  </P> <P> Most workers and union officers still find little fault with the theories of  labor-management cooperation behind those Japanese policies, or with the need  to make American manufacturing better able to compete with imports.  </P> <P> In addition, Japanese and American managers in the auto industry remain  committed to joint labor-industry programs. They say the practices lead to  better productivity and to genuine employee involvement in plant-level  decision-making.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Goal Is Productivity  </P> <P> "The whole point of (our labor policies) is to increase productivity while at  the same time making the jobs of our workers easier and safer," said C. Robert  Leadbetter, vice president of personnel for Mazda's U.S. assembly plant here.  "And we have quite a bit of participation in our programs."  </P> <P> The national leadership of the UAW also remains committed to joint programs and  denies that the dissent in union-represented plants is widespread.  </P> <P> Yet, at both Japanese and American plants around the country, rank-and-file  workers have been registering their protests against the Japanese team concept  and the UAW leadership's willingness to see it implemented.  </P> <P> At GM plants using the team approach, workers have protested at the ballot box  by voting for dissident union leaders who are prepared to move the UAW's  national leadership away from its policy of increased cooperation with  management in the development of joint labor programs.  </P> <P> When he ran unsuccessfully to become a UAW regional director and a member of  the union's governing executive board, Douglas won landslide victories at two  of GM's newest assembly plants where the auto maker has fully implemented  team-concept labor agreements. Even though Douglas lost the region-wide race,  his strong showing shocked the UAW leadership.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, this week in Van Nuys, Calif., the majority of delegates elected by  rank-and-file union members at GM's Camaro-Firebird assembly plant to the UAW's  June national convention in Anaheim oppose the team concept introduced in the  plant's current contract. Workers there are angry that GM has announced that it  will lay off 20% of the plant's work force this summer in spite of the  Japanese-style labor agreement.  </P> <P> "The people thought that, by having a team concept, that would guarantee them  their jobs," said Joe Garcia, a local union officer at Van Nuys who opposes the  dissidents. "Now, the dissidents are blaming everything on the team concept."  </P> <P> But worker dissatisfaction is not limited to the domestic companies. There is  growing evidence that the honeymoon between management and labor in the new  U.S. plants run by the Japanese is coming to an abrupt end.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the UAW, saying it now has the support of more than half of the  work force, filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board calling  for a union election at Nissan's non-union Smyrna, Tenn., assembly complex.  </P> <P> The union's long-stalled organizing campaign at Nissan, where most workers were  initially strongly anti-union, has gained ground at Smyrna over the last year,  as more and more Nissan assembly line workers have become increasingly unhappy  with their heavy job loads and the plant's alleged safety problems.  </P> <P> A UAW victory at Nissan would be the first time the union has won a contested  representation fight with one of the Japanese auto makers. Workers at three  other Japanese-managed assembly plants are now UAW members, but those plants  all have close ties to GM, Ford or Chrysler. The UAW was able to work out  agreements through the Big Three to obtain union recognition at the plants  without any fights.  </P> <P> One of the most startling outbursts against Japanese labor practices is taking  place at Mazda's new assembly plant in this blue-collar suburb of Detroit.  </P> <P> Last week, dissidents swept to victory in the first election of officers for  the newly created UAW Local 3000, which represents the plant's 2,700 hourly  employees.  </P> <P> The victory, said workers interviewed at the plant, did not represent a  complete rejection of Mazda's theory of kaizen, or continuous improvement,  which is the basis for the company's labor policies. Rather, the vote was a  protest over the way in which kaizen has been implemented by the plant's  American supervisors.  </P> <P> "I don't think the Japanese are causing the problems, but I think the American  supervisors are running the place like a traditional American car plant," said  a Mazda worker who supported the dissidents in the election.  </P> <P> "They took the worst of both the Japanese and American systems and put them  together here," complained Mike Cornelius, a worker just elected union  committeeman on the dissident slate.  </P> <P> "What we are in there is Olympic car builders. They have got us running all  day."  </P> <P> Others believe that Mazda's supervisors are not giving workers the level of  involvement in decisions and control over their jobs that they expected.  </P> <P> "We were promised a say, let us have a say," worker Doug Davidson complained.  </P> <P> "Part of the reason we won so handily was that people feel they were a little  betrayed by all the promises Mazda made," said Phillip Keeling, the newly  elected president of Local 3000. "In orientation (for newly hired employees),  they talked about how happy-cheery Mazda was and how much they cared about your  family.  </P> <P> "It's nothing like that," Keeling added. "It is a very fast (work) pace, there  is constant pressure to cut costs, speed up the line and eliminate jobs. They  call it kaizen. It's constant pressure."  </P> <P> Yet, even Keeling insists that he has no plans to "kick in the doors" at Mazda  to eliminate kaizen, but rather hopes to modify practices at the plant and  tighten contractual loopholes when the plant's labor agreement comes up for  renegotiation in another year.  </P> <P> Still, the protest at Mazda, along with the rising chorus of dissent at other  plants, has led industry observers to wonder whether a broader rejection of  Japanese practices by workers throughout industrial America is in the offing.  </P> <P> "I think the victory at Mazda is extremely significant," said Harley Shaiken, a  specialist in labor studies at UC San Diego. "Mazda is not very different from  other Japanese plants here, so it could indicate that a backlash is developing  against these kinds of policies."  </P></p>

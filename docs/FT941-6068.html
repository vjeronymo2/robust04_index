			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Observer: We like sheep Observer is more or less inured to the stream of notices that lands on the desk detailing movements of sundry herds of City analysts/salesmen/traders - swapping one employer for another more generous with the lolly or the titles, or both. But a team of IT people, for heaven's sake? They are only glorified electricians. However, Nomura's PR machine felt moved to issue a release earlier this week announcing: 'Nomura captures systems team from CSFB.' Should the cleaners or the tea ladies decide on a change of scene, please, please leave our name off the publicity list.</p>

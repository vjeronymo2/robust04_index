			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 18 Apr (MENA) -- Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators resumed their meetings this morning with a meeting  of the Security Committee cochaired by Major General  'Abd-al-Razzaq Yahya and General Effin Agmon, deputy chief of  the Israeli Army's planning department [name and title as  received].    General 'Uzi Dayan, chief of the Israeli Army's planning  department, who was heading his country's delegation to the  talks, left Cairo last night for a day in Israel. He is  expected to return to Cairo tonight to join the talks.    According to Palestinian sources, the Legal Affairs  Committee  will resume its talks today. The committee will examine two  working papers, a Palestinian and an Israeli, concerning the  legal and judicial powers of the Palestinian authorities in the  self-rule areas.    Khalid al-Qidrah, a member of the Palestinian negotiating  team, yesterday told MENA that the paper Israel presented at the  end of the last round is "completely unacceptable."    According to Palestinian sources, members of the Civilian  Affairs Committee will meet today in subcommittees to discuss  water, communications, and other unresolved issues. Experts  from both sides will attend the meetings of the subcommittee on  water, the same sources said.    The subcommittee on communications will mainly discuss the  frequencies that the Palestinian authorities will use for  police, communications, and other purposes. The two sides  agreed on measures concerning the creation of a Palestinian  radio and television service, according to the same sources.    The Palestinian sources said that a subcommittee emanating  from the Legal Affairs Committee will begin working today on the  draft of a final agreement. The same sources said that it is  too early to speak of progress in the talks as they have just  started.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th and General Amnon Shahaq, head of the  Palestinian and Israeli delegations respectively, held a private  meeting this morning in which they discussed issues concerning  this round of talks, which will last until 21 April.</p>

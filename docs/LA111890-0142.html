			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEAR DIARY FROM VIETNAM;  </P> <P> PEACE: A WOODLAND HILLS MAN AND OTHER VETERANS RETURN TO REBUILD A MEDICAL  CLINIC DESTROYED DURING THE WAR. THE VISIT IS PAINFUL AND MEMORABLE.  </P> <P> It has been good for me to see these beautiful people and this beautiful  country at peace. All my memories of VN were of war, suffering and destruction.  I sort of loved this country though they sent us here for war. Now that it's  free, I love it even more.  </P> <P>  -- from the diary of Charles Nixon,  </P> <P> Wednesday, Sept. 12, 1990.  </P> <P> War veteran Charles Nixon returned to Vietnam this fall chiefly for  intellectual reasons -- to travel in a Third World country and, as he put it,  to witness firsthand the effects of U.S. foreign policy.  </P> <P> Maybe it's because he was an ambulance driver during his 1966-67 Army stint in  Saigon and, by his own account, was spared much of the war's horrors. He came  home to finish college, hold a steady job, marry a woman who's become his soul  mate, and start a successful contracting business -- hardly the tormented  postwar experiences of some others.  </P> <P> He was caught off guard, then, by his roller coaster emotions during the recent  visit and by the inexplicable power that Vietnam and his long-dormant memories  of it held over him.  </P> <P> "I expected to go back and visit a country at peace and learn more," Nixon said  recently in the den of his Woodland Hills home. "I didn't expect to be so moved  by the country. It was a tremendous emotional experience for me and caught me  by surprise.  </P> <P> "The biggest thing for me was all I knew about Vietnam, all my images of  Vietnam, were from the war, and I had nothing to replace them with," said  Nixon, 46, a tall, striking man who said he was brought up to fear Communists  and feelings. "Now, I have a whole country, and people, and sunsets."  </P> <P> Between Sept. 4 and Oct. 30, Nixon joined seven other veterans on a "peace and  reconciliation mission" outside Hanoi, a six-week adventure during which they  helped rebuild a medical clinic in the village of Yen Vien. According to the  Veterans Vietnam Restoration Project (VVRP), the nonprofit group that organized  the trip, the clinic had been out of use since it was destroyed by U.S. bombs  20 years ago.  </P> <P> Nixon and his colleagues lived in a guest house with dormitory-like quarters  and worked side by side with their former enemies. All were in their 40s, five  of the eight were unmarried. Several suffered post-traumatic stress as a result  of fighting in the war. They took side trips organized by the local branch of  the Communist Party, and followed the orders of Vietnamese construction  managers.  </P> <P> One veteran flew home to Kentucky during the first week after acknowledging  that he didn't feel comfortable around the Vietnamese, couldn't work with them  and couldn't control his paranoia. Others, such as Nixon's roommate from Maine,  grew so close to their foreign co-workers that they wept like children when  they said goodby.  </P> <P>  This country at peace is beautiful. Why did our government rain such awful  destruction on these people? It seems that VN is a national sore spot. Guess  Washington learned some lessons from the experience but were they the right  ones? The American people still don't understand the U.S. involvement.  </P> <P>  -- Nixon diary,  </P> <P> Wednesday, Sept. 12  </P> <P> It was the third such trip for the 2-year-old VVRP, which operates with a small  staff and donated funds in Garberville, Calif. Although Vietnam Veterans of  America has sponsored several tours in the past three years, VVRP is the only  such group that provides humanitarian aid to Vietnam, organizing volunteers to  help build medical facilities and donating medical supplies.  </P> <P> Fifteen years after the controversial war ended, organized American travel to  Vietnam is still illegal because the U.S. government maintains a trade embargo  with the country, refusing to restore normal diplomatic and commercial  relations.  </P> <P> The trips sponsored by VVRP, however, are sanctioned under a 1987 agreement  between the two countries that allows private groups to provide humanitarian  aid.  </P> <P> "We are actually participating in the construction of facilities and the trips  are just a side matter," said Scott Rutherford, VVRP's development coordinator,  adding that another trip is planned next fall.  </P> <P> Nixon described the trip as a rewarding but extremely difficult experience, in  which the group's internal dynamics, difficult as they were, were compounded  daily by the frustrations of working in a foreign culture. They had to cope  with language and cultural barriers, the intense, Southeast Asian heat and  claustrophobic humidity, "Ho Chi Minh's Revenge" and a debilitating virus that  struck the group.  </P> <P> The trip didn't change his life, Nixon said, but affirmed his political  convictions that nations have a right to self-determination and the U.S. should  not interfere. It also furthered his long effort to show emotion more openly.  </P> <P> On most days, he would work on the construction site until the early afternoon  or until he succumbed to the heat, hauling buckets of concrete and bricks by  hand or shoveling debris. Even to Nixon, a contractor, it was back-breaking  work.  </P> <P> He read a lot of Vietnamese history, and eventually felt relaxed enough to take  long bike rides through Hanoi, an ancient city of parks and trees he said he  prefers even to Paris.  </P> <P> He had been euphoric after a four-day orientation session in rural Sebastopol,  where a pair of psychologists helped the travelers get to know each other and  guided them through their tangle of feelings.  </P> <P>  "The past four days have, as everyone admits, seemed more like four weeks. As  a group we seemed to have come together, feel closer. The self-revelations and  acceptance by others has increased feelings of trust and caring. Truly a unique  experience, I felt like I had gone through a sort of emotional Basic Training."  </P> <P>  -- Nixon's diary on Tuesday,  </P> <P> Sept. 4, as the group prepared  </P> <P> to leave the United States.  </P> <P> For Nixon -- who avoided war protests when he came home because he "wanted to  get on with my life" -- it was the first time he had been exposed directly to  other veterans' suffering.  </P> <P> "One vet told about the first time he shot someone in combat," Nixon said. "He  was ambushed by three North Vietnamese and shot one in the chest. The guy cried  out in pain. Twenty years later, he still remembers it and feels guilty about  it."  </P> <P> Another, a Medal of Honor recipient, revealed a scar on his torso that "looks  like a road map" Nixon said. Another was homeless. Another had lost several  friends from the blue-collar town in New England where they grew up and were  drafted.  </P> <P> But group members drifted apart. One of Nixon's biggest disappointments was  that once in Vietnam "people retreated into their own shells and acted like  they did during the war," he said.  </P> <P> The group held a few, loosely organized "rap" sessions, but the meetings  weren't held regularly. And Nixon's efforts to record his colleagues' lives  before, during and after the war were rejected in a few cases, increasing his  loneliness and feelings of isolation.  </P> <P> Nixon said he thinks future trips should include a psychologist or counselor as  an escort, a suggestion Rutherford said VVRP was seriously considering.  </P> <P>  I keep thinking all feelings are not so pleasant but they all are better than  feeling dead or numb. I've opened myself up to a lot of pain etc., but it feels  like the right thing to do. Reaching out to those people at the restaurant was  the right thing to do even if it hurt a lot.  </P> <P>  -- Nixon diary, Monday, Oct. 15  </P> <P> A human rights activist who has traveled in Cuba and Central America with his  wife, Louise, Nixon was anxious to meet and talk with Vietnamese and learn how  the Communist society worked. Sometimes he succeeded, and on his last night in  Hanoi enjoyed dinner with a couple of government information agents he had  talked to all afternoon.  </P> <P> But Nixon said he also had a few frustrating encounters with Vietnamese --  possibly because of the language barrier, but also, he thinks, because of  lingering bitterness from the war. One evening, he had struck up a conversation  with a restaurant manager and she ordered a pot of tea -- in Vietnam, a gesture  of friendship.  </P> <P> The woman's husband joined them and after a while, Nixon invited the couple and  their 6-year-old daughter to see a movie the following night. They made a date,  and the husband even offered to pick up Nixon at his guest house.  </P> <P> But the new bond came apart when Nixon got his dinner bill. He realized the  woman had charged him for the "friendship" tea, and for a hot steamed towel he  hadn't ordered but used to be polite.  </P> <P> Nixon says he paid the higher amount, although it was clear he was upset. At  that point, he recalled, the woman's husband began a pantomime of a soldier  with a machine gun and, looking directly at Nixon, repeated "B-52 pilot, B-52  pilot" -- shorthand for the ultimate enemy to the North Vietnamese.  </P> <P> "I was really hurt and felt betrayed," Nixon later wrote in his diary. "I felt  like I opened up and made a friendly gesture and got kicked you-know-where."  </P> <P> Yet, on the last day of work Nixon's group held a banquet for their Vietnamese  co-workers and many of the Vietnamese and Americans cried, Nixon included.  </P> <P> "I had seen Ted and Truy sitting together before dinner, Ted 6 feet 2 inches,  240 pounds, carpenter-veteran; Truy 5 feet 4 inches 130 pounds," Nixon wrote  about his roommate and the man's Vietnamese friend.  </P> <P> "Truy was leaning against Ted with his head on Ted's shoulder. Truy, the NVA  soldier who could have killed some of the friends that Ted lost in the war, was  like a puppy about to be separated from his mother. So was Ted. So was I.  </P> <P> "We were all deeply moved. This was the hardest parting I've ever experienced.  I've cried at partings a little in the past, but never like this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> EXCERPTS FROM YEN VIEN DIARY  </P> <P> Sept. 9  </P> <P>  We went for walk to Hanoi. Left 10 a.m., warm and humid. Traffic crazy, people  friendly, smiles and greetings by many. Do they know we are U.S. or not?  </P> <P> Sept. 10  </P> <P>  One lady refused us service in her shop. Why? Because we were U.S.? Could she  have lost family to U.S. bombs or the war? Who knows? Maybe I should go back  with a note from my translator and ask tomorrow?  </P> <P> Sept. 11  </P> <P>  This is our 2nd day on the job site. The rare combination of heat, humidity  and hard work has humbled even the most proud of us. No one wants to impress  the Vietnamese now. We are all hoping to be able to survive a full day.  </P> <P> Sept. 15  </P> <P>  I am looking at the faces of these bright, healthy, beautiful children. I'm  reminded of the thousands and thousands of children we must have killed with  bombs and napalm during the war.  </P> <P> Sept. 19  </P> <P>  Feel nervous walking in crowds at the marketplace. So many people and anyone  could do something. Heard an Australian tourist was stabbed to death in the  street in Hanoi a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> Sept. 21  </P> <P>  Everybody here seems to be really stressed out. The work is boring and we  don't know what to do. Illness, lack of familiar things. The noise from the  traffic, horns honking, etc. is horrendous. We are planning on American movies  and dinner tomorrow to relieve the stress. Help. I'm homesick.  </P> <P> Oct. 6  </P> <P> It has been good for me to see these beautiful people and this beautiful  country at peace. All my memories of VN were of war, suffering and destruction.  I sort of loved this country though they sent us here for war. Now that it's  free, I love it even more.  </P> <P> Oct. 7  </P> <P>  The VN know how to build and we are learning from them, NOT the other way  around. Last time the US came here and tried to control the VN and get them to  do things the American way.  </P> <P> Oct. 10  </P> <P>  The people's committee took us to a variety show in Hanoi tonight. It was  interesting. Singers, comedians, even some acrobats. Even did the lambada  within one mile of Communist Party Headquarters. Decadent!  </P> <P> </P></p>

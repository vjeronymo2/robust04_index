He told a media briefing in  Pretoria the mediation should be on the scale of that of the  Palestinian/Israeli option.    Gen Viljoen accused the government and the African National  Congress [ANC] of "stalling tactics" in negotiations and the  Freedom Alliance had been put in a "pressure chamber" with four  days left before the constitutional deadline.    With a deadlock in the negotiations looming, the AVF was  prepared to use "as little violence as possible" to achieve its  goal of self- determination, Gen Viljoen said. Although the AVF  was still committed to a peaceful negotiated settlement, "there  is no way the Afrikaner can be forced into a new situation and  new nation as you make instant coffee", the general said.    He re-iterated that the AVF's own transitional authority  would be implemented in public in Pretoria on January 29 to be  mandated to "lead the Afrikaner to freedom". The AVF had made  enquiries about the international mediations and it could be  available within a week, Gen Viljoen added.    He could not divulge more information due to the sensitive  nature, he said.</p>

The puppet defence minister there blared that "a perfect  combat posture of the Army will be taken to deal with armed  provocation" of the North.    The South Korean puppets revealed their scheme to hurt  fellow  countrymen with arms, shouting themselves hoarse for "the  completion of military posture" and "an immediate retaliation"  from the beginning of the year. This shows that they will not  hesitate to light the fuse of war to slay fellow countrymen. It  must not be overlooked here that the traitor, maliciously  charging the North with its fictitious "nuclear issue" again,  spun out the malicious trash that the North "refuses to give up  nuclear development" because it "has not abandoned its lingering  desire for unification through communization and unification  with arms."    This is a despicable ruse of the traitor to justify armed  provocations of his group on the pretext of the North's  "nuclear issue".    Making consistent efforts for peace of the country and its  peaceful reunification, the North put forward the 10-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation and a proposal  for the exchange of special envoys to discuss and resolve  outstanding questions between the North and the South. The  South Korean puppets, however, are following a road of  dependence on foreign forces and North-South confrontation,  shunning them.    The Kim Yong-sam group must stop running wild, mindful of  the  irrevocable consequences of its reckless war racket and increase  of tensions.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Man in the News: A prickly bear baited - Mangosuthu Buthelezi There are certain politically correct cliches about Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party: he is mad; he is a dangerous megalomaniac; he is an enemy of the South African people; he fears electoral defeat and rejects democracy; he must be stopped. Given the imminence of South Africa's first all-race elections, between April 26 and 28, and the high hopes pinned to this great event of national catharsis, few dare stray from the realm of the politically correct to question the truth of these labels. With the juggernaut of majority rule bearing down upon the nation, better simply to go on believing that Buthelezi is an evil but ultimately impotent menace; then he can be crushed with impunity, and with no fear for the consequences. That is the reasoning which underpinned Thursday's decision to impose a state of emergency in Natal province, and the black homeland of KwaZulu (ruled by Chief Buthelezi). The elections must go on, in spite of the opposition of Inkatha, which commands a large chunk of the electorate in Natal/KwaZulu; Inkatha can be easily defeated because it commands no army; once crushed, it and Chief Buthelezi will disappear forever. Would that reality were so simple. For Chief Buthelezi has been preparing for this battle - psychologically and militarily - for years. Since its formation as a 'cultural movement' in 1975, Inkatha has worked hard to rebuild the sense of a Zulu nation, so strong in the 19th century but undermined by defeat at the hands of the British, the emasculation of the Zulu chiefs and the fragmentation of the Zulu kingdom early this century. A prince of the Zulu royal family and an uncle to the king, Chief Buthelezi has coaxed the embers of Zulu nationalism into full flame, reaching a climax earlier this week when Zulu warriors, marching to defend their King, were gunned down by African National Congress security guards in central Johannesburg. Chief Buthelezi's ethnic message may be denied by the political elite, but it has penetrated the public consciousness. History may well condemn him for fanning ethnic flames which threaten South Africa's democracy. Historians will certainly condemn Inkatha - and possibly Chief Buthelezi, though his responsibility has not been proven - for operating 'hit squads' using weapons and training allegedly provided by Pretoria's security services. Irrespective of history's judgement, Buthelezi is a reality; and he is doubly dangerous because he is not simply - as the politically correct would argue - a creation of apartheid whose power derives from apartheid structures. Ironically, it would be more correct to say that Buthelezi is a creation of the ANC. As ANC deputy secretary general, Jacob Zuma (the only senior Zulu in the ANC's top leadership) explained in 1992, 'forming Inkatha was the ANC's idea - to have a political organisation to undermine apartheid from within'. For decades, Buthelezi did just that, refusing to accept independence for KwaZulu, and campaigning for the release from prison of Nelson Mandela. But when the United Democratic Front emerged in the early 1980s as de facto internal wing of the ANC, it demonised all 'collaborators', chief among them Buthelezi. The Zulu leader opposed ANC policy on two central issues: economic sanctions and the use of guerrilla tactics to overthrow white rule. Today there is no political leader more despised by the ANC. Certainly, Chief Buthelezi will lose part of his power base once an ANC government (which will sweep Natal as a result of Inkatha's election boycott) pays the salaries of homeland police, civil servants, and possibly the Zulu King. But the Zulu warriors who fought in the streets of Johannesburg on Monday were not teachers, nurses and bureaucrats. They came from the world of migrant workers' hostels and KwaZulu villages where tradition and loyalty to the King remain powerful forces for resistance. No army can hope to subdue every village and kraal in rural Zululand; and even if they do so temporarily, violence will resume once they leave. The risk is that the battles of 1994 will store up material for resentment and revenge for decades to come. Yet the ANC seems unable to resist the temptation to prod the angry bear that resides in Chief Buthelezi's soul. They know they will get nowhere by humiliating a man whose sensitivity borders on the paranoid. They know that any attempt to trick him will backfire because he cannot bear to be taken for a 'stupid kaffir', as he so often points out; yet they offer him constitutional concessions which look good but mean little, and hope he will not notice. And most seriously of all, they think he has no true support and can be crushed by the legitimate will of the majority. In short, for the ANC, Buthelezi is a dictator clinging illegally to power, with no genuine constitutional complaints and no intention to negotiate. Their conclusion: accommodating him is not only unnecessary, but impossible. That may be true now, but it was not always so. Even early this year, the ANC could have had a deal with Inkatha relatively cheaply, by agreeing to devolve real power to the provinces, rather than guarding it at the centre. The Zulu King was then on the sidelines, and could have been assured a place as titular monarch of Natal/KwaZulu, by guaranteeing the security of royal lands and palaces. Only when that deal fell through did he enter the fray, increasing tension by calling for a sovereign Zulu kingdom and commanding his subjects to defend their nationhood. The chances are it is too late for a deal, and further violence is inevitable. Many would welcome his demise, in South Africa and abroad. He has alienated almost every local and foreign friend he ever had. His counter-productive propaganda machine has made it impossible to understand his policies, let alone defend them. He is, quite simply, in the way: obstructing the event millions worldwide have waited decades to see, the death of apartheid and the birth of a new non-racial democracy. And if he does not move, he will be removed by force - whatever the consequences.</p>

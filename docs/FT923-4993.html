			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sarrio acquires Slovenian cardboard unit for Pta8bn SARRIO, the Spanish cardboard manufacturer controlled by Italy's Saffa group, has paid Pta8bn (Dollars 88m) to acquire 76 per cent of Papirnica Kolicevo, the leading producer of stucco cardboard in Slovenia. The takeover, which marks one of the largest disposals to date by Slovenia's privatisation agency, lifts Sarrio's annual output of cardboard to more than 800,000 tonnes making it western Europe's second largest manufacturer after Austria's Meir Menholf and ahead of the Swedish Stora-Fedmulhe group. Under the terms of the acquisition 24 per cent of Papirnica Kolicevo, which had a turnover of Pta5.2bn last year, will be held by Slovenia's development agency and Pta3.4bn of the purchase price will be allocated to improving the plant's productivity. Sarrio said that in the mid-term Papirnica Kolicevo's present output of 100,000 tonnes, 50 per cent of which is exported to the European Community, would be increased to 180,000 tonnes. The takeover represents the biggest investment to date by a Spanish company in eastern Europe and is funded by a Pta9.4bn convertible bond issue last year and by Sarrio's cash flow. The bond is also financing a Pta3.5bn investment programme in the company's two plants in Spain. Sarrio was merged in 1990 with Italy's Cartiere Saffa, a cardboard producer with three units in Italy owned by the Saffa group, and the business was headquartered in Spain because, with fund raising for future investments in mind, the Spanish markets were preferred to the Italian ones.</p>

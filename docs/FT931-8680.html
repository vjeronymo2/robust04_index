			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Holiday company ceases trading TOUR OPERATOR Riva Travel yesterday said it had ceased trading because it could not meet its financial obligations. It has 300 customers abroad and 60,000 bookings. The company has links with Mr Harry Goodman, former chairman of the International Leisure Group, which collapsed in 1991. Riva said last night that Mr Goodman had worked as a consultant to the company. Ms Jackie Kernaghan, Riva's managing director, formerly worked for ILG. Riva was fully bonded, and the company said that customers' money was protected and holidaymakers abroad would be repatriated. Repatriation and administration of bookings will be handled by the Civil Aviation Authority. The company had 52 employees including 40 in the UK. Staff were told late yesterday afternoon that they no longer had jobs. Riva operated tours to the Mediterranean, Florida and the Caribbean. 'The difficulties of the economic climate, the dramatic fall of sterling and the resultant downturn in business for all tour operators made it impossible for the company to obtain the additional funding it required,' Riva said last night. The company said that until noon yesterday it was negotiating with several unnamed organisations 'to arrange a possible restructuring of its trading operations. These negotiations having failed, the board had no alternative but to cease trading'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Commander Henry Ruiz, official in </F> charge of Sandinist National Liberation Front, FSLN,  international relations and candidate for FSLN secretary  general, by Radio Sandino Program Director Ada Luz Monterrey;  place and date not given; from "The Sunday Drumbeat" newscast]    [Text] [Begin recording] [Ruiz] I believe we have made a  historic decision. Remember that the FSLN, in which women have  had a role, did not have a regulation compelling recognition of  women. This is the first failure.    The other thing that makes this decision very welcome is  that  when one takes into account 30 percent against the true number  of women in the party -- in my opinion this is not enough. It  obliges us to pursue more participation by women.    Thus in practice we are making a decision that can take  immediate effect and continue forging ahead. If we go to the  other extreme, this is still a good intention, but the road to  hell is paved with good intentions. I believe this is the best  thing that could have happened to us.    [Monterrey] Remember, Henry Ruiz, that according to the  media  a proposal has been circulating to have the FSLN congress  discuss a return to what was once called political commissars.  This would empower the Sandinist Assembly to elect editorial  boards and directors of Sandinist media. What is your opinion?    [Ruiz] I do not agree with this.    [Monterrey] Why?    [Ruiz] Two things are new to Nicaragua: First, real freedom  of expression does exist. No party can have freedom of  expression if decisions are made within the party to reduce this  freedom. This is what makes the existence of parties possible,  especially in the case of a revolutionary party. If we adopt  this proposal, we would be going back to old practices. Second,  publishing houses are our own media, but they are also  businesses that have to compete. They must have an open market.  If you place the media on a political footing with no eye on  profits, it is very unlikely that it would survive. The FSLN,  despite suspicions to the contrary, does not have large  financial resources. Thus owners have to survive, so publishing  houses, in an example of essential respect, must be so  administered.    [Monterrey] If Commander Henry Ruiz is elected FSLN  secretary  general during this congress, what will your immediate action  be: preserving FSLN unity or reducing the effects of what  pessimists are forecasting if Commander Ortega does not win?    [Ruiz] I do not like to forecast schisms. I believe we have  been and will emerge united. Some comrades have told me that  there is already division. I have replied that it is not yet  entrenched. (?Those who accept this have already committed  suicide.) If the party is not unified, we are obliged to seal  it up. I say let us bolt the party together, tighten the  clamps, use some glue, and launch the party forward. As we  approach 1996 we will see a split. I hold that if we don't win  in 1996 -- in addition to the (?good people they have) and all  these things that many times prove to be ideas on and intuitions  of what is going on or has happened -- will be consolidated if  they defeat us. [sentence as heard]    What is currently operating is a substitute model of the  revolution, but it is a neoliberal model. If you add the fact  that this has advanced so much, added to the three years  remaining in this administration, added to a possible defeat,  then you can forget about the revolution. Here is where  Sandinists will have to implement other plans. If we as  Sandinists have any conscience, we must realize that unity is  the only chance if this fatality were to occur. [end recording]    On another topic dealing with events in Nicaragua,  Commander Henry Ruiz, alias Modesto, told us:    [Begin recording] [Ruiz] I am happy because we have points  of  reference in Sandinism. The sad thing would be if Sandinism had  no points of reference and everything were a crisis, chaos, and  that we had to seek points of reference elsewhere, in other  parties. That would be bad. Tardiness does not matter; the  important thing is that points of reference have been found.  The sad thing is that I am the only other candidate. It would  be good if several of us were candidates for FSLN secretary  general.    On the question of what must be done to regain our power, I  believe that if we use our historical strength... [pauses] we  have always been dynamic, strong, mystical, and [words  indistinct] when our goals are unclear. I believe there is a  key goal, but we do not know how to reach it. This requires a  national plan that includes what I call the regaining of power.  I do not say government because I insist this is not a  government problem. It has to do with providing the executive  branch and the legislative branch with enough power so that they  can exercise other policies and lead the country out of  stagnation while stopping neoliberal policies.    If we examine this in the face of international realities,  it  is obviously not an easy task. Look at Venezuela. Carlos  Andres lost the elections [as heard] and see where he is now.  But Caldera is committed to the neoliberal plan, and there is  already word of a future social explosion in Venezuela. We are  committed to this neoliberal plan because this is what the  government established and signed. It will last until 1997.    We need to pursue a kind of national referendum in  connection  with the country's problems and see how we -- the government --  can deal with them, establish what we are going to propose, what  solutions to offer, and how these solutions are attainable.  When we put all these things down on a single piece of paper I  believe this will once again give Sandinists a point of  reference and the resolve to work. I believe that the debate,  which we have tried to run down, has given us something that is  quite tangible: We have risen, and we are [words indistinct] and  energy. So if we find these things we will have moved ahead.  [end recording]    These relations will improve to the extent the United  States allows them to improve. We cannot stop supporting just  causes we have supported in the past, we are supporting now, and  as we will hopefully continue to support in the future. The  fact that we have been so supportive of our brothers in El  Salvador caused us serious problems with the United States.  Nevertheless, just for the sake of avoiding problems, we could  not stop supporting our Salvadoran brothers. For the sake of  avoiding problems with the United States, we will never stop  supporting our Cuban brothers.    This means that in the face of our efforts to improve our  relations with the United States, we must not turn our backs on  our principles and our historic roots -- things we are obliged  to maintain. In this sense, I think we must carefully examine  the evolution and developments that have taken place in the  United States.    The Reagan and Bush administrations are not the same as  today's Clinton administration. There are substantial  differences, and, I might add, numerous differences. President  Clinton has assumed certain positions for reasons of political  interest, and also for reasons linked to his own personal  choices. He has shown openness in relations with ethnic groups,  with homosexuals, and with women -- an openness which, at the  same time, has not been manifested in relations with countries  that have been under attack, such as Cuba. Perhaps the alignment  of various forces within the United States is not permitting  President Clinton to be more broad in his openness. [two-second  break in reception]    As congress president, I ask you to grant me a few more  minutes. Much has been said about this topic. Some have  mentioned the problem of the Sandinist anthem and suggested we  eliminate the words of the anthem. I believe that, in fact,  there are other anthems in the world which have their own  characteristics and which are historic. I think, however, that  the words of the Sandinist anthem go far beyond this and reflect  a deeply historical significance. We have been victims -- and I  reiterate this -- and we have not been responsible for  victimizing others.    Aside from maintaining and carrying out efforts to establish  relations with the United States, we must keep our  anti-imperialist principles intact. I also believe it is  necessary to say here and now that the Sandinist Front is, and  will continue to be, anti-imperialist. [applause]    We have proposed other motions within this same spirit. I  would like to see an overall approval of these motions. There  are some portions to which you contributed with words and  actions, which will be reviewed by the commission to summarize  and improve, if possible, this important portion of our program.</p>

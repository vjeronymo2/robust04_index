He asserted  that no one asked them to cut down their operations during the  Geneva summit. His party does not carry out resistance  activities based on the negotiations, because "we do not believe  in these negotiations," Shaykh Qasim said. He pointed out that  resistance operations are escalated and reduced according to the  objective situation on the ground, not according to political  circumstances.    As for information coming from within Hizballah about  preparations for a settlement, Shaykh Qasim clarified that the  party opposes a settlement in the first place. He said: We are  betting on its failure. We believe that there are enough  complications and pressures to hamper many of the steps to a  settlement. Therefore, Shaykh Qasim continued, the possibility  of failure is as great as any other possibility.</p>

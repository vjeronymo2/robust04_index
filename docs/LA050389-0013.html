			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINIMUM WAGE  </P> <P> By his refusal to allow not even a nickel raise in the minimum wage of $3.35  throughout his two terms, President Reagan added immeasurable suffering to the  bleak lives of millions of Americans.  </P> <P> That moral obtuseness is now being addressed by Congress. However, in spite of  his vision of a "kinder, gentler America," President Bush has vowed to veto the  proposed increase which will gradually reach $4.55 by 1991. This promised veto  speaks more clearly than the catchy rhetoric of his speech writers. It looks  like America's poor are going to have another tough four years.  </P> <P> JERRY SMITH  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

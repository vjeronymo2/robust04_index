			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Business Travel: A breath of fuggy air - Policies on smoking and cabin freshness differ from airline to airline Smoke gets in your eyes and up your nose. And so do bits of fluff, hair, skin particles and volatile emanations from the malodorous passengers around you. Taking a long-haul flight is more than just a matter of a comfortable seat and gourmet food. Airlines differ in how they treat smokers and how often they change the air in the cabin. On the smoking front, they tend to divide into two camps: the anti-smoking Anglo-Saxon countries, and their former colonies; and the pro-smoking rest of the world. On the issue of smoking in aircraft, France would appear to be an honorary Anglo-Saxon country. In the 'anti' corner, US carriers forbid smoking on all domestic flights. British Airways has not allowed smoking on its domestic flights since 1988, SAS bans smoking on flights within Scandinavia, and Singapore Airlines has smoke-free short-haul routes on its Silk Air subsidiary. These rules are not as strict for long-haul international flights, perhaps because airlines recognise that it is harder for tobacco addicts to go without for eight or 10 hours. Many airlines have no-smoking flights only on routes where there are at least two daily flights: smoking is banned on one, and allowed on the other. Such flights are available from BA, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines between Europe and Asia, and on many US carriers across the Atlantic or Pacific. For short-haul international flights, carriers are more divided. While SAS still allows smoking on flights outside Scandinavia, Air France last month banned smoking on flights of less than two hours. BA plans to prohibit smoking on flights of less than 90 minutes from this summer: more than 400 flights a week will be affected between the UK and much of northern Europe. Such changes of policy at BA and Air France contrast with the attitude of German carrier Lufthansa. It experimented with no-smoking flights in 1990, but abandoned the idea in the face of public hostility. Those in favour of an individual's right to smoke overcame those arguing that the health and comfort of others were more important, says the carrier. Many Asian and south European carriers have not even experimented with no-smoking policies, perhaps because smoking is more popular in those regions. Is it possible for an airline to please both supporters and opponents of smoking? Air France is trying: it has a special smoking compartment on flights to Japan and South Korea. Economy-class smokers sit at the back of the aircraft, separated from other passengers by thick curtains. While non-smokers may applaud efforts like this, they might be less pleased by the issue of the freshness of the air itself. Only US carriers have statistics about cabin air freshness at their fingertips. Most other carriers contacted by the FT had to consult their engineering departments, and often did not know precise figures. The results of the survey show that, when it comes to air freshness, the type of aircraft matters at least as much as who owns it. It is not easy to change cabin air frequently. At 40,000ft, the external air can be minus 60`C and almost completely dry. It must be heated by 80`C and have moisture added before it is pumped into the cabin. This all uses fuel, so the latest Boeing and Airbus aircraft, introduced since the mid-1980s, try to cut down on the waste by recycling some warm and relatively moist cabin air. Airlines insist that this does no harm to passengers. The air is filtered using a mesh that catches many bacteria. Sleeping people extract very little oxygen, so the air the second time round should be just as capable of sustaining life as it was the first time. Nevertheless, those who want completely fresh air circulating around them should avoid travelling in new aircraft, such as the Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A320, while smaller aircraft tend to change the air more frequently. Travellers paying for the most expensive seats will get better air quality than those with cheap tickets. The air in an aircraft flows from the front to the back; the further forward you are, the fresher the air, unless there are smokers in front. Moreover, with fewer passengers per square metre in the more expensive seats, each has more fresh air. As if that were not enough, one airline has just made the fresh air class distinction even greater. US carrier Northwest last month banned smoking in all first-class cabins.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      WILL SMOKE GET IN YOUR EYES?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Airline Smoking policy Frequency of cabin air changes*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Air France          No smoking on flights       'Better than 7 litres                     under 2 hours.

He stressed the need to  uphold high standards in the army's anticorruption and  clean-administration work. He called on leaders at all levels,  senior cadres in particular, to strictly enforce rules and  regulations formulated by the CPCCC and CMC on party style and  clean-administration building; and to become models of  whole-heartedly serving the people and abiding by discipline.    Liu Huaqing said the Third Plenary Session of the Central  Commission for Discipline Inspection was a very important  meeting at which General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an  important speech. The CMC decision to call the All-Army  Discipline Inspection Work Conference was aimed at the timely  study of General Secretary Jiang's important speech;  implementation of guidelines set forth at the plenary session of  the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection; and further  strengthening party style and clean- administration building in  the army in line with the arrangements worked out by the CPCCC.    Liu Huaqing expounded the achievements the army has scored  in  party style and clean-administration building in 1993. He said  that as a result of making a conscientious study of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's expositions on enhancing party style and clean-  administration building, CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin's relevant  instructions, and the CMC's decisions, the army has increased  awareness on combating corruption and clean-administration  building. Party committees at all levels have extensively  strengthened ideological work and improved workstyle, carried  out in-house checks and self-correction, and conscientiously  investigated and dealt with some major law-breaking and  discipline-breaching cases; thereby educating servicemen,  helping to improve leadership style, and promote army building  in all areas.    Liu Huaqing pointed out the need for all comrades in the  army  to have a profound recognition of the long-term nature and  arduousness of strengthening party style and  clean-administration building. This year, the army will  resolutely implement the CPCCC decision on the anticorruption  struggle in party style and clean-administration building. He  called on the army to gain a new and heightened ideological  understanding, and gain new breakthroughs in investigations and  dealing with major and important cases; to devote more efforts  to important parts and important links; and to make new strides  in the areas of establishing systems, and of supervising and  checking these systems. Liu Huaqing said with the powerful  ideological weapon of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, the strong leadership of  the CPCCC and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, and  cooperation from everyone in the army, our army's anticorruption  and clean- administration building work will surely achieve new  results.    Liu Huaqing stressed: Under the new situation, our army  shoulders a major historical mission: It must provide a strong  and forceful security guarantee for the state's reform, opening  up, and modernization construction. This requires us to make  ourselves very strong so we will be able to accomplish the tasks  given by the state under any circumstances. The fact the CPCCC  set clear demands on the army to stand at the forefront of  building socialist spiritual civilization demonstrates a high  degree of trust in it. The CPCCC set very high demands on army  building. As party style and clean- administration building are  important for building spiritual civilization, it is natural for  the army to do an even better job in this area. Therefore,  party committees and leaders at all levels must uphold high  standards, make strict demands, and further enhance their  awareness and sense of responsibility in fighting corruption and  building a clean-administration.    Liu Huaqing pointed out: The party committee is the key to  doing a good party-style job in a unit. If a party committee is  strong, it will be able to consolidate the fruits of the  anticorruption and clean-administration efforts; even if  problems arise, a strong party committee will solve them easily.  Criticism and self-criticism sessions should be conducted  within the party. We should oppose liberalism [zi you zhu yi].  Opposition to liberalism is the excellent tradition of our  party and our army, and we must continuously carry forward that  excellent tradition under the current new situation of  anticorruption and clean-administration building. It is  necessary for party committees at all levels to implement the  party's system of democratic centralism and organizational life.  Party secretaries and deputy secretaries of party committees  must uphold principles, take the lead in stressing party spirit,  and in organizing criticism and self-criticism sessions.    When touching on the need for leading cadres to set  exemplary roles in party style and clean-administration  building, Liu Huaqing said senior cadres in the army must foster  the concept of taking the interests of the whole into account  and strictly abide by political discipline. They must  resolutely implement all decisions reached by the CPCCC and CMC;  absolutely refrain from doing things which are definitely banned  by law; honestly execute whatever the system dictates; and  genuinely speak and act in line with the CPCCC politically,  ideologically, and in action. Leading cadres, senior cadres in  particular, must be consistent in their speech and behavior when  it comes to the matter of honestly fulfilling their official  duties and of practising self-discipline; they must practice  what they advocate. They must strictly enforce systems and  regulations worked out by the CPCCC and CMC on party style and  clean-administration building; they must be models of  whole-heartedly serving the people and of enforcing discipline.    The All-Army Discipline Inspection Work Conference opened on  25 February in Beijing. The major purpose of the conference was  to sum up and analyze the army's anticorruption and  clean-administration building work in 1993, particularly its  experience in implementing the arrangements mapped out by the  CPCCC and CMC on anticorruption and clean-administration  building work; and to study and arrange the anticorruption and  clean-administration building work for the army in 1994. Zhou  Ziyu, secretary of the CMC commission for discipline inspection  and deputy director of the People's Liberation Army [PLA]  General Political Department, delivered a work report.    Zhang Zhen, Chi Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Fu Quanyou, and  others attended today's meeting. Also attending today's meeting  were responsible comrades from the major units of the PLA  General Staff Department, General Political Department, and  General Logistics Department in Beijing; discipline inspection  commission members from the military system; discipline  inspection commission members from the CMC; major units from the  army; and secretaries and discipline inspection heads of the  discipline inspection commission of the armed police units.    Yu Yongbo, member of the CMC and director of the PLA General  Political Department, chaired the meeting, and made arrangement  for transmitting and implementing the guidelines set forth at  the Third Plenary Session of the Central Commission for  Discipline Inspection and at the All-Army Discipline Inspection  Work Conference.</p>

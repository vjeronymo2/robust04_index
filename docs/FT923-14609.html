			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (19): Objectives have been met - Consultant's Critique TRUST is the key to a good relationship. Once RAC Enterprises (RACE) had selected its systems supplier, it entrusted the project to Travellog. This trust continues. Travellog keeps a copy of RACE's software on its own machine, and has a modem link to RACE's machine. This arrangement ensures that RACE can receive instant fixes in case of problems. Version control is maintained, according to Travellog's Andrew Osborne, to ensure that the two companies' systems remain in step. Another form of trust is the reliance which RACE has on its machine. RACE performs an automatically scheduled back up to tape of its data each night, after its Dover office closes at 11pm. If the machine were to break down - and it has been very reliable so far - the company could temporarily revert to manual systems, using the pre-printed forms employed before the machine arrived. No preventive maintenance contract is in force - such is the general reliability of such machines these days. An uninterrupted power supply is installed, to ensure smooth close-down if there is a power cut. RACE publishes a brochure describing its system, in which it makes a great deal of the system's usability. The conventional IT-oriented view of usability is that there should be uncluttered screens, lots of help messages, probably a graphical user interface (GUI), with colour and fast response times. RACE's system scores on the first and last points. However, it does not offer help messages, use a GUI or colours. This bucking of the conventional wisdom makes a comment on that wisdom. This system requires that its users are trained in its use. They must know their product, because they must be able fluently to answer their callers. Help messages would mainly be of use to untrained users, so are superfluous. The company uses OS/2 PCs as terminals in its main office, to allow users to link both to its own system and to its parent's mainframe membership computer. These PCs are capable of both colour and graphics. However, graphics would add nothing to a system like this, which is menu driven, and aiming for fast response times. Colour might be useful better to highlight parts of the screen - Andrew Osborne admitted that the system was capable of supporting colour displays. RACE's trust in its suppliers has so far paid off. Its system has met its objectives, appears stable and has contributed to company growth.</p>

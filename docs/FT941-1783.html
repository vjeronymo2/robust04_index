			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Kohl makes EU enlargement pledge to east Europe Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany entered an already bruising debate over enlargement of the European Union yesterday by promising he would make strenuous efforts to open further the EU to the countries of central Europe when Germany takes over the presidency this year. Implicitly attacking opposition to enlargement of the EU - dramatised recently in top-level French criticism of Germany's enthusiasm for the process - Mr Kohl insisted that 'the Baltic Sea is just as much a European sea as the Mediterranean. It is quite simply intolerable for us to adopt the attitude that we want to create some sort of closed shop'. He rejected any attempt to turn the EU into a 'glorified free trade area', insisting that enlargement must go hand in hand with closer integration and reinforcement of European institutions. At the same time he sharply criticised Britain and Spain for holding up the current enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden over technical changes in the voting rules. Mr Kohl, whose government will take over the EU presidency on July 1, suggested new moves to involve the four likely central European candidates for EU membership more closely in Union decisions. One proposal would be to extend EU summit meetings to include the leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in a regular exchange of views on common problems. Their participation would ensure that EU decisions were not taken that would make their eventual membership more difficult. A second idea would be to invite those countries - 'in the near future' - to send deputies to the European parliament as non-voting members, in a consultative role. Mr Kohl left no doubt that he sees extension of the EU to the east as a top priority and of vital national interest for Germany. He said it was 'unthinkable' that Germany's eastern border, the Oder-Neisse border with Poland, 'should remain the eastern border of the European Union'. Only by simultaneously 'deepening' the EU, while the enlargement process continued, could 'peace and freedom' in Europe be assured, he said. 'With a glorified free trade area we would never manage to achieve this in a lasting way.'</p>

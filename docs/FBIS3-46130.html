			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fanny Wong] </F>   [Excerpts] China last night brought on a showdown with the  Hong Kong administration over the new airport, declaring that  legal and financial obligations not approved by Beijing would be  invalid after 1997. [passage omitted]    The Government has so far awarded 34 contracts worth a total  of $31.4 billion. This represents 78 percent of the value of  government airport core project contracts. It is understood all  works under the 34 contracts will be completed before the 1997  changeover, saving them from the impact from the declaration.  The immediate victims are expected to be the franchises crucial  to running the Chek Lap Kok facility, such as baggage and cargo  handling, catering, air fuel supply and aircraft maintenance.    The Airport Corporation Bill, which is yet to be approved by  the Legislative Council, would be invalidated in 1997. Even if  the management corporation was approved and set up it could be  dissolved.    Legislators last night accused the Chinese Government of  reacting irrationally and dealing a blow to Hong Kong people's  confidence. They warned that due consideration should be given  to the possible impact on the community. The Government reacted  more cautiously, saying only that it was still studying the  XINHUA statement.    A spokesman said: "But meanwhile we must stress again that  we have complied fully with the Memorandum of Understanding on  the Airport Core Programme.    "The position is that we are awaiting a response from the  Chinese side to our formal request for an early meeting of the  Airport Committee, which we hope will resolve outstanding issues  on the financing of the airport and the airport railway."</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / The 'Machin' set for scrap heap The 'Machin' payphone, symbol of Mercury's assault on the UK telecommunications market, is set for the scrap-heap, Alan Cane writes. The phone kiosk was first seen at Waterloo railway station, London, in July 1988. In spite of the estimated 100m calls that have been made from the distinctive blue and silver kiosks, the shells bearing Mercury's logo will be progressively removed, beginning next March. By the end of the year all will be gone. In six years, Mercury installed 2,873 payphones in a variety of city centre sites, airports and stations. All but 10 accept only Mercurycards. But the company's contribution to Britain's street furniture is small compared with the 330,000 or payphones that have been installed by British Telecommunications, and the operation has never made money. Now it is to be axed as part of Mercury's radical retrenchment which will see it join with cable companies to offer residential telephones and seek a buyer for its customer equipment business. The Mercurycards will still be available from retailers until March and will be useable in the company's payphones until the end of the year. Some 16m have been sold since 1988. People with cards they do not or cannot use will be able to return them to the company for a refund.</p>

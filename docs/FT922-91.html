			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Britain set to drop VAT rates opposition BRITAIN is ready to drop its long-standing opposition to the Community legislating on value-added tax rates, provided its whisky exports are not penalised by higher excise duties. This was signalled last night by Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, during bargaining in Luxembourg on indirect tax rates in the EC. Finance ministers had been instructed by their leaders attending the weekend summit in Lisbon to try to align consumer goods tax rates from January 1 1993, when fiscal checks at internal EC borders disappear. Such alignment is intended to prevent countries undercutting each other's rates and drawing in shoppers from higher tax-rate states. EC diplomats said that after Mr Lamont's concession they expected agreement to be reached under the chancellor's presidency of finance ministers, in the second half of this year. Mr Lamont said he was willing to convert last year's political commitment on a 15 per cent minimum standard VAT rate into 'a time-delimited, legally binding' directive. Germany and some other governments, with standard VAT rates below 15 per cent, have said they need the force of an EC directive to justify politically unpopular increases. The idea being floated in Luxembourg last night was that the directive should last for four years. Mr Lamont made it clear there would no question of such a law being automatically prolonged. EC finance ministers also reached agreement in principle on a life assurance directive, which will complete arrangements for a single, EC-wide market in various types of insurance.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For motor vehicles other than trailers and motorcycles, the label shall be affixed either to the hinge pillar, door-latch post, or the door edge that meets the door-latch post next to the driver's seating position. If those locations are not practicable, the label may be placed on the left side of the instrument panel or if that is not practicable, the inward-facing surface of the door next to the driver's seating position. If none of the above locations are practicable, the manufacturer must notify NHTSA of that fact and, with appropriate drawings or photographs, suggest an alternative location. Such suggestion must be submitted for approval to the Administrator, NHTSA. Whatever its location, the label must be easily readable without moving any part of the vehicle except the outer door, and the lettering on the label must be of a color that contrasts with the label's background.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trailer labels must be located on the left forward half of the vehicle. Labels on motorcycles must be affixed to a permanent member of the vehicle and as close as possible to the intersection of the steering post with the handle bars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 CFR 567.5 prescribes the labeling requirements for vehicles manufactured in two or more stages. Section 567.5(a) requires chassis-cab manufacturers to affix a label in the form and location specified in &sect;567.4 to each chassis-cab manufactured by them. Section 567.5(b) requires intermediate-stage manufacturers to affix a label in the form and location specified in &sect;567.4 to each chassis-cab to which they are required to furnish an addendum to the incomplete vehicle document prescribed in &sect;568.4, if such chassis-cab has been certified by its manufacturer in accordance with &sect;567.5(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, &sect;567.5(c) requires final-stage manufacturers to affix a label of the type and in the manner and form specified in &sect;567.4 to each vehicle, containing the information specified in that section relating to that vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Michael Robinson, Director of the Michigan Department of State Police, petitioned the agency to amend &sect;567.4 to require that manufacturers' labels on vehicles weighing more than 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) be made of a heavy gauge metal of a specified thickness with raised or recessed letters and numbers and be riveted to the vehicle. He further suggested that the labels be located on the door latch post near the driver's seating position. If that is not practicable, then he wanted the label to be placed on a permanent vertical section of the cab's floor area to the left of the driver's seating position and which would be immediately visible with the driver's side door open. If that location is still not practicable, he wanted the label to be affixed to the portion of the instrument panel to the left of the steering wheel. He suggested that the label for a bus be affixed, if practicable, to the ceiling area above the windshield or windows in the driver's seating area. If none of the suggested locations are practicable, then the manufacturer must notify NHTSA as currently required by &sect;567.4(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Robinson stated that he submitted his petition because the Motor Carrier Division of his Department has identified a significant problem in locating information on the gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR) and vehicle identification numbers (VIN) of commercial vehicles. He asserted that there are currently no Federal standards requiring labels of standard size, thickness, or format displaying either the GVWR or the VIN on commercial vehicles. Under current requirements, the label containing that information may be located in any one of several different places and in one of several different formats, including decals, adhesive labels, and riveted metal plates. Mr. Robinson alluded to the current requirement that each vehicle have a label showing the GVWR and VIN affixed when the vehicle is manufactured, but stated that there is no Federal requirement that the label remain affixed thereafter. Thus, the labels on many vehicles either fall off or are otherwise removed or obliterated after manufacture, usually by accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Robinson stated that prior to the inception of the Commercial Driver License (CDL) requirements, the GVWR was not normally used by law enforcement officers. Now, however, it is very important for officers to be able to determine the GVWR of commercial vehicles. Under the CDL program, drivers are licensed to operate only those vehicles within the GVWR ranges of vehicles for which the drivers have met the qualifications. Law enforcement officers often have difficulty determining the GVWRs of commercial vehicles because the labels on those vehicles are often damaged, painted over or removed, usually accidently, during the life of the vehicle. The reason for the absence of the GVWRs is that many labels are not designed or constructed to hold up under the rigors of commercial vehicle operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner asserted that the manufacturer's label is a prime source of the VIN and the only means that law enforcement officers have to determine the GVWR of a given vehicle. Without the GVWR, police officers who are unfamiliar with commercial vehicle operation are unable to determine the CDL GVWR range into which a particular vehicle falls. In such a case, officers cannot determine the correct enforcement action. As a result, drivers may be allowed to continue operating vehicles which they are not qualified to operate. Thus, with more certain access to VIN and GVWR information, police officers could more readily inspect and investigate commercial vehicles during routine traffic stops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Robinson further stated that a review of reports about truck and bus accidents over the several months prior to submission of the petition revealed a large number of discrepancies in entries in the reports regarding the GVWR, presumably stemming from the investigating officers' inability to locate or read the vehicle label. He argued that this difficulty results in collection of erroneous data which is then submitted to the SAFETYNET data management system established and maintained by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The SAFETYNET system is a cooperative effort to share commercial vehicle data electronically between the FHWA and the various states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On another point, Mr. Robinson stated that as of July, 1991, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) estimated that approximately 10,494 commercial trucks and 18,865 commercial-type trailers were classified as unrecovered stolen vehicles in the United States. He argued that identification and recovery of those vehicles is greatly hampered by the lack of uniform display of VINs on commercial vehicles. He believed that if a more standardized and permanent manufacturer's label were used on commercial vehicles, law enforcement personnel could more easily and reliably inspect and identify commercial vehicles and could possibly locate and recover many more of such vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Analysis of the Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although NHTSA has no independent information indicating a problem in determining the GVWR of commercial vehicles in use or, if there is such a problem, its magnitude, the agency nevertheless has no reason to doubt Mr. Robinson's assertions. Further, if the problem exists in Michigan, it is reasonable to assume that it exists in other states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

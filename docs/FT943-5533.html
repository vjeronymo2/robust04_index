			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / 'Peace bond' plan urged to boost aid: New York Mr Alan Hevesi, comptroller (treasurer) of New York city, has called for an issue of 'peace bonds' to be launched in the US to help support Northern Ireland's economic development once peace is established in the province. Repeating statements he made in Northern Ireland early in July, Mr Hevesi said Irish Americans would be willing buyers of such bonds, just as Jewish Americans have bought substantial amounts of Israeli bonds. 'A constructive peace process will have a major effect on investment in Ireland, north and south,' he said. The comptroller has used his position as a custodian of New York's public-employee retirement fund to justify his statements on Irish affairs. The fund has Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) invested in companies which have business interests in Northern Ireland. Mr Hevesi said he wanted to encourage these companies to adopt employment practices worldwide which reflected the so-called McBride Principles adopted by New York. These are designed to give minorities improved access to jobs.</p>

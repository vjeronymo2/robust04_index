			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Airlines press Clinton on 'open skies' President Bill Clinton is coming under pressure from a growing number of US carriers to revive negotiations with the UK on liberalising airline services between the two countries. Mr Ron Allen, chairman of Delta Air Lines, the third largest US carrier, is the latest US airline chief executive to have written to Mr Clinton asking him to intervene to break the deadlock. Mr Allen asked the US authorities to approve his airline's recent commercial partnership with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways to give it access to London's Heathrow airport. Under the current air service agreement between the two countries only two US carriers - United and American - can serve Heathrow, the world's biggest international airport. But the marketing and ticket code-sharing partnership with Virgin would open the door for Delta into Heathrow. Mr Allen's letter follows a similar initiative last week by the heads of six other US airlines, including United, the largest US carrier, who all wrote to Mr Clinton urging him to take action to revive 'open skies' talks with the UK. These initiatives reflect frustration among many US carriers at the refusal by the Department of Transportation to consider reviving talks with the UK after walking away from negotiations last year. The DOT appears to have sided so far with the position of American Airlines, the second largest US carrier, which has argued that the US should renounce its air agreement with the UK unless Heathrow was immediately opened to all US carriers. Instead, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, who has also become increasingly frustrated by the DOT's attitude, has proposed a gradual process of liberalisation over three phases eventually leading to total 'open skies'. Mr Allen argued in his letter that approval of the Delta-Virgin partnership would inject more competition on transatlantic routes and 'underscore the desire of both our governments to move towards serious liberalisation'. Mr MacGregor has already given his approval to the Delta-Virgin partnership.</p>

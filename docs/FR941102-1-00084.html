			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The application of the somatic cell adjustment contained herein will promote orderly marketing. As pointed out by several witnesses testifying at the hearing, producers in these markets are faced with a wide array of quality premium programs. These programs have no standard basis or standard value that is applied between handlers. Therefore a producer is faced with trying to decide which premium program will give the producer the greatest return without a standard with which to compare. Inconsistent premium programs also result in producers with identical milk receiving different prices for that milk depending on which handler is procuring the milk. The inclusion of this recommended somatic cell adjustment will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act by encouraging orderly marketing through the standardization of the basis for payment on the level of somatic cells in the milk and the standardization and checking of the testing and test procedures used for determining the somatic cell counts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As was stated earlier, all parties agreed that high quality milk is important to all segments of the dairy industry. In fact, there was little opposition to the inclusion of an adjustment for quality in the amended orders. Even though testimony indicated that there are other quality factors that are important in overall milk quality, there was no determination of their effect on milk quality or any attempt to compute a relevant associated value. Therefore, somatic cell count will be used as the quality adjustment factor in this decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two basic reasons to apply the somatic cell adjustment rate on a hundredweight basis rather than to adjust the protein price. First, the somatic cell adjustment reflects the quality of milk in all uses rather than just cheese, and second, application of the somatic cell adjustment on a hundredweight basis makes it very clear to producers and to handlers that quality affects milk used in all products. Although testimony clearly showed that somatic cells affect the quality of milk in all uses, a value determined on the basis of the effect of somatic cells on cheese reflects the most prevalent use of milk in these markets and is the easiest way to determine a value for payment to producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A lack of agreement among hearing participants occurred in trying to determine the application of a somatic cell adjustment. There was a general consensus that an adjustment should be made in the producer pay price for quality and/or somatic cells. The rate at which such adjustment should be made varied by proposal, but was tied to the reduction in cheese yield that occurs as somatic cell counts increase. Several witnesses testified that the somatic cell adjustment rate should be set at a moderate level. Testimony indicated that most of the decline in cheese yield occurs as the SCC increases from below 100,000 to above 100,000, with a much slower decline in yield as the somatic cell count increases to one million. However, testimony also showed that declines in yield are much more linear when somatic cell tests and cheese yield studies are done with bulk tank milk than with the milk of individual cows. Several proposals suggested using a factor of .0005 times the cheese price in determining the value of the somatic cell adjustment per 1,000 somatic cells. This factor is derived from the approximately four percent decline in cheese yield as the somatic cell count increases from 100,000 to one million. This is the same adjustment that is used in other Federal orders in which a somatic cell adjuster is included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The formula used to determine the somatic cell adjuster reflects the changes in the yield of cheese as the levels of somatic cells change. The formula also ties the adjustment to the value of the milk by using the block cheese price to determine the value per 1,000 somatic cells. However, since record evidence clearly shows that the affect of somatic cells on Class I and Class II products is related more to the quality of the finished product than to the yield of the product, the formula should reflect less than the full value of the affect of somatic cells on cheese yield. Using the recommended formula, the somatic cell adjustment for the average producer under the Chicago Regional order would be three cents per hundredweight, far below the 25 cents per hundredweight average quality premium that is shown in hearing exhibits as being paid currently.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / IMF approves Polish budget Poland's budget policies have won the approval of the International Monetary Fund, opening the way to a 20 per cent reduction in the country's Dollars 33bn debt to western government creditors, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Mr Michael Deppler, IMF mission chief, said yesterday Poland had fulfilled the terms of its 1993 agreement and would be negotiating a new stand-by arrangement. The draft budget, which foresees an 83,000bn zlotys (Pounds 2.56bn) deficit (4 per cent of gross domestic product), will be approved by parliament next month. IMF approval is needed by Paris Club government creditors, which wrote down 30 per cent of the country's debt in 1991 and promised a further 20 per cent this year if the country remained in favour with the Fund. Poland can also use the Dollars 500m stand-by loan which becomes available at the end of March to help finance its debt reduction agreement with western banks in the London Club although the talks centre on a Polish suggestion, resisted by the banks, that the Dollars 12.3bn owed them be reduced by half to match the Paris Club deal.</p>

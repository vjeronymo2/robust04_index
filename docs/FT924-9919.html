			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: NatWest buys Chicago broker NATIONAL Westminster Bank has bought the Chicago-based futures and option broker, Burns Fry Futures, after receiving approval from the US Federal Reserve Board. The move demonstrates the bank's 'commitment to the establishment of an international futures and options clearing, execution, and broking service,' said Mr Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest Markets. NatWest announced its intention to acquire Burns Fry Futures in July 1991. Burns Fry, the Canadian securities firm, will retain a nominal interest in the operation. Burns Fry Futures, which was formerly owned by Security Pacific, will be integrated into NatWest Futures. The firm has a presence on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. NatWest Financial Futures previously had no activities in the US futures markets, but is active on a number of European and Japanese exchanges. 'This is the first stage of a broad review of our futures strategy,' said Ms Victoria Ward, who was hired from the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange at the start of the year with the brief of creating a global strategy for NatWest's futures business.</p>

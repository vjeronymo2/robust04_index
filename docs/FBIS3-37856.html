			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, Feb 23 (TANJUG) -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev on Wednesday [23 February] sharply criticized  NATO members for trying to solve the Bosnian conflict on their  own, and called for joint actions to achieve peace in Bosnia.    Russia was ready to send more troops to Bosnia, if it was  necessary, Kozyrev said in an interview to the Polish television  in Krakow, where he took part in the [word indistinct] Russian  confermce on the new partnership.    It was a big delusion to think that NATO was able to solve  every problem unilaterally. He criticized NATO members for  deciding about the Sarajevo action without prior consultation  with the east.    NATO was last week ready to launch air strikes in the  Sarajevo area acting on the ultimatum to the warring sides to  demilitarize that city. In reality, the threats were addressed  to the Bosnian Serbs alone.    The Bosnian Serbs started withdrawing heavy weapons around  Sarajevo on Friday, only after the Moscow initiative and  guarantees, and Russian peacekeepers were deployed on the line  dividing the Serb and Moslem side.</p>

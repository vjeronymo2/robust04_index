			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Poll shows Europe split on trade access European business leaders favour reducing barriers to imports from east Asia and eastern Europe and cutting government intervention to boost the continent's long-term economic prospects, according to an opinion poll for the Financial Times published today. The survey of senior directors from 507 top European companies in seven countries underlines the sluggish recovery from recession as well as disappointment with the 1993 single market. Some 77 per cent of respondents said they had registered no benefits from last year's measures to lower Europe's internal trade barriers. The poll, carried out by Harris Research for the FT and five other European newspapers, highlights large divergences of opinion among executives in the main European Union countries. While 55 per cent of respondents favour easier access for imports from regions such as east Asia and eastern Europe, 26 per cent in France and 27 per cent in Spain want higher trade barriers. The main points are: 40 per cent of respondents expect the EU economy to contract this year, while 51 per cent expect growth of 1 per cent or less. Only 10 per cent expect to increase staff in 1994, with 45 per cent planning job cuts. British executives are far less enthusiastic about deepening EU integration than on the Continent. 51 per cent of respondents think a single European currency would improve competitiveness. German and UK executives are most sceptical. The 'tiger' economies of east Asia, such as Korea and Taiwan, are seen as the greatest threats to European industry. German, Dutch and Belgian executives are particularly worried about competition from eastern Europe. Companies hold divergent views on measures to stimulate the economy. Some 51 per cent of German executives want tax cuts, while 63 per cent of UK respondents want minimal EU involvement in the economy.</p>

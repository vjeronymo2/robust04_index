			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- Commenting NATO's  air raids against the Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Bucharest  says that "deciding for armed actions, the United Nations has  abandoned the role of peace maker which it used to play, and  overtly sided with the Muslims," which questions the nature and  the mandate of the UNPROFOR (United Nations Protection Force) in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the embassy states in a press release.    The statement released for the press writes that the  Yugoslav  Embassy is definitely against the policy of pressure and  ultimatum, against armed attacks over the Serbian area, and  pleads that double standard policies should be renounced.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Warning over state of beaches HOLIDAYMAKERS will stay away from resorts unless action is taken to clean up UK beaches, says a study led by the World Health Organisation. The report, published in the British Medical Journal, says a variety of litter and medical waste including plastic fishing gear, polystyrene foam, clothing, glass and syringes, was found by volunteers in an investigation in 1991 by the Norwich Union Coastwatch UK. The findings were checked by Dr Robin Phillipp, director of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health Promotion and Ecology, and a team from Farnborough College of Technology. The report says: 'If our personal and collective efforts for litter and pollution control are not improved, the findings reported here suggest that at least in south-western England, a very popular area for summer tourists, there could be considerable consequences from adhering to the British Medical Journal's recent advice that 'if a beach looks filthy, don't swim in the sea'.'</p>

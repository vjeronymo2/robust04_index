			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fairfax finalises refinancing JOHN FAIRFAX Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, has finalised an ADollars 850m (USDollars 569m) debt refinancing programme which directors said would significantly lower its interest costs. A company statement yesterday said the refinancing had been achieved despite legal action by interests associated with Independent Newspapers, the Irish media group headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, which unsuccessfully bid for Fairfax in 1991. The refinancing involves an unsecured five-year amortising facility of ADollars 800m provided by a syndicate led by National Australia Bank and including Toronto Dominion Australia and Societe Generale Australia. It also includes a five-year working capital facility of ADollars 50m provided by National Australia Bank. The facilities replace arrangements with Fairfax's previous lenders.</p>

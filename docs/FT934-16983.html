			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Brittan seeks swift dumping probes SENIOR EC trade officials want to speed up the Community's investigations into 'dumping' of non-EC products on the European market, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, will today sound out foreign ministers from the 12 member states on the possibility of introducing a nine-month deadline for the imposition of provisional anti-dumping duties. Dumping occurs when products are exported to the EC at unfairly low prices, compared with the price on the producer's domestic market. Duties are imposed if EC producers have suffered 'injury' as a result, but investigations can take more than 18 months. Sir Leon also wants to improve transparency and efficiency by providing more information to interested parties and splitting up the inquiries into dumping and injury, as in the US. EC officials say this would require more staff. Sir Leon's proposals, which have yet to be put to other EC commissioners, may help relaunch debate on the more sensitive question of whether to change procedures for voting on anti-dumping decisions. An earlier plan, which would give the Commission more power to push through duties, has been bogged down for a year. National officials believe concessions on the issue could help persuade France - which wants to strengthen the EC's arsenal of trade weapons - to sign up to a world trade deal, provided the problem of agricultural subsidies can be settled.</p>

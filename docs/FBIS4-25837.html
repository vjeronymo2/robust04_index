			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 15 (XINHUA) -- South China's  Guangdong Province plans to hold investment-promotion talks  especially for the mountainous counties from August 18 to 24  this year.    The province will also hold an exhibition of poverty-relief  achievements made in the mountainous areas in the past ten years.    Guangdong has 50 mountainous counties, making up 65 percent  of the whole territory of the province and 42 percent of the  province's population, and among which 31 counties are below the  poverty level.    To help these areas shake off poverty, the provincial  government has granted broad preferential treatment to the most  destitute areas.    From 1985 to 1993, the total agricultural and industrial  product value of the 50 mountainous counties has increased by  four times and the average annual income of the farmers has  doubled to 1,250 yuan.    The investment environment of the mountainous areas has also  been vastly improved in the past few years. Several railroads  and highways have been built across the areas. Roads through  the 50 mountainous counties now total 33,000 km.    Meanwhile, all 50 counties have installed program-controlled  telephones.    These areas are also rich in labor and natural resources,  such as forests, minerals, rocks and hydropower.</p>

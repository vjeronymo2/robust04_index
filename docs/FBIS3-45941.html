The eight-member delegation led by Tomur Dawamat, vice  chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's  Congress was met at the airport by Daud Taha, deputy minister of  housing and local government of Malaysia.    Dawamat told reporters that his visit is to strengthen  friendship and understanding between China, including Xinjiang  and Malaysia and to promote economic ties.    He said his visit is at the invitation of Prime Minister  Mohamed Mahathir who showed a strong interest in Xinjiang during  his official visit to China in June last year.    Dawamat is scheduled to call on the prime minister and the  supreme head of state Sultan Shah Azlan who also visited  Xinjiang in 1991.    The delegation will later tour the economic planning unit in  the prime minister's department and industrial enterprises.</p>

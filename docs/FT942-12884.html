			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks edge lower as profits are taken Wall Street US blue-chip stocks were mostly lower as investors booked profits after the previous session's powerful rally, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 6.24 easier at 3,699.54, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down a scant 0.84 at 451.87 in moderate activity. But the secondary markets improved, with the American FE composite up 2.23 at 438.20, and the Nasdaq composite 3.41 better at 734.21. Stocks opened on a firm note, with the bond market continuing to provide a favourable backdrop for a sustained improvement in share prices. In part, the optimism which inspired Monday's surprising 57-point surge by the Dow industrials carried over into the opening. But equity investors also drew quiet comfort from the resilience which longer-dated government bonds were showing in the face of the day's problematic economic data. The potential obstacle was the Conference Board's April index of consumer confidence, which came in at 91.7, from a reading of 86.1 in March. The sharp increase surprised analysts, and suggested the possibility of a spurt in consumer spending. Bonds were thrown off kilter by the news, but soon regained their stride, showing modest gains by midday. At the same time, stocks slipped into negative territory and stayed there, as mild profit-taking across the board prevented a rebound to opening levels. Many of the blue chips were showing modest losses as the session drew to a close, though analysts were generally pleased that the setback was not more severe. Corporate earnings were again a driving force in the markets, and most of the early gains were struck on better- than-expected first-quarter performances. Disney jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 after the entertainment group revealed record revenues and net income up 16 per cent in the first quarter. Elsewhere, Capital Cities/ABC gained Dollars 14 7/8 to Dollars 712 1/8 as it announced a big jump in net income and strong operating results from the ABC broadcast network. In the energy sector, Chevron shed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 90 7/8 after revealing a 23 per cent slide in net income as a result of low crude oil prices. Texaco fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 64 3/8 and Arco Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 97 3/4 . Both groups posted disappointing results the previous session. One of the session's biggest casualties was UNUM, an insurance holding company which had disclosed a slim earning gain before adjustments on Monday. The stock plummeted Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 50 1/4 on volume of 2.1m shares. Tobacco stocks picked up value on the news of an agreement by BAT Industries to acquire American Brands for Dollars 1bn in cash. American, which makes Pall Mall and Lucky Strike cigarettes, climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 34 1/2 on the announcement. Philip Morris, the world's leading marketer of tobacco products, jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 54 1/4 . RJR Nabisco was Dollars  1/2 better at Dollars 6 7/8 . On the Amex, BAT ADRs improved Dollars 9 1/16 to Dollars 13 3/4 . Canada Prices continued to climb in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index rose 27.07 points, or 0.64 per cent, to 4,263.80. The rise followed a 69.57-point jump yesterday. Advancing issues outpaced declines 460 to 322, volume of 65.01m shares exceeded Monday's 52.44m shares, and trading value was CDollars 870.1m compared with CDollars 675.3m. Industrial products recorded the day's biggest increase, 1.68 per cent. In that group, Northern Telecom soared 2  5/8 to 41 after reporting slightly higher first-quarter earnings, with the latest period including a large gain.</p>

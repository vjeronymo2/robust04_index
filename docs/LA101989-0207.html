			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE: THE BREAKING STORY;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: NBC BROADCASTS WERE LIMITED BY A LOSS OF POWER AND THE LACK OF A  BACKUP GENERATOR AT ITS AFFILIATE STATION.  </P> <P> NBC, the TV network that brought the nation some of its first dramatic coverage  of the Whittier earthquake two years ago, came in last with the least during  Tuesday's devastating San Francisco temblor because its Bay Area affiliate had  no power source and no backup generator.  </P> <P> Sitting atop Cathedral Hill, about five blocks from San Francisco City Hall,  KRON-TV was unable to get pictures of the 6.9 killer quake on the air until 7  p.m., nearly two hours after it struck. As a direct result, the San Francisco  NBC affiliate was also unable to feed the nation's top-rated network, leaving  Tom Brokaw and other NBC affiliates, including KNBC-TV Channel 4 in Los  Angeles, at the mercy of secondary sources.  </P> <P> "We lost all power," KRON news director Al Goldstein, a three-year veteran of  Bay Area broadcast news, said Wednesday. "We couldn't transmit and we could not  receive anything from any remote unit."  </P> <P> Indeed, Tom Capra, KNBC news director, said that KRON's computer system was  down for about an hour and the station was even cut off from routine news wire  services, such as Associated Press.  </P> <P> "We were FAXing them wire stories about the quake," Capra said.  </P> <P> During and immediately after the 5:04 p.m. shaker, ABC and its  owned-and-operated San Francisco outlet, KGO-TV, took advantage of their  position as the World Series network by flashing helicopter and Goodyear blimp  shots of the devastation to their TV audiences. In Los Angeles, KABC-TV Channel  7 took full advantage of the feeds, making "Eyewitness News" live up to the  full implications of its name.  </P> <P> CBS affiliate KPIX-TV had its own visuals and commentary within 30 minutes.  Though the transmission cracked and flashed on and off, KCBS-TV Channel 2 in  Los Angeles filled much of its airtime following the first two hours after the  quake with KPIX video feeds.  </P> <P> But KRON and its sister station in Los Angeles, KNBC, failed to get in on any  of the early action.  </P> <P> "We got killed by KABC because they had pictures first," KNBC's Capra said  Wednesday. "Our affiliate was off the air and that was a bad break for us."  </P> <P> Some KRON footage began to appear on CNN and other NBC stations at about 6:42  p.m. -- but only because the San Francisco office of NBC's Sacramento  affiliate, KCRA-TV, picked up KRON's then-weak signal and, unbeknownst to KRON  officials, put it up on a satellite feed.  </P> <P> KRON's problems could have been greatly reduced, if not prevented, a former  employee charged Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I told them, 'When the big one comes, we're going to need an emergency  generator and we're not going to have it,' " former KRON news director Mike  Ferring said.  </P> <P> Ferring, who left the station nearly two years ago and is now news director at  the ABC affiliate in Sacramento, KOVR-TV, told The Times that he and other news  executives had warned KRON's owner, Chronicle Broadcasting of San Francisco,  Inc., of the need for a backup power supply for its four-story building on Van  Ness Ave. year after year.  </P> <P> "They did not have emergency power and never have had it," he said. "Every year  it went into the proposed budget and every year it went out because they said  we were supplied with power from two trunk towers and there was no need for a  backup."  </P> <P> Unlike the other two network affiliates, which are located in free-standing  buildings near the Embarcadero center in San Francisco's financial district,  KRON is located further inland in an area that, ironically, did not receive  much of the brunt of the temblor.  </P> <P> "What we did was start ferrying tapes in right away," KRON's Goldstein said.  "We stayed very competitive once we hit the air."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, that wasn't until after 7 p.m., after nightfall. KRON ran into  its second big headache at that point: no light for pictures.  </P> <P> "Where there were fires and headlights . . . and there were lots of headlights  . . . we could show (the devastation)," Goldstein said.  </P> <P> But the helicopters used by KRON, as well as the other Bay Area stations, are  not equipped for extensive night time video coverage, according to former Bay  Area newsman Tom Vacar.  </P> <P> "None of their helicopters are equipped with the million candlepower lights  that we have down in Los Angeles," said Vacar, who is now a reporter for KNX-AM  (1070). "One of the great advantages of working at a station in Southern  California is that the stations do have lighting, so you can shoot after dark."  </P> <P> Vacar, who maintains an apartment in the devastated Marina area of San  Francisco, was dispatched to the Bay Area along with KNX helicopter pilot Bob  Terr less than five minutes after the quake, according to KNX news director Bob  Simms. Terr, who also had a video camera crew on board, flew up along the  Interstate 5 freeway, landing at Crissy Field in the center of the San  Francisco just before 9 p.m. Ironically, L.A.-based Vacar was able to deliver  on-the-spot radio reports to his KNX audience 500 miles to the south before  KRON could go on the air with its first videotape.  </P> <P> KOVR's Ferring said that KRON did not have an earthquake contingency plan while  he worked there and he didn't believe they had developed one since he left.  KRON's Goldstein said the station did have one but was unable to put it into  effect. As of 3 p.m. Wednesday, KRON's studios were still on emergency power  supplied by a portable generator.  </P> <P> "I have a feeling there isn't a helluva lot you can do to prepare for it, no  matter how many contingencies you've got," Ferring aid. "At one point, in the  mid-'80s, there was an attempt to get Bay Area broadcasters to get together and  come up with a plan to handle this kind of major disaster."  </P> <P> Like the backup generator that Ferring had consistently fought for at KRON, the  quake coverage master plan never came into being.  </P> <P> "There's a foolish competition that goes on (in broadcast journalism)," Vacar  said. "There's always been talk about pool reporting during a disaster, but  that's all it's ever been: talk. When there's a bona fide disaster, people are  far more interested in the breadth and the depth of the the thing than who got  it first."  </P> <P> Vacar worked as an on-camera reporter for three years at KCBS-TV in Los Angeles  as well as six years at KGO-TV in San Francisco before switching to KNX two  years ago. There is a different between the two media, he said. "Egos are out  of the way in radio. All they want is the news. On television, there's a  self-defeating competitiveness where everything depends on how it looks. That's  something that you just don't find in radio."  </P> <P> * RELATED STORIES: F8, F9, F12 and F16  </P></p>

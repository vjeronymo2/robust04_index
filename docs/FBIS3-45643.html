			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 18 (CNS)--China is to change its  state-owned enterprises into state-operated solely-funded  limited companies in a bid to establish a new state-owned  enterprise system.    The state-owned solely-funded limited company pattern will  be  a new organizational pattern in China's company system. As  enterprises of public ownership are now being involved in the  trial practice of the shareholding system, the restructuring of  state- operated enterprises into state-owned solely-funded  companies will change state-owned enterprises into legal persons  observing the basic principle and the management system employed  by companies.    Following restructuring, the solely-funded limited companies  will have certain fundamental characteristics including first,  the independence of such enterprises of the sources of their  capital and their being a legal person with their registered  capital enabling them to enjoy their civil rights and  shouldering their civil responsibilities. Second, the state is  the only source of capital for a particular enterprise and it  holds limited liability for the company to the extent defined by  the amount of capital it offers. Third, management bodies  involving state-owned assets have to base their trust on the  board of directors which should be authorized to manage the  company's assets and act in the interests of the company.</p>

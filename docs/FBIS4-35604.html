			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA)-- Field Marshal Muhammad  Husayn Tantawi, minister of defense and war production, said  that the armed forces are currently undergoing a giant  modernization process according to annual, five-year, and  long-term plans that depend on local resources and friendly  states.    Having attended the "Bahir 94" live ammunition maneuvers  conducted by an armored formation of the 2d Field Army today,  the defense minister said: We are not developing our armed  forces to antagonize anybody, because we are at peace with all  our neighbors. He pointed out that the goal of this  modernization is to ensure the preparedness of our armed forces  for accomplishing their task of defending national security.    Field Marshal Tantawi said: Our only task in peacetime is to  train our armed forces cadres to ensure their optimal combat  efficiency. The more peace is established, the better training  can be at all levels.    We seek to achieve balance between the human element and  armaments to enable individuals to use modern and sophisticated  weapons, Tantawi said. He added that the numbers of combat  elements in the armed forces are currently being increased  against those working in the service or administrative sectors.  He affirmed that the numbers of the armed forces will not be  decreased, emphasizing: We seek to achieve the optimal use of  available manpower.    The defense minister pointed out that there are no plans to  cut the term of military service for new recruits, noting that  the armed forces recruit the number of individuals they need.  He explained that the surplus recruits are absorbed into the  national service apparatus, which seeks to achieve  self-sufficiency for the armed forces.    Field Marshal Tantawi said that the armed forces have an  excellent mobilization plan that ensures shifting from a  condition of peace to one of war in record time.    The defense minister called for paying more attention to  military training, noting that sophisticated armaments need  first-rate training. We have to stretch the shelf-life of old  weapons. We have to enhance their efficiency and upgrade them to  the level of modern weapons, he said.    He stressed that commanders and officers of different ranks  should be given the opportunity to make decisions to cope with  developments in order to develop their sense of initiative and  creativity. Tantawi called for enhancing the combat efficiency  and preparedness of the armed forces and for raising fighters'  morale through constant training, discipline, and physical  fitness.    The military drill incorporated armored formations from the  2d Field Army with elements from the Air Force, Air Defense, and  Electronic and Chemical War and units from the engineering and  airborne divisions.    In the drill, our troops checked a hostile offensive action  and forced the attacking forces to retreat to the international  borders, inflicting heavy losses on them.    The exercise began with reconnaissance sorties in which our  troops gathered information on the condition of the hostile  forces. In the meantime, our forces destroyed hostile aircraft  that tried to reconnoiter our positions.    The (Shilka) and Chaparral antiaircraft missiles were used  in  the exercise. This is the first time the firing process has  been conducted from training aircraft outside the air defense  firing range. The shooting was conducted under conditions  identical to those prevailing in a real war. The antiaircraft  ballistic units dealt with the enemy's armored units to destroy  them and secure our forces' lines. Our artillery bombarded the  enemy artillery and silenced their sources.    Our aircraft attacked the depth of the enemy defenses to  destroy its artillery and armored pieces. Our artillery units  prepared for the advance of the bulk of our troops by constant  bombardment and smoke screens.    Combat units opened gaps in the enemy's mine fields, using  the Egyptian-made al-Fatih missiles, which proved their high  efficiency during the Gulf war. Our troops then advanced into  the depth of the enemy's lines, while our air defenses were  checking attacks by the enemy's air force using the (Shilka)  missiles, characterized by the ability to deal with air targets  while moving.    Our artillery succeeded in silencing the enemy's reserve  artillery deep in the lines by firing long distance. It also  succeeded in destroying the enemy's armored vehicles, using  highly-explosive ammunition with the help of antitank  helicopters.    MI-8 helicopters were meanwhile landing paratroopers behind  the enemy's artillery lines to create a gap in its defenses. A  Buffalo aircraft loaded with antitank weapons landed on the  battlefield to replenish our troops' supply of ammunition.    Our troops finally managed to control the territory that was  seized by the enemy, forcing its troops to retreat. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certification should be granted for a limited period of time. The procedure for recertification could be simply verification of satisfactory employment with the appropriate type of equipment for that certification level/classes since the time the previous certification was granted or it could entail additional refresher courses, ``hands-on'' demonstration, or passing of a written examination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Revocation of Certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There should be a procedure included in the certification program to revoke a certification for falsifying or providing inaccurate information in the certification process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The components listed above as the model State certification program are modelled after the certification standards developed by the ASME for MWC and MWI operators. These ASME certification standards were developed by a committee balanced by interest classification (e.g., regulatory, operators, manufacturers, etc.) and underwent public review and comment. The EPA was a member of the ASME committee for the development of the MWI certification standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August 1992, to ensure the availability of at least one appropriate national certification program, the EPA requested the ASME to develop and manage a nationwide certification program for boiler operators. As a result, the ASME Board of Safety Codes &amp; Standards and the Council on Codes &amp; Standards approved the formation of a committee in June 1994 to develop such a program. The ASME certification program is anticipated to be completed in late 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the EPA will provide the final student handbook and instructor guide, developed by the EPA, to the States so they may implement operator training or certification programs prior to finalization of the ASME certification program. In addition, some States may already require that boiler operators obtain state boiler operator engineer licenses. If these licensing agencies demonstrate equivalency, a State air pollution control agency could accept this licensing as certification under this program. Licensing organizations, such as the National Institute for the Uniform Licensing of Power Engineers Incorporated, have commented that there are other licensing organizations that may be able to provide certification programs in a shorter timeframe than the ASME since they already have a licensing program developed for boiler operators along with a possible database of appropriate questions. They also indicated a willingness to modify their programs to meet whatever criteria a State sets for a certification program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the October 6, 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the training materials developed by the EPA will be revised as necessary when the ASME certification program is sufficiently developed to ensure that the training course is coordinated with the certification requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ASME has previously developed certification programs for operators of MWC's and MWI's. In terms of the boiler operator certification, the EPA's intention is to continue to work with the ASME by serving on the various development committees and by providing technical assistance to develop a certification program. The ASME certification program is anticipated to be completed no earlier than late 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

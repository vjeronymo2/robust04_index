			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (4): Technology is the weapon against London - Frankfurt's stock exchange LONDON'S spectacular failure to develop its Taurus settlement system has brought cheer to the hearts of Frankfurt financiers eager to challenge London's primacy as Europe's leading financial centre. The reason is that London's failure to devise an electronic way of 'dematerialising' share settlement has highlighted what German financiers believe to be the Frankfurt financial markets' superior technological edge over London. While the German securities markets have suffered under a number of competitive disadvantages - such as a strict regulatory regime which has discouraged financial innovation and a lack of investor-oriented supervision  -technology has been a central weapon in the battle with London. The aim of the campaign has been to win back market share in German securities - in equities, bonds and derivatives - from London to Germany. These efforts will be intensified further with the future development of the Deutsche Borse AG, Germany's unified stock-exchange structure, which came into being at the beginning of the year. There are two important areas in which Germany's financial institutions have invested heavily in technology: The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), a fully-screen based trading system for future and options. This has existed for only three and a half years, but in that time has mounted a vigorous challenge to Liffe, London's open-outcry derivatives market, Europe's largest. The total number of contracts handled by DTB climbed from 6.8m in 1990 to 34.8m last year (confounding critics who said that a screen-based system would not function in hectic market conditions). It has 79 member institutions - about 40 per cent of these are non-German - and it is expanding beyond Germany with a recent agreement to link up with Matif, its French equivalent. A fully electronic system is more technologically advanced than one where brokers shout and wave their arms about amid an avalanche of paper, as at Liffe. But having the technological edge has not necessarily given the DTB the business advantage: in May this year 70 per cent of the business in the crucial Bund future is still done in London rather than over the DTB. This worries German financiers, because it is likely that much of the business in 10-year German government securities is also done in London. But the DTB struck back with a medium-term government bond future (the Bobl). The DTB dominates this market, with a share of 80 per cent, although Liffe introduced a competing product in January this year. It has always been somewhat irksome to German financiers that London, a centre for international equity trading as well as for UK equities, should have captured much of the business in German shares via the Seaq International price display system, which requires a telephone call to execute an order. One reason why fund managers may have been driven to execute their transactions in blue-chip German stocks via London rather than Germany is because of the lack of securities-market supervision in Germany. Another was the fragmentation of liquidity and visibility between the eight exchanges now merged into the new Deutsche Borse structure. Technology alone could not overcome these obstacles - which are being dealt with - but the introduction of the Ibis screen dealing system for Germany's leading share and bond issues in April 1991 has succeeded in pulling back business from London. London's share of business in Germany's 30 leading shares has dropped from 14 per cent in 1989 to 10.25 per cent last year, says Mr Rudiger von Rosen, chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, citing Bank of England statistics. He attributes this success to the Ibis system, which within Germany now has a 44 per cent market share of turnover in the leading shares, more than twice the level only a year ago. Last summer, it appeared that Ibis would not be the last word in the development of electronic trading systems for the German securities markets. Details of a study commissioned by the Frankfurt stock exchange leaked out, suggesting that during the 1990s Germany would move to a fully paperless system for equity trading. The report, conducted by the McKinsey consulting firm, proved too radical. Floor-based trading systems are to remain, assisted by technological innovations such as the recently introduced, so-called, Boss-Cube order-routeing system, which has been designed to eliminate the paper flow associated with a share order. But the new Deutsche Borse is to be used to develop a 'one-stop' shop for the purchase of equities, bonds and derivatives, together with settlement services. It can only be brought about by further advances in technology. This was made clear by Mr Rolf Breuer, chairman of the Deutsche Borse and head of securities at Deutsche Bank, when he used his influence to appoint a successor to Mr von Rosen as chief executive. Von Rosen, a former head of public relations at the Bundesbank, is to be replaced later this year by Mr Werner Seifert, a Swiss citizen who is now head of Swiss Re's primary insurance business. Until 1987 Mr Siefert was a partner at McKinsey. His background in technology and finance is thought to be the decisive factor behind his appointment. The organisation which he will head up from next August this year is a holding structure which brings the Frankfurt stock exchange, Germany's largest, under the same roof as the DTB and the Deutscher Kassenverein, the German settlement system. Whatever advances are yet to be made, the Germans are pleased that they do not have to follow London's example and develop a dematerialised share transfer system - they have this in the Kassenverein already. It offers settlement within 48 hours - and if the order is put in early enough, within the same trading day.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Eve static at Pounds 2.5m midway Pre-tax profits at Eve Group, the USM-traded civil engineering company, were little changed at Pounds 2.5m, against Pounds 2.51m, for the six months to end September. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 33m to Pounds 33.8m. Mr Roger Ames, chairman, said recessionary conditions still affected parts of the business, adding that it was difficult to predict the future with any certainty. However, he was confident that the full-year's results would be 'at a level similar to the previous year'. Earnings per share were down 1p to 16.1p but the interim dividend is again 3p.</p>

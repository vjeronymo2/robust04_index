			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Investors reject Grupo Torras draft accounts SHAREHOLDERS of Grupo Torras, the Kuwait Investment Office's (KIO) troubled Spanish industrial holding company, yesterday rejected the company's 1991 draft accounts, AP-DJ reports from Madrid. In a statement, Grupo Torras said the holding company's advisors had recommended that shareholders reject the accounts at a general shareholders' meeting in Madrid. However, shareholders agreed to submit the unapproved accounts to the Spanish stock exchange commission within the required time limit. The commission has given Grupo Torras until tomorrow to make public the accounts, carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which are reported to reverse the consolidated net profit of Pta3.96bn (Dollars 36.4bn) initially claimed by Torras to a loss of Pta44.4bn. Although Grupo Torras is not traded on the Madrid stock exchange, several of its holdings - including the food products company Ebro Agricolas SA and the chemicals concern Ercros SA - are listed. The shareholders' meeting had been delayed by an on-going investigation of the previous management of Grupo Torras, which was replaced by a new team in May, said Mr Mahmoud Al-Nouri, acting chairman. The new management brought in KPMG Peat Marwick, the international accounting group, in an attempt to discover why the group has made huge losses despite the Dollars 4bn that the KIO has injected into its Spanish investments since 1986. The preliminary accounts for 1991 show a net loss of Pta44.44bn against a profit of Pta3.83bn previously, a loss before extraordinaries of Pta33.7bn (loss of Pta14.05bn), and an extraordinary loss of Pta10.74bn against a gain of Pta14.05bn.</p>

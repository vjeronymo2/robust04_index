			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Helical Bar jumps to Pounds 4m Rents from properties acquired during 1993 enabled Helical Bar, the property investment and development company, to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.22m to Pounds 4.02m in the half year to July 31. Turnover advanced to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 10.9m), with most of the increase coming from acquisitions. Mr Michael Slade, managing director, said Helical had bought little investment property during the period and had been concentrating on development projects. Administrative expenses increased to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 943,000) and net interest costs were Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 2.6m), including Pounds 590,000 of interest capitalised on development projects. After tax of Pounds 835,000, earnings per share were 10.83p (10.89p) basic and 10.93p fully diluted. The interim dividend is increased from 2.5p to 2.75p. During the first half Helical put in place Pounds 100m of new banking facilities, including an Pounds 85m 10-year borrowing facility. Since July, the company has agreed a further Pounds 20m seven-year facility at a fixed interest rate of 8.625 per cent. Mr Slade said Helical now had Pounds 21m of cash and Pounds 45m undrawn banking facilities at its disposal to fund acquisitions of investment property and developments. The company has agreed funding with investment institutions for five office and industrial developments, which should have a value of about Pounds 35m on completion. A further three developments are planned, at Camberley in Surrey, Edinburgh and the City of London. Institutional funding for these schemes is being sought. Earlier this week Helical formed a joint venture with former employees of retail group Sears.</p>

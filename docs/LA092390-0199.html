			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POISONED SQUIRRELS  </P> <P> Weren't our state parks established to preserve our natural resources? I was  shocked to read in The Times that park rangers at San Elijo State Park have  poisoned and killed over three-fourths of the ground squirrel population at the  park ("Poison Grain Keeps Underground Squirrels Under Control at Beach," Sept.  13).  </P> <P> Why should these animals be labeled as "pests" and exterminated? They are  native to the area and have as much right as any other species to live in the  park and to be protected.  </P> <P> Why didn't state park officials alert animal activist groups when the ground  squirrel over-population problem was identified? Why didn't they invite these  groups and concerned individuals to meet and discuss ways to trap and relocate  the ground squirrels, or develop a chemosterilant as a birth control measure?  </P> <P> With all the current interest in protecting native wildlife, surely ways could  be found to deal with the problem without resorting to mass killing of the  animals.  </P> <P> State parks officials should institute a program which requires them to notify  animal activist and conservation groups whenever they identify a wildlife  over-population problem. The arbitrary and crass mass killing of ground  squirrels should not be repeated.  </P> <P> GORDON L. WILSON  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

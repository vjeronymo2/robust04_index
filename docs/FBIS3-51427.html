			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enelcys Rodriguez Calderon; quotation marks as </F> published]    [Text] "The report Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin  has presented is not sufficiently clear and explicit enough to  reach final conclusions" on the actions of crew members of the  National Guard helicopter, Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa  Antich has said at Miraflores Palace.    The report prepared by the Colombian Government and  delivered  12 January by the Colombian foreign minister to President Ramon  J. Velasquez establishes that the aircraft entered illegally  Colombian territory, violated international and internal rules  of states as well as the safety and property of individuals in  that country.    The Venezuelan foreign minister has said he read carefully  the document and found that it is not sufficiently  comprehensive. Ochoa Antich has said: "It is said National  Guard members fired upon the helicopter themselves, because the  shots were fired from the side, instead of from bottom to top.  The defense minister made an explanation to me, and I, who also  have some knowledge in this regard, believe that it may have  occurred while the helicopter made a turn; therefore, this is  not enough evidence."    Ochoa explained that the Colombian Government has reached  negative conclusions regarding the actions of the helicopter  crew members and that the reasoning leading to this hypothesis  is insufficient." The reason why the report has concluded that  the members of the patrol fired the shots is because two empty  cases of a 562 projectile appeared near the place where the  helicopter was found."    For Ochoa, the evidence supplied by Colombia is not  sufficiently strong or accurate, and he added that the report's  conclusions were based on statements by residents of the area."  This leads us to wait for the investigation being conducted by  the Defense Ministry." He added that the helicopter case does  not merit issuing a letter of protest.    When questioned on whether good conduct was the main  condition for repatriating Colombian inmates, Ochoa stated  flatly: "No. The agreement clearly establishes that the  reasons are very specific; they should be sentenced prisoners  and must be willing to be sent to the other country." That  requisite "is not included in the agreements," he concluded.</p>

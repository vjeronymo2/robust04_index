			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONTAMINANTS DETECTED IN COMPANIES' DISPOSAL WELLS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: EPA ORDERS CAR DEALER AND TIRE STORE TO FIND NEW WAYS OF DISPOSING  OF THEIR TAINTED RINSE WATER.  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered a Newhall tire store and a  Lancaster automotive dealership to stop injecting rinse water tainted with  cancer-causing chemicals into underground disposal wells.  </P> <P> The chemicals found at Sierra Toyota Inc. of Lancaster and Daily Tire and  Automotive Inc. of Newhall are not an immediate health threat, but were found  in concentrations above federal safety standards, EPA spokeswoman Lois Grunwald  said Thursday.  </P> <P> The two businesses were among five automotive service companies in Los Angeles  County ordered to correct what federal officials said were violations of the  Safe Drinking Water Act.  </P> <P> The presence of lead, trichloroethane and vinyl chloride in water samples taken  at the Newhall and Lancaster companies indicates a potential for ground-water  contamination, Grunwald said.  </P> <P> At Sierra, for example, EPA samplings found 59 micrograms per liter of  trichloroethane, well above the safety standard of 5 m.p.l., she said.  </P> <P> Both companies were ordered to stop injecting water into the wells, to dispose  of fluids remaining in the wells and to temporarily seal all pipes and floor  drains leading to the wells.  </P> <P> Known as injection wells, the wells accept water used to rinse work areas and  then percolates into the ground. At Daily Tire and Sierra Toyota, EPA  investigators found that oil, degreasing solvents and other chemicals were  allowed to mix with normal rinse water injected into the wells, rather than  being cleaned up separately, Grunwald said. There was no evidence that the  mixing was intentional or malicious, she said.  </P> <P> Under the EPA order mailed last Friday, the businesses must find alternative  ways to dispose of the chemicals, such as recycling, Grunwald said.  </P> <P> "I'm going to do whatever is right to comply with the order," said Leon Graham,  owner of Daily Tire. "I'm not going to fight it."  </P> <P> The EPA also ordered Foothill Chevrolet of La Canada, as well as Trancas Canyon  Chevron and Ball and Sons Auto Inc., both of Malibu, to take the same remedial  actions.  </P></p>

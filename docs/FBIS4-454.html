			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation in the area of Menongue, Cuando  Cubango Province, appears to be returning to normal after the  clashes which occurred on 8 April. It is noteworthy, though,  that the government forces which were dislodged from their  temporary base in the vicinity of Cuelei, are now regrouping.  It is not yet known whether they plan to launch yet another  military offensive.    The military command for the independent area of Menongue  today announced that technical preparation combat maneuvers are  to be carried out over the course of this week in a bid to  contain new attacks. That command also asked people in National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola-controlled areas in  general, and in the area of Cuchi in particular, to remain calm,  adding that the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FALA,  will know how to defend the interests of the civilian population.    The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor  Party's adventurous plans to attack and take Cuchi District cost  its People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA,  91 soldiers killed and 193 wounded. Major Americo, of the 14th  Infantry Regiment, was among the dead.</p>

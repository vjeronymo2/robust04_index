			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLCHILDREN VICTIMIZED AS STATE FEEDS OFF COUNTY FUNDS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: BUDGET PROCESS LETS LAWS SLIP INTO EXISTENCE WITHOUT PROPER PUBLIC  HEARINGS BUT WITH WIDESPREAD EFFECTS THAT ONLY A FEW REALIZED.  </P> <P> The added financial problem that school districts in Orange County, as well as  others throughout the state, now face goes back to the closing hours of the  last legislative session. The rhetoric in the Assembly chamber in the final  hours of the state budget debate was angry, frustrated, personal and very  partisan. Public policy implications were for the most part lost, and the  budget package was clearly a "get me through the night" document that few  expect to hold up longer than six months.  </P> <P> Yet one statement made by Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), during the most  rancorous exchanges, stood out as the best description of this budget and its  disastrous effects on local government. Isenberg was addressing his Republican  colleagues across the aisle when he said: "Face it, the 1980s are over. Your  slogans don't work anymore, and neither do ours."  </P> <P> Those slogans, used on both sides of the aisle, have resulted in state budget  gimmickry that makes a mockery out of funding local government and basic human  services.  </P> <P> As a prime example of how badly the budget process has broken down, consider  the passage of Senate Bill 2557 (Sen. Ken Maddy, R-Fresno). This new law pits  underfunded county services against underfunded school services by authorizing  county government to charge school districts for the collection of property  taxes in lieu of the state fully funding state mandated services administered  by counties.  </P> <P> In essence, the state has forced county government to put its hand into the  school pocket if it is to have any semblance of a balanced budget.  </P> <P> As the weeks went on beyond the constitutional deadline for the Legislature to  complete the state budget, the battle centered upon attempts to suspend the  funding provisions for schools under Proposition 98, the 1988 constitutional  amendment guaranteeing a minimum base level of funding for education.  </P> <P> When at last it became apparent that there were insufficient votes to balance  the budget on the backs of our schoolchildren, the leadership of the Assembly  and Senate and the governor stopped posturing and got down to dealing.  </P> <P> Out of their closed-door meetings, an agreement was finally reached. But the  leadership package of revenues and program cuts required numerous pieces of  legislation to be enacted.  </P> <P> Within hours, language was developed, bills were amended, analyses were written  and the vote was taken. Buried in that package of bills that had been gutted,  rewritten and never subject to public hearing was SB 2557.  </P> <P> The analysis of the bill (which is all that even the speediest of readers could  have read in the crush of those last moments) mentioned nothing about public  schools. In fact, one floor analysis's only reference to the property tax  collection fee was "and makes various allowances and requirements for counties  to recover costs." The major description of SB 2557 referenced an authorization  for counties to charge booking fees to other local jurisdictions.  </P> <P> Most legislators could not know the full impact of SB 2557 on schools as they  were acting in haste upon inaccurate information provided by the leaders who  concocted the deal. But it was clear to the governor and to the legislative  leadership what they were doing. While slashing support for California's 58  counties to below the bone and taking that money for their own budget  priorities, they were purposely making up the difference by forcing counties to  take more than $100 million from schools statewide.  </P> <P> The schools can ill afford this back-door thievery.  </P> <P> While the Proposition 98 guarantee generated a 4.76% cost-of-living adjustment  for education, the governor unilaterally hacked that amount down to 3%. When  compared to the 5.2% cost-of-living adjustment needed just to stay even with  prior year costs, schools suffered a 2.2% loss in the budget appropriations.  The property tax collection fees further reduce the money for education locally  by an additional 1.25% to 1.50%, leaving schools with about a 1.5% increase to  stretch against 5.2% in costs. And that is without a pay raise for anyone.  </P> <P> In Orange County, these fees mean real reductions of dollars to school budgets.  </P> <P> Ranging from $11 to $46 per student, the total reduction in education funding  in the county for our K-12 districts amounts to more than $7 million. As a  sampling: Garden Grove Unified School District's bill for property tax  collection fees will exceed $400,000; Santa Ana Unified School District will  pay $560,000; Capistrano Unified School District will need to pony up more than  $680,000 and Newport-Mesa Unified School District will be hit with a tab of  more than $670,000. With an approximate average cost of $50,000 to operate one  classroom for one year, the $7 million translates into 140 classrooms -- or the  cost of educating 4,200 students.  </P> <P> Worse than the monetary bottom lines for both counties and schools is the  incredible and unsound budget precedent set by the state. Without public review  of any kind, the state took money from one local government entity in order to  avoid dealing with its own conspicuous consumption, yet it left in place the  state mandates to provide the services that those dollars were meant to fund.  </P> <P> While the state fed off of the county funds, they told counties not to worry as  counties were now authorized to feed off of school budgets in order to recover  the money the state failed to supply. The problem for schools is that they are  the end of the food chain. The ones who are fed off of ultimately are the  children.  </P> <P> It is interesting to note that counties also collect property taxes for the  state, yet no one authorized the counties to collect fees from the state for  performing the same service that is now chargeable to school districts.  </P> <P> As budget crises continue throughout the year, it will be important for the  public to know that schools are not to blame and counties are not to blame. In  fact, this is not even an issue between schools and counties, though some will  characterize it as such.  </P> <P> The blame for the feeding frenzy on local government budgets falls squarely on  the Legislature and its fondness for passing laws without providing the needed  resources. When counties and schools line up in bankruptcy court, which they  are starting to do, the line will really begin and end on the steps of the  Capitol. Until the slogans end and the policy discussions begin, California  will continue to have a fatally flawed budget process that fails to address the  real service needs of our state.  </P></p>

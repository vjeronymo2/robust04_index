			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Siemens arm in turbine pact with Russia KWU, the power engineering arm of Germany's Siemens industrial group, has signed a co-operation agreement with KTZ, Russia's largest industrial turbine manufacturer, for joint production and marketing both in Russia and on the world market. At the same time Siemens/KWU will take up a 10 per cent shareholding in the Russian enterprise, which was privatised in January. The deal was signed in Kaluga, 250km south of Moscow, where KTZ is based. A spokesman for KWU said yesterday that the deal would give Siemens access for the first time to the Russian market for smaller industrial turbines. At the same time, KTZ would be able to provide components for Siemens turbines on the international market at competitive prices, and Siemens would help the Russian concern market its own products world-wide. No price was put on the share purchase, although the nominal value of the shares is Rbs62m. In addition, KWU will provide the Russian enterprise with machinery and know-how to overhaul its production plant. The Russian manufacturer employs 9,200 workers, and has a market share in the former Soviet Union of around 50 per cent, KWU said. It is the largest supplier of turbines up to 35MW capacity. KTZ, the Kalushsky Turbiny Zavod, is now 40 per cent owned by its workforce and 40 per cent by the Russian government. KWU has taken up half the remaining shares, with the rest distributed amongst smaller shareholders. Although KWU already has good connections in the big power station market in Russia - it signed a joint venture to build gas turbines in St Petersburg with the turbine manufacturer LMZ in recent weeks - the new deal is its first in the smaller industrial turbine market. 'We will get the opportunity, on the one hand, to offer our turbines in the future on the Russian market, which we believe has great potential,' KWU said. 'Apart from that, we will be able to buy components from KTZ for our turbines at favourable prices, improving our competitiveness in international markets.'</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHOOSE AND CUT YOUR CHRISTMAS TREE  </P> <P> Time constraints, modern life styles and weather all conspire to deny county  residents many of the trappings of a traditional Christmas. There are not too  many sleigh rides to grandma's, for example, when the thermometer lurks around  70 degrees.  </P> <P> But one tradition we can enjoy is cutting a fresh Christmas tree.  </P> <P> Orange County has a nice crop of tree farms where either you or the farm staff  can cut a tree. Some farms provide services such as home delivery, flocking and  fire-retarding; some provide seasonal treats. Most farms plan to be open until  Christmas Eve but will close when their stocks are depleted.  </P> <P> ANAHEIM GREEN TREE FARMS  </P> <P> 2715 W.

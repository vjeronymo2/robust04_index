			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Dai Yaping (2071 0068 1627)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 17 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Lu Ruihua,  executive vice governor of Guangdong Province, said that in the  first quarter of this year, while actively carrying out fiscal,  foreign trade, banking, and investment reform, Guangdong  continued to grasp the opportunity for accelerating development  and maintained the momentum of economic growth.    At a recent meeting in Guangzhou, the provincial government  analyzed some prominent problems in economic operations and  worked out solutions.    According to Lu Ruihua, in the first quarter, the gross  industrial output value produced by enterprises at and above  township level in Guangdong reached 105.1 billion yuan, an  increase of 21 percent over the same period last year; sales  reached 96.7 billion yuan, an increase of 18 percent; exports  reached $7.555 billion, an increase of 16.1 percent; and the  amount of foreign funds actually used reached $2.196 billion, an  increase of 48.8 percent.    Prominent problems in economic operations at present include  a high rate of price increases, a serious shortage of working  funds, a hidden crisis in grain production, and a lack of  coordination between some reform measures.    Lu Ruihua said: The Guangdong government is soberly aware of  the current situation, and realizes the necessity of strictly  controlling the scale of investment while facing a stern  monetary situation, stabilizing and developing grain production  and preventing grain production from declining, and  conscientiously carrying out fiscal reform and guaranteeing  stable increases in fiscal revenue.    He said: Local governments at all levels in the province  must attach great importance to keeping prices of daily  necessities stable, strictly control the adoption of price  reform measures without going their own way, intensify  government control over market prices, establish food price  regulation funds more quickly, establish a reserve system for  major commodities, and resolutely check various practices which  are contrary to price control regulations.</p>

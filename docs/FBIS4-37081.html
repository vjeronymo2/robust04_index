			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review  of all items in the 10 June issue of the Arabic-language  newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islam issues.  <H5>  Contents: </H5> 1. Writer Berates Government Approach to Dialogue, Sets Terms    2. Writer Sees Muslim Brotherhood History as Commendable    3. Appeal To Mubarak to Use Dialogue With Islamists    4. Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Denies Disagreement With  Labor    Party    5. Report Says Security Forces `Liquidated' Islamists    6. Lawyers Association Determined To Uncover Lawyer's  Killers  <H5>  WRITER BERATES GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO DIALOGUE, SETS TERMS </H5>   In his 3,500-word article on page 5, Labor Party Secretary  General 'Adil Husayn criticizes the government's approach to the  proposed national dialogue which, he believes, would be useless  if it were not an instrument of change and exhaustive reform.  Stating that "national dialogue must start with political  reform, or the right to change the ruler," he says that all  signs indicate that the government wants one thing but the  people want another. "We want it to be a triumph for the  approach of democratic change, while they want it to be a  tyrannical, terrorist setback that further establishes the  present regime, with all its incompetence and corruption," he  says.    Husayn notes that nothing in the public policy or the ruling  approach has changed since the call for dialogue was made. "The  most fateful laws are still being passed in a hurry without  serious discussion," he says, pointing out that instead of  recognizing the role of the opposition, the government has  tightened the noose around it by taking its free writers to  military courts and harassing the Muslim Brothers. He affirms,  however, that "we will not boycott the dialogue, unless it is  proven beyond a doubt and before all that they are determined to  conspire and hatch evil plots."    Registering his party's objection to the formation of the  committee in charge of preparing the national dialogue, Husayn  sums up the terms of "collective national powers and parties."    He emphasizes the need for a balanced representation of  people from various intellectual inclinations in the proposed  general congress for the national dialogue. For this purpose he  suggests that the total number of representatives be limited to  "200 members for example" to ensure a balanced exchange of  views. He stresses that National Democratic Party members  should not be favored over other parties, that representatives  of major parties should be increased, that no major trade or  professional union should be excluded, that universities should  be represented, and that the Islamic current should be  represented compatibly with its intellectual and political  weight in the society.    Moving on to the agenda of the national dialogue, he sums up  the three self-evident principles by the following: To  guarantee man's basic right to protect his body, dignity, honor,  and money; to work out ways to put an end to election rigging;  and to agree on collective objection to the use of armed force  in political conflicts, or what he terms "the so-called civilian  terrorism."    "The general congress must openly announce from the first  moment that it will not culminate in binding resolutions, apart  from the three self-evident principles. If you wish to expand  the scope of discussion and exchange of views, it is alright  with us, so long as the world will follow what is going on via  the central mass media," Husayn concludes.  <H5>  APPEAL TO MUBARAK TO USE DIALOGUE WITH ISLAMISTS </H5>   In the 500-word "Quiet Message to President Mubarak" on page  9, Muhammad Isma'il says to Mubarak that the evil retinue around  him has put an invincible wall between him and the people, as is  evident from the wedge driven between the president and  Islamists in general.    "Some have harbored evil intentions toward Islam and  Muslims;  they were brought up and weaned on disbelief and infidelity. An  opportunity was offered to them on a silver platter to release  their suppressed poisons in the face of the Islamic revival,  which we unfortunately failed to exploit. They used the  country's ordeal to win your favor with their false slogans and  insincere words," he writes.    "Whoever told you, Mr. President, that Islamists have  ambition to rule or to take your chair is a liar and an  unethical hypocrite," he states.    Explaining that emergency laws, arrests on suspicion, and  scaring and framing the people have not succeeded in stopping  terrorism, he pleads with the president "to try, even for once,  the approach of dialogue and good counselling; use love rather  than hatred, tolerance rather than spite, and sincerity rather  than ill will." He proposes to the president to give scholars  the chance to talk to Islamists first in jail and then outside  of jail, and to give orders to stop torturing prisoners and  improve their living conditions. He affirms that accepting  dialogue or mediation with our sons will strengthen rather than  weaken the government.  <H5>  WRITER SEES MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HISTORY AS COMMENDABLE </H5>   A 400-word article by Ahmad 'Izz-al-Din on page 7 comments  on  "the security and media clampdown on the Muslim Brotherhood" and  the repeated use of the term "secret organization" to refer to  the organization.    Referring to a report in the 3 June issue of the weekly  magazine AL-MUSAWWAR, filed as NC1106202194 and add, he says  that what the magazine terms secret documents of the Muslim  Brotherhood were based on "a confidential memorandum written by  Brigadier General M.R. of the State Security, hoping to present  the Muslim Brothers as an easy prey to the regime to exterminate  them."    'Izz-al-Din emphasizes that even if the information revealed  in the magazine report was true, the Muslim Brothers' quest to  impose themselves on the political map and their wish to avoid  provoking the security apparatus could not be described as a  secret action or as terrorism.    "AL-MUSAWWAR's security report has unmasked some positive  aspects in the secret group that are lacking in the public  ruling party and other overt political powers. Among these is  the fact that the elections of the secret organization are being  done by free and secret balloting and that everyone will have an  equal opportunity to run for the leading positions," 'Izz-al-Din  says.    The writer adds that it is alright to uncover more hidden  facts about that secret organization, because "what the  government sees as criticism we see as praise and what it sees  as a vice we see as a virtue."    He concludes: "If the government keeps up its current  course, the Muslim Brothers will gain more prominence and  popular support. They will even walk the streets and call: This  is the secret organization; who wants to join?"  <H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SPOKESMAN DENIES DISAGREEMENT WITH LABOR </H5> PARTY    An unattributed 120-word report on page 7 says that Ma'mun  al-Hudaybi, official spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood, denied  a report published in the "last" issue of the AL-'ARABI  newspaper, which quoted him as saying that "the Labor Party does  not represent the Muslim Brotherhood and we disagree with  Ibrahim Shukri."    Al-Hudaybi explains that the newspaper distorted his words  and that he did not say that there was a disagreement between  the Muslim Brotherhood and the Labor Party. He affirmed that  what he said was: "With all due respect to Ibrahim Shukri and  the Labor Party leaders, the party--as stated by its leader  Ibrahim Shukri--does not represent the Muslim Brotherhood on the  committee in charge of preparing for national dialogue."  <H5>  REPORT SAYS SECURITY FORCES `LIQUIDATED' ISLAMISTS </H5>   A 120-word report by 'Adil al-Bahnasawi on pages 1 and 7  says  that security forces used armored cars to bulldoze the house in  which four members of the Islamic Group were hiding in Tama,  when these forces failed to arrest them. The four were  "liquidated" after the house was bulldozed completely.    The report adds that the security forces, in a separate  incident, took four Islamists from jails in Asyut and three  students in a police car to a cemetery in Tahta, where they were  tied-up and shot dead.  <H5>  LAWYERS ASSOCIATION DETERMINED TO UNCOVER LAWYER'S KILLERS </H5>   An 800-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi and Khalid Yunus on  pages 1 and 7 cites Ahmad Sayf-al-Islam Hasan al-Banna,  secretary general of the Lawyers Association, as he affirms at a  press conference that the association's crisis is "purely  professional" and that the association was only acting upon its  established principle to protest the violation of the rights of  one of its members to live. In the report, al-Banna affirms that  the association will keep up its efforts until the names of the  officers who were responsible for the death of Lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani are publicized.    "Unless the government takes the necessary legal measures,  we  will lodge a complaint with the UN Human Rights Commission to  launch an investigation," al-Banna said. He added that an  official in the American Middle East Watch Human Rights  Organization will meet with the Association members to discuss  the case.    Al-Banna stressed that the government cannot dissolve the  association's council and that a court ruling in al-Sadat's time  emphasized that it is unconstitutional to dissolve the council.</p>

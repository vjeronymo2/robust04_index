			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Borovkov report under the "News From the Regions" </F> rubric: "Fate Crushes Down on Central Newspapers in the Shape  of `Molot'"]    [Text] Rostov-na-Donu -- Many subscribers to central  newspapers in Rostov Oblast have been left without their  favorite periodicals. "Molot," the biggest publishing house in  Russia's South, has discontinued printing such newspapers as  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, and  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA. Awaiting their turn are GUDOK, SOVETSKIY  SPORT, and SPORT-EKSPRESS. The reason is the one that has grown  to be banal: The newspapers cannot pay their newsprint and  printing debts.</p>

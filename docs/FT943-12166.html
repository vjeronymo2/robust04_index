			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Supervisors alert banks on bonuses: Payments to derivatives dealers The world's banks have been warned not to tie the bonuses paid to financial derivatives dealers too closely to the profits of the products they sell as this could create excessive risks. The Basle Committee of international supervisors gave the warning in its guidelines for bank supervisors, published yesterday, on how banks should manage derivatives such as swaps and options. Similar guidelines were issued yesterday to regulators of securities firms by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco). The guidelines come amid debate over the derivative trading activities of banks and securities firms and follow proposals from the Basle Committee this month that banks should have to hold more capital to cover derivative risks. The Basle committee suggests that banks could be at risk if their dealers - some of whom attract multi-million dollar bonuses - are paid on the profitability of the trades without the risks being considered. Their guidelines place strong emphasis on senior directors of banks being told in plain language about the risks they may be running. They say that the risks should be translated into simple terms in internal reports. Supervisors in individual Group of Ten countries covered by the Basle committee are also told to ensure that banks do not allow their traders to start selling new derivatives products before managers understand them. Mr Tommasso Padoa-Schioppa, the Basle committee chairman, said the guidelines would help banks improve risk management systems. He said banks and securities regulators had worked jointly on guidelines despite the fact that they issued separate documents. There has been a history of division between the two industries' supervisors. There was a split between the Basle Committee and Iosco last year, when efforts to devise joint rules on capital charges for trading activities broke down. The Iosco guidelines warn that the potential profits from derivatives may lead firms to 'ignore or underestimate' risks, particularly those from new products. The Basle guidelines warn of the 'liquidity risks' of being unable to unwind lossmaking positions in volatile markets. Guidance on risk, Page 26</p>

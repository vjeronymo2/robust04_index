			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Technology: Preserving the formula - Continuing a series on innovation in the recession, Clive Cookson looks at the chemical sector's survival strategy In the UK, industries based on chemistry have a far more successful recent record of innovation than those based on physics. While British chemical and pharmaceutical companies keep innovative products flowing on to the world market, their counterparts in electronics and engineering have all but abandoned global competition and settled for roles as niche players. Over the last decade the UK chemicals industry has nearly doubled the proportion of turnover devoted to research and development from 3 to 6 per cent. This year it will spend about Pounds 1.6bn on R&amp;D. Chemical companies are for the most part unanimous in the view that R&amp;D must be maintained during the current business downturn, though it may need to be focused better. And in pharmaceuticals, where R&amp;D budgets are typically 15 per cent of sales, the issue of protecting innovation in the recession simply does not arise - the world market for medicines continues to grow strongly. ICI, the UK chemicals giant, inevitably dominates the performance of the whole industry. The company has been pushing up R&amp;D spending by about 15 per cent a year over the past decade. In 1990 it increased by Pounds 40m to Pounds 679m. Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, told shareholders at the annual general meeting last week that R&amp;D would continue to receive priority: 'The innovative application of chemistry and related sciences will probably be the most important single factor in maintaining ICI's success in the future.' Peter Doyle, ICI research director, expects to have slightly more to spend on R&amp;D again this year - probably between Pounds 680m and Pounds 700m. With the group turnover likely to fall as a result of the recession the research budget will take a greater share of ICI's resources. The way ICI is protecting R&amp;D from cuts contrasts with its treatment of capital investment, which is being reduced by Pounds 100m this year. But R&amp;D, like all ICI activities, is being focused more selectively. Projects are most vulnerable in the field of high-performance materials, to which ICI has devoted a lot of resources over the last few years without achieving great commercial success. 'At present we're carefully appraising the materials business, and I'm looking for some reshaping in that area,' Doyle says. Slightly more than half of ICI's R&amp;D is in the bio-sciences, mainly for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical businesses. ICI Seeds is the best example of an innovative field in which the company is maintaining its research effort through the recession, as a long-term investment; it is applying biotechnology to create new crop strains with better yields, controlled ripening and resistance to disease and pests. Even in the petrochemical industry, the sector worst hit by the recession, companies are maintaining their R&amp;D effort. The Shell group, for example, increased its R&amp;D expenditure on chemicals from Pounds 168m in 1989 to Pounds 181.5m in 1990. Bulk petrochemicals are taking a declining share of the research effort, however, as Shell devotes more attention to higher added-value products ranging from lubricant additives to specialised plastics. To speed up the innovation process, Shell Chemicals set up a Business Development Centre near Manchester three years ago. Its role is to translate ideas coming out of Shell's long-term R&amp;D effort into new businesses as quickly as possible. Three new Shell enterprises have already emerged from the centre: Surdyne oilfield chemicals, Rampart Packaging (which prolongs the shelf-life of food by sealing it inside an impervious plastic membrane) and Crystal Polymers (PET resin chips for making plastic bottles). The company says the centre enables it to get more out of its research and development effort during the recession. Smaller chemical companies also emphasise their determination to protect R&amp;D spending during the recession. 'We're cutting costs where we can in the administrative side but not in R&amp;D,' says Steve Cuthbert, chief executive of Brent Chemicals. The UK chemicals industry is in a stronger financial position to protect R&amp;D today than it was in the 1980-81 recession. 'Companies then faced the absolute imperative of cutting back on all their costs for the sake of short-term survival, even though this involved long-term damage,' says David Culpin, business development director of the Chemical Industries Association. 'That is not the case today.' Brent, with turnover of Pounds 90m a year, spends Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m on R&amp;D. The company is too small to undertake basic research and it does not invent new molecules. It innovates by formulating new combinations of existing chemicals for specialised applications in metal finishing, aerospace, electronics, packaging and the graphic arts. 'It has taken us a long time to build up our teams of formulating chemists and the last thing we want to do now is decimate them,' Cuthbert says. Formulating chemistry, as opposed to synthetic chemistry (making new molecules), is not taught in most university courses, and good, creative formulating chemists are almost unobtainable. Indeed good chemists of all sorts are now scarce in the UK, because chemistry was an unglamorous and unpopular subject among students during the 1980s and universities and polytechnics were unable to expand their output of graduates to match the rapid growth of chemical and pharmaceutical research. All chemical companies, large and small, are therefore determined to hold on to their researchers during the recession. 'It's getting harder and harder to find people of quality, particularly in organic chemistry,' says Peter Doyle. ICI's policy is not only to keep existing staff but to continue recruiting on a significant scale - unlike in the 1980-81 recession. UK chemical companies with international operations are expanding their R&amp;D efforts more quickly overseas than at home. The shortage of good scientists and engineers in the UK is only a minor reason for this. The main motive is to carry out development work as close as possible to the main customers. For example ICI set up its Japan Technical Centre in Tsukuba Science City because it wanted to hitch its fortunes firmly to the global expansion of Japanese end-user industries, especially automobiles and electronics. Only by doing R&amp;D in Japan can ICI effectively develop special chemicals and materials in collaboration with Toyota and Honda, Matsushita and Sony. Laporte too is building up its overseas R&amp;D activities. 'Our R&amp;D in timber treatment is now done almost entirely in the US, because that is where the experts are and where we get feedback from the most important customers,' says Hans Seidl, Laporte director responsible for R&amp;D. At the same time international chemical companies are trying to counteract the effects of recession by making sure that innovative products are introduced as quickly as possible in the world's main markets. That is an important reason for Laporte's Dollars 4m acquisition of Taiwan Spechem, announced this week. Spechem supplies chemicals for printed wiring boards to the fast-growing Taiwanese electronics industry. The acquisition will enable Laporte to manufacture its electronics chemicals in Taiwan and open up a market that had been largely inaccessible to it as an importer. The series will continue next week by examining the engineering sector.</p>

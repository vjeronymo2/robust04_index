			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Major's vision of an end to the Ulster troubles: An initiative by the PM for round-table talks WHEREAS others can only see fog, centuries-old problems and irreconcilable differences, Mr John Major had a grandiose vision yesterday on his tour of Northern Ireland. 'I believe the way ahead is clearer than many people may imagine,' he said. Everybody in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and in Britain wants peace, he said. Ipso facto, round-table talks on the province should resume as soon as possible. He may have been naive but the immediate effect of his speech was, on balance, positive. Talks will probably start after next month's local elections in the province - only the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party appeared unhappy with that prospect last night. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, may meet Unionist and nationalist leaders beforehand in order to pre-empt disputes over procedural points. But the government's only fresh contribution to breaking the political deadlock that has gripped the province since the 'troubles' started nearly 25 years ago was in one line at the end of Mr Major's speech: 'When they talk, we will put proposals before the participants. We must press ahead.' There were no official clues about what such government proposals might involve. But indications from Whitehall are that the package will be a synthesis of ideas already discussed by Unionist and nationalist parties during previous talks that ended in November, rather than a fresh approach. If Mr Major is to do more than act as a catalyst to talks that end, once more, in failure, the government's proposals will almost certainly have to bridge a divide that has stymied a trail of government initiatives over the past two decades. Any signs that Mr Major has found a magic formula that has proved elusive before are scant. As suspicious as ever of the UK government giving ground to the nationalists, Mr Paisley, yesterday castigated Mr Major for suggesting there was a political solution to terrorism. He wants tougher security and an end to the Irish Republic's constitutional claim on the north that gives 'oxygen' to the republican paramilitaries. More subtly, more moderate Ulster Unionist MPs were urging that Northern Ireland be treated like any other part of the UK - code for excluding the Irish Republic from any practical involvement. In contrast, Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, wants Northern Ireland's political machinery set firmly in an all-Ireland context. Such complexities could emerge in discussions on how talks resume. Unionists want low-key bilateral talks focused on restoring democracy to the province and attach priority to Dublin giving way on its constitutional claims. The SDLP will want assurances that there will not be interim agreement on any proposals until the whole agenda has been resolved - including Northern Ireland's position within the British Isles. Building on public revulsion at recent terrorist atrocities, Mr Major appeared to have won enough goodwill to ensure such obstacles to talks will be overcome. But it will only be a return to where the politicians were last November.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Leading Article: Bridging the final Gatt gap including the latest one, for Easter, set by the Gatt's director-general, Mr Arthur Dunkel - are equally meaningless. Not so. One deadline is crucial: the end of the American president's ability to use his Congressional 'fast-track' authority at the beginning of March 1993. With no provision for its renewal, that is when the more than five year old Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations will turn into a pumpkin. That deadline does not leave as much time as might be thought. Even after agreement on agriculture is finally reached, it will take at least two months to reach consensus on other outstanding issues. Some improvements will be required in the texts presented by Mr Dunkel last December. Chief among the outstanding issues will be market access, including services and public procurement, as well as the lowering of tariffs. For the world economy, these agreements will be of enormous importance, probably more important than agriculture. That does not make agriculture less pivotal. It is too important to too many countries for a global deal to be possible without it. But such a deal depends first on agreement between the US and the European Community. It has been tantalisingly close since the end of last year. Another chance is created by the regular meeting between Mr George Bush and Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, on April 22. With Mr Helmut Kohl pressing for a Gatt deal to be reached before the summit of the group of seven industrial countries in Munich this summer, with the re-election of Mr John Major and the elevation in France of the economically hard-headed Mr Pierre Beregovoy, Mr Delors has the opportunity to strike the deal. Distorting effect The obstacles should not be insuperable. Agreement is close, for example, on the idea that the EC's payments to farmers in compensation for the lower prices proposed by Mr Ray MacSharry, the farm commissioner, would not have to be reduced for six years, even though they are seen as having a distorting effect on trade and production. Similarly, the EC's demand for 'rebalancing' - raising the low tariffs on imports of cereal substitutes already bound within the Gatt - seems to have faded away. Difficulties remain, however, over the EC's idea of quantitative limits on imports from the US of certain cereal substitutes - corn gluten especially. Equally problematic is the EC demand for a commitment by the US that EC subsidies would not be challenged under US law. US opposition More fundamental is the adamant US opposition to the EC's desire to change parts of the text put forward by Mr Dunkel last December. It too would like to make changes, but rightly fears that once one bit of the text is challenged, the entire document could unravel. The most worrying feature of current discussion - apart, that is, from the continued failure to reach agreement - is the tendency to think in terms of quantitative limits, be it on subsidised exports or on cheap imports. Such limits may seem expedient, but they contradict fundamentally the thrust of liberalisation. It would be better to focus on reductions in assistance, letting quantities go where they will. Behind the inability to reach agreement seems to be a belief by the EC that the Dunkel text contradicts Mr MacSharry's proposed reductions in internal support. But once consequent reductions in output are taken into account, the MacSharry plan would probably meet the requirements of the text. At most, it would need only simple modifications. For over a year it has been true that once reform of the common agricultural policy can be broached, there is no reason in principle why a Gatt agreement should not be reached. Such an agreement is overwhelmingly in the economic and political interests of all parties, including the EC. Europe needs to solve the farm policy problem. Mr Delors knows that well. He should take the opportunity now before him to turn that knowledge into action, so meeting the final deadline of the Uruguay round.</p>

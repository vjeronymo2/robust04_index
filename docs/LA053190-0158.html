			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN FOR HOUSE-SIZE SURVEYS REJECTED  </P> <P> The Manhattan Beach City Council, still searching for a means to curb so-called  monster houses, decided Tuesday not to survey residents and property owners  about limiting square footage because the process would be too complicated and  time-consuming.  </P> <P> Instead, in a 3-2 informal vote, the council tentatively limited the floor area  of a house to 70% of the lot size on most single-family property, excluding the  beach area.  </P> <P> The current ratio is 90%.  </P> <P> In addition, 400 square feet would be allowed for garages on lots of 4,800  square feet or less, and 600 square feet on larger lots.  </P> <P> The council has yet to discuss other proposed controls on the bulk of  buildings, including setbacks and yard requirements.  </P> <P> The council abandoned the survey idea after consultant Michael Dyett said a  credible survey would require personal interviews with 400 scientifically  selected people and could take two months to complete.  </P> <P> Council members, who have heard a variety of views on house sizes, said they,  not a survey, should decide the issue. "The buck stops here," Councilman Bob  Holmes said.  </P> <P> The council will hold another meeting on zoning code revision from 2 to 6 p.m.  June 16.  </P></p>

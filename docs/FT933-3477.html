			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Building costs set to rise: Contractors will pass on materials price increases, RICS says CONSTRUCTION costs could rise by nearly 4 per cent next year because contractors are no longer able to absorb the rising price of building materials, according to a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey published today. Contractors face growing pressure as increases in materials prices eat away profit margins, said the institution in its quarterly study of building costs. 'Over the next two years, the price of materials is expected to rise above the general rate of inflation,' said Mr Christopher Vickers, the institution's construction spokesman. 'As a result the bubble will burst and contractors, unable to absorb rising costs, will be forced to increase their bids for tender.' The study highlights an issue of growing concern for building contractors. Building materials prices fell steeply in the early 1990s, but have recently begun to rise again. Throughout the recession, intense competition in the construction industry has forced tender prices down, and contractors have had little or no hope of passing rises in materials prices on to customers. Subcontractors, meanwhile, have complained that larger contractors have been delaying payments to them. The institution's survey showed that tender prices have stabilised at early-1987 levels, ending three years of decline. The cost of building is 23 per cent lower than the peak levels recorded in 1989. The institution said tender prices were unchanged in the second quarter of this year, compared with the previous quarter, and expected them to hold steady until the first quarter of next year. Then, however, increasing material and wage costs would prompt a resurgence of tender price inflation. By the fourth quarter tender prices would be nearly 4 per cent higher than in the fourth quarter of this year. The institution said building material prices were expected to rise 5.3 per cent in the 12 months to the third quarter of 1994, followed by a further 5.5 per cent increase in the 12 months after that. In line with other industry forecasts, the institution said that construction output would continue to decline, but grow by 1 per cent in 1994, 'progressing gradually' in 1995. Although this is a modest rate of recovery, it would at least give contractors more hope of passing on materials increases to customers than they have at present.

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis reap bumper wheat subsidy Mark Nicholson in Riyadh SAUDI ARABIA'S wheat farmers will receive SR7.9bn (Dollars 2.1bn) in payment for the 1991 harvest, which reached a record 4m tonnes, under the kingdom's heavily subsidised agriculture programme. King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, issued the directive last week for the payments, which amount to farmers receiving up to Dollars 500 a tonne for their wheat, a massive subsidy over world prices of just over Dollars 100 a tonne. The subsidy programme was introduced during the early years of Saudi Arabia's oil boom in the 1970s, and was designed to ensure the kingdom's self-sufficiency. The programme was also intended to provide employment in rural areas to the north-west of Riyadh, where there was no direct economic spin-off from the growing earnings country's oil industry. However, this year's bumper harvest has swollen the kingdom's already large surplus of wheat. Saudi Arabia's grain stores, which have a capacity of 1.4m tonnes, are already full, after 1990's 3.6m tonnes' harvest. Domestic consumption is about 1m tonnes. The kingdom, which has taken sixth place in the world's wheat export league since its 152,000 farms responded to government incentives to cultivate wheat, is expected to sell much of its surplus on international markets at world prices. Diplomats say they also expect a large amount to be offered in aid to poorer Moslem countries, and suggest that some may be sent to the newly independent central Asian states of the former Soviet Union. The kingdom became self-sufficient in wheat in 1984, following the generous subsidy programme. However, the recent surpluses have led the government to encourage farmers to switch to the production of barley, by insisting that farmers gain licences to produce wheat. Saudi Arabia produces 400,000 tonnes of barley every year, but needs to import up to 5m tonnes to feed sheep and camel herds. Wheat production still remains more attractive, however, to most farmers, who cultivate the crop on huge pivot-irrigated circles in the desert. Some critics of the programme argue that this is leading to a dangerous depletion of Saudi Arabia's scarce water resources. Agriculture accounts for about 90 per cent of Saudi water consumption.</p>

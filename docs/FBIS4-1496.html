			<p>BFN     [Text] Mmabatho April 28 SAPA -- A white gunman who opened  fire on voters at a polling station at Taung in Bophuthatswana  was under police guard in hospital, SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] radio reported on Thursday [28 April]  night. Police spokesman Col Dave George said the suspect was  severely burnt when angry voters set his vehicle alight after  the shooting.    The incident was one of several rumoured developments in the  Western Transvaal which the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [AWB,  Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has earmarked as the base for the  Afrikaner "volkstaat" [homeland].    South African Police said they could not comment on the  incident because it occurred in an area under the control of the  Bophuthatswana police.    Information filtering from the region said right-wingers  were  involved in the incident.    There were also reports that AWB members and security forces  levelled their weapons at each other in the Rustenburg area on  Thursday, but police could not confirm any such incident.    Defence force Ratel armoured vehicles and black defence  force  troops lined the streets of Rustenburg on Thursday when an AWB  convoy of about 100 cars moved through the town for an AWB rally.    Whites in Rustenburg were seen to give the white  right-wingers thumbs-down signs.    Observers said the ranks of the AWB appear to be dwindling,  with 200 people attending Thursday's rally. Few attended a rally  addressed by AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche in Brits last  weekend.    Police on thursday continued their investigations into  bombings on the reef. Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe  earlier said some of the suspects arrested were AWB members.    A number of right-wingers' farms had been searched for  weapons and explosives in the past few days, according to  Western Transvaal police sources.</p>

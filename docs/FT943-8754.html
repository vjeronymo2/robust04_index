			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Hoechst boosted by 'ozone-eating' filter Shares in the German chemicals group Hoechst were invigorated yesterday by news that it had developed an 'ozone-eating' filter material with a wide range of industrial and domestic applications - and sales potential of up to DM500m (Pounds 207m) a year. Although the maximum local atmospheric concentration of the irritant ozone was well below recent alarm levels, the Frankfurt-based company's announcement alerted dealers, who marked the stock up DM8.50 to DM356. According to Mr Andreas Schleicher, manager of the Noxon project, Hoechst is negotiating with around 40 companies interested in applying its ability to convert air- or water-borne ozone into pure oxygen by 'eating' the extra oxygen atom in ozone. Potential partners included manufacturers of filters and air-conditioning appliances for commercial and domestic use and swimming pool and sewage equipment makers. Hoechst claimed its research had shown Noxon could destroy concentrations of up to 200 grammes a cubic metre - some 1.5m times Germany's recommended outdoor level of 120 microgrammes. The Hoechst material offered no health risks in itself and had many promising applications in protecting people from ozone's harmful effects, Mr Schleicher said. Ozone can cause headaches and irritate lungs, throat and eyes. Children and the elderly are often especially sensitive. Hoechst suggested hospitals, old people's homes and schools as likely buyers of Noxon filters and air-conditioners, along with car and aircraft manufacturers. The company was also working on developing ozone sensors for industrial applications where it was essential to be alerted to the presence of excess gas. These included ozone generation plants, and offices fitted with laser printers or large photocopiers. Under German law, workplace concentrations may not exceed 200 microgrammes per cubic metre. According to Mr Schleicher, cyclists were among potential beneficiaries from projects such as the combination of Noxon with other materials such as activated charcoal in smog masks. Heavy ozone contamination was the focus of Germany's latest environmental controversy when drivers in Hoechst's home state of Hesse were ordered not to exceed 80kmph during the recent heatwave. Fast driving was blamed for an unacceptably high concentration of atmospheric ozone in the state. World stock markets, Page 31</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Talks on paper's future to be held Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing which owns The Independent newspaper, will hold talks in the next few days with all those involved in the loss-making company's future. Mr Hay Davison, accompanied by Sir Kit McMahon, a fellow non-executive director, will meet the main parties in turn to try to gauge their intentions. Those involved include the founders' group, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, which controls 10 per cent of the company; the two continental European newspaper groups El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy which together own 37 per cent; and Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland, who bought a 24.99 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing on Friday. The two non-executive directors will also meet Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, which would have taken a 40 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing if a Pounds 55m bid for the company had succeeded. The consortium which groups MGN, El Pas, La Repubblica and the founders is now considering the possibility of an increased offer for the company although it is believed that no final decision has yet been taken. Meanwhile, it is believed that contacts have continued between Mr Hay Davison and Lord Hollick's MAI group which recently made an agreed takeover bid for Anglia Television. Mr Hay Davison believes that persuading a television company to become a minority shareholder would help protect the group's independence.</p>

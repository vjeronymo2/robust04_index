			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Lib Dems court case on Literal Democrat fails The Liberal Democrats failed yesterday to have the result of a European parliamentary election in June declared void and a new ballot ordered. The party believes it was deprived of victory in the Devon and Plymouth East constituency because Mr Richard Huggett, a rival candidate, described himself as a Literal Democrat on the ballot paper. Yesterday, the Election Court ruled that, under rules set by parliament, any description was optional. The judges suggested parliament might wish to reconsider the rules to prevent abuse. It is believed to be the first time in a British parliamentary election that there has been a legal challenge to a candidate's description.

The election petition was brought by Mr Sanders and a representative elector against the acting returning officer and Mr Chichester. Rejecting the petition, Mr Justice Dyson and Mr Justice Forbes ruled that, under the Representation of the People Act 1969, the minimum requirements for identifying a candidate were the full name and home address. Any description was optional. 'Contrary to what might be thought to be the popular view, parliament has focused on certain minimum criteria for identifying candidates which do not include references to political parties, it being assumed that voters will learn all they need to know about the candidates during the election campaigns,' they said. It was also clear that 'the rules do not prohibit candidates - whether out of spite or a wicked sense of fun - describing themselves in a confusing way or indulging in spoiling tactics'. Parliament, in debating the rules, had understood the possibility of abuse and accepted it with apparent equanimity. Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat president, said: 'A signal has been sent to anyone who wants to disrupt this country's democratic processes that they are perfectly at liberty to do so.' Mr Chichester described the Liberal Democrats' argument as arrogant. 'I believe that most of the people who voted Literal Democrat did so deliberately.'</p>

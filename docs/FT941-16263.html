			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort's EPIT trust raises Pounds 320m Kleinwort Benson's European Privatisation Investment Trust has raised about Pounds 320m from institutions during the pre-placement period, making it likely to be the second largest UK investment trust launch ever, and the largest trust in Kleinwort's stable. The public offer period, which starts today and closes on February 2, could take the fund up to a total of as much as Pounds 400m. Kleinwort originally announced that the fund aimed to raise Pounds 40m. The largest investment trust launch was the Mercury World Mining Trust last November, raising a total of Pounds 426m. The offer price for EPIT is 100p, with 50 per cent due immediately and the remainder six months later, to allow staggered investment of the funds. There will be one warrant attached to every five shares, and the minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. The trust will initially buy shares in companies privatised within the last five years, following the principle that most efficiency gains are realised within five years of privatisation. These will be sold, or money borrowed, to participate in new privatisation issues as they come up. Up to 20 per cent of the fund will be invested in former Warsaw pact countries, and up to 20 per cent in the UK. But the main emphasis will be on European Union member countries apart from the UK. France, Italy and Spain all have large privatisation programmes planned. Mercury Asset Management is launching a similar European privatisation trust, but with a larger UK content. Investment trusts provide a simple way for individuals to invest in privatisations outside the UK as they avoid the need for foreign bank accounts and currency exchange costs.</p>

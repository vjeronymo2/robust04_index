			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: False accounting found at Spring Ram - Shares fall by 43p after revelations in document for agreed offer for Stag SPRING RAM Corporation, the kitchen and bathroom furniture maker which became a favourite with City investors, yesterday fell from grace when the company announced exceptional charges of Pounds 5.6m to cover 'serious misrepresentation and false accounting' at a subsidiary. Concern about the company's internal financial controls led to a collapse in the shares, which fell 43p to 113p, wiping nearly Pounds 160m off the company's market value. The company said the former finance director of a subsidiary, Balterley Bathrooms, overstated stock figures to boost profits since 1989. The problem was discovered in February during a final audit and the director was asked to leave. Spring Ram made charges of Pounds 2.1m against last year's profits to cover the overstatement and thought the problem had been solved. It said it was advised by Arthur Andersen, its auditor, that the problem did not need to be disclosed. Mr Stuart Greenwood, group finance director, said the former director's motives were not fraudulent. 'We set very demanding targets and he seems to have been caught up in the success culture.' But the company discovered from the end of April management accounts that the overstatement had been more serious. Arthur Andersen were sent in again in June and are still investigating. Spring Ram revealed the charges yesterday as it announced an agreed takeover of Stag Furniture Holdings, a furniture maker, at 160p a share in cash with a loan note alternative. Shareholders representing 49.52 per cent of the equity have accepted. Stag shares rose 39p to close at 158p. Panmure Gordon, the company's stockbroker, was told of the charges when preparing the offer document and advised the matter should be released to the market as soon as possible. Spring Ram said yesterday it had not announced the overstatement earlier because its legal advisers told it to delay until the full scope of the problem was known. But the company was yesterday widely attacked by shareholders and analysts, who said such price sensitive information should have been made available much sooner. One analyst said the handling of the problem suggested 'naivity or a cock up'. He said: 'They seem to have spotted the problem all right. But you simply do not release such matters tucked away in a bloody offer document.' Mr Greenwood replied: 'With hindsight, it may look like we were plodding. But we identified the problem and thought we had dealt with it. This is an isolated incident and should not undermine people's confidence in our ability to run the business.' Profit forecasts for Spring Ram are hardly changed, at about Pounds 42m. The maximum exceptional charge of Pounds 3.5m for the present year will be cancelled out by an exceptional credit of Pounds 5.8m from the sale of four non-trading subsidiaries last month. But several analysts said Spring Ram's premium rating was lost. See Lex</p>

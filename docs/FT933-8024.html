			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Interim managers can speed up recovery Sir, Lucy Kellaway's excellent article, 'Troubleshooters for hire' (August 9), postulates a future of more self-employed, project-focused, knowledge-based interim managers, with companies employing fewer very senior executives to hire and co-ordinate the short-term specialists. The effect of the recession on both sides of the Atlantic is surely speeding up this process. More companies, stripped of massive structures and now lean and fit, are reorganising tasks into part-time or ad hoc projects and are turning to networks of independent specialists or leased executives for help. In some cases those specialists are former employees now operating independ-ently and available for hire. There are a lot of motivated quality people in the marketplace ready to tackle short-term projects, fill temporary gaps or take on part-time posts. I speak from experience, having been a professional interim manager for five years with a continuing flow of projects. Smaller and medium-sized companies could probably benefit from this resource to speed up recovery. But it is also up to independents to market themselves and seize such opportunities.

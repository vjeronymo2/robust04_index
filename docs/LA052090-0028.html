			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIRGIN ATLANTIC'S PLAN TO PLANT TREES IS SINCERE  </P> <P> I would like to respond to S. J. Diamond's May 4 column, "Seeing Through the  Forest of Environment-Themed Ads."  </P> <P> The labeling of Virgin Atlantic's tree planting endeavors as a "trust us"  campaign I find to be particularly troubling and inaccurate.  </P> <P> Our interest in improving the environment is genuine, continuous and filled  with real hope, not hype.  </P> <P> As founder and owner of Virgin Atlantic Airlines, Richard Branson has been  involved with numerous charitable and environmental commitments in England.  </P> <P> The tree planting campaign that coincides with the Los Angeles-to-London route  is a natural extension of his environmental concern that includes nonsmoking  flights, biodegradable bags and a recycling program.  </P> <P> Virgin Atlantic's commitment to TreePeople and their commitment to plant trees  is clear, and specific arrangements will be made once TreePeople determines  what would best serve their cause. Virgin Atlantic will be there with full  financial support and genuine interest.  </P> <P> As with any new venture or endeavor, projections of customer response cannot be  predicted with complete accuracy. For this reason, we are unable to provide a  precise figure as to the amount of funds this program will generate. Be  assured, however, that Virgin Atlantic has entered into this program solely as  a means of aiding the environment and improving the quality of life.  </P> <P> LORI LEVIN, Director, Corporate Communications, Virgin Atlantic Airlines  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: TRACING IRISH ROOTS AN UPHILL STRUGGLE  </P> <P> If you are like millions of Americans, you can trace your roots back to  Ireland, but even if you can't, on St. Patrick's Day you can become honorary  Irish for the day.  </P> <P> Irish roots in the New World go back to Colonial days, but since 4.7-million  Irish came to America between 1820 and 1920, this is the time period when you  probably will discover your Irish family arrived on these shores. Irish  research is not easy due to the destruction of the Record Tower in Dublin  Castle in the early 18th Century and the disastrous 1922 fire in the Public  Record Office, which nearly obliterated civil records. Successful research for  Irish ancestors, therefore, depends in large part on access to parish records.  </P> <P> While the LDS (Mormon) Family History Library in Salt Lake City has many Irish  records on microfilm -- and you should start your search there -- it does not  have all the records. This library has a sizeable collection of Irish church  records, but the majority are not yet microfilmed and can only be searched at  the parish house or by an agent in Ireland. The most critical piece of  information you need to continue your research in Irish records is a precise  address -- and the more common the surname you are researching, the more  critical this advice is.  </P> <P> "Records that provide both names and definite addresses are therefore very  valuable ways of linking people with places," says James G. Ryan, author of  "Irish Records: Sources for Family &amp; Local History." The two major records  used for this purpose are "Griffith's Valuation Survey" in the mid-1800s and  the "Tithe Applotment Survey" in the early 1800s. Both of these are indexed in  the "Surname Index" compiled by the National Library of Ireland, which  indicated how many house/landholders with a particular family name were  recorded in "Griffith's Valuation Survey," and also where (but not how many)  landholders of that name are in the "Tithe Applotment Survey."  </P> <P> "By examining the original records indicated in the index, the full names of  those listed and the town in which they lived can be established," he says.  Ireland's civil register of births, deaths and marriages, which starts in 1864,  is a good source for genealogists seeking information about their families who  came to America in the 19th Century. If you know when the parents of your  immigrant died, their death certificates may give the family's home address.  Marriage certificates will reveal the addresses of both partners, and birth  records also indicate the parents' address. In Ryan's new book, ($38.95 ppd.  from Ancestry, Inc., 350 South 400 East, Salt Lake City, Utah 84110), each  chapter (arranged alphabetically by county) has a brief history with  genealogically significant dates and events. The author discusses what records  survive, where they are located, and in the case of the church records, the  address and name of the current clergyman -- everything a researcher needs to  locate specific types of records. Maps accompany each county.  </P> <P> Another valuable source, seldom utilized by researchers, is Irish newspapers.  Ryan has included data on them, plus information about commercial and social  directories, censuses, wills and administrations, and gravestone inscriptions  in this outstanding new book, which will enable many researchers to find their  Irish ancestors.  </P></p>

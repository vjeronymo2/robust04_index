			<p>BFN     [Text] On Saturday the Office of Chechen President Djokhar  Dudayev supplied Interfax with a statement on relations between  the Russian Federation and the Chechen republic. Groznyy sees  consultations with the Chechen opposition, underway in Moscow,  as a sign that Moscow has no intention of settling problems in  bilateral relations by civilized and peaceful means.    The statement says Moscow's dialog with what is known as  Chechnya's Provisional Council proves that Moscow "is trying to  destabilize the situation in the Caucasus and the Chechen  republic with a view to occupy Chechnya".    As a result, it is practically impossible for Groznyy to  hold  negotiations with Moscow.    The Chechen leaders repeat that a solution to the problem of  bilateral relations can be found only by Presidents Dudayev and  Yeltsin, in a face-to-face rendezvous.    Only a meeting between the two presidents can return to the  norm relations between the Chechen republic and the Russian  Federation, says Groznyy. All contacts with the so-called  public and political forces, as represented by the Provisional  Council, "will yield no result other than aggravation of  bilateral relations".    Dudayev's Office rejected reports on plans to send an  official delegation to Moscow.</p>

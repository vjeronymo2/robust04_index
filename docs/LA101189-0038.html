			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: THOSE DENIED AMNESTY ARE URGED TO APPEAL  </P> <P> Concerned that only a tiny fraction of eligible immigrants have appealed  government denials of their amnesty applications, representatives of the Los  Angeles County Federation of Labor's immigration project Tuesday urged  applicants not to give up too easily and offered to help file their appeals.  </P> <P> "We believe many eligible applicants fail to appeal their denials because of  lack of affordable legal services and lack of information about the appeal  process," said Teresa Sanchez, director of the federation's Labor Immigrant  Assistance Project.  </P> <P> Immigration and Naturalization Service statistics show that appeals have been  filed by only about 8% of the more than 37,000 applicants denied amnesty so far  under the first stage of the government's massive amnesty program, Sanchez  said. She blamed the low appeal rate on the INS, saying that the agency "has  done little or no publicity" to alert applicants of their opportunity to  appeal.  </P> <P> About 800,000 of the 1.1 million applications for temporary residency in the  Los Angeles INS district have been approved. Those rejected now face the  prospect of reverting to illegal alien status.  </P></p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries After Eagle Star's performance in recent years, another Pounds 450m from its parent could look like more money going up in smoke. But BAT Industries' decision to prop up its insurance subsidiary has offensive as well as defensive motivation. From one viewpoint, the very need to provide such a sum reveals the stark extent to which Eagle Star's financial strength has been eroded by lingering recession and the continuing mortgage indemnity crisis. In this regard, Eagle Star is not alone; capital-raising exercises in recent weeks by the likes of General Accident and Royal Insurance have been applied to similar ends. Yet, in boosting the solvency ratio of its general business to more than 50 per cent, Eagle Star is also positioning itself to compete aggressively for new business. The marked upswing in the property and motor insurance sectors since the spring provides the opportunity. Happily for Eagle Star, its parent company can afford the injection simply by diverting some of its ample cash flow from tobacco. The operation will add a mere 3 percentage points to BAT's gearing, taking it to around 58 per cent. Eagle Star's rivals are less lucky. They can only resort to the equity market for the scale of funds they may still need. Like the food retailers last year, the stronger players must be tempted to get in first and challenge their weaker competitors to follow if they dare.</p>

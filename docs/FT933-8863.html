			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Oftel invites BT to talks OFTEL, the telecoms regulator, has invited British Telecommunications and its competitors to a meeting in early October to discuss future arrangements for interconnection by competitors to the public telecommunications network. The day-long private seminar, an unusual departure for a regulator, is to give BT the chance to spell out its proposals for standard published interconnection tariffs and to give competitors an opportunity to respond before Oftel determines the future framework for interconnection. BT will attend, and about 30 other participants have been invited including all the main UK telecommunications operators. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said he wanted his decision on inter-connection 'to be firmly founded on the industry's experience and real needs'.</p>

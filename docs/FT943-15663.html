			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Causes of the war still fester: Resistance will feed off south's alienation For weeks Yemen's civil war had come increasingly to be a race between opposing military and diplomatic forces. Anxious to avoid any foreign intervention, the north had to secure a military victory as quickly as possible, while the south, aiming for international recognition, had to stave off military defeat as long as it could. With the fall of Aden, the northern generals seem to have won. However, even in the teeth of apparent defeat, southern political leaders insist they are not vanquished. 'People are resisting in many places and south Yemen is a vast area,' said Mr Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas, the southern prime minister, in an interview on Wednesday, a day before the fall of his capital. His words were echoed by Mr Mohsen Farid, the deputy premier, who said: 'Maybe the battle is over, but the war is not.' Indeed, the northern forces, essentially an army of occupation, may well find themselves increasingly the targets of a small and determined south Yemeni resistance. Now reported to be seeking asylum in neighbouring Oman, Ali Salem al-Beidh, the southern president, may be able to regroup his scattered leaders and organise a guerrilla movement which will give General Ali Abdullah Saleh, the northern leader, nightmares for years to come. The northern leadership, claiming its victory over the south, insists that its aims are unity, stability, and democracy. It will be a long, hard slog. Not least, it will have to overcome the country's chronic economic malaise, made worse by the two-month war. Inflation has spiralled to some 400 per cent over the past four years and promises to rise even more. War damage has added to the difficulties. The Aden refinery, bombed out of commission by northern warplanes, used to meet the country's domestic fuel requirement of 65,000 barrels a day. Now, while searching for the funds to repair that damage, the country will have to import petrol, using up scarce hard-currency reserves. Yemen's civil war, which began with the decimation of southern military units placed in the north, has been an acrimonious and bloody fight. Neither side has released casualty figures, but international aid workers put the total in the tens of thousands of dead and wounded. It will create lasting acrimony. 'Lots of blood has been shed. They need to put the past behind them as fast as possible,' says Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy to Yemen. Good but, perhaps, hasty advice. Since the unification of the north and the south in May 1990, southerners have increasingly felt left out of the country's economic and political mainstream, certain that the northern leadership has intentionally cut them adrift. It was such feelings of marginalisation which led to the southerners' desire to separate from the north again. Without resolution of the country's underlying political and economic problems - the very problems which brought on the war - Yemen is likely to remain disunited, unstable, and undemocratic for many more years to come. And Mr al-Beidh remains in the wings.</p>

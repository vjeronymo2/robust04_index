			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Tough fight beyond the glitz of a royal occasion - Forget the Queen's Speech, says Philip Stephens. John Major must now restore the government's reputation for competence Forget the Queen's Speech. Mr John Major's political fortunes over the next year will not depend on the agricultural tenancies bill or on his plans to abolish regional health authorities. Nor for that matter will they hang on the gap in the legislative programme left by the decision to scrap privatisation of the Post Office. The government, still languishing in the opinion polls, enmeshed in charges of 'sleaze' and unable to demonstrate grip or sense of purpose for more than brief periods, has a bigger task. As it enters the second half of this parliament it must restore the reputation for competence which has so sorely eluded it since sterling's ignominious exit from the European Monetary System two years ago. The strength and durability of the economic recovery, the prospects for pre-election tax cuts, tranquillity or otherwise in the classrooms, and the future of the welfare state are the sort of things that preoccupy the electorate. If peace in Northern Ireland turns from a fragile promise into a reality, Mr Major's achievement could yet change the political climate. We will hear no great debates on the Clapham omnibus about whether the bills which form the core of the legislative programme mark a victory for the cabinet's consolidators or for its radicals. Arguments about the government's lack of Thatcherite edge belong to the rarefied atmosphere of Westminster, not to the real world. Here we must enter a caveat. There is one piece of legislation that must be passed. And the capacity of the Conservative party to shoot itself in the head can never be discounted. The bill to implement the increased funding of the European Union agreed at the 1992 Edinburgh summit is threatening another convulsion on the Tory backbenches. Mr Major had no choice other than to make it an issue of confidence in his government. After the agonies over the Maastricht Treaty the cabinet is agreed that appeasement will never satisfy the anti-Europeans. It is always possible, just possible, that there are enough nihilists among the irreconcilables to bring down the government. But the odds overwhelmingly are that the bill will be passed. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, wants the key second reading debate to be held the day before his November 29 Budget. The more rational Eurosceptics on the backbenches see little point in handing to Mr Tony Blair Britain's negotiating mandate at the far more important 1996 intergovernmental conference. Outspoken critics of Brussels among the younger generation - Mr Bernard Jenkin is a good example - have anyway been unwilling in the past to match dark words with action. The rest of the programme is not without substance. Gas deregulation will complete the unfinished business of the 1980s privatisation programme. Equalisation of the pensions age at 65 and tighter regulation of pension funds is relatively uncontroversial. The Jobseeker's Allowance may mark the beginning of a new, cross-party consensus on the structure of benefits. No one will quarrel with the creation of an environmental protection agency or with the principle, at least, behind the government's belated promise to do something to end discrimination against the disabled. Mr Major's mistake has been not to make a virtue out of a more commonsense approach to legislation. Like many in his administration he is a prisoner of the idea that good government defines itself through permanent legislative revolution. The then Mrs Margaret Thatcher thought the same when she introduced the ill-fated poll tax. On the centre-left of the party Mr Clarke shares the Maoist instincts more commonly associated with the Tory right. The prime minister has been mesmerised by the anger of the right over the Post Office. So his aides spent much of yesterday assuring journalists that his administration had not run out of steam. As Mr Blair remarked during a competent - if less than spectacular - debut as party leader in a set piece Commons debate, the Conservative party is still undecided whether to praise or to bury the memory of Mr Major's predecessor. As he enters the second half of the parliament Mr Major must make that choice. All precedents suggest it will be impossible for the government to recover its position before an election due at latest in mid-1997. It may be that the right of the Tory party has simply become ungovernable. The rebels may fall into line over Europe this time only to pick a bigger fight in 1996. But no one, least of all Mr Blair, is sure that the game is lost for Mr Major. The mood of the country over the next 12 months should provide the answer. Yesterday's batch of statistics confirmed that the economy is on the government's side. Mr Clarke will not unveil tax cuts in the Budget, but the profile of public borrowing should leave them within reach this side of a 1997 election. If all this translates into a significant improvement in the polls the government has a chance. If it does not then the Conservative party will be unable to escape the fate of its leader.</p>

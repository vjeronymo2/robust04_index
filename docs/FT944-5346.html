			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 In Mosaic - published in New York by Farrar Strauss at Dollars 25 but surely meriting distribution here - Lincoln Kirstein has embarked upon his memoirs. Here is the first quarter-century of his life, from 1907 until 1933, when he brought George Balanchine to America and embarked upon the greatest enterprise of a life full of great enterprises. In Kirstein, intellect and action have marvellously combined, and this first volume is a story of a precociously brilliant youth who matures into an extraordinary man of thought and deed. The style is powerful: descriptions - of Gurdjieff; of Harvard and Boston society; of teachers and friends - are grandly evocative. It is a tremendous book about a tremendous life. It is also a reminder of the values in telling the story of a life, in a year when my other two nominations are in the 'Biography from Hell' category: Peter Watson's Nureyev (Hodder, Pounds 20) and Christopher Ogden's study of Pamela Harriman, The Life of the Party (Little, Brown, Pounds 10.99). Books to fling across the room.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: Matador - Queen's Theatre The mortal combat of man and bull has a seedy sexiness that draws bellows of indignation from animal liberationists, a straggling, overwhelmingly female, row of whom lined the pavement outside the Queen's Theatre. This detail is not lost on Peter Jukes, the young English writer brought in to furnish a book for Michael Leander and Edward Seago's musical of the corrida. Jukes lingers conscientiously on the objections of the two principal women in the bullfighter's life: his homely Andalucian sister (Caroline O'Connor) and his glamorous American lover (the top-billed Stephanie Powers) who together carry the doubts of the moral majority. But the sexiness remains - a rank, male quality inextricably linked to the will to make something of hum-drum lives. Domingo, who is based on the legendary bull-fighter El Cordobes, is a boy from nowhere on a hiding to nothing until he catches the opportunistic eye of a fixer called El Panama, at which point he becomes The boy from Nowhere. The storyline - of a fighter's pride and fall - is entirely predictable, and played out in flashback. As two of the characters are permitted to remark, people love a rags to riches story but they love a tragedy even more. Though the Spanish Civil War hovers in memories, and Franco himself makes a brief appearance, it is a politically and thematically unsophisticated piece, distinguished by a really rather sophisticated attempt to stylise its subject through an equation of bullfighting with flamenco. The bull is a stunningly animated conglomerate of six dancers, black and glittering, whose menace comes not from any thunderous momentum but from an evocation of the moments before the charge, when time is suspended between stamping hooves and lowered horns. Fransisco Perez Arevalo brings the ineffable style of the real flamenco dancer to bear on the head of the beast, somewhat overshadowing its nether regions and underlining the old saw that true flamenco dancers are born and not made. Elsewhere, the rhythmic intensity and formal elegance of the dance is cleverly gestured at in Elijah Moshinsky's refreshingly people-centred production, which is designed with an exquisite restraint by William Dudley. It has its share of long, lean limbs - two of the longest and leanest of which belong to John Barrowman's Domingo. Although he looks every inch the part, Barrowman succumbs to the synthetic song-and-dance texture that emerges from the fragmentation of the scenes and from lyrics (Seago) which tend to hamstring Leander's score with a banal sentimentality. Nicky Henson's tubby impresario El Panama gets - and makes - the best of them with with the roguish 'I'll take you out to dinner,' while the key numbers, 'No Way out of this Town' and 'Children of the Sun', accumulate a certain anthemic impetus through repetition. As if to underline that that this is a man's world the women do rather badly out of it. Domingo's childhood sweetheart (Jackie Dunn) is peremptorily matched and dispatched, while Stephanie Powers seems under-employed as the American movie actress.</p>

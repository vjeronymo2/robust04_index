			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Control of Seleco sold ITALY'S privatisation programme moved a small step forward yesterday with the transfer of formal control of Seleco, one of the country's best-known consumer electronics companies, to a group of private investors headed by Mr Gian Mario Rossignolo and Mr Hans Werthen. Mr Rossignolo is chairman of Zanussi, the Italian white goods group owned by Electrolux of Sweden, while Mr Werthen is honorary chairman of the Swedish concern. Together, they control Sofin, a private company which has run Seleco since 1989. However, formal control of Seleco has remained with REL, a company set up in the early 1980s to save troubled consumer electronics groups following an industry crisis. Seleco, formerly part of the Zanussi group, came under the control of REL in 1983.</p>

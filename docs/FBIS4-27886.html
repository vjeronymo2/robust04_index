			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Senior Foreign Ministry  officials held an emergency meeting Thursday [2 June] to discuss  Japan's response in the event of UN sanctions against North  Korea for its renewed refusal to allow nuclear inspections.    Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito returned early from a  European tour to attend the meeting, which set the line for  trilateral consultations with the United States and South Korea  expected to be held Friday in Washington.    The U.S. has warned it will seek economic sanctions against  North Korea if the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is  prevented from examining discharged nuclear fuel rods at the  5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon to determine whether spent fuel  has been diverted to manufacture nuclear weapons.    North Korea over the past two weeks has been removing spent  fuel rods from the reactor and is expected to have fully  reloaded the reactor within one or two days.    The IAEA has warned that its capacity to carry out tests  will  be lost "in days" unless Pyongyang halts the unmonitored fuel  exchange and places the discharged rods under international  supervision.    The Washington consultations aim at formulating joint  punitive measures against North Korea in case China, the  communist nation's longtime ally, vetoes a UN Security Council  resolution threatening economic sanctions.    Washington is expected to reiterate its demand that Tokyo  halt yen remittances to North Korea from pro-Pyongyang  organizations and residents in Japan, which are believed to be a  major source of foreign currency for the isolationist,  economically weak country.    The talks will also "prepare for the worst scenario," a  ministry source said, alluding to a possible military  confrontation over the nuclear issue.    North Korea has repeatedly prevented IAEA inspectors from  carrying out full inspections of its nuclear plants, fueling  suspicions that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons.    Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata expressed  grave concern over North Korea's refusal to comply with the UN  and its nuclear watchdog's inspection demands.    "If (North Korea) does not talk without reserve, it will  lead  to an undesirable direction," Hata told reporters at his  official residence. "North Korea should take a serious view of  the concern of the international community."    A government spokesman later said Japan's position is to  seek  a peaceful resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue.    "We still hope this issue will be resolved in a peaceful  manner through efforts by the parties concerned," Deputy Chief  Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara told a news conference.    Ishihara also noted the government is scrutinizing North  Korea's virtual refusal to accept Monday's Security Council  statement urging Pyongyang to comply with nuclear safeguard  requirements.    Despite the harshly worded rejection, Ishihara said, no  noticeable shift in North Korea's stance on the matter can be  seen.    A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official later said  three-way  talks among Japan, the U.S. and South Korea in Washington on  Friday will focus on measures to deal with potential action by  the UN Security Council.    The options are either the implementation of sanctions or a  warning if North Korea continues to reject international  inspections, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.    The official said the three countries will explore the  possibility of supporting a step-by-step approach to the North  Korean nuclear issue, an approach which would win China's  support.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Greybe] </F>   [Text] A meeting between ANC Freedom Front and government  negotiators to sign an accord on an Afrikaner volkstaat  [homeland] scheduled for last Thursday [31 March], was cancelled  at the last moment because ANC chief negotiator Thabo Mbeki was  ill.    One of the three facilitators involved in drawing up the  accord said yesterday that the meeting would take place this  week, possibly on Thursday. CP [Conservative Party] MP Tom  Langley was expected to represent the Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front] at the meeting.    ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said Mbeki has recovered from a  bout of influenza and was "up and about." After the negotiators  had signed the accord it would be studied by their leaders. A  public signing ceremony would be held later, the facilitator  said. The signing would necessitate revision of the Electoral  Act.    This breakthrough, after months of on-off talks between the  Volksfront, the ANC and government, would lead to Gen Constand  Viljoen's breakaway Freedom Front's taking part in the  elections. Viljoen said after he had registered his party for  the elections that it would take part only if there was an  accord on a volkstaat, because constitutional provisions were  too general.    The accord sets out the conditions and the process under  which a volkstaat could be established. It made provision for  voters' second ballots to be used to determine how much support  the volkstaat commanded and where it lay.    It is proposed that the Electoral Act be changed to allow  volkstaat votes to be recorded separately at certain polling  stations. In terms of the ANC's position, insisted upon by the  organisation's president Nelson Manadela and Mbeki, the accord  specified that there would be no racialism or discrimination  against non-supporters of a volkstaat living in such an area.</p>

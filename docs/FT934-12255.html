			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: European sector claws back losses in thin trading EUROPEAN bond markets clawed back some of Monday's losses but ended narrowly mixed in moderate turnover. Flows were thin as investors continued to digest last week's round of rate cuts, and with little fresh news expected this week, most markets are expected to continue consolidating. UK GILTS ended slightly firmer as participants prepared for today's auction of 6 per cent gilts due 1999, next year's new five-year benchmark. Despite its Pounds 3.5bn record size, the auction is expected to go smoothly, supported by firm demand from overseas and domestic investors. Expectations of near-term easing have caused short to medium-dated paper to outperform longer maturities in recent weeks and are expected to ensure strong demand for the new paper. Analysts are calling for a bid-to-cover ratio of around 1.5 to 2 times and a tail - the difference between the highest accepted yield and the average accepted yield - of around three basis points. Late in the day the bonds were quoted at 49 1/32 on a when-issued basis, yielding 6.21 per cent. GERMAN government bonds began the day on a firmer footing after overnight buying by Far-Eastern accounts, but early gains were eroded by profit-taking on disappointment over preliminary October inflation data and D-Mark weakness following last week's  1/2 -point cut in key German rates. The December bund contract opened at 100.04, rose as high as 100.24 and closed at 100.13, up 0.05 point on the day. While some see further downside at the long end, others expect it to remain well supported. 'I'm pulling in my bear claws,' said Mr Karl Haeling, head of International Futures and Options at Deutsche Bank, who expects the technical uptrend to continue. 'While we are in a consolidation phase, I feel there are bigger chances for a break to the upside than to the downside.' ALTHOUGH the French franc strengthened slightly against the D-Mark, French bonds edged lower on the day, pressured by the announcement of new 5.5 per cent 10-year bonds to be auctioned next week. The notional bond futures contract traded on Matif fell 0.14 point to 124.52. JAPANESE government bonds hit new six-year highs, with the December JGB bond futures contract rising 0.11 point from Friday to 113.98. The rally was spurred mainly by investors switching out of stocks into bonds after the Nikkei stock index fell by 286 points to 20,024 - perilously close to the psychological 20,000 level. THREE days of heavy selling at the long end of the US Treasury market ended yesterday when bond prices posted modest gains in the wake of a weak consumer confidence report. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/16 at 103 5/8 , yielding 5.983 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 3.891 per cent. Treasury prices opened firmer and held their ground in positive territory, thanks to news of a decline in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index. The index, which fell from 63.8 in September to 59.4 in October, indicated that consumers remain concerned about the weakness of the economy, and cheered bond investors, who had seen prices plummet and yields soar over the previous three days. Analysts said that most of the buying was limited to dealers, and that retail accounts were staying on the sidelines until the afternoon auction of a record Dollars 16.5bn in two-year notes. The auction turned out to be something of a disappointment, with demand weaker than expected. This temporarily unsettled bonds, pushing prices into negative territory, but they recovered their losses later in the day. CANADIAN government bonds slid sharply in the wake of Canada's national elections, but later recovered to trade only slightly lower in midday dealings. The strong performance by the separatist Bloc Quebecois sent initial shudders through Canada's currency and bond markets, but prices stabilised on remarks by the party's leader Lucien Bouchard that he has no hidden agenda to disrupt parliament. According to Mr Brian Hilliard, senior economist with Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, 'the key thing is that the Liberal Party has an absolute majority'. He also said investors should take comfort from the likelihood that monetary policy will remain unchanged.</p>

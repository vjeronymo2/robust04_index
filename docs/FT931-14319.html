			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Strong final quarter lifts Primerica to Dollars 593m PRIMERICA, the diversified US financial services group, yesterday announced a 16 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 153.3m, in spite of a decline in brokerage earnings. The strong final quarter took Primerica's full-year 1992 profits to Dollars 593m, a 24 per cent improvement on the Dollars 478.8m earned in 1991. A net gain of Dollars 68m from the sale of securities holdings and other assets, combined with lower debt costs and solid increases in profits at Primerica's consumer finance and insurance services divisions, helped to offset the drop in net income at the group's Smith Barney stockbroking unit. Smith Barney reported a profit of Dollars 38.2m in the final quarter, down from Dollars 49.8m a year earlier. The decline in earnings was attributed to lower trading revenues, the result of market conditions that were less favourable than in the fourth quarter of 1991, which was a particularly strong period for US equity markets. Although profits tailed off in the final quarter, Smith Barney still produced record earnings of Dollars 170.1m for the full year, well up on the previous high of Dollars 152.4m reported in 1991. Large increases in broking, investment banking and asset management revenues were behind the record performance. Elsewhere in the Primerica group, earnings were higher than a year ago. Consumer finance services recorded net income of Dollars 51.3m in the fourth quarter, up 13 per cent on the same period a year earlier and once again the result of cost containment measures and lower loan loss provisions. Full-year earnings at consumer finance services reached Dollars 193.5m, up from Dollars 175m in 1991. Profits from insurance services in the fourth quarter rose 19 per cent to Dollars 46.8m, taking the division's annual profits to Dollars 187.3m, compared with Dollars 174.8m in 1991. Sales of new life insurance remained flat, but mutual fund sales soared in the final three months of the year, boosting total sales for the year to Dollars 1.1bn, up 36 per cent on 1991. Corporate expenses dropped sharply in the quarter, falling from Dollars 16.8m a year ago to Dollars 6.7m, thanks primarily to low US interest rates, which reduced the cost of Primerica's debt. Overall, expenses in 1992 fell 51 per cent to Dollars 48.2m. Primerica also said yesterday it planned to take a charge of about Dollars 15m in the first quarter of this year to cover the costs of adopting new accounting procedures relating to post-retirement benefits.</p>

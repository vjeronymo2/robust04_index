Syria's Tishrin daily denounced "the refusal of US  congressmen who are close to the Zionist lobby, and who do not  really like the Syrian-US rapprochement, to remove Syria's name  from the list."    Such behavior was "proof of hostile and aggressive  intentions  against Syria," which had taken the necessary steps to curb the  transit of drugs across its territory, the paper said, adding  that Syria was not a producer country.    Tishrin recalled that in April 1993 a law was adopted  requiring the death penalty for those convicted of growing,  producing and trafficking drugs.    A White House statement on Friday said that Syria had done  little to combat drug trafficking.    The State Department had initially wanted to exempt Syria  from the list to reward it for helping to press the Palestine  Liberation Organization back into peace talks, The New York  Times reported Friday.    But legislators denounced the State Department's  maneuvering,  given Syria's poor record in stopping the opium trade in the  al-Biqa Valley in Lebanon, an area largely controlled by Syria,  the Times said.    Mindful of the explosiveness of granting concessions to  Syria, Secretary of State Warren Christopher overruled  lower-ranking officials who had recommended the exemption.    Syria is due to resume bilateral peace talks with Israel  later this month.</p>

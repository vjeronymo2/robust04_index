			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NRC INVESTIGATING RADIOACTIVE SPILL IN VA HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigators checked the La Jolla VA Medical  Center and the homes of about a dozen laboratory workers Saturday but found no  evidence of dangerous radioactivity from a spill of radioactive materials in  one of the labs.  </P> <P> The accident, which occurred Thursday night or early Friday morning in a  sixth-floor research laboratory, "poses no threat to anyone who visited the  hospital, patients there or workers in other areas of the facility," said NRC  spokesman Greg Cook.  </P> <P> "The only people we have concerns about are those who were working in the  immediate area of the spill, and that concern exists because we do not have  enough information as yet to say definitively that they have not been  affected."  </P> <P> Cook said that the NRC team arrived about midnight Friday and has surveyed the  laboratory where the spill occurred, but has not had a chance to interview  workers in the area to determine just what happened and when.  </P> <P> A check of public areas in the Veterans Administration hospital turned up no  traces of the radioactive material, Phosphorus 32, which is usually used to  trace the path of other materials in research projects.  </P> <P> Cook said that the San Diego Poison Control Center "was inundated with calls  from concerned people" after the accident became public Saturday morning.  </P> <P> NRC investigators checked hallways and elevators and found only minute traces  of the radioactive material, Cook said.  </P> <P> "This was after the hospital's maintenance crew had done a cleanup of the  area," he explained, "and we were satisfied that there was no danger, that no  danger exists or had existed" in areas outside the sixth floor research  laboratories.  </P> <P> Checks of about 10 homes of researchers turned up only contamination on a pair  of shoes, he said. He termed the contamination "very low level" and said that  it was removed by simply washing off the shoes.  </P> <P> Hospital officials discovered the radioactive accident when they arrived for  work about 8:30 Friday morning and found that the entrance to the sixth floor  research lab where the spill occurred had been sealed with tape, signaling a  radioactive accident.  </P> <P> "It got spread around the hospital quite a bit," Cook said, "but we believe  that, based on the kind of material they were using, there is no safety  concern."  </P> <P> Gayle Gray, spokeswoman for the VA Hospital, said that the hospital was "back  to normal" Saturday following the cleanup. She said the material is not  considered dangerous enough to require wearing masks, gowns or shoe covers, and  said that harmful effects occur only from ingesting the material.  </P> <P> "It would be about the same level of radiation as if you flew from San Diego to  New York on an airliner at 40,000 feet," she said of the danger to hospital  personnel, patients or visitors Saturday.  </P> <P> Cook said that because of the extensive interviews and other investigations,  the NRC team may be at the La Jolla hospital "well into next week."  </P> <P> The federal regulatory agency could take a number of actions against the  hospital if it finds that there were improper procedures or lax safety  standards at the facility, Cook said  </P> <P> The most severe penalty would be revocation of the hospital's permit for use of  radioactive materials, Cook said. Other, less severe penalties include fines,  citations which require written answers and possible corrective action or  orders requiring changes in hospital procedures, he said.  </P> <P> "We will have to look at the hospital's procedures and see whether the actions  which were taken in this case were appropriate before considering any sort of  action," Cook said. "Until we have a handle on what actually occurred, we have  no way to assess whether the proper measures were taken."  </P></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Major and cabinet have gained 'substantial successes' in Europe Sir, I should like to remind some of your contributors about the substantial success which Mr Major and his cabinet are achieving with their leadership from the 'heart' of the European Community. Who, at Maastricht, fought for and won concessions to enshrine subsidiarity and to reserve a position as to whether Britain should join a single currency bloc? With the hindsight enjoyed by most of his critics, perhaps Mr Major should have foreseen that his position in the ERM was precarious. However, he did try to play the game with a 'straight bat' within the rules as they were understood to be at the time. It seems quite possible and even desirable that the 'greater German' bloc should emerge. I very much doubt if the French will relish the thought of their economic management being dictated by an 'independent' central bank and thus will most likely opt to wait until Britain, France and Italy have converged sufficiently with Germany to allow a joint politically controlled central bank by the participating countries. Again Mr Major's instinct for caution in rejoining the ERM follows logically. Some commentators like to portray this as a sop to the so-called Euro-sceptics. If this is so then truly we would all be Euro-sceptics, which we are not. His insistence that a return to the ERM will not be in the foreseeable future seems only common sense. The Conservative party is, of course, representative of the feelings in Britain as a whole. The Conservative government has achieved its Maastricht goals with the consent of parliament and I am sure that the Conservative party conference will give Mr Major a strong vote of confidence.

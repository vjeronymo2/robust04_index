Mr. Tshisekedi, whose words were reported today by the  weekly  L'INTRUS, made this statement at the end of a meeting with the  Belgian ambassador to Kinshasa, Jean Coene, who visited him  yesterday. "I will not be represented anywhere. I am and will  remain the prime minister," Mr. Tshisekedi said, adding that "if  the HCR members are manipulated by Mobutu, they will find us in  their way."    Following the agreements signed between the presidential  group and the radical opposition after four months of  negotiations, the HCR has merged with the PT to become the  HCR-PT. It is now the duty of the HCR-PT to appoint the new  prime minister charged with managing the transition. On this  point, Mr. Tshisekedi said he considers the negotiations "as an  amendment of the transitional constitution drawn up by the CNS  which does not call the gains of the CNS into question." The  HCR-PT is currently meeting in various commissions to contribute  to a "joint decision" on the transition by both the CNS and the  political conclave of the Presidential Group.</p>

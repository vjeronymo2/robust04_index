			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Raise a glass to Mr Clarke Mr Kenneth Clarke is a jolly chap, full of warm beer and words like 'judgment', 'common sense' and 'reasonable decisions' - the home secretary who personifies England. It is he who, following a waffly intervention by Mr Robert MacLennan, Liberal Democrat, replied: 'In response to the honourable gentleman, I ask him to go away, lie down in a dark room, keep taking the tablets and think carefully about whether the Liberal Democrats have an opinion one way or the other on the merits of any of the proposals that I have just announced.' That is the authentic voice of the cheerful thug at his most cheerful and his most thuggish. It earns him this season's second prize for the most successful speech announcing a government retreat from a previous position; the first is still firmly in the grasp of Mr Douglas Hurd, although whether he earned it defending Maastricht or failing to defend Bosnia is a fine point. The foreign secretary can make the most guilt-ridden slide down the back drainpipes of policy seem like an elegant drawing room pirouette. The home secretary simply puts his foot on the bar rail, his elbow on the counter, looks up at the house and asks: 'What're you having squire?' What the Commons is having is bar-room wisdom from a politician who was highly rated for having roughed up the nurses when he was health secretary and the teachers when he was at education, which is to say overrated. Our Mr Clarke's performance is perpetually diminished by hindsight. Do not mistake the import of this seemingly harsh judgment. Everything has a context. When you consider the home secretary's colleagues - men such as, say, the chancellor, or the first lord of the Treasury - our hero stands out as certainly their equal and, some venture, their better. True, he did not leave either of his two previous departments in a condition of smoothly oiled perfection. That accounts for his less than triple-A overall rating. But his quick wit, his bonhomie and his willingness to tackle powerful interest groups should take him far in this administration, in spite of what can now be seen as questionable results at health and education. None of this has much to do with the principal task of the Home Office, which is to protect us from criminals. We should not blame Mr Clarke for that. His preoccupation, like that of his fellow-ministers, is with the office politics of his chosen profession. Who will be promoted, where to, and when? These are the motivating questions. A healthy concern about such matters keeps ministers from trying to invent any new policies. That is to the good. Most policies, especially on crime, are neutral. Some, such as the elements of the government's own brand-new criminal justice bill that the home secretary reversed last week, may be positively harmful. Few do any good. The figures tell the tale. Between 1979 and 1991 the government increased the number of police officers by 12 per cent. This enhanced force succeeded in putting 8 per cent more people in prison. It was a wasted effort. For during the same period the number of recorded crimes rose by 112 per cent. This does not mean that the actual number of crimes more than doubled. Criminal statistics are the most misleading of all measures of anti-social behaviour. People have become increasingly willing to report break-ins, rapes and the like; the police are more assiduous at writing entries in the book. Yet even when this is taken into account we are left with the impression that during the 1980s there was a steady increase, of imprecise amount, in crime, particularly violent crime. Anecdotal evidence supports this view. It is also clear that nobody has a sure-fire answer to the problem. Professor David Pyle, senior lecturer in economics at the University of Leicester, has produced a paper* whose depressing conclusion is that there are few novel approaches to crime in which the benefits outweigh the costs. It is even more depressing that the production of such a thesis has been sponsored by Securicor Services, but that is the age in which we live. It is, however, clearly possible to sup with Securicor and go home with an independent mind. The best that the author can say of the privatisation of crime prevention is that the case is 'not proven'. The professor looks at neighbourhood watch schemes, electronic tagging and the privatisation of prisons. 'There may be dangers,' he says, 'in placing too much reliance on the private sector in this field.' Policing, which is a 'public good' should be financed through 'compulsory public subscription'. Prof Pyle is no kinder to us soppy old liberals. For he tells us that the remedies popular in the bar-room do apparently work. Various studies demonstrate that increases in the certainty and severity of punishment can be effective in reducing crime. This may be news to the Home Office, if not to its political head. As to which is better, 'certainty' or 'severity', the conventional wisdom is again challenged. The rise in police strength necessary to make it more likely that criminals will be caught is seen as less cost-effective than simply sending more offenders to prison, for longer periods. This will be disputed by those whose basic discipline is sociology rather than economics. Liberals will, however, enjoy his finding that 'recorded property crime is much more closely related to the level of economic activity in England and Wales than had previously been thought'. One remedy does stand out. Most crimes of violence are caused by drunkenness; the majority occur after pub closing time, especially at weekends. Prof Pyle postulates a market solution, namely raising the price of alcohol. This might be reinforced by encouraging the sale of low-alcohol beers and wines; his analogy is the differential tax that has brought about a switch to unleaded petrol. 'There seems to be no reason why such a policy would prove to be ineffective, even if, as seems likely, the demand for alcoholic drink is price inelastic,' he writes. Mr Clarke is the ideal minister to propound such a scheme. 'Common sense,' he would mutter. 'Stands to reason.' It could do both him, and our Saturday nights, a modicum of good. * An Economist Looks at Crime in Britain. European Policy Forum/Social Market Foundation, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA</p>

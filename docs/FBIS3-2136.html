Government sources insisted there had been no attempt to  hide  anything by not printing a fuller account and suggested instead  that the administration did not want to bombard legislators and  the community with "a barrage of papers".    But liberal legislators from the United Democrats of Hong  Kong and Meeting Point last night demanded the Government reveal  more than what was contained in the 36-page White Paper on the  talks.    They said the White Paper was insufficient for people to  make  a proper judgment of the handling of the negotiations, which had  led to an almost total breakdown in Sino-British relations with  serious ramifications for the territory in the run-up to 1997.    Confusion mounted last night after the Chinese side rejected  the British accounts of the talks.    Chief Chinese negotiator Jiang Enzhu briefed a group of Hong  Kong members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) with a  different version of events.    There already had been a warning from Beijing that the  British move might affect co-operation in other areas, including  the crucial talks needed to get the new airport fully under way.    The Chinese side rejected the British suggestion that  Beijing  had changed its stance on issues such as the abolition of  appointed seats to the district boards and municipal councils  elections.    While announcing the publication of the White Paper  yesterday  and the gazetting today of the remaining parts of his  controversial electoral package on the 1995 Legislative Council  elections, the Governor, Chris Patten, stressed that the White  Paper was "a thorough, factual account".    Noting that China had already disclosed some details of the  talks in the People's Daily on January 7, Mr Patten said the  British side had decided to publish its version to fulfil a  promise to reveal details of the talks when pressing ahead with  the remaining legislation without the Chinese Government's  agreement.    Mr Patten said the White Paper set out the background to the  present position and the approach which Britain took in the  negotiations with China, as well as the modifications Britain  was prepared to make to his 1992 proposals as part of an overall  agreement including the through-train arrangement.    He said he regretted no agreement could be reached, but  commended legislators for approving the first-stage bill early  yesterday morning on the three simple issues.    The council approved the lowering of the voting age from 21  to 18, the adoption of the single-seat, single-vote system for  the three-tier elections and the abolition of appointed seats on  the district boards and municipal councils.    "I think it was an extremely important day for Hong Kong. I  think it was an extremely important mature moment in Hong Kong's  history," he said.    "Nobody can wipe it out. Nobody can pretend it didn't  happen. Nobody can turn back the clock on what happened," Mr  Patten said.    Defending the decision to publish only an abridged account,  government sources said if a blow-by-blow account of the talks  was included, the document would be as big as a phone book.    "It's not sensible and it's not helpful to bombard the  Legislative Council, the Parliament and the Hong Kong community  with a great barrage of papers. It is sensible to summarise it  in this way, there's nothing missing from here," said a  government source.    "It is a distillation, but everything that is important,  everything that happens in the talks that is important is there."</p>

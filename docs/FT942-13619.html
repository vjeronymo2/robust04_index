			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Motoring: Paths were made for walking Pedestrians outnumber motorists, a fact many drivers forget until they start walking themselves. Then the boot really is on the other foot. The AA's Foundation for Road Safety Research has come up with a report - the statistics are in kilometres - that should enable Britons to walk more safely and gives all drivers food for thought. One example: for every 100 million kilometres walked alongside traffic, 411 pedestrians will be killed or injured, compared with only 34 car drivers covering the same distance. Only motor cyclists (551 deaths per 100m kms) and pedal cyclists (526) are at greater risk. And it has to be said that quite a few motor cyclists kill or injure themselves by losing control and running off the road without other parties being involved. The AA Foundation report is based on a two-year study of walking patterns and accident records in Northampton, a typical UK town with a population of 180,000 and a mix of residential, commercial and industrial districts. The findings have been extrapolated to cover the whole of the UK. In Britain, road casualties continue to fall. The national total of 3,819 deaths in 1993 was 10 per cent less than the year before. Pedestrian casualties also fell - by 7 per cent. Even so, 1,250 were killed and 11,411 seriously injured in the British Isles last year, so there is plenty of room for improvement. (To those whose eyes glaze over at the mention of road safety, I would say this: just wait until you, or someone close to you, becomes a road casualty.) Tragically, child pedestrians between five and nine years of age head the casualty league table with 897 accidents per 100m kms, well over twice the average. From 10-15 years this falls to 855 per 100m kms. Over-65s (504 per 100m kms) are in third place. The safest pedestrians are 25-49 year olds. Road safety campaigns have concentrated on persuading drivers not to speed on residential roads. However, the AA Foundation discovered that heavily-used main roads, carrying traffic through Northampton, were six times as dangerous for pedestrians. And walking on post-1965 housing estates was found to be safer than on older ones because the footpaths were separated from traffic - which puts one of my hobby horses under starter's orders. I believe there has to be a greater separation of pedestrians and traffic and that pedestrian crossings should be raised far enough above the road surface to deter speeding. When the railways were built 150 years ago, their promoters were compelled to fence off every inch of the permanent way to protect straying livestock. The old understanding - backed by the law - that footpaths were for people, roads for vehicles has gone. Now, if drivers of cars, or for that matter, 38-ton lorries, find it convenient to mount the pavement to get round a tight corner or to park, that is what they do. If walkers are endangered or inconvenienced, that is just too bad. No one cares. My local council spends large amounts of money relaying the town's traditional brick pavements. Within weeks, they are damaged by vehicles driving over them. True, bollards and decorative railings have been put up here and there. But a simple solution seems not to have occurred to the council. Whenever a kerb is relaid, it should be made too high for vehicles to mount. Naturally, gaps and ramps would let pedestrians, prams and wheelchairs pass through easily - but the gaps would be too short for any vehicle. In the busiest, double yellow-lined shopping streets, kerbside railings would do two things; protect pedestrians by channelling them on to proper crossings - and make illegal parking pointless for anyone except an Olympic hurdler. At the same time, raised pedestrian crossings would cause serious damage to a car. That ought to deter the yobs who think it smart to roar up and down shopping streets at 50mph (80kph) and more. No, I have not turned into an anti-motoring correspondent. I enjoy driving, strive to improve my roadcraft and remain committed to the socially responsible use of cars. Life as one knows it would be impossible without them. I admit to feeling no guilt when driving on a free-flowing motorway at between 80 and 85mph (129-137kph) in good weather. I am convinced, though, that 30mph (50kph) is fast enough in built-up areas, and much too fast outside a school when children are coming or going. And when I walk in town I am afraid of enormous articulated lorries passing inches away, separated from me only by a kerb hardly high enough to stub one's toe on. The French authorities have no scruples about preventing pavement parking or speeding through small towns and villages. They are lining kerbs with concrete dragon's teeth and flower troughs. Ferociously humped pedestrian crossings are front suspension smashers for motorists who ignore urban speed limits. In Brittany, the 50kph (30mph) limit in one village I often drive through is enforced by a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights, though in this case the crossing is not elevated. Any approaching vehicle exceeding 50kph is detected by radar and the lights go red for a couple of minutes. It is a sensible move that really does make speeding counter-productive.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Italy set to call early election Italy's President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is expected this weekend to announce the dissolution of parliament and a date for early general elections. The most likely dates are March 20 or March 27; but some reports said President Scalfaro might let polling day slip into early April after requests from his Christian Democrat party which is upset by the early dissolution. The dissolution has been brought about by the discrediting of the main parties because of corruption scandals. On Thursday Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the 73-year-old former governor of the Bank of Italy, resigned. He said he had accomplished his expressed aim of introducing an austerity budget for 1994 and supervising electoral reform.</p>

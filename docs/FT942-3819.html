			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Company News This Week: Christian Salvesen - Other Companies The distribution company today reports full year results which are likely to show only a modest increase on the year-ago pre-tax level of Pounds 75.9m and earnings per share of 19.1p. Following the group's profits warning in January, the shares have underperformed the market by around 40 per cent - these results should mark a turning point.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Legal action considered over B&amp;C collapse ERNST &amp; YOUNG, administrators to British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, which collapsed in 1990, confirmed yesterday that it was con-sidering suing 'various parties' connected with the collapse of the financial services group . The Independent on Sunday yesterday reported that Ernst &amp; Young was planning to sue Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, for alleged negligence in advising B&amp;C on the take-over of Atlantic Computers in August 1988. B&amp;C was subsequently forced to write off Pounds 550m against its investment in the company, which it had purchased for Pounds 407m. Ernst &amp; Young said yesterday that as administrators they were 'investigating any rights of action they may have against various parties, but no decision has been made as yet as to whether to sue'. The administrators confirmed that they had held discussions with Stephenson Harwood, their solicitors, and with leading counsel about legal action, but that a decision was unlikely to be forthcoming in the 'very near future.' However, Ernst &amp; Young would have to issue a writ before the six-year expiry date on the bringing of civil actions under the statute of limitations runs out. Last week B&amp;C successfully sued another merchant bank, Samuel Montagu, which was ordered to pay damages of Pounds 172m to B&amp;C creditors. The dispute arose over B&amp;C's 1987 takeover of Mercantile House Holdings which relied on an agreement that Quadrex would then buy Mercantile's wholesale broking division. However, after the bid, Quadrex did not have the money to make the purchase, which led to B&amp;C making a damages claim for breach of contract. BZW said yesterday that the story was 'nothing more than speculation' and said that it knew nothing about it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, January 18 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA)  -- Paek Han-ki, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee  of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, in a  statement today bitterly denounced the anti-DPRK smear campaign  of the Japanese authorities and urged them to stop the hostile  acts at once.    The Japanese authorities recently launched a probe into a  trading firm of Japan "suspected of violating the regulations of  the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls  (Cocom)" and are conducting a despicable anti-DPRK campaign,  connecting the case with the innocent DPRK in a far-fetched way.    The vice-chairman branded this as an utterly groundless  fabrication to impair the dignity and prestige of the DPRK and  another shameless political intrigue, which shows the true  colour of the Japanese authorities who resort to hostile  propaganda, reversing black and white.    He said:    "At a time when the DPRK and the United States are moving  toward a package solution of the problems for a fundamental  settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula thanks  to the self-determined and aboveboard diplomatic policy of the  DPRK, the Japanese authorities have launched a new smear  campaign against the DPRK. This is an unpardonable challenge to  throw a wet blanket over the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks and  isolate and blockade the DPRK. This is also an anachronistic  act against the world public that wish the solution of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the improvement of the  DPRK-U.S. relations through dialogue and negotiation.    "With no pressure and plot can the international  reactionaries and the Japanese authorities undermine the  international prestige of the DPRK or block the advance of the  Korean people.    "The Japanese authorities must look straight at the trend of  the times and immediately stop the smear campaign and hostile  acts against the DPRK."</p>

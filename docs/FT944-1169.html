			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Berlusconi urges early election as coalition crumbles: Italian government on brink of collapse after four Northern League ministers quit Italy's eight-month rightwing coalition crumbled yesterday with the resignation of four ministers from the Northern League and a call by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, for early elections. Mr Berlusconi accepted the imminent fall of his government in a parliamentary speech, claiming the League defection from the coalition was 'a fraud perpetrated on the electorate' by Mr Umberto Bossi, its leader. The resignations coincided with the beginning of a turbulent parliamentary debate on three no-confidence motions tabled by the League and the main opposition parties. The debate is expected to end tomorrow, unless Mr Berlusconi decides to cut proceedings short and resign today before a vote is taken. This was seen as increasingly likely last night. In a bitter personal attack on Mr Bossi, the prime minister said that if the government lost its majority in parliament there was 'no option but to seek the opinion of the electorate'. The call for early elections was echoed by Mr Berlusconi's faithful allies in the coalition - the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini and the small Christian Democratic Centre. This contrasted sharply with the view of Mr Bossi as well as opposition leaders who insisted the present situation was too unstable to permit early elections. They said elections could not be held before changes in electoral rules, and clear guidelines were established for the control and use of the media. A similar view is also shared by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who has the constitutional authority to dissolve parliament or to ask for the formation of a new government. In recent days, former president Francesco Cossiga has emerged as a go-between and possible candidate to head an interim government to pilot Italy towards elections. The debate began late because of a demand from one deputy for the proceedings to be transmitted live on television, a request which was eventually accepted. Mr Berlusconi's half-hour speech consisted almost exclusively of an attack on Mr Bossi, whom he said was an unreliable partner from the outset of the coalition. The media magnate turned politician repeatedly invoked the legitimacy he derived from the vote accorded him and his Forza Italia movement 'by the people' in the March elections. Mr Bossi replied that Mr Berlusconi had lost his legitimacy because he had failed to govern and deliver on electoral promises while also pulling the coalition away from the centre towards the right. The League leader was confident yesterday that he had sufficient support within the League to ensure his no-confidence motion, backed by the opposition, would topple the government. The minimum votes necessary for this in the chamber of deputies is 316. It should be clear tomorrow whether Mr Berlusconi will accept a vote on the three no-confidence motions, or seek to outflank them with his own confidence motion which would have precedence. The four ministers who resigned yesterday were: Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the finance minister; Mr Francesco Speroni, institutional reform; Mr Vito Gnutti, industry; and Mr Domenico Commino, EU affairs.

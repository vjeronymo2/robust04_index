			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by R. Rashitov: "Defense Industry Problems at the </F> Center of Attention"]    [Text] Topical questions regarding joint measures for  stabilization of the situation at defense industry enterprises,  worked out by the Governments of the Russian Federation and  Republic of Tatarstan, were discussed during the consultations  held in Kazan by O.N. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the  Government of Russia, and Tatarstan Prime Minister M.G. Sabirov.    The participants in the consultations--directors of a number  of military-industrial complex large industrial  enterprises--discussed the problems of preservation and  improvement of the defense industry's scientific and  technological potential, and speeding up the production of  civilian goods at these enterprises that would be both  competitive and affordable for the population.    An agreement was reached to provide conversion credits, tax  preferences, placing long-term orders, and gradual transfer of  housing and social-cultural facilities into the ownership of,  and maintenance by, local bodies of executive authority. It was  pointed out to defense industry enterprise directors that they  have to boost their commercial activities aimed at selling the  products they produce, including exporting them.    O.N. Soskovets and M.G. Sabirov visited production shops and  sections of aviation and motor-building production associations,  where they were shown samples of output, and talked to workers  and technical-engineering personnel.</p>

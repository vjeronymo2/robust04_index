			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "ARF approach to security can ensure regional </F> peace"]    [Text] Asean has commendably recognized the need for  security cooperation, and the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) which  meets next month in Bangkok could give rise to a new security  framework in the region.    The 18-member multinational framework is arguably Asean's  most ambitious effort in its 27-year history to engage the major  powers in a security dialogue.    No region in the world has used its dividend from the  thawing  of the Cold War more wisely than East Asia. According to the  latest figures from the Economic and Social Commission in  Asia-Pacific (Escap) in Bangkok, the region has just had another  banner year. It grew more than six times faster than the global  economy did in 1993.    Regional stability is founded on the emergence regionwide of  a open market system; the recognition by all Asean countries of  the need for regional peace to ensure the continuation of  internal economic developments; and the capping of the Indochina  crisis -- in no small degree through the efforts of Asean.  <H5>  Economic gravity </H5>   For the moment, the United States' withdrawal from some  naval  and air bases in the region may have generated some anxiety in  Asean. But as Apec [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] makes it  clear, America's centre of economic gravity has shifted from the  Atlantic coast to the Pacific.    A testimony to the changing times is the constitution of the  ARF's membership which is drawn from both sides of the Cold War  divide -- the six Asean countries, the United States, Canada,  Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union,  Papua New Guinea, China, Russia, Vietnam and Laos.    Considering that some of these countries were at war with  each other not so long ago, their coming together in the ARF  shows their commitment to global peace and prosperity.    But serious differences remain because of the long history  of  conflicts and rivalries in the region.    For one, the South China Sea issue may soon come to a boil.  China is running out of oil resources close to home, at a time  when its own energy needs are growing exponentially. The  strategic sealanes passing through the Spratlys are so widely  used -- increasingly also by China -- that a conflict there  could be injurious to the entire Asia-Pacific community.    A viable way urgently needs to be found to allow Vietnam and  China to cool down the temperature in the Spratlys -- which can  then become congenial to confidence-building measures among all  claimant countries.    Also, the dispute between Malaysia and the Philippines over  Sabah is the most salient and serious intra-Asean territorial  dispute. This contentious issue has often created serious  tension and caused a deterioration in relations between Kuala  Lumpur and Manila which adversely affected Asean regional  cooperation.    To be effective, the ARF has to serve its members, keeping  in  mind that the primary purpose is preventive diplomacy -- to  preserve regional peace and prevent disputes from escalating  into armed conflicts. In all circumstances, one thing should be  remembered: the ARF is not a forum of the likeminded, therefore  a spirit of give and take will be crucial to building mutual  trust and confidence.    A current phenomenon in the region is the drive by several  Asean governments to build up and modernize their weapons  inventories. The simplest reason for this is that the end of the  Cold War has brought down prices for modern weaponry -- and some  East Asian countries are simply taking the opportunity to grab  some "fire-sale" bargains while they are available.    Asean needs to agree on whether an arms race is taking place  in its midst -- and if it is, then the member countries through  the ARF must consult on how to contain it.  <H5>  Arms register </H5>   Various proposals have been made by think-tanks. These  include the creation of a Southeast Asian arms register,  regional cooperation in arms purchases, exchange of intelligence  data, observers at military exercises, transparency about  military strength, more contacts between military officers and  even the creation of an Asean peacekeeping centre.    Recently some of the confidence-building measures were  implemented. Singapore was invited for the first time as an  observer at the just concluded U.S.-Thai Cobra Gold war games.  This invitation could eventually be extended to other ARF  members.    It, however, should be borne in mind that Asean countries  have varied approaches to security and it is necessary that,  through the ARF, they define the appropriate extent of  transparency expected regarding military strength in the region.    From dialogue, the ARF must move gradually to seek a  consensus about developing the mechanisms to maintain peace and  stability. Only then can the Asia-Pacific region be a safer  region, as the ARF promotes trust, eases tensions and heads off  confrontations.</p>

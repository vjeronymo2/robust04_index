The Nigerian  deputy foreign minister told the Nigerian press agency NAN that  he is confident on the issue of holding such a referendum,  since, he said, 90 percent of the population of this peninsula  is made up of Efik-speaking Nigerians. How do the Cameroon  authorities react to this proposal? We asked Augustin Kontchou,  information minister and spokesman for the Cameroon Government:    [Begin Kontchou recording] We are surprised by such a  declaration. It shows quite clearly that the Nigerians do not  consider the Bakassi Peninsula to be Nigerian territory.  Cameroon cannot of course accept that a referendum should be  held in order to determine that part of its territory should go  elsewhere. I would like, nevertheless, to thank the Nigerian  deputy foreign minister for showing the international community  with this declaration that the Bakassi Peninsula is indeed  Cameroonian territory.    I would, however, like to know what the Nigerians really  want. We have been negotiating with them in Togo. They have not  told us that they are abandoning this mediation, but they now  seem to be following another path: The Nigerian foreign  minister announced in Cairo that there would soon be a summit  between the Nigerian and Cameroonian heads of state, but we have  not been told anything about this. And now they announce a  referendum. We conclude that this is some sort of diplomatic  and media agitation in order to sow confusion. Cameroon cannot  take this agitation very seriously.

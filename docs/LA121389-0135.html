			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GUILTY OF MURDER IN BURGLARY RETALIATION  </P> <P> A Long Beach man was convicted Tuesday of murdering a Van Nuys man and trying  to kill the man's girlfriend in retaliation for a burglary.  </P> <P> A Van Nuys Superior Court jury deliberated one day before finding Dean Kennedy,  30, guilty of all charges against him. The charges, first-degree murder for  financial gain and attempted murder, carry a maximum sentence of life in prison  without possibility of parole.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Judith Meisels Ashmann scheduled sentencing for  Jan. 11.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow said Kennedy hired two men to kill  Thomas Wilson, 35, and Susan Yee, 32, both of Van Nuys, on Dec. 23, 1987.  Wilson was shot twice in the head and once in the stomach. Wilson died; Yee was  shot but recovered.  </P> <P> Kennedy, the owner of a window tinting business, was involved in illegal  activities with Wilson involving credit cards, Rabichow said. Wilson  burglarized Kennedy's home of a $35,000 check and some credit cards,  prosecutors said. An angered Kennedy hired John Young, 28, of Long Beach and  Kitiona Paepule, 22, of Paramount to kill Wilson and provided a gun and  silencer, Rabichow said.  </P> <P> Young, who pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to life in prison  without possibility of parole, testified against Kennedy. Paepule's trial is  pending.  </P></p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Post Office woos NHS THE Post Office will this week enter the National Health Service computer market as part of a new policy to sell its expertise in the public sector. Since April 1990 the Post Office's computer operations have functioned as a separate business, selling services to other Post Office divisions. Now computer services managers can offer services to other public-sector bodies and overseas post offices. Their first such service, a hospital information support system, is to to be launched today.

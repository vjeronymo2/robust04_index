			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's decision to meet with Chechen President Dzhokhar  Dudayev is based on his concern about the current situation in  the republic which poses an "increased threat" to its population  and residents of adjacent regions, including Daghestan and the  Astrakhan region, Yeltsin's administration chief of staff Sergey  Filatov said.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that  the date of the meeting has yet to be set.    Observers believe that Yeltsin had been putting off the  meeting with Dudayev, waiting for his old foe, former Russian  parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov to leave the Chechen  Republic where he stayed after his release from prison under  amnesty earlier this year. Now that Khasbulatov is in Moscow,  the last obstacle has been removed.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> . . . Will Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder do it again? We're told that there are  discussions at Tri-Star about a fourth Pryor-Wilder comedy teaming, titled  "Another You," and that Peter Bogdanovich is a possibility to direct. The  actors teamed for last year's "See No Evil, Hear No Evil," as well as "Stir  Crazy" (1980) and "Silver Streak" (1976).  </P> <P> . . . Ever wonder who would win a battle between the monster from "Alien" and  the title nasty from "Predator"? Look for the answer in "Predator II: Body  Count" (due at Christmas), which features the predator's trophy case -- filled  with the skulls of his human and inhuman victims, including one that's  unmistakably that of the Alien.  </P></p>

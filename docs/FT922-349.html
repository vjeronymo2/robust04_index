			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Call for standard post-16 training VOCATIONAL education and training for people aged 16 to 18 should be tailored to a uniform standard, the National Commission on Education urges today. The commission, a privately funded body, said that a unified system would improve the quality of the workforce. In a discussion paper, it calls for a common core curriculum of mathematics, science, technology, English and another European language, whether in full-time education, on Youth Training or in traineeships run by employers. Establishing a high-quality, broadly based education at all ages and levels is essential if the UK is to develop a flexible and committed workforce, the paper argues. The government, employers, unions and educational institutions should all be brought together, the paper says. But it warns that it will be vital to determine which of those 'stakeholders' would carry primary responsibility. Local enterprise companies, the organisations created by the government to improve Scotland's training and environment, are suffering because they have too little discretion and are struggling to adapt existing working practices of staff, according to a report. Academics from the London School of Economics argue that many of the difficulties arise from Treasury and Department of Employment funding constraints south of the border. The report questions whether staff seconded from the Civil Service 'possess the required expertise and competence' for the job. Towards a well qualified workforce.

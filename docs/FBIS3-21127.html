			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text][dateline: Fukui]    Kozo Iida, president of Japan Atomic Power Company, visited  Fukui Prefecture on 9 December and asked for prefectural  governor Yukio Kurita's cooperation on the construction of  Tsuruga NPPs No. 3 and 4. At a press conference after the  meeting, when Mr. Iida was asked about the decommissioning of  Tsuruga NPP No. 1, which is among the conditions for additional  construction proposed by the mayor of Tsuruga City, he said,  ``We will consider decommissioning the plant after the year  2000, when NPPs No. 3 and 4 are completed.''    Japan Atomic Power already has a group for investigating  reactor decommissioning in its Power Generation Division's Power  Generation Administration Department. The company began setting  aside funds for decommissioning in 1988.    However, the only example of decommissioning in Japan is the  Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (JPDR) at JAERI's Tokai  Research Institute (Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture), so Japan  has less experience than the U.S. or European nations. There are  questions to be answered such as whether another nuclear power  plant can be built on the same site, how to dispose of the large  amount of waste material, etc. In the future, the topic of  decommissioning is likely to become the focus of problems  concerning additional construction at Tsuruga.    When asked about plans to proceed with construction, Mr.  Iida  also said, ``We will ask for support in such areas as human  resources from various power companies such as Hokuriku Electric  Power Company that will be recipients of the power we  generate.'' However, on the same day Hokuriku Electric Power  Company vice president Masao Shimizu told reporters in Tokyo,  ``We do not know whether we will receive power from Tsuruga NPPs  No. 3 and 4 because we still do not have a clear understanding  of what the supply and demand situation for electric power will  be. Right now it is a blank slate.'' Clearly the two companies  are not in step.    Therefore, the role of Kansai Electric Power Company, which  has insufficient power resources and whose sites for new power  plants sit empty, holds the key Japan Atomic Power Company's  support.</p>

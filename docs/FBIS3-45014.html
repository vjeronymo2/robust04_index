Sun Jiazheng, deputy secretary  of the provincial party committee, presided over the session.    Chen Huanyou said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee is an important historic meeting, and the  "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a  Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted by the session is a  program of action which will guide us in pushing forward the  reform of the economic structure in the 1990's. We must  concentrate on implementing it from three aspects. [passage  omitted]    Firmly reaffirming the achievements made in this year's  work,  Chen Huanyou said: Since the beginning of this year, all  localities in our province have earnestly implemented the  guidelines in the important remarks made by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping during his tour of southern China in early 1992 and the  guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress, continued to  seize opportunities, deepen reforms, open wider to the outside  world, strengthen and improve our macroeconomic control,  accelerate structural adjustments, speed up scientific and  technological advances, and adhere to the principle of building  a material civilization and a spiritual civilization  simultaneously. As a result, the economy has been able to  maintain its momentum of rapid growth. New progress has been  made in building a spiritual civilization, in developing  democracy and improving the legal system, and in strengthening  the party organizationally. The general situation is good. The  economy has been developing in a sustained and rapid way. The  province's GNP this year is expected to increase by 18.5 percent  over that of last year. New advances have been made in reform,  and a new situation has developed in our export-oriented  economy. According to estimates, our foreign exchange earnings  made through exports this year are expected to rise 17.8  percent; the actual amount of utilized foreign capital has  increased 69.5 percent; and about 9,000 joint-venture,  foreign-funded, and cooperative enterprises have been approved.  New achievements have been made in the development of science,  technology, and education. New progress has been made in  building a spiritual civilization. Party building has been  strengthened.    Chen Huanyou analyzed and explained the distinguishing  features of this year's work as follows: First, we vigorously  and comprehensively implemented the state's macroeconomic  control measures, and took full advantage of the development  opportunities. Under the circumstances of a tightened  macroeconomic environment, we firmly and continuously fostered  the thinking that "Development is the last word," and sought to  develop as fast and efficiently as possible. Second, while  maintaining a higher growth rate, we strove to improve the  quality of economic operation. We notably strengthened our  sense of the economy of scale in development, of bringing about  coordinated development of various industries, and of relying on  science and technology for progress. We also paid more attention  to the substance of economic development and the quality of  economic growth. Third, we found opportunities in the  transition from the old to the new structure to further  intensify reform and promote self-sustained economic growth.  Fourth, we constantly upheld the policy of fostering both  material and cultural and ideological progress, and attaching  equal importance to both; we made overall plans and successfully  arranged work in all fields; we mobilized the initiative of all  cadres and the masses to create a favorable social environment  in which the general situation was stable and everyone tried to  make progress. Chen Huanyou pointed out that there are still  difficulties and problems regarding capital, market, and  commodity prices that should be taken seriously. He stressed  the need to earnestly overcome these difficulties and resolve  the problems in the course of conducting our work hereafter.    Chen Huanyou pointed out: The year 1994 will be crucial to  economic structural reform, and it will be a year of sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the economy. The general  requirements for next year's work are: Guided by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, we need to  comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th National  Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, further emancipate our minds, seek truth from  facts, and firmly seize the opportunity; we need to further  intensify reform and accelerate the pace of building a new  socialist market economic structure; we need to open wider to  the outside world and accelerate the process of  internationalizing Jiangsu's economy; further accelerate  structural adjustment, raise economic standards and returns, and  maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  economy; we need to strengthen the building of socialist  spiritual civilization and the work of combating corruption and  building a clean government; and we need to strengthen party  building and promote social progress in all fields. In light of  the general requirements and development goals, it is necessary  to concentrate on carrying out work in the following six areas:    Accelerate the pace of reform, centering on building  the basic framework of socialist market economic structure.

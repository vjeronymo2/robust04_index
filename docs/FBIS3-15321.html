			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We just received a report noting that, supported by  tanks and various types of armored cars, Azerbaijani troops  launched an offensive towards Fizuli in the southeastern sector  of Karabakh war front at 0515 this morning. They managed to  advance.    The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army press  service reported at noon that fierce battles were still  continuing in this sector of the front.    The NKR Defense Army command ordered its troops to take the  necessary measures to foil the enemy's attacks and recover their  former positions.    The NKR Foreign Ministry has stated that all responsibility  for the consequences of such actions fully rests with the  Azerbaijani side, which is methodically violating the cease-fire  agreement achieved through the mediatory efforts of the Russian  Defense Ministry.    The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reports that  relative calm now prevails on the republic's borders.</p>

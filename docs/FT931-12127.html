			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Key Recommendations An extra market of 19m tonnes a year for domestic deep-mined coal to be created from April, mainly by postponing liberalisation of the electricity market and enabling power companies to commit themselves to more long-term contracts. The extra output to be subsidised for five years to enable British Coal to sell it at world prices. Estimated first-year cost is Pounds 120m. Additional financial help for installation of clean coal technology. Subsidy to be paid for either by diverting part of nuclear levy to coal or by direct Treasury grant. There would be no increase in consumer electricity charges as a result. Options to generate further increase in market for domestic coal to be considered. These to include cutting open-cast output from 18m tonnes to 10m tonnes per year by imposing a moratorium on new licences; measures to make imported French electricity less competitive; requiring power stations burning orimulsion to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment, impairing the fuel's competitiveness; challenging rules in the electricity wholesale market which make gas-fired stations more likely to be fully used than coal plants. Creating a new licensing authority. Establishing an Energy Commission modelled on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. All proposed pit closures to be referred to modified colliery review procedure. In theory this would rule out any pit closure for nine months but in practice is unlikely to do so. Pits with no long-term prospects to be stripped of easily accessible reserves or turned over to private licence-holders.</p>

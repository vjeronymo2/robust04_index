			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Markets: Skittish investors face season of uncertainty - Wall Street SNOW IN the Rockies, floods in the mid-west and a record-breaking heat wave in the east - summer this year is straying far from its norm. Coming on the heels of an equally unpredictable winter, people just do not know what to expect next. The stock markets have been behaving in a similarly capricious fashion. Since mid-June, share prices as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average have moved so erratically that they have confounded attempts to draw up a sensible analysis of market trends. On midsummer's day, the Dow was at 3,510. In the two days following June 21, it dropped 44 points, but rallied more than 60 points over the following three days. It then embarked upon a five-day slide which took 80 points off its value. On July 7 it rallied once more, recouping almost 65 points in two days. By mid-morning yesterday, after more than a fortnight of wild gyrations, the Dow was back where it started - at 3,510. These swings in prices reflect investor skittishness over the outlook for equities. The markets are proving extremely difficult to read, and no one can make a forecast with any real confidence. This uncertainty has been reflected in a series of recent articles in US newspapers and financial magazines postulating various outcomes for the markets over the rest of the year and beyond. Persuasive cases have been made that investors should hang tough (prices will remain trapped in a relatively narrow range as investors wait for the economy to take a firmer direction); that they should buy more stocks (as the economy's problems worsen, interest rates will fall even further and attract more money into the markets, pushing up prices); and that they should start selling stocks (interest rates will go up to head off inflation, forcing money out of overpriced stocks and turning a controlled decline into a headlong slide as nervous mutual fund investors scramble to liquidate their holdings). Uneasiness about the approaching second-quarter corporate reporting season has only added to the indecisive mood. The run-up to the season has been dominated by profits warnings from companies struggling to maintain earnings growth achieved earlier in the year or late in 1992. To some, the warnings suggest that second-quarter earnings across the board will fall short of expectations. To others, however, the season offers hopes for a rally, on the assumption that most of the bad news has been priced into stocks already. A good example of this thinking occurred this week when Nike announced fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 76.9m, up from Dollars 70.7m a year ago. Although profits were lower than analysts had expected, Nike's share price rose Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 56 on the news, mainly because the stock had been depressed ever since the sports shoe retailer issued a warning late in June about its longer-term earnings outlook. Several other factors have been behind the recent price oscillations. Commodities prices continue to exert an influence on stock, and bond, markets. The value of metals, especially gold, has been swinging back and forth, while fears that the huge floods in the mid-west will wreck some of the country's major crop harvests has boosted food prices temporarily. Energy prices also have been playing havoc on stocks. Earlier this week, shares in the country's airlines were hit by surging crude oil prices as investors worried that the big carriers, already involved in the latest skirmish of a long-running air fare war, would face higher fuel costs. On Thursday, airline stocks rebounded as oil prices turned tail, but yesterday they retreated once more, this time unsettled by reports of weak June air travel numbers. The manoeuvrings of the short-sellers - the speculative investors who, anticipating a falling market, sell borrowed stock in the hope they can buy it back later at a lower price - also have taken their toll. Much of Thursday's 38-point gain in the Dow, for example, was attributed to demand from short-sellers. They had expected prices to decline but, when the markets started heading higher, they were forced to scramble to buy back stock to meet their future obligations. The short-sellers, in fact, have been taking quite a beating from the markets. Since the beginning of the year, they have been betting that stocks would make a decisive move downwards - but each time the markets have teetered close to a collapse, buyers have stepped in and prices have snapped back smartly. Of course, at some stage the short-sellers are going to be proved right. The problem is, no one, least of all the short-sellers themselves, has any clue when that time will come. Monday        Closed Tuesday      3449.93 - 34.04 Wednesday    3475.67 + 25.74 Thursday     3514.42 + 38.75 Friday       3521.06 +  6.64</p>

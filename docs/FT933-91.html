			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hitachi to invest Y5bn in US plant HITACHI, the electronics group, is investing Y5bn (Dollars 47.2m) to increase capacity at its US semiconductor facility by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. Hitachi, an important producer of semiconductors, plans to use the increased capacity at its facility in Texas to make mainly logic integrated circuits for use in computers and industrial machinery, among other areas. The move is in line with long-term plans to increase overseas manufacturing, it said. Hitachi expects semiconductor sales to increase to Y600bn in the year ending March, from Y560bn a year earlier.</p>

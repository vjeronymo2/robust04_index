			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: PROPOSITION 125 ;  </P> <P> GAS TAX WOULD BE USED FOR RAIL SERVICE  </P> <P> In a year when several initiatives would, if adopted, bring massive complicated  changes in state laws, Proposition 125 is narrow in its effect and to the  point: The measure would free up gasoline tax money to improve commuter rail  service.  </P> <P> Voters in 1974 approved the use of gas taxes for building rail lines. Now  voters are being asked whether the gas taxes also can be used to buy rail  passenger cars and locomotives for intercity service.  </P> <P> Transportation officials say a short supply of so-called rolling stock --  passenger cars and locomotives -- has been a major impediment to the lengthy  and costly process of improving commuter rail service.  </P> <P> Bonds totaling $3 billion have been approved this year to enhance rail service  in the state. Commitments also have recently been made by state authorities to  begin extensive commuter service in and out of Los Angeles and other urban  centers by 1993. But proponents of the measure maintain that the needs are well  beyond what has already been provided.  </P> <P> The main question surrounding Proposition 125 is whether its passage would  substantially reduce the amount of money available to build highways --  currently the most extensive use of gas tax money.  </P> <P> In a recent communication to its members, the Automobile Club of Southern  California, which opposes the measure, contended that it undermines commitments  given to voters in the Proposition 111 campaign last spring that money raised  by increasing the gas tax would go to relieve traffic congestion and to build  and improve highways.  </P> <P> "Even after passage of Proposition 111, gas tax funds remain inadequate to  cover the current deficiencies in our road and highway system," the Auto Club  statement said. "By increasing the demands on gas tax funds, Proposition 125  will make the problem worse. To fund necessary highway projects, local  jurisdictions may be forced to turn to toll roads, resulting in a double tax  burden on motorists."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), sponsor of the legislation that put  Proposition 125 on the ballot, counters that the measure "does not affect  highway funding in any way."  </P> <P> "It does not increase nor decrease the amount of fuel tax funds allocated for  transit capital purposes by the Legislature," he said recently. "It simply  allows more flexibility on the part of local transit agencies in making  decisions as to what rail capital expenditures are undertaken." Currently, he  noted, all rail capital expenditures are authorized except for rolling stock.  Allowing money to be spent for this purpose is the only change, he said.  </P> <P> Until now, the rail allocation has been only a small share of the gas tax  revenues, this year amounting to $64 million. If there were to be more  political support for rail construction as opposed to highways, this could  grow.  </P> <P> Aside from Costa, support for the measure is coming from Cindy McKim, head of  the rail division at Caltrans, who views it as adding needed flexibility to  rail funding. "The bonds are a one-time-only jump-start on our rail program,"  she said.  </P> <P> Other backers include Gerald H. Meral, executive director of the Planning and  Conservation League, the sponsor of one of the rail bond measures approved by  the voters in the June primary; Kirk West, president of the California Chamber  of Commerce, and William E. Leonard, chairman of the California Transportation  Commission.  </P> <P> Opponents include the chairman and immediate past chairman of the Libertarian  Party of California, Gail Lightfoot and John Vernon.  </P> <P> No major campaign expenditures are expected from either proponents or opponents  of the measure.  </P></p>

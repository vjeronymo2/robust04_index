			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- French President Francois  Mitterrand urged his NATO colleagues here Monday [10 January] to  take action in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but diplomats said the summit  was unlikely to adopt any new initiatives.    "It is good to make commitments but we must keep them  tomorrow," Mitterrand said at the opening session of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation's two-day summit here, according to  spokesman Jean Musitelli.    France and other countries are lobbying for NATO to launch  air attacks on the Bosnian Serbs as promised in August if  requested by the United Nations to break the siege of Sarajevo  and other Moslem communities.    But Washington, which backed the air raids last May but was  frustrated by European opposition, now appears reluctant to act,  warning the attacks could endanger humanitarian operations on  the ground.    Musitelli said U.S. President Bill Clinton told the summit  that Washington was ready to go along if "each country assumes  its responsibilities to implement what will have been decided."    Britain has also balked at the possibility of air raids for  fear of reprisals against its troops serving with the  10,000-strong UN contingent in Bosnia.    British officials said the summit would do little more than  reaffirm the August decision to put its air power at the United  Nations' disposal if requested.    "Reaffirming them means being ready to implement them. The  situation could evolve in such a way that would call for their  implementation," one said.    France has also called in recent days for the boosting of UN  forces in Bosnia and application of UN Security Council  Resolution 836 aimed at using Western air power to protect UN  troops and Moslem "safe areas."    British Prime Minister John Major said the summit had to  consider "what realistic help we can continue to give to keep  Bosnians alive and encourage the peace process."    Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana told reporters here  that the 21-month-old conflict embroiling Bosnian Serbs, Moslem  and Croats "is a conflict that does not have a military  solution."    He said the UN presence in Bosnia "will not be eternal" and  a  decision on its future would have to be taken after the winter  if a peace accord is not struck.    Clinton also reiterated the United States' readiness to send  troops to Bosnia to help police and enforce an eventual peace  agreement, if the U.S. Congress agrees, according to Musitelli.    But U.S. officials have said congressional approval to  provide up to half of a planned 50,000-strong force was in doubt  following peacekeeping debacles in Somalia and Haiti.    The leaders were expected to discuss Bosnia as well as the  situation in Russia over dinner Monday night, officials said.    The foreign ministers of France, Britain, Spain and Canada,  which are contributing the bulk of the UN troops protecting  relief operations in Bosnia, were to confer at the same time.</p>

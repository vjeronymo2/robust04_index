			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Pollution plays back seat driver Motorists who imagine that their cars protect them against traffic pollution are deluding themselves, according to research published today. Pollution levels inside cars can be up to 18 times higher than those in the air outside, says Earth Resources Research, a London-based environmental consultancy in a report commissioned by Greenpeace. Drivers can be exposed to even higher levels of toxic pollutants - hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide - than cyclists and pedestrians. And they suffer whether the windows are open or closed. The research is based on studies in Britain, Europe and the US which measured pollution inside and outside cars. Levels inside were were two to 18 times higher for benzene (a carcinogenic hydrocarbon), two to 14 times higher for CO and 1.3 to 2.5 times higher for NO. They consistently exceed safety limits recommended by the EC and World Health Organisation. Exposure to benzene and CO is highest on urban roads and in slow-moving traffic. Conditions are worst in older cars with faulty exhaust systems. CO in the blood impairs the delivery of oxygen to the body and is dangerous for pregnant women and people with heart disease. In contrast, NO levels inside cars reach a peak during high-speed motorway driving, Earth Resources Research found. NO can damage the lungs and increase susceptibility to respiratory infection and asthma attacks. 'Interestingly, in most studies the level of ventilation did not significantly alter interior concentrations, although conditions tended to be worse with the heater on and somewhat better with air conditioning in use,' the report says. Recent data from the US, where most vehicles have catalytic converters, show in-car pollution levels similar to those in Europe, the report says, 'suggesting catalysts alone are not sufficient to solve the problem'.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Singer &amp; Friedlander faces new Pounds 8.6m claim SINGER &amp; Friedlander, the banking and property group, said yesterday it faces a new claim for damages of Pounds 8.6m from the department of trade and industry stemming from Singer's role as adviser to interests connected with Barlow Clowes, the fraudulent investment group. The company said the new claim was 'in relation to Singer's role in connection with Barlow Clowes and the bid for Buckley's Brewery in 1987'. Last May, Singer disclosed that it and three other City firms faced a separate claim of Pounds 40m from the DTI. Singer also announced yesterday that its pre-tax profits fell 61 per cent to Pounds 6.05m in 1992. However, the fall was attributed to an exceptional debit of Pounds 10.1m to cover the fall in value of properties held for long term investment. Without this debit, pre-tax profits would have risen 5 per cent to Pounds 16.2m. There was a 33 per cent rise to Pounds 9.29m in trading profits from banking operations. Mr John Hodson, chief executive, said this was in part attributable to a 'big turnaround' from losses to profits in a business which sells the high yielding debt of South American companies. He added that there was also a strong performance from the corporate finance department's offices in Leeds and Nottingham, which give advice to small and medium-size companies. Singer's property division made profits of Pounds 3.05m, down from Pounds 3.12m. The fall was attributable to a rent free period granted on a new investment, now fully let. Earnings per share, excluding the exceptional item, rose 22 per cent to 5.86p. The total dividend was raised from 2.5p to 2.6p via a final of 1.6p.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Letter: European agriculture forced in wrong direction Sir, There appears to be considerable misinformation, or being charitable, misunderstanding, about the effect that the probably General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreement will have on Europe's food production. Under the agreement there is absolutely no actual requirement upon Europe's farmers to reduce, for example, cereal production. What is required is that the amount of subsidised exports is reduced. Un-subsidised exports will remain unrestricted. In addition, even the reduction in subsidised exports is relatively non-damaging since the Gatt agreement requires a reduction in these of only 21 per cent in volume terms and 36 per cent in export subsidy cash terms by the year 2000. Last year export refunds cost European Community taxpayers over Pounds 8bn, plus a further Pounds 5bn for storing surpluses. At the same time these subsidised exports caused havoc in world food markets and were especially damaging to Third World food producers. The whole direction towards 'peasantisation', in which European agriculture is being forced to travel by misdirected government subsidisation, is wrong. The majority of Europe's farmers could compete, and be far better off, were they allowed to compete, unsubsidised, on world food markets for that percentage of their production that is surplus to EC domestic requirements. The peasants of Europe could then be supported by governments, at considerably less cost than the present corrupt and anachronistic Common Agricultural Policy, for social reasons only.

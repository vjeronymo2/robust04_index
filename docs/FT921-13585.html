			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace Institutions which have been baying for British Aerospace's blood at least have the satisfaction of seeing Mr Dudley Eustace quit his job as finance director. Doubtless, Mr Eustace must share the blame for last autumn's rights issue fiasco. But it does not help that there is no replacement to hand, while the problems that piled up during the reign of the idiosyncratic Sir Roland Smith are as acute as ever. Asda's property claim against BAe has at least been provided for, so there is no extra impact on the profit and loss account. It will involve a cash outflow, though, which the company can ill afford - especially since it looks increasingly unlikely to clinch the cash-rich second phase of the al-Yamamah deal until the UK election is out of the way. Meanwhile, BAe has to be doubly careful in managing its working capital. Its cash position may have improved in last year's second half as stocks of unsold Rover cars were reduced. But cars will be difficult to move this year as well. BAe needs to find a new finance director quickly, and a good one at that.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Price rises 'increase Soviet poverty' A ROW broke out within the Soviet government yesterday over a report claiming that recent price rises were putting more than half the population at or below the poverty line. A meeting of the Security Council, which brings President Mikhail Gorbachev together with his main presidential aides, opened with an attack on official estimates about the price rises by Mr Yevgeny Primakov, recently Mr Gorbachev's special envoy to the Middle East. Mr Primakov said that figures showing the minimal subsistence income required to keep level with the price rises had more than doubled, from Rbs97 (Pounds 32) a month to Rbs207 (Pounds 68), were more accurate than the figures presented to the council by the State Price Commission. These showed prices had gone up on average by 1.5 times, although meat and its products had tripled, bread had doubled and some items of clothing, like shoes, had gone up four or five times. The issue is a particularly touchy one, since the price rises have been directly responsible for a wave of strikes (at present in abeyance) in Belorussia and for isolated protests and minor riots in Soviet cities. The higher average figures, produced by Mr Boris Bolotin, an economist working for the IMEMO economic think tank, would put nearly half the Soviet population at or below the poverty line. He defines this as having less than the minimum income needed to pay for a fixed basket of commodities. Mr Bolotin calculates that the compensation of Rbs60 a month for the lower paid does not provide 85 per cent compensation for the price rises, as the government claims, but only one third. Figures produced by the newspaper Commersant took a position between the state committee figures and Mr Bolotin's, showing price rises of 1.7 times. The newspaper said that the subsistence level in big cities has risen to a minimum of Rbs186 a month. The one bright spot - though only for the wealthiest - is that the surge in state prices has forced down black market prices. Those worst hit are those who shop mostly at state stores, despite queues and empty shelves.</p>

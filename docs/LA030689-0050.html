			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Without switching personalities, format or any of the other essentials that  normally go with such things, KMPC-FM (101.9) will cease to exist today and  reemerge as KEDG-FM. "Nothing will change except for the advertising and  promotion," says Denise Maynard, programming assistant for "The Edge" (as the  station now calls itself). She said the call letter change came about because  station management believed listeners confused KMPC-FM, an album rock format,  with its AM sister station which programs big band and easy listening music  along with the California Angels baseball games.

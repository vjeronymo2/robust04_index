			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Banks offer lesson in regulation - Derivatives The issue of how best to police derivatives markets has been exercising the minds of regulators, bankers and end-users for several years. The usual regulatory approach has been to apply existing standards to the derivatives markets. In a paper published yesterday by the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, Mr Charles Taylor, executive director of the Washington-based think-tank Group of Thirty, turns that approach on its head. He argues that not only have regulators got it wrong, but that derivatives specialists at banks have largely got it right. In fact, he says, the model-based approach to market risk management adopted by derivatives specialists should be extended not only to other areas of securities trading, but also to credit risk and other types of risk. 'The central idea is that the amount of capital a bank needs is related to the riskiness of its business, measured by the volatility of its income,' says Mr Taylor. Unlike the traditional approach of assessing credit exposure, this involves predicting future volatility using historical models and marking to market. There are four steps: regulators need to set risk parameters, such as the scope of historical data; they must validate the computer models used by banks; banks must estimate the overall 'value-at-risk'; finally, the regulator has to apply a 'conservatism factor' to the resulting estimates, in order to calculate the capital adequacy standard. The ideas in Mr Taylor's paper, 'A new approach to capital adequacy regulation for banks', stem partly from discussions with market practitioners when putting together the Group of Thirty's guidelines on best practice in the derivatives market. 'Our discussions led me to think that it might be possible to apply concepts used there, like value-at-risk and statistical measures of income volatility, to the wider problem of setting capital adequacy standards. Then I learnt that this idea was nothing but 'best practice' in capital allocation,' Mr Taylor explains. As well as setting out how this could be done by regulators, Mr Taylor criticises the existing approach, embodied in the 1988 Basle Accord, and the market risk amendment, which he describes as 'rough and ready'. However, Mr Taylor, who has discussed his ideas with both regulators and bankers, is surprisingly optimistic about the prospect of regulators taking up what is effectively a reversal of their traditional approach to regulation. Certainly, the Basle committee has delayed implementing its market risk amendment due to the strong adverse reaction by banks. Originally, the comment period was to end in December 1993, for a decision in early 1994, followed by implementation. Mr Taylor says he expects regulators to allow greater use of models in calculating market risk than is indicated in the original consultative paper. There are a number of points in Mr Taylor's favour. First, applying rules which already correlate with internal risk management is clearly a more efficient approach. Secondly, regulators' own understanding has advanced in leaps and bounds in recent years. They may now be ready to apply some of the lessons learnt to other areas of regulation. However, there are also problems. The computer models used are extremely complex and, to police the system effectively, regulators would need to employ highly-skilled staff. Such staff, as well as being expensive, might quickly be tempted to move to banks. Mr Taylor thinks this problem can be overcome. 'Regulators are taking a lot of time and trouble to train people,' he argues. In addition, he believes that as the derivatives markets continue to expand, the pool of experts in the field will grow. To some degree, the same problem exists among smaller banks and institutions on the fringes of the market - although, arguably, market participants who are not sophisticated enough to implement this type of risk management should not be involved in the market. Secondly, many of the blow-ups in the derivatives markets have taken place not because of inherent risks, but because traders have deliberately misreported or falsified positions. A system relying on traders marking to market would have to be very closely policed.

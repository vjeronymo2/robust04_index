			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Uasin Gishu district commissioner [DC], Mr.  Wilson Chepkwony, has said the government was doing everything  possible to assist those who had been affected by clashes which  flared up some time back in the Burnt Forest area, adding that  calm had been restored.    The DC, speaking when he chaired a leaders' meeting called  to  discuss the security in the region, said the government had  donated 3,000 bags of maize to the people who had fled the area  and had now gone back to their farms, and warned the press  against writing stories meant to incite people in the area.

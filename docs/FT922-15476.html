			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: ANZ drops partnership plans THE Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) yesterday dropped plans for a commercial partnership with National Mutual Life, nearly two years after the Australian government vetoed plans for a ADollars 3.4bn (USDollars 2.6bn) merger. Mr Will Bailey, ANZ chief executive, said detailed negotiations had failed to find a structure which would allow joint control of important business areas while conforming with federal competition law. The two groups set up working parties to discuss ways of increasing co-operation after Mr Paul Keating, then Australia's treasurer, blocked the proposed merger on competition grounds in May 1990. Mr Keating said the merger would have substantially reduced competition in the life insurance market, which is dominated by a handful of banks and pension funds. The effect of his ruling was to enshrine in law the independence of the country's six biggest financial institutions. ANZ is the second largest bank, and National Mutual is the second largest life office. Mr Bailey said detailed analysis of the groups' funds management, information technology and product distribution operations had confirmed that a merger was 'clearly the best option for both parties'. He said the groups had identified areas in which gains could be made from joint control, but had been 'unable to find a structure which would meet each company's requirements and also fall within the government restrictions'. However, Mr Bailey said the two groups would co-operate on broader commercial issues such as capital raisings, systems costs and distribution of a limited range of products. Mr Gil Hoskins, managing director of National Mutual, said policy-holders would benefit from 'a loose alliance which leaves scope for the development of other connections and arrangements within the financial sector'. He said ANZ wanted to maintain an independent position in the superannuation and life insurance markets rather than enter a partnership short of a merger. 'Therefore it is impractical to continue to be aligned with them,' he said.</p>

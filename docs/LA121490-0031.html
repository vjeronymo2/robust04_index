			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> TOUGH SLEDDING FOR SANTA CLAUS;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS: ST. NICK, ALIAS STEVE PORTER, IS LEARNING HOW TO HANDLE ADULTS  WHOSE CHILDREN WANT NO PART OF THE MAN IN THE RED SUIT.  </P> <P> You could fill a book with the things they never teach you at Santa Claus  school, Steve Porter says. Such as how to handle rejection.  </P> <P> Or more precisely, how to handle parents whose children want no part of a Santa  Claus photo opportunity.  </P> <P> "It's the biggest problem I have with parents," said Porter, who plays Santa  Claus at The Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks. "I despise these people who force a  child who's terrified of Santa to sit up on his lap and then say, 'Smile.' "  </P> <P> Of the dozens of preschool-age children who toddled up to Santa's throne  Thursday morning, at least half screamed in protest, despite Porter's kindly  reassurances and the threats, bribes and assorted enticements of camera-toting  parents.  </P> <P> "I don't think they know who Santa is," said Suzan Benson of Simi Valley, as  son Michael and nephew Tyler Steele, both 1 year old, wailed in unison while  struggling to escape Santa's arms. "They wonder, 'Who is this strange man?' "  </P> <P> "Tyler was fine until Michael started crying," said Tyler's mother, Lisa  Steele.  </P> <P> For Grace Brown, a clerk at the Culpeppers Popcorn counter a few yards away, it  was a familiar scene of laughter and lamentation.  </P> <P> "We tell our kids not to talk to strangers, then we drag them to see Santa,"  Brown said. "I've heard parents threaten kids and bribe them. 'We'll go get a  toy if you're good.'  </P> <P> "It's frustrating for parents." Brown said. "They get the kids all dolled up  and then they don't want to sit on Santa's lap.  </P> <P> "But some of them really look forward to it."  </P> <P> For most parents, recording their child's encounter with Santa is at least as  important as the visit itself. Robin Nicastro, Santa's photographer at The  Oaks, has a collection of stuffed animals, bells and funny faces designed to  stop tears long enough for a quick photo.  </P> <P> "Some kids you can snap out of it," Nicastro said. "But some parents pressure  their kids."  </P> <P> And sometimes there's no telling what will happen.  </P> <P> "He was OK until he got up there," said Jami Swayze, whose 1-year-old son Jesse  -- actor Patrick Swayze's nephew -- sobbed on cue the minute he was placed in  Santa's arms.  </P> <P> "These kids wait in line and watch the other kids cry and think that's what  they're supposed to do," Swayze added.  </P> <P> Echoing the comments of several parents, Swayze said she dared not arrive home  from the mall without photographs, no matter how Jesse felt about it.  </P> <P> "His grandparents said that if I didn't get them, they were going to bring him  down," said Swayze, who bought the top-of-the-line, six-photo package for  $19.95.  </P> <P> The reluctance of some children to sit in Santa's lap is one of many surprises  that Porter has entered in a journal -- "The Santa Claus Chronicles" -- since  he attended a two-day Santa school and started at the mall the day after  Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> A novice St. Nick, the 35-year-old Porter says he never knew how hard it could  be to ho-ho-ho all day in a hot costume and scratchy beard.  </P> <P> "The first thing Santa has to do is jet to the bathroom," he said as he doffed  his red suit at the start of a 30-minute lunch break. Then he squeezed in a  couple of cigarettes in a back room of the mall before fortifying himself for  the afternoon crowd -- an older, more skeptical bunch -- with a chicken  sandwich.  </P> <P> "Some kids challenge me," he said. "They say, 'You're not really Santa Claus.'  I tell them that Santa needs lots of helpers."  </P> <P> The No. 1 rule for Santa Claus is not to make promises, Porter said. "I never  promise anything, even if the parent says it's OK."  </P> <P> So what do kids want this year?  </P> <P> "For boys, anything to do with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," Porter said. "For  girls, it's Barbie. I've had 10,000 requests for Barbie this, Barbie that."  </P> <P> Then there was the 47-year-old woman who climbed on Santa's lap and announced  that she wanted Santa for Christmas. "She wanted to know when I got off work,"  said Porter, a divorced Newbury Park resident with two children of his own.  </P> <P> Despite his encounters with pushy parents and tearful children, Porter said the  $7-an-hour job has gotten him into the Christmas spirit as never before.  </P> <P> "In the past, I've been burned out at Christmas," he said. "This year, I expect  it to be the best Christmas ever."  </P></p>

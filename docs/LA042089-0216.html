			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> 'LADY VOLS' FETED IN ROSE GARDEN  </P> <P> President Bush welcomed the 1989 NCAA women's basketball champions, the  University of Tennessee "Lady Vols," to the White House today but said that in  the face of intimidating competition, he would not try a repeat of his free  throw with the male champs.  </P> <P> Giving the women champions equal time in a sunny Rose Garden ceremony with his  wife, Barbara, and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Bush noted that there  was no basketball hoop set up on the garden lawn, as there was last week when  the male NCAA champion University of Michigan Wolverines visited and Bush hit a  well-documented free throw. The President pointed to the abilities of Most  Valuable Player Bridgette Gordon and said, "I'll be darned if I want to go  head-on-head with her out there on the foul line."  </P> <P> The Volunteers beat Auburn 76-60 on April 2 to win their second NCAA  championship in the last three years.  </P></p>

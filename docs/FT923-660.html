			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Prime ministers set 'final' deadline for Ulster talks TALKS on Northern Ireland's political future were given a 'final' extension of seven weeks by the British and Irish prime ministers yesterday after they reached a compromise to avert the collapse of the negotiations. Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds managed to resolve a dispute between the two governments over the timing of the next Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference - which unionists have insisted will mark the cut-off point for the separate talks on Ulster. The conference, originally expected next week, will now be held on November 16. The deal gives a breathing space for participants in the Ulster talks, who include representatives of the British and Irish governments as well as unionist and nationalist leaders. But it does nothing to lessen the compromises that will have to be made by all sides if an agreement is to be reached. So far any agreement on how Northern Ireland should be governed is at best sketchy. Unionists remain concerned about the republic's constitutional claim to the province and the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party has withdrawn from the talks until the claim is on the table for discussion. It is not clear if he will return when talks resume in Belfast on Wednesday. But Mr Peter Robinson, deputy DUP leader, last night said it was up to Dublin to take some 'realistic' action over its constitution if the talks were not to fail before the dealine the Irish had 'openly and publicly' set. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds became embroiled in the row after British and Irish ministers failed to reach agreement in Dublin earlier this week. The two prime ministers agreed there would be no more extensions to the Ulster talks. The Irish government sought an early date for the inter-governmental conference, fearing that otherwise the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, under which the meetings are held, would be devalued. However, unionists insisted that the separate Ulster talks could not continue once it was reactivated. They demanded suspension of the Anglo-Irish pact before they would begin talks.</p>

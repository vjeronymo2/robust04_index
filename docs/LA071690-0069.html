			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Formerly known as the Rooster, Angel Manager Doug Rader is now the Juggler. . .  .  </P> <P> Inconsistency, a logjam in the outfield and injuries in the infield add up to  88 different Angel lineups in 89 games -- the most remarkable statistic of an  unremarkable season in Anaheim. . . .  </P> <P> Only the lineup cards of April 11 and 14 have been the same: Devon White, cf;  Johnny Ray, 2b; Wally Joyner, 1b; Chili Davis, dh; Dante Bichette, lf; Claudell  Washington, rf; Lance Parrish, c; Jack Howell, 3b; Mark McLemore, ss. . . .  </P> <P> That lineup is 2-0 -- Mark Langston and Mike Witt combined for a 1-0 no-hitter  over Seattle and Bichette's three-run homer beat Minnesota, 7-5, in 12 innings  three nights later -- but won't be repeated because Washington was traded to  the Yankees and McLemore is disabled. . . .  </P> <P> No wonder the Angels are not in contention for the American League West title.  And, barring a dramatic upturn, this will be the first time since 1975 that  neither the Angels nor the Dodgers will have been a factor in a divisional  race. . . .  </P> <P> Worst call of the weekend was made Saturday by Wrigley Field official scorer  Bob Rosenberg when he gave Andre Dawson a single after hitting a routine  grounder to Dodger shortstop Alfredo Griffin, who couldn't get the ball out of  his glove until it was too late. . . .  </P> <P> Rosenberg had the biggest smile in all of Chicago when Mike Morgan allowed his  first legitimate hit in the seventh inning. . . .  </P> <P> Amused was Loel Schrader, the recently retired sports columnist of the Long  Beach Press Telegram.  </P> <P> In 1947, Clair (Toby) Tobias of the Grand Fork Chiefs of the Class C Northern  League was seeking his second consecutive no-hitter. In the first inning, a  Duluth batter bunted the ball to the third baseman, who threw wildly over the  first baseman's head. Official scorer Schrader ruled it a hit. By the fifth  inning, Tobias hadn't allowed another hit. Schrader then went down and asked  the first-base umpire if a good throw would have gotten that bunter in the  first inning. He said yes. Schrader changed his call to an error -- and Toby  Tobias eventually got his second consecutive no-hitter, believed to be a first  in the minor leagues. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Rob Dibble and Andrew Dice Clay. . . .  </P> <P> Think the Dodgers may have made a mistake when they re-signed Mike Marshall and  not Steve Sax?. . . .  </P> <P> Although they are 0-1 in their 1917 style uniforms, the Chicago White Sox  should wear them again. . . .  </P> <P> I hope Sox Manager Jeff Torborg isn't going to wear out relief ace Bobby  Thigpen, who made his third consecutive appearance and 42nd of the season  Sunday. . . .  </P> <P> Few people enjoy their jobs more than Oakland Athletics outfielder Dave  Henderson. . . .  </P> <P> Andrea Joyce, wife of CBS "Morning Show" co-host Harry Smith, did a good job  hosting the network's pregame baseball show Saturday. . . .  </P> <P> If the foul pole is in fair territory, why isn't it called the fair pole?. . .  .  </P> <P> Some of the best conditioned athletes in the world are competing in the Tour de  France, where the other day they bicycled up mountains in 107-degree heat and  90% humidity. . . .  </P> <P> Mike Dunleavy made his first decision as Lakers coach a good one by retaining  assistant coaches Bill Bertka, Randy Pfund and Jim Eyen. . . .  </P> <P> Two years ago, Jacques Demers and Jim Devellano of Detroit were the hottest  coach-general manager pair in the NHL. Now Demers is out of a job and Devellano  has been kicked upstairs. . . .  </P> <P> Could there be a place in the Kings' organization for Demers?. . . .  </P> <P> "Valvano: My Side," by Jim Valvano will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster's  Pocket Book in February. . . .  </P> <P> Inside Sports magazine underrated the maize and blue uniforms of Michigan when  it rated them second best looking in college football behind Florida State's  garnet and gold . . . .  </P> <P> Tallest female gymnast in the U.S. Olympic Festival was 5-3. . . .  </P> <P> Sorry, HBO, but I'm still not convinced that Mike Tyson is "baaack" like you  say in your commercials just because he knocked out Henry Tillman. . . .  </P> <P> One winning Pick Six ticket has been sold on 15 of the first 61 days of the  Hollywood Park meeting. . . .  </P> <P> Fenway Park gets less sacred every time I see beach balls being thrown around.  . . . That celebrity golf tournament on NBC was OK, but I'd much rather watch  Michael Jordan stuff a basketball than sink a putt. . . . You know what kind of  a season it is for the Chicago Cubs when Harry Caray says, "It's only a game."  </P></p>

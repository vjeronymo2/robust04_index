			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May l0 (AFP) -- The Bosnian Government  Army has deployed mortars and anti-aircraft guns near Sarajevo  in violation of the heavy arms exclusion zone around the city,  UN officials said Tuesday [10 May]. UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) spokesman Eric Chaperon said the Moslem-led forces  had heavy weapons and many patrols on Mount Igman, to the west  of the city, facing Bosnian Serb lines within the 20-kilometre  (12.5-mile) exclusion zone ordered by NATO in February under the  threat of air strikes.    Another UNPROFOR officer, speaking anonymously, said  helicopter patrols had on Monday counted four mortars and two  anti-aircraft guns deployed alongside 1,000 Bosnian army troops  around Mount Igman, a strategic height overlooking the Bosnian  capital. Chaperon also reported fresh fighting between Bosnian  troops loyal to President Alija Izetbegovic and soldiers  following orders of Fikret Abdic, the renegade Moslem leader of  the northwestern Bosnian pocket of Bihac.</p>

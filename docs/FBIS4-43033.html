			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Almost Two-Thirds in Favor of </F> Accession: `Gate to Larger Europe Open'"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Federal President Thomas  Klestil was not only happy about the effect of the appeals to  participate in the referendum but also about the result:  "Austria has passed its European test -- the gate to a larger  Europe is now open." The result of the referendum is "important  for the country and good for Europe."    Klestil strongly appealed to all parties to "accept the  decision of the voters in a democratic spirit, to close ranks,  and to tackle together the major challenges the country now  faces." It is one of the most important rules of democracy not  to the day after the election tense with the confrontations of  before.    In their news conference, neither Federal Chancellor Franz  Vranitzky nor Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek displayed "any  inclination for experimentation." Both stated that cooperation  at the level of government with those parties that have taken a  negative position toward EU [Eureopean Union] entry was "not  possible" in the coming legislative term, either. Vranitzky  said that the election campaign would be used to create  "fundamental trust in our party among the people." "In the  interest of Euorpean integration," the government parties showed  "self-evident solidarity."    Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek said that the Austrian People's  Party [OeVP] would "continue the path on which it had embarked."  [passage omitted]    "The Austrians opted for the future and for optimism." This  is how Foreign Minister Alois Mock commented on the result of  the referendum. "Once more, the Austrians showed that they are  better than they themselves think of themselves. The Austrians  definitely wanted to have a say when it comes to building a new  Europe, and not remain outside."    Heide Schmidt, chairwoman of the Liberal Forum, spoke of a  decision for openness. As an opposition party, it was not easy  for the Liberal Forum to support the government line. The "Yes  to the EU" was, nevertheless, the right decision, because this  was proof of a responsible opposition policy.    On behalf of the Greens, Peter Pilz announced that "as of  tomorrow, the Austrian Greens" would "keep an eye on Brussels  and Strasbourg," -- because now Austria would need somebody to  carefully watch that the transit treaty will still exist in six  years. [passage omitted]    In a reaction late last night, [Freedom Party of Austria  Chairman Joerg] Haider said "I am neither the winner nor the  loser," and announced that the government would "not be happy  for too long about its undoubtedly high level of support." The  mists would rise, and then those "conditions" of which he warned  would come into play.    In view of the enormous propaganda, the 66-percent support  was "actually a poor result," Haider said in his analysis of the  result, in which he described entry opponents as "patriots" and  supporters as "European-minded Austrians" who "obviously" do not  "attach great importance" to democratic structures.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Italgas advances 6.5% to L658bn despite recession and mild winter ITALGAS, the listed Italian gas distribution group controlled by the Eni state holding company, raised gross operating profits by 6.5 per cent to L658bn (Dollars 411.25m) last year, according to preliminary figures released yesterday, Group sales were little changed at L3,381bn, against L3,353bn in 1991, in spite of the recession and a relatively mild winter, which tended to depress gas sales, said Mr Carlo Da Molo, chairman. The company gave a strong hint that the dividend would be increased for the second year running, up from the L100 a share paid last year. Full figures for the group, which in 1991 raised net profits by 16.7 per cent to L91bn, will not be available until later this month. While gas supplies remained broadly stable at 6.4bn cubic metres last year, sales of drinking water, the group's second main business area, rose by about 10 per cent to 175m cubic metres, while the number of towns served rose to 389 from 319. Investments during the year rose by 11 per cent to L761bn. Banco di Napoli, the big Naples-based Italian bank, has moved a step closer to buying the remaining minority stakes in Isveimer, a Neapolitan long-term lending institution. Last month, Banco di Napoli revealed it had gained majority control of Isveimer, which administers about L25,000bn in loans to borrowers in southern Italy. The impact of a full merger between the two companies is now being considered by the Bank of Italy, which will have to find that the deal does not create a monopoly.</p>

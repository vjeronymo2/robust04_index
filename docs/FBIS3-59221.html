			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Arturo Zampaglione report: "Clinton's Republican </F> Turnaround -- Three Out of Four Americans Are Behind Him"]    [Text] Washington -- He talked of God, spoke out against  military spending cuts, talked nostalgically of family values,  praised the electric chair, proposed life imprisonment for  third-time offenders, announced cutbacks in social expenditure,  praised religious voluntary work, and attacked welfare benefits  for the unemployed. How can any President riding on the back of  these issues be called a democrat? How do we define the Bill  Clinton who -- on Tuesday evening [25 January], speaking in a  voice which was, to tell the truth, slightly hoarse -- showed  himself at the sung mass of American politics that is the State  of the Union speech? Right wing or left wing? Post-Reagan or  post-Kennedy? Or, to put it in Italian terms, is he a "liberal  democrat," a progressive, [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi-follower, or a [L'UNITA editor] Veltroni-follower.    The truth is that in a traditional bipolar system, which the  United States has had for some time and which Italy aspires to,  it is often hard to pin labels on people. The mythical "center"  of politics and of society is more of a virtual reality than a  real place, and is occupied from time to time by both sides,  counter to ideology and depending on contingent electoral  convenience. Clinton's speech the other evening simply confirmed  this.    The President's aim was clear: Place the White House and the  Democratic Party in the best possible position with regard to  the forthcoming elections. A third of the Senate will be  reelected in November, together with the entire House of  Representatives. If the Republicans were to win again, as they  did two months ago with Rudolph Giuliani in New York, and  perhaps if they managed to wrest back the majority in Congress,  then Clinton too would be much more vulnerable at the  presidential elections of 1996. Hence the attempt to anticipate  events, taking up typically Republican themes such as crime and  unemployment and attempting to woo middle class moderates. At  the same time, the President did not want to cut all his ties  with the traditional Democrat voters: For this reason the  speech was a clever game of striking the balance between the  iron fist and social expectations, and between traditional  values and post-modern idealism. Clinton has watered down but  has certainly not forgotten the progressive stance that took him  to the White House, beginning with the reform of health care and  the policy for cleaning up the ghettos. What conclusions can be  drawn? A pragmatic platform has emerged that pleased the voters  (84 percent of people interviewed in a CNN-USA TODAY poll said  they thought that the President was going down the right road)  and that he has forced out the Republicans.    In a televised reply, Senate minority leader Bob Dole and  Clinton's most likely opponent in the 1996 election, could only  criticize the inadequacy of Clinton's anticrime measures and the  overdose of bureaucracy in the health care reforms. His party  colleagues confirmed yesterday that the litmus paper of the  White House anticrime strategy will be the presence of large  amounts of money to build more prisons.    The fact remains that the Democratic majority is ready to  follow the President. "The health care reform will be passed by  Easter," predicted House of Representatives Speaker Tom Foley.  His party certainly does not want to let the favorable  political situation slip, with a recovering economy -- and it is  this which seems to be most important for the voters -- where  there are no wars on the horizon, where the White House remains  popular in the polls, and where the program platform, i.e.,  running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, keeps the  number of malcontents to a minimum.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Clinton bangs drum for healthcare reform plan President Bill Clinton started his working year yesterday with a White House meeting intended to get his plans moving again for reform of the US healthcare system. He insisted that legislation to overhaul the healthcare system, several times postponed in 1993, would be approved by Congress this year. 'I believe that 1994 will go down in history as the year when, after decades and decades of false starts and lame excuses and being overcome by special interests, the American people finally had health security for all,' Mr Clinton said at a meeting of senior advisers. While concern about the healthcare system remains high among US voters, the issue has lost some of the urgency that drove the Clinton administration's proposal, announced last year, for radical legislation that would guarantee a fixed package of health benefits to all US residents. The bill faces hard pounding in the congressional committee process. The delay in pushing the legislation through Congress has given Mr Clinton's opponents time to muster their forces against crucial elements of his plan, especially the requirement that all employers pay most of the cost of health insurance for their workers. 'We'll need a different plan,' Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, said in a New Year's Day address, 'taking the best ideas, if any, from all the proposals but without price controls, employer mandates, mandatory health care alliances and massive overdoses of government control.' Some Republicans are even betting that public demand for healthcare reform has died down enough to remove the need for radical change altogether. While most members of Congress appear still to believe that a substantial reform law will be enacted, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the senior Republican on the Senate labour committee, predicted yesterday that comprehensive legislation would not pass. Mr Clinton said he remained open to alternatives but that, after weeks in which his proposals have been dissected, he wanted people to look now at the details of rival plans and at the cost of the status quo. 'I have said all along what my bottom line is: that we have to have comprehensive benefits that can never be taken away; that we cannot go on being the only country in the world with an advanced economy that cannot figure out how to guarantee health security to all our people.'</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: USAir union threatens strike THE THREAT of industrial action loomed over USAir, the US carrier in which British Airways is seeking to invest Dollars 750m in return for a large minority stake, after the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said its members appeared to have voted in favour of a strike. The announcement from the IAM came late yesterday afternoon. The union - representative for over 8,000 mechanics and related workers at the airline - acknowledged that a few smaller 'locals' (branches) were still left to vote today. But it said results so far suggested a 'nearly unanimous vote' for strike action. The union added that it would set a strike date within 72 hours. 'The IAM takes no pleasure in announcing strike plans,' said Mr John Peterpaul, IAM transportation vice president, 'but USAir must understand our members feel they have no choice but to stand up to company demands that would force IAM members to carry a heavier burden than other employee groups'. He said the union was willing to resume negotiations but no talks have been scheduled. The strike threat comes after a contract offer from USAir which the union claims would mean permanent wage cuts and work rule concessions. Yesterday, the union was sharply critical of British Airways, suggesting the UK carrier had 'imposed its heavy hand in USAir matters', even though its proposed investment has get to gain regulatory approval. The IAM said it was withdrawing support for the proposed link between the two airlines. BA declined to comment.</p>

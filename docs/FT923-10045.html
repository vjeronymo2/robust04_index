			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank Lloyds Bank must have been disappointed to see its shares fall more than 5 per cent yesterday after it raised its interim dividend by nearly 10 per cent. After all, its net return on equity is a highly respectable 16 per cent, the all-important tier 1 capital ratio is pushing 7 per cent and bad debt provisions against large corporate loans are at their lowest level for more than two years. The trouble is that these factors have for some time allowed the shares to trade at a premium of 100 per cent and more to net assets. What the market was not prepared for was the 6 per cent fall in operating income. Coming a day after a similar disappointment from Midland, Lloyds' interim results add to the impression that a dearth of income is becoming a problem for the British banking industry which no amount of cost-cutting can disguise. True, Barclays and National Westminster are not expected to show the same shrinkage in their loan books next week, but Lloyds is the bank to which investors look for strategic vision. It may be right that lower interest rates reduce the amount it can earn on its interest-free capital and that some low-yield business is not worth keeping anyway. Beyond that, however, the answers are hardly original: keep trimming expenses and hope that loan demand will revive. It is thus easy to see why Lloyds was so interested in acquiring Midland. The merger would have given it both extra income and new costs to cut. Unfortunately, there are no obvious alternative candidates. But investors are not without some consolation. For the time being the bank has plenty of resources - including Pounds 930m in surplus provisions for developing country debt - with which to finance further increases in its dividend.</p>

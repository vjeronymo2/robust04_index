			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Major's shotgun marriage threatens Anglo-Irish pact / A look at how the government may have bolstered its majority but at the cost of a crisis in cross-border relations A COLLAPSE of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement and a crisis in cross-border relations could be the price to be paid for Mr John Major's courtship of the Ulster Unionist party at Westminster to bolster his government's majority. The crushing defeat of the Tories at the Christchurch by-election on Thursday, leaving them with a majority of just 17, and continuing threats of rebellion on the Tory backbenches have given Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, the opportunity he has long been looking for. He now hopes to drive a wedge between London and Dublin and to reverse what Unionists perceive to be the growing influence of the Republic of Ireland in Northern Ireland's affairs. In return for the support of his nine MPs, Mr Molyneaux said last week that he had reached an 'understanding' with Mr Major. The government has repeatedly denied that a deal was struck. Mr Ken Maginnis, the UUP deputy leader, said 'there has not been any last-minute deal signed up in legal terms'. Talks had being going on for months 'resulting from government frustration with the Northern Ireland round-table talks process and the intransigence of the Irish government and the (nationalist) SDLP'. He added: 'The government has for some time been indicating a willingness, if all else fails, to consider changes in the way Northern Ireland is to be governed.' Some of the changes envisaged by the UUP include the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster, the broadening of local government powers in the province and 'greater attention being paid to persons with experience in security issues'. Asked whether these changes would signify the abandonment of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Mr Maginnis said: 'I certainly hope so.' Mr Molyneaux said last week he expects the agreement 'to wither away'. This has set alarm bells jangling in Dublin. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said last week he would be 'very concerned' by any unilateral moves made by the British government on Northern Ireland. One of his aides said: 'If a clear warning is made to London that any unilateral move would be viewed as undermining the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but they go ahead and do it anyway, then one can only conclude that this would lead to a major crisis in Anglo-Irish relations'. The fact that Mr Reynolds has stepped into the fray, not leaving it solely to Mr Dick Spring, his foreign minister, is indicative of the seriousness with which the issue is being dealt with in Dublin. In Belfast the SDLP, led by Mr John Hume, said: 'This is an integrationist move, making Northern Ireland similar to Scotland or Wales and ignores the fact that we have a divided community here, where a large part of the population consider themselves Irish.' Hitherto, the British government has professed neutrality in the Anglo-Irish talks process. A key phrase used by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and first coined by Mr Peter Brooke, his predecessor, was that Britain had 'no strategic interest' in Northern Ireland - a phrase which alarmed Unionists but encouraged nationalists to believe that Downing Street was genuinely exploring a neutral approach. Mr Hume has been involved in bilateral talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The talks have angered Unionists but Mr Hume says they are aimed at bringing the political violence to an end. Unionists accuse Mr Hume, Sinn Fein and Dublin of trying to set up a 'pan-nationalist front'. Although there has been discomfiture in Dublin at Mr Hume's move, the official government reaction is that 'Mr Hume is an experienced politician and knows what he is doing'. According to those close to the Hume-Adams talks, one of Mr Hume's main arguments has been that the British government's professed neutrality in the round-table talks and its statement of 'no strategic interest' in the province, provide the basis for a negotiated end to the political violence. Significantly, Sinn Fein has substantially moderated its tone over recent months, and although it still argues that Britain must go one step further and make a commitment to militarily and politically disengage from Northern Ireland, it sets no deadline for this as it has in the past and has been making increasingly conciliatory statements directed towards the Unionists. Mr Hume's key argument now looks very shaky however, and with it his hopes of ending the IRA bombing campaign and eventually bringing Sinn Fein into the peace process. In private, the republic's officials now talk about playing the US card  - asking the Clinton administration to appoint a 'peace envoy' to Northern Ireland. British objections have until now restrained Dublin from pushing this option. A further option might be for the republic to ease its 22-year broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein. This would increase pressure for a review of the similar ban in the UK.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES MAY JOIN PANEL OVERSEEING CLEANUP OF UP MONTEREY PARK LANDFILL  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee recommended Tuesday that the city's  Department of Water and Power join an industry-run committee that is cleaning  up the Operating Industries Inc. landfill in Monterey Park.  </P> <P> The recommendation, expected to be considered by the full council later this  month, would make the department the only municipal agency on the 82-member  committee. The committee was set up several years ago by companies identified  by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as "potentially responsible" for  contamination at the landfill, which has been designated a federal Superfund  site.  </P> <P> The 190-acre dump, bisected by the Pomona Freeway, opened in 1948 and accepted  liquid hazardous waste as well as municipal trash until it was closed in 1984  amid complaints about odors, the accumulation of landfill gas and other  environmental problems. In 1986, the dump was placed on the national priority  list for cleanup under the Superfund program, which makes companies and  agencies liable for the hazardous waste they generate even after they have  legally disposed of it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DWP Used Dump  </P> <P> The DWP allegedly dumped hazardous liquid waste at the landfill, although the  department has not acknowledged liability for the pollution problem there. DWP  spokeswoman Mindy Berman said the department disposed of 700,000 gallons of  "water with some oil in it" from steam plants and other facilities. She said  the DWP waste accounted for a fraction of the total liquid waste at the  landfill, estimated at 200 million gallons.  </P> <P> At a hearing Tuesday before the council's Commerce, Energy and Natural  Resources Committee, an attorney for the DWP said the city would face a battle  with the EPA if the department does not join the so-called Operating Industries  Landfill Steering Committee. The department would pay $49,250 to join the  committee, with other costs through the end of December expected to total  $100,000.  </P> <P> "The EPA has told us they will not deal with us as a separate entity," said  Deputy City Atty. Roberta Zinman. "They only wish to deal with the steering  committee. It appears there will be no secondary group."  </P> <P> In a report to the council panel, the City Administrative Office said joining  the committee was financially wise because the admission fee would be less than  the cost of drilling one test hole at the landfill and the related laboratory  expenses. The steering committee is expected to drill two dozen monitoring  wells at the landfill.  </P> <P> "In the long run, taking everything into consideration, it would be a lot  cheaper and probably a lot more effective to join the organization than  fighting on our own," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who heads the  three-member council panel which unanimously approved the DWP request to join  the committee.  </P> <P> Last year, nearly 120 companies and government agencies agreed to pay a total  of $66 million to help clean up the dump, with the DWP's contribution exceeding  $440,000. At that time, Daniel W. McGovern, regional administrator of the EPA,  described the dump as "one of the most complex and contaminated sites in the  nation."  </P> <P> The landfill has been plagued with problems involving the migration of landfill  gas into surrounding neighborhoods, emissions of gases containing vinyl  chloride and other harmful substances, and the accumulation of leachate, which  is landfill water contaminated with chemicals. In May, the EPA agreed to  gradually hand over the job of cleaning up and monitoring the landfill to the  steering committee, which is scheduled to take full control of the job within  the next few weeks.  </P> <P> The steering committee, through contractors and consultants, is expected to  expand the system for monitoring, collecting and burning landfill gas at the  dump. It has already agreed to improve irrigation and erosion control at the  site and collect and haul away leachate. The group will also design and  construct a plant to treat leachate at the site.  </P> <P> EPA officials have estimated that the cleanup cost could reach $200 million to  $300 million. The City Administrative Office estimated in its report that the  cleanup could total $1 billion.  </P></p>

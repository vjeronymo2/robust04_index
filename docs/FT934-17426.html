			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Pressure over pit safety rules TORY backbenchers are putting pressure on the government over the new health and safety regulations for the coal industry that come into force today. In response to appeals from Nacods, the pit deputies' union, they are urging Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, to meet the concerns of miners over the regulations. The rules separate the duties of pit inspection from supervision - until now both carried out by Nacods, which is taking legal action against the government over the changes. Around 90 Conservative MPs have been approached by the union, including Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, MP for Batley and Spen, and Mr Winston Churchill, MP for Davyhulme, who both opposed the pit closure programme. In letters to the backbenchers Mr Peter McNestry, Nacods' general secretary, has warned that the new regulations eliminate 70 per cent of the safety obligations enshrined in absolute statutory duties and replaced them with more broadly defined duties and voluntary codes of conduct.</p>

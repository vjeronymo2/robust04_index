			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Welsh 'Quangoland' warned MR JOHN REDWOOD, the Welsh secretary, warned chairmen of Welsh quangos yesterday that the public expected national boards to maintain the 'highest standards of probity and fairness'. He said: 'I look to all the chairmen to lead, by insisting on the highest standards of conduct.' He said if things did go wrong, or a mistake was made, 'the public likes an early apology from the board and is entitled to expect that disciplinary action will be taken if necessary'. Mr Redwood was speaking at a meeting with the chairmen of Welsh non-departmental public bodies - the so-called quangos. He said there were limits to the number of functions which could best be handled by these. 'Many services require either the direct political control and accountability of local government or the Welsh Office. I do not want Quangoland to grow too fat on functions transferred from local government.' His comments come a few weeks after the publication of a highly critical report by the Commons public accounts committee about the internal management of the Welsh Development Agency. The investigation followed concerns raised by the National Audit Office about the WDA's 1991-92 accounts. In a report published today, the NAO condemns the way in which another quango, the Development Board for Rural Wales, allocated housing under a secret set of rules separate to those which were made public. The board's own housing officer was involved in allocating houses to himself and his ex-wife when neither was eligible under the published rules. The board said both allocations were authorised by senior officers. In his report on the board's 1992-93 accounts, Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, said the total number of affected tenancies was not known but might be one fifth of the board's housing stock of 1,200 houses, which are mostly in Newtown, Powys. His report follows one earlier this year by Mr Elwyn Moseley, the Welsh ombudsman, who found there had been gross maladministration. Sir John said the board accepted it had been guilty of that and had stopped allocations under the unpublished categories. It is the third successive year that the NAO has commented on the board's accounts. Last year, it said the board in 1991-92 had modified a car leasing scheme without Welsh Office approval. The previous year there had been an irregular payment of Pounds 15,563 to its retiring chief executive. Under the published housing rules, a qualifying applicant must have secured permanent employment in the town where he or she wished to live and to come from outside a 10-mile radius of it. Under the unpublished categories, neither employment in the area nor residence outside was a requirement. Sir John recognised that the board had been seeking to make best use of its assets and to meet its wider development objectives. Mr Glyn Davies, the board's chairman and an ex-officio director of the WDA, said yesterday: 'Sir John's report is fair and balanced. But it is very frustrating that media attention is diverted from the good work that we do.'</p>

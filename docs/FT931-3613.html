			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Observer: Honest broker Whether or not anyone knows quite what's what in the arcane sector of finance known as 'derivatives', we now have a Who's Who therein - thanks to a joint effort by Risk magazine and Intercapital Brokers. What's more, by asking the sector's inhabitants about their 'lifestyle' in the questionnaire, the publishers attempted to make all the so-called rocket scientists with multiple degrees in nuclear physics sound a shade more human. 'They are a cosmopolitan bunch, moving at ease between jobs in Tokyo, New York, London, Paris . . .' oozes the accompanying blurb. But apparently somewhat literal minded with it, a note at the front of the volume suggests. Having asked the whizz kids taking part in the early stages to name their 'pet hate', the compilers were dismayed by replies expressing a 'high level of distaste' for domestic animals. So the questionnaire was later amended to ask: 'What do you most dislike?' Alas we're not told whether the derivatives specialist who answered 'my wife', was an early or a late participant.</p>

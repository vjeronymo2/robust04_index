			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Restructuring lifts Trygg-Hansa LOWER underwriting losses and heavy investment gains enabled Trygg-Hansa SPP, Sweden's leading insurance company, to report improved results for the first six months as the group restructured following big losses last year associated with the country's banking crisis. Operating profits of SKr884m (Dollars 109m) were slightly down on the comparative figure of SKr898m at the same stage last year, but this was largely due to a 58 per cent fall in contributions from the 35 per cent-held Home Holdings group in the US to SKr42m from SKr101m. Otherwise, core insurance profits rose 10 per cent to SKr303m from SKr275m as premiums - up 2 per cent at SKr3.95bn - outstripped a marginal rise in claims costs. Trygg said the recession in Sweden had trimmed premiums at home by 4 per cent, but claims costs fell by 7 per cent and a trend of spiralling claims in recent years had been checked. Meanwhile, there was a 4 per cent increase in premiums from international insurance to SKr775m, while claims costs fell 14 per cent to SKr465. The group also showed benefits from the upward trend this year in capital markets. Unrealised capital gains, mainly in Trygg's bond portfolio, sent overall profits rocketing to SKr1.65bn from SKr436m. The group's solvency margin - the ratio of shareholders funds to premiums - at the end of the period stood at 151 per cent, compared with 134 per cent at the end of 1992. Claims costs from reinsurance rose in the first half to SKr1.23bn from SKr932m.</p>

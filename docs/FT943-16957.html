			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Prudential leads bidders for National Car Parks A consortium of venture capital investors, led by UK insurance giant Prudential, is understood to be behind the bid for National Parking Corporation, which owns National Car Parks and the fast-growing National Breakdown Recovery service. It is believed that the bidding consortium also includes Electra, the unquoted companies investment trust, CinVen, the venture capital arm of British Coal's in-house funds manager, and Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, part of Morgan Grenfell - NPC's financial adviser. Morgan Grenfell has been sounding out potential buyers for several months for the 64 per cent of NPC owned by founder Sir Donald Gosling, 65, and Mr Ronald Hobson, 73, after flotation was ruled out. The shares, which stood at 450p at the start of the week, rose further to 575p yesterday in over-the-counter trading, valuing the private company at Pounds 675m. The group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.3m on Pounds 233.5m turnover in the year to March 26, 1993. Aside from its enormous cash flow, NPC's major attraction would be its freehold and long-leasehold interests in around 600 car parks, and a number of property investments. The properties used by its operating businesses are all valued at cost, despite the fact that many of the car parks were purchased during the 1950s and 1960s and are situated in prime locations. Collins Stewart, the stockbroking firm, estimates that assuming valuations based on an 11 per cent yield on its car parks, NPC is sitting on a Pounds 200m surplus to its balance sheet property valuation of Pounds 197m. There is potential for redeveloping prime sites, although in many cases the local authorities may not be prepared to change the land usage. The company dominates the provision of private car parking spaces in the UK, with no sizeable competitors after its 1990 acquisition of rival Europarks. A near-monopoly has prevailed because of a quirk in the law: car park owners are not considered to be providing a service and are therefore outside the auspices of the Office of Fair Trading. NPC has utilised the cash flow from car parking to build up its highly successful vehicle breakdown operation, which made Pounds 9.8m profit last year. Its phone and computer network is now supporting a push into urgent domestic repair services.</p>

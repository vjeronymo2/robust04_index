			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Scots keep 'not proven' verdict The 'not proven' verdict in Scottish courts is to be retained, the government said yesterday. The decision to retain three verdicts - guilty, not guilty and not proven - was contained in a white paper on reform of the criminal justice system in Scotland. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, also said the government intended that Scotland retain 15-member juries. He told an Edinburgh news conference that a considerable majority of people  -including four voluntary organisations and two out of three police associations - supported keeping the 'not proven' verdict. The decision comes after widespread debate and a campaign by the parents of a murdered girl to abolish the verdict. A man accused of murdering 19-year-old Amanda Duffy two years ago had been acquitted by a jury verdict of not proven. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, a Scottish Office minister, said it would be left to senior judges to explain the effect of the not proven verdict to juries. Mr Lang also proposed new powers to increase the sentence for people who offend while on bail. The right to bail should not be available for those accused of a serious offence such as attempted murder or rape where they have a previous conviction for a serious offence. The maximum fine for breaching a condition of bail will go up from Pounds 200 to Pounds 1,000. There are also plans to increase the number of intermediate dates on which a court can decide whether a case is ready to proceed. The aim is to save the time wasted when police officers attend court to give evidence and are not called or the case fails to proceed.</p>

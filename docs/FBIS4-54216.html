			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Foreign Investment Law Revised To </F> Further Attract Investors"]    [Text] The government of the Lao People's Democratic  Republic has amended its foreign investment law to further  convince foreign investors of investment opportunities in the  country.    The amended law, which is now called the Foreign Investment  Promotion and Management Law, was endorsed by the third ordinary  session of the National Assembly (Third Legislature) held last  month. This was seen as a remarkable and positive move by the  Lao government in its economic policy which is at a new stage of  development.    The amendments to this law were intended to make it suit the  current investment climate in Lao PDR [People's Democratic  Republic]. It reflects more clearly the renovation policy of  the Lao government, and guarantees the interests of both the  investor and the government. As this law is more or less  related to the labor law, amendments were also made to the labor  law during the same session. Improving the labor law ensures  greater fairness in relations between employers and employees,  both local and foreign. In 1988, the Lao government introduced  an open-door policy of multilateral economic ties and  cooperation with foreign countries in an effort to gradually  strengthen the economy of the country along the lines of a  market-oriented economy. To help realise this policy, it  promulgated a foreign investment law in the same year which was  designed to attract investors to boost the social and economic  development of the country. A national level committee, known  as the Foreign Investment Management Committee (FIMC) was set up  under the Committee for Planning and Cooperation to promote and  manage foreign investment.    Over the past years the open-door policy and the foreign  investment law have to some extent added to the attraction of  Laos in terms of business opportunities as well as for tourists.    Investment statistics obtained from the FIMC show that in  the  three months from January to March 1994 some 43 new licensed  foreign investments coming to a total of U.S. $116 million were  made. The investments cover such sectors as agribusiness,  manufacturing, tourism, mining, construction, telecommunication,  banking, and service industries. Of the sectors, the service  industry takes the lead in terms of investment amount.    The investors are from such countries as Thailand,  Australia,  Italy, Japan, and China.    To keep foreign investment growing in the country, the Lao  government will have to ensure the effective implementation of  its newly amended foreign investment law.</p>

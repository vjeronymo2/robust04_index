			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Chemical industry spending falls CAPITAL spending by the chemical industry, which usually accounts for a sixth of UK manufacturing capital expenditure, fell 11 per cent last year to Pounds 2.176bn. Spending is expected to fall a further 10 per cent this year to Pounds 2bn, a Chemical Industries Association survey of 65 companies shows. The survey concludes that in spite of the emergence of some 'green shoots' the outlook for 1993 is another tough year, with only a slow recovery for the industry. There will be no early reversal of the industry's downward trend in investment spending, says the report. Capital expenditure is expected to rise to Pounds 2.4bn next year, but fall back to Pounds 2.15bn the following year. The south-east and East Anglia will receive the largest share of investment  -35 per cent - over the next three years, the north-west and Midlands will receive 29 per cent, the north-east and Humberside 21 per cent and the south-west 3 per cent. Wales will gain 3 per cent and Scotland 9 per cent. This high investment in the south-east reflects the predominance of spending by the pharmaceuticals industry - highly concentrated in the region. About 43 per cent of investment over the next three years will be for pharmaceuticals, 25 per cent for specialities, 23 per cent petrochemicals and plastics, 7 per cent basic organics and fertilisers and 5 per cent dyestuffs and pigments. Two years ago petrochemicals and plastics was the largest sector, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the total. The proportion of spending on the environment increased from 14 per cent of the total last year to 23 per cent by 1995. Over the next three years environmentally-related capital spending is estimated at Pounds 1.18bn, in real terms 22 per cent higher than in 1992. The proportion of that spending attributable to legislative requirements increases from 53 per cent in 1992 to 64 per cent in 1995. The association says UK companies have lost business to overseas competitors because of lack of clarity in procedures and administrative delays for the recently introduced integrated pollution control. It said there was a threat of further loss to countries where environmental and waste handling procedures were less onerous. The UK's 10 per cent fall in capital expenditure this year compares with falls of 7.5 per cent in Germany, 10 per cent in Italy, 8 per cent in Belgium, 6.5 per cent in the Netherlands, and 5 per cent in Spain.

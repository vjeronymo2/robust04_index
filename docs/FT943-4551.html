			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown Holdings On the surface the market's attitude to Hillsdown Holdings seems a bit churlish. Despite the improvements wrought by the new management - assets generating some Pounds 1bn of turnover have been sold in the last couple of years with virtually no loss in profit - Hillsdown's shares still carry a yield of more than 6 per cent. That looks high for a company which claims to have turned the corner, is now generating cash and is talking about acquisitions and higher dividends. But Hillsdown must pay the price for its failure to cut its dividend in the recession. Even now its payment is less than twice covered. Memories of the bad times will be slow to fade. After all, profits fell by more than half between 1989 and 1992. The market, too, needs more evidence of Hillsdown's ability to grow. Since there is not much sign of food price inflation in the shops, margin improvement will require tough control on costs and a judicious juggling of product mix. Recognising the need for acquisitions is one thing. Finding suitable ones is another. Hillsdown implicitly admits as much by clinging to its housebuilding assets on the grounds that it could not easily replace them with a more lucrative investment in food. Nor has the market failed to recognise the improved outlook. Hillsdown trades on a higher multiple than both Unigate and Northern Foods and has out-performed the sector by 30 per cent since the start of last year. That looks like enough for the moment. The muted reaction to yesterday's promise of resumed dividend growth suggests the proof of the pudding will be the rate of earnings expansion rather than higher payouts.</p>

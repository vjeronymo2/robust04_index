Preparations for this  day were not made in a correct manner, and this has led to the  delay.

This is attributed to the inability of the Palestinians  to assume the responsibilities for which they have been calling  for a long time.    ['Abdullah] In my view, the criticism is clear. There is  bitter criticism in the Palestinian camp. The Palestinian camp  and people were waiting for the moment of withdrawal of the  Israelis from the occupied territories, but it seems that the  leadership in Tunis has not prepared itself properly for this  moment, though it was expected that the Palestinians would  assume authority quickly.

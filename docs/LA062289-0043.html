			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY GI PLEADS GUILTY TO SPY CHARGES  </P> <P> Orange County soldier Michael A. Peri pleaded guilty Wednesday to espionage  charges for giving East German officials U.S. defense secrets and assessments  of Soviet troop strengths, saying he was "frustrated" with his military job.  </P> <P> Peri, 21, a 1985 graduate of La Quinta High School in Westminster, faces a  maximum punishment of life in prison, said Sgt. Maj. Dale McInnis, spokeswoman  for the 5th Army Corps in West Germany.  </P> <P> Appearing nervous at times during the four-hour hearing at the U.S. Army  Community Center in Fulda, West Germany, Peri told a military judge that he  crossed into East Germany on Feb. 20 because he felt overworked and  unappreciated in his job as an intelligence specialist (Spec. 4). In that job,  Peri, a member of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment based in Fulda, analyzed  Communist troop movements and electronic signals.  </P> <P> "I really didn't have a plan," Peri said, according to a report by Stars and  Stripes, the military newspaper. "My primary reason was to leave behind all the  frustrations and problems at work. Everything had been wrong. I wasn't enjoying  myself. I wanted to start over somewhere else."  </P> <P> Peri also testified that he was curious about Soviet military operations.  </P> <P> "I was looking at Soviet forces on paper, and I wanted to see it first-hand,"  he said. "That played a part in my decision."  </P> <P> Peri said he took a lap-top computer containing secret information with him  because: "It was a bargaining chip to keep them from doing something to me. It  would show them I wasn't an American plant."  </P> <P> Asked whether he realized that the information he passed to East German  officials was likely to be harmful to the United States and advantageous to  hostile nations, Peri responded, "Yes, sir." But he said he did not realize the  extent of potential damage until he was questioned by intelligence experts upon  his return to Fulda.  </P> <P> According to testimony Wednesday, secrets passed to the East Germans included  information about U.S. tank and helicopter movements along the border between  East and West Germany defense plans for West Germany, and American estimates of  Soviet military forces in East Germany.  </P> <P> Army prosecutors plan to call three intelligence experts to testify about the  potential damage to the United States and European allies during sentencing  proceedings expected to continue through Friday in Fulda.  </P> <P> The courtroom was cleared of spectators several times during Wednesday's  hearing when classified information was discussed. Among those in attendance  were Peri's parents, Fred and Winnie Peri, and his sister, Desiree, all of  Laguna Niguel. Family members were permitted to meet with Peri the night before  the hearing and again Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> The soldier was handcuffed as he was led in and out of the hearing at a  military courtroom about a quarter-mile from the Army post. All entrances to  the building were guarded during the proceedings.  </P> <P> Peri, who had been considered a model soldier, said he was angry that he had  not been permitted to accompany the rest of his unit on a survival training  mission and feared that he would not be allowed to go on a planned trip to  Spain because of his heavy workload. He told Col. Craig G. Jacobsen, the  military judge, that he had not been recruited by East German agents.  </P> <P> His testimony revealed only sketchy information about his activities and  movements during the 12 days he was missing. One of the unexplained elements  remains a train ticket from Austria, found in Peri's possession when he  surrendered.  </P> <P> Peri was reported missing Feb. 21. Fears that he had crossed into East Germany  arose two days later, when a Jeep-like vehicle he had signed out was found a  mile from the Communist border near the village of Obersuhl. He returned on  March 4, walking through the gates of the base at Fulda.  </P> <P> Peri testified that he dressed in civilian clothes and entered East Germany by  climbing a border fence. He said he walked south along a patrol route until he  was spotted by East German soldiers and taken to a nearby military post. East  German officials who did not identify themselves interrogated him in Berlin and  in several "safehouses" throughout his stay, Peri said. He said he asked to  return to the West on March 3, when the East Germans asked him if he wanted to  stay or leave.  </P> <P> In addition to the espionage charge, Peri pleaded guilty to being absent  without leave, violating an Army regulation prohibiting unauthorized travel by  soldiers within one kilometer of the border and theft of a military vehicle and  computer.  </P> <P> The guilty plea reversed Peri's previous innocent plea and followed a pretrial  agreement, the terms of which military authorities declined to disclose.  </P> <P> Peri was described by relatives in March as "a very together young man" who  followed his older brother into the Army.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A SOLDIER'S STORY  </P> <P> Michael A.

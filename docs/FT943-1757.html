			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Dalgety in Spain Dalgety, the food and agribusiness group that owns Spillers, yesterday bought two privately owned Spanish pet food companies as part of its strategy of expanding its European pet food business. Last week, announcing a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 120.1m for the year to end June, the group said it would be seeking more acquisitions in continental Europe, where it will be focusing on food ingredients and pet foods. The price of the Spanish deal was not revealed, but the group is thought to have paid close to the two companies' combined annual turnover of Pounds 17m. Their combined assets are Pounds 11m and operating profits Pounds 1.8m. Mr Richard Clothier, Dalgety chief executive, said the group had had no presence in Spain. Last year, Dalgety paid Pounds 42m for BP's Paragon Petcare, giving it access to the French, German, Dutch and Belgian markets.</p>

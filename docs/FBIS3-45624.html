			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sue Green] </F>   [Text] Fleet Street dubbed them the two generals: the  tall, tough northerner who strode about London coatless in the  cold, masterminding Labour's doomed election campaign, and the  Tory campaign chief who won the war but lost the battle, failing  to keep his own seat as his party regained power.    Now, in a twist of fate, those two men are on the same side,  pushing the Hong Kong democracy barrow.    The Labour man, Dr Jack Cunningham, a scientist-turned  politician, is Britain's shadow foreign secretary, in Beijing  this week to tell China his party won't be taking its side  against the British Government.    And the man he is lining up with, whose roof he slept under  in Hong Kong, is none other than his old campaign foe, now the  territory's Governor, Chris Patten.    "Someone asked me a very funny question at dinner the other  night," says Dr Cunningham in his broad Geordie [northeastern]  accent. "If Labour had won the election but I'd lost my seat  would I be Governor of Hong Kong?"    He doesn't know the answer. And, strictly speaking, he  cannot say for sure whether Labour will keep the present  government's Hong Kong policy--and its choice of Governor--if it  wins the British election due before 1997. But he thinks it  unwise to dump either, and unlikely: "It's difficult to  conceive of wiping the slate clean and starting again,  especially if it's 1996," Dr Cunningham says. "A Labour  Government in the future is not something I can make  declarations about now but, speaking personally, my commitment  is to these proposals and it is difficult to conceive of  circumstances in which we would throw the whole lot out. And,  for my own part, I don't think it would be sensible for us to  come in and remove the Governor, put someone else in."    Dr Cunningham says a member of Mr Patten's family was amazed  to hear him saying nice things about the Governor in a  television interview: "I said yes, you wouldn't have seen me  doing that two years ago." But two years is a long time in  politics and Dr Cunningham, who represents Copeland in Cumbria  and has been a member of parliament for 23 of his 54 years, is  well accustomed to a system in which your former foes become  your hosts. He and Mr Patten previously crossed swords when Mr  Patten was environment secretary and he was Labour's spokesman.  He sees their present roles as a curious twist of history.    He is quick to dismiss the notion that Mr Patten's high Hong  Kong profile may be aimed at furthering his political future  back home. He says a total breakdown of the China-Britain talks  on Hong Kong, withdrawal of Mr Patten's reform package,  undermining both him and Prime Minister John Major--perhaps  fatally wounding the government-- would not be a good result for  Labour. "The outcome of that is a Labour Government that has to  resolve this problem and I don't think you can do that just by  taking China's side," he says.    In fact, contrary to speculation that Chinese Embassy  lobbying of MPs in London may be weakening support for Mr  Patten's reforms, Dr Cunningham has made it clear to China he  will not be backing it against the Tories. Asked if he had been  lobbied in London, where he has met Chinese Ambassador Ma Yuzhen  and Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, he said: "Not overtly,"  then added, "no, that's not quite true." China's view during  those talks was that the Patten plan should be withdrawn. "I  think they hoped we would come to that point of view but we did  not and we have not and nothing that happened in Peking  (Beijing) would lead me to recommend that course of action to my  colleagues in London. "I regard the proposals as very modest.  It is a bit difficult to concede that this is some huge gulf  that cannot be bridged."    So, what achievements from his three days in Beijing, his  first visit, does he have to report at today's shadow Cabinet  meeting? Dr Cunningham says he learned a lot (references to his  meetings with "Mr Rongji" at his Friday press conference showed  there was definite scope to expand his knowledge of China) but  says he did not know before he went why the Sino-British talks  broke down; and he still does not know.    Those he met in China included Vice-President Li Lanqing,  Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu, and director of the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping. He has asked them to explain,  in writing just how the Patten plan conflicts with the Basic Law  and what amendments they want. "I just wanted to try to get a  clearer understanding of the Chinese reasons for this stand over  Hong Kong, the breakdown, and to make sure the Chinese were  absolutely clear about my position and that of the British  Labour Party, and to establish good personal relationships and  contacts."    As a long-time politician, strategist, and media performer,  Dr Cunningham could hardly be dubbed a straight talker. But he  is willing to be blunt where it seems due. Like Mr Patten, he  sees a conflict in the Chinese position: President Jiang Zemin  says trade and politics should remain separate, yet China is  dragging the airport issue into its political negotiations over  Hong Kong.    To allow this standoff to lead to a series of protracted  economic and trade disputes would be "pretty silly" he says.  The end result? "A series of self-inflicted wounds." And while  he says it is never too late to take up the issue of Hong Kong  democratic rights, he concedes that should have been done years  ago.    But to be fair, it was not just that British Governments did  not take the initiative--the incentive to do so in Hong Kong was  also lacking: "There's little doubt the approach of 1997 was  the single biggest stimulus," he says.    It is not certain Dr Cunningham would become Foreign  Secretary in a future Labour Government. He was given the  shadow post despite coming just 12th out of 18 in the shadow  cabinet poll. But he is a strong supporter of the Labour Leader  John Smith and obviously has hopes of getting the job "if I was  lucky enough to," he says.    If his entry in Who's Who is any sort of litmus test, Dr  Cunningham has at least one qualification for taking a key role  in the resolution of Hong Kong's future: Along with fly  fishing, fell walking, and folk music, his hobbies include  "listening to other people's opinions".</p>

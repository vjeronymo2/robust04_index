			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Biryukov] </F>   [Text] Kaliningrad 8 May TASS -- Petr Shirshov, chairman of  the Russian parliament committee on security and defence, who  was in Kaliningrad, the westernmost city of Russia, expressed  concern over difficulties raised by the Baltic states to  frustrate the normal operations of Russian troops stationed in  the Kaliningrad Region.    A delegation of the Russian parliament upper chamber he  heads  was here on a fact-finding mission to inspect combat  preparedness and every-day life of units of land troops and the  Baltic Fleet stationed here.    The delegation visited the main naval base in Baltiysk where  legislators were guests of the Nastoychivyy destroyer sailors  and marines and participated in an anniversary meeting of the  region's veterans and the public, which was devoted to the V-Day.    Delegation members discussed problems of combat training and  social programmes for troops at meetings with the leadership of  the region, the Baltic Fleet, the Army, Border Guards and  Air-Defence Forces.    Shirshov said that his trip was a followup of the recent  visit to the Kaliningrad Region by parliament's upper chamber  speaker Vladimir Shumeyko who came forth with an initiative to  set up here a combined group of troops of limited strength.    The idea was backed by the Russian Defence Ministry and is  to  be formalised legislatively. "The task of this group is to  ensure adequate combat preparedness of this Russian territory,"  Shirshov stressed.    "Nobody should doubt that it is an inalienable territory of  our country, a successor of the former Soviet Union, to which it  was transferred according to the decision of the Potsdam  Conference 50 years ago," Shirshov stressed.    The delegation departed from Kaliningrad for Moscow on  Sunday.</p>

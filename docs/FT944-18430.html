			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Rating move warning to companies Companies whose properties have dropped in value since the last business rates revaluation in 1990 will not immediately receive the full benefit in reduced rates after next year's revaluation, the Department of the Environment announced yesterday. The transitional scheme for introducing the new valuations will also put a ceiling on the amount by which companies' rates can increase. This will be fixed at 20 per cent for large properties, and 15 per cent for smaller properties. These limits will stay in force for the next five years. The government has not ruled out meeting some of the costs from public funds, but said that 'in the present climate of economic recovery' it was 'reasonable that ratepayers who stand to gain substantially from the changes should meet the costs of protecting those who face large increases'. Mr David Curry, the local government minister, pointed out that many of the 'gainers' from next year's revaluation were still receiving help from 1990's transitional scheme. He added: 'We fully accept that, because of the way the economy has moved in different parts of the country, the 1995 rates revaluation will give a very different picture to that which emerged from the 1990 revaluation.' The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the government's decision to buffer rates increases and to give extra protection to small businesses. But it said: 'We would not want the winners this time around to have to face lengthy delays before seeing the gains.' The revaluation has not yet been completed, but the government said businesses in London and the south-east are most likely to benefit from it. Companies in the Midlands and the north of England could see the greatest rises.</p>

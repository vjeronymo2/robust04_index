			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: HISTORIC NOTE TO HOLIDAYS  </P> <P> Get in tune with the Christmas spirit Sunday at a concert of holiday music  featuring a historic pipe organ. The event begins at 4 p.m. in the Piru United  Methodist Church, 227 Center St.  </P> <P> This is a rare opportunity for the public to hear the second-oldest pipe organ  in the state. Built in 1864 by William A. Johnson of Massachusetts, the  instrument was originally installed in the Eastside Presbyterian Church in  Stockton. In 1934, the organ was bought by the Warring family of Piru for the  local Methodist church.  </P> <P> Organ builder Michael McNeil of Lompoc, who did restoration work on the organ  during the 1970s, has called it "a priceless historical instrument." Organist  Roberta Palmer of Bardsdale has chosen a program of familiar seasonal melodies  and Christmas carols to showcase the special timbre of the instrument.  Admission is free and refreshments will be served after the concert.  </P> <P> Both the organ and the church are county historical landmarks, located about a  mile from California 126. Take Main Street north from the highway, and go west  one block on Center Street. For information, call 524-2697.  </P></p>

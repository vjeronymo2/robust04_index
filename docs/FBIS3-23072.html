Certain sources said the two FIS leaders were put under  house  arrest in Douera (suburb south-east of Algiers) while others  said they were in Zeralda (31 km west of Algiers).    According to the daily, other party leaders could have been  freed last week. The releases, added the daily, are part of a  general amnesty which is likely to take place before the end of  the holy month of Ramadan.</p>

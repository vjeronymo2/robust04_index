			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rob Vreeken report: "Sri Lanka Does Not Need Tamils Back"] </F>   [Excerpt] For the time being there will be no talk of Tamil  refugees returning from the Netherlands to Sri Lanka.  Negotiations on the matter with the Sri Lankan Government could  last a long time. "The bureaucracy here works very slowly  indeed," a well-informed source in Colombo said. "The  authorities would prefer not to have the Tamils return. They  feel it best that they stay abroad for a while."    In addition, the government in Colombo first wants to see  how  the agreement concluded in February between Sri Lanka and  Switzerland works out. Both countries will cooperate in the  return of two or three hundred Tamils. Expectations are that  the initial asylum seekers, whose requests for asylum have been  declined in Switzerland, will be sent back this month. The  UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] is prepared to oversee  the proper implementation of the agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

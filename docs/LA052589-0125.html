			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FURTHER USE OF KRAFT'S LIST ATTACKED;  </P> <P> DEFENSE SAYS JURY WILL JUST ASSUME HE KILLED 8 OTHERS  </P> <P> A defense lawyer argued Wednesday that the jury automatically will assume Randy  Steven Kraft is guilty of eight more murders if prosecutors are allowed to  introduce any new entries from his handwritten list.  </P> <P> "The prosecution won't need to present any other evidence," William J. Kopeny  said. "The jurors already believe that it is a death list."  </P> <P> The prosecution, which calls the list Kraft's "score card" of his victims, was  permitted to introduce 13 of its coded entries when Kraft was convicted two  weeks ago of 16 Orange County murders.  </P> <P> Now, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown wants to use more items from the list in  seeking a death verdict at Kraft's upcoming penalty hearing. They are part of  the evidence he wants to use to prove Kraft committed six murders in Oregon and  two in Michigan between 1980 and 1982.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Link to 45 Murders  </P> <P> Prosecutors have linked the 44-year-old Long Beach computer consultant to a  total of 45 sex-related murders of young men, partly by connecting them to the  list found in his car. But Brown has elected to introduce just the out-of-state  murders -- plus those for which Kraft was convicted -- at the next hearing.  </P> <P> At a penalty phase, prosecutors are allowed to introduce into evidence other  acts of violence they claim that a defendant has committed, even if he has  never been convicted of those crimes. Jurors are instructed that if they are  not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed these  acts, they are to put them out of their minds in deciding the penalty.  </P> <P> But because this jury is already sold on the prosecution's theories, Kopeny  argued, the mere introduction of these murders is all the prosecutor needs.  </P> <P> "It is totally ridiculous to assume that those jurors could put it out of their  minds" in a case this unique, Kopeny argued.  </P> <P> Kopeny called the list "the centerpiece of the prosecution's case" at the guilt  trial. It was the key reason Kraft was convicted on every single murder in the  charges, Kopeny said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Unfair and Prejudicial'  </P> <P> The defense lawyer argued that even if Kraft's lawyers could convince the jury  that the new entries do not represent the Oregon and Michigan victims, the  damage would be done. Since the jurors already believe that it is a death list,  he said in his court papers, then the jurors will think that Kraft must have  killed eight more people somewhere, even if it was not in Oregon and Michigan.  </P> <P> "It is simply unfair and prejudicial," Kopeny stated.  </P> <P> Kraft, whom prosecutors say could be the most prolific serial killer in the  country, shook his head Wednesday when Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin  suggested that prosecutors were doing him a "favor" by not trying to put the  entire list -- with its 61 entries -- into evidence.  </P> <P> McCartin began hearing a battery of defense motions Wednesday on issues to be  settled before jurors return June 5 to hear evidence. Kopeny filed four  separate motions on the issue of the so-called death list alone. Most of the  other motions are aimed at preventing Brown from introducing evidence of any  more murders at all.  </P> <P> Kopeny claims in his court papers that prosecutors are guilty of "piling on" by  adding the eight new murders, since the jurors "are already convinced Mr. Kraft  is a serial killer."  </P> <P> "The jurors have already accepted 90% of Mr. Brown's theories about this case,"  Kopeny told the court.  </P> <P> The penalty phase motions will continue today, then will resume again on June 1  and 2.  </P></p>

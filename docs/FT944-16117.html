			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Malaysian Airline seeks to boost cargo services The chairman of troubled Malaysian Airline System (MAS) will soon unveil plans aimed at cutting costs and generating new business, particularly in cargo services, officials said, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. They said Mr Tajudin Ramli would announce alliances with other airlines to increase flight frequencies, and expand the airline's cargo services. 'The alliances will increase MAS frequencies to Europe and other regions and also expand our services,' one official said. Mr Tajudin, who made his mark in Malaysia's telecommunications sector, has said previously that he planned to streamline the former state-run airline, which is south-east Asia's largest carrier. 'MAS is a profitable company and will contribute some 3 per cent to the Malaysian economy by the year 2000,' Mr Tajudin said yesterday. He hinted that his plans for the airline focused on the cargo service, saying it would benefit from Malaysia's rapid industrialisation and increasing exports. MAS made a profit of MDollars 8.43m (USDollars 3.29m) on turnover of MDollars 4.01bn in the last financial year, helped by the sale of old aircraft. The airline, with a fleet of some 90 aircraft, has also begun leasing out its excess medium-range aircraft to regional carriers.</p>

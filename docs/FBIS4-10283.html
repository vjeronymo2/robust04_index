			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santollo; from the "Radio ACIR </F> Newscast"]    [Text] In answer to questions on whether he plans to  continue as part of the pacification process, Manuel Camacho  Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas,  said the following:    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] The governor [Javier Lopez  Moreno] has told me: We are elated with just hearing you say  that there is no cease-fire process that has lasted longer than  the one in Chiapas. We acknowledge that this is a very  significant step which, during the past decade, did not occur in  any Central American nation, or with any similar armed group.  However this not the only thing we want. We are calling for  and demanding more. In this respect I say to the governor, and  at the same time answer a question that is floating around, that  yours truly has no intention of retreating to any embassy.  Yours truly plans to remain in Mexico, and wants to remain in  Chiapas because he believes that the people who are doing things  here are doing it in good faith and intelligently. Yours truly  also believes that there are issues to be solved here that are  worth solving, and because he intends to continue working for  peace. [end recording]    Without any doubt, one of the important questions  surrounding  this issue is related to when the peace talks will resume. When  will the EZLN [Zapatista National Liberation Army]; peace  mediator Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas; and  Special Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis once again sit  at a negotiating table? In this respect, Camacho Solis' reply  was as follows:    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I am also aware that this is  the most important effort we can make because by safeguarding  the negotiation process with the EZLN, and respecting their  decisionmaking process, I am sure that in the next few weeks we  will be able to take further and firm steps to ensure lasting  peace. [applause] Who will accomplish this? The peace  commissioner? No. The mediator? No. This will be accomplished  by all of us. Every individual, every household that can come up  with an answer. When abuses by the authorities are amended, then  we already have someone who is working for peace. Every  resolution by a magistrate or a judge that carries this same  spirit, is already supporting the peace process. [end recording]    Manuel Camacho Solis indicated that by adding all these  dispositions, and with the support of the president of the  republic, as well as all the political forces committed to  peace, there is no reason why progress in the Chiapas peace  process cannot be made.</p>

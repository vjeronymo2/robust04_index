			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Court action on music monopoly A music company will today seek in the High Court to enforce a monopoly of distribution of records outside the US by singers such as Johnny Cash and groups including the Black Crowes and Slayer. Phonogram, the UK unit of PolyGram, the music and film group in which Philips of the Netherlands has a majority stake, will seek to block American Recordings, the US recording label formerly known as Def American, from dealing with any other distributor for its artists outside the US. Phonogram is claiming that American Recordings has violated a joint venture agreement in which Phonogram was named as sole distributor for American's artists outside the US. The action before the High Court is a counter-suit to a Dollars 14m (Pounds 9m) action by American in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The US record label has said that Phonogram did not abide by the terms of the agreement and that the company did not promote its artists as agreed, file tax returns, pay royalties, or set up office space. American says that Phonogram improperly withdrew Dollars 4.5m from the joint venture between the two companies. It accuses Phonogram of failing to pay advances, keep separate accounts, and open separate books for the joint venture. Last month Phonogram tried to introduce into evidence a tape recording of a conversation between American Recordings executives and their lawyer to demonstrate American's motives for bringing the suit in the US. It is alleged that Phonogram obtained the tape from an unidentified 'hacker', and a High Court judge refused to allow the tape into proceedings on the grounds that it interfered with privileged communications between clients and their lawyers. Phonogram and PolyGram have refused to comment while the cases are in progress.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Arts: Don Pasquale - Opera It is unlikely that Donizetti realised what a favour he had done opera-house managements when he wrote Don Pasquale. The opera has been popular since the day it was first performed and yet, with just four singers, no need for big, expensive voices, a small chorus and modest sets, it involves less than a grand opera budget. Thus Don Pasquale is often called for. Even when the rest of Donizetti's output was mostly languishing in neglect, this well-made comic opera had a ready audience. The Royal Opera has been playing it since 1973 in the production by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, which looks more tasteful now than it did 20 years ago (how styles change]) and the opera has never failed to put across its wit and considerable charm. The present cast is a partial reconstitution from the revival of two years ago. The mainstay then was Paolo Montarsolo as Pasquale and he is back, giving every impression that he has lived the role for a lifetime. As he curls up in a favourite armchair, he really seems fond of the old fellow, comfortable in his crumpled smoking-jacket, at home in his fusty bachelor drawing-room, at ease even with his rheumaticky wheezes and slow shuffle. Montarsolo is also Italian, which helps in getting the words across. The patter in his duet with Dr Malatesta went at just about the fastest rate this production can have seen and the French baritone Francois Le Roux as the double-dealing doctor, visibly a sharp operator as quick on his feet as he was to flash a winning smile, did well to keep up with him. The two young lovers were played by Judith Howarth and Raul Gimenez, able singers both. The soprano is careful to bind one note to another and makes a Norina in whom one always has confidence, firmer of voice than many who take the role, not a flighty canary of a singer. Her whistling high F in the opera's final moments arrived without warning. Gimenez is at his best in the scene of the nocturnal tryst, where he touches upon the top notes with moon-lit delicacy. There is more opportunity for expressive singing in the bel canto style than the four singers find between them, but with Bruno Campanella providing a stylish lead from the pit the musical standard is very respectable. One change in the staging is that the cats, which were such a feature of Pasquale's household, have gone. Or perhaps this production has simply outlived them: Don Pasquale always has been an opera with nine lives. Performances continue until July 2 (Box Office 071-240 1066)</p>

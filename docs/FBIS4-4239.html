			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The best-equipped soda  ash plant in China went into operation today in Weifang, in east  China's Shandong Province, marking China's step up to the  advanced world level in the field.    It has a planned annual production capacity of 600,000 tons  of soda ash.    The plant, a key construction project of China's Seventh  Five-Year Plan (1986-1990), involved an investment of 710  million yuan and is scheduled to produce 400,000 tons of light  soda ash and 200,000 tons of heavy soda ash annually.    Its main equipment has been imported from Germany, Japan and  the United States.    The project, which was started in April 1986 and completed  in  June 1989, was built on the largest salt production base in  China -- Yangkou Salt Farm of Shandong along the Bohai Sea.    Since it was put into production on a trial basis, it has  produced more than 2.4 million tons of 100 percent pure soda  ash, which has been sold in more than 20 provinces and regions  in China and exported to 11 countries and regions.    In 1993, it produced 640,000 tons of soda ash, 80,000 tons  of  which were sold abroad, accounting for one-eighth of the  nation's total production and more than one-fifth of the  country's soda ash exports.    It has ranked among China's 500 largest industrial  enterprises for three consecutive years.</p>

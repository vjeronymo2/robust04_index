			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng hailed  today the inauguration of the Chinese Academy of Engineering  (CAE) and the opening of the seventh academicians' conference of  the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).    Addressing the inaugural meeting, the premier said that the  founding of the CAE is a major event in the scientific,  technological and engineering communities and of great  significance for China's socialist modernization drive.    He lauded the great contributions the Chinese technological  and engineering communities have made to the country's economic  construction and national defence since the founding of New  China in 1949.    Li pointed out that China has done a good job in many fields  of engineering and technology and trained large numbers of  outstanding workers in science and technology.    For this reason, the premier said, the founding of the CAE,  with outstanding experts in technological communities as its  mainstay, will have a far-reaching impact on improving their  social status, on arousing their enthusiasm and on stepping up  the country's development of engineering technology.    Li noted that the CAE is most honorable, consultative  academic organ in China's engineering communities.    He hoped that the CAE, entrusted by the central government,  will give advice and suggestions on the state's major scientific  and technological projects and programs, and on research and  studies on major development issues.    He also hoped the CAE will make active contributions to  implementing the government's policies and principles on the  work of science and technology, and to academic exchanges and  cooperation at home and abroad.    To further facilitate international exchanges and embody the  authoritative and honorary status of the CAS membership system  founded in 1955, the State Council decided to grant the CAS  members the official title of "academicians", which is an  international practice, while the academicians system will be  carried out in the CAE, the premier said.    He said the first batch of foreign academicians of the CAS  is  expected to be selected during the meeting.    Li said the concept of "science and technology is the first  productive force" put forward by Deng Xiaoping, should be  carried out unswervingly throughout the whole course of the  socialist modernization drive.    He said that attention should be paid to three things:  science and technology serving the country's economic  construction, developing the high-tech industries and  strengthening the basic studies.    The premier also highlighted the aim of reform of scientific  and technological system as the establishment of a new system  that suits the development of a socialist market economy,  accords with the law of science and builds a close tie between  science and technology and economy.    Talking about the international competition in science and  technology, Li said that the CAE and CAS, the country's two top  scientific bodies, should coordinate closely to make greater  contributions to the country's modernization drive.    He also urged the government and party leaders at all levels  to take more care of the work and life of scientists and  technical workers.</p>

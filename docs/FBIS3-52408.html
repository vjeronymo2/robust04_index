The  two sides held four sessions mostly devoted to the core issue of  Jammu and Kashmir.    Addressing a news conference in Islamabad today, Foreign  Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan said that no progress was made on  the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir at the foreign  secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan, as the two  sides have basic divergences. He said that for the first time,  most of the time was devoted to the discussion of the Kashmir  issue during all four sessions. Pakistan maintained its  principled position that a solution to the Kashmir issue lay in  a plebiscite on the basis of the UN resolutions. The Pakistan  side rejected the Indian view that the UN resolutions are no  longer relevant, and it was made clear that these resolutions  are as relevant today as they were in 1948. Khan said Pakistan  is willing to hold talks on the format for implementing the UN  resolutions, and there is no change in Pakistan's principled  stand in this connection. He said for Pakistan, the people of  Kashmir are the central players, because it is they who must  determine their future. He said the Kashmiri people should be  consulted first on this issue.    The foreign secretary said Pakistan's first demand with  regard to visible steps in Kashmir was reducing the repression  and tension and releasing the jailed Kashmiri leaders. He said  Pakistan wants the Kashmiri people to have free and unrestricted  access to the international media, human rights organizations,  members of parliament, and diplomats. He said that during the  talks both sides paid maximum attention to the Kashmir issue,  but difference of opinion persist at the same level as in the  past. He said Pakistan remains committed to continued dialogue  for the peaceful resolution of Kashmir and other issues, but in  view of the fact that the repression in Kashmir is at its height  and human rights continue to be violated there, Pakistan will  not schedule any talks at the foreign secretary level or any  other level until there is visible improvement in the occupied  Kashmir situation.    Khan said it is untrue that Pakistan is assisting the  freedom  fighters. He said Pakistan has proposed a neutral monitor of  the Line of Control to ensure and to let people see what is the  real situation on the ground. He said India did not accept this  proposal and maintained that it will monitor the situation  itself. Khan said various other bilateral matters also were  discussed. The Indian delegation told Pakistan that they will  be ready to present their detailed viewpoint on issues such as  Siachen, Sir Creek, and the Wullar Barrage within the next two  weeks.    Answering questions from the press, Indian Foreign Secretary  J.N. Dixit said he held preliminary discussions on some  suggestions which have to be considered by both sides, and that  we will see how to proceed on these suggestions. He said  despite basic divergences in views on the situation, we have  agreed to search for ways and means to solve this [Kashmir]  issue.    In the presence of Dixit Khan read a joint statement, which  says both sides recognized that there are basic divergences on  the Kashmir issue. The talks addressed all aspects of the Jammu  and Kashmir issue and it was agreed that sincere efforts will be  made to resolve it. Both sides stressed the need to engage in a  meaningful dialogue with a view to solving all outstanding  issues. The statement adds that the two sides will consult  each other on the question of further talks at the foreign  secretary level or any other level.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Observer: Keep pumping What's this? Sir Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive, endorsing Losec, the more expensive Swedish rival to Zantac - Glaxo's top selling anti-ulcer drug. In an interview with Swedish business newspaper Dagens Industri, Sir Richard says: 'It is not always best to prescribe the cheapest medicine. With chronic stomach problems one often gets better results with treatment by an acid-pumper like Losec.' No doubt Sir Richard was just displaying his normal clinical honesty. But Astra, the maker of Losec, is not impressed. It says that something has been lost in the translation. Its anti-ulcer drug is not an acid-pumper (Syrapumpare) but a Syrapumphammare - a 'proton pump inhibitor'.</p>

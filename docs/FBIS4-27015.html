			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Improved trade and  Chile's intended support for the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) were the main topics at a meeting between  Chilean President Eduardo Frei and U.S. President Bill Clinton  in Washington today.    After the White House session Clinton told reporters that  Chile's success in handling democracy and its economic growth  made it a potentially important trading partner with the U.S.    During talks with U.S. businessmen this morning, President  Frei emphasized that any future negotiations about a free trade  agreement with the United States or whether Chile plans to join  NAFTA, will be considered taking into account the country's  strategy for increasing investment and developing exports.    Clinton, meanwhile, said that it was most important for the  U.S. Congress to approve the development of relations with Chile  so that the negotiations for NAFTA membership can be speeded up.</p>

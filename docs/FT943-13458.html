			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (7): The bubble that burst - Finance houses start to pick up the pieces The last few years have revealed a simple but unpalatable truth about Japan's financial institutions. Though they rank as the largest companies of their sector in the world by almost any measure, their strength was never commensurate with their size. Banks and brokers have been brought low by the bursting of the bubble that inflated them in the late 1980s. Both look set for a long period of reconstruction. The banks boast that the last year was a watershed in the struggle to discharge the bad loans of the bubble period. In their annual reports for the year ended March 31 in May, most of the major city banks, trust banks, and long-term credit banks declared that the worst of the problems were over. All 21 banks announced sharp falls in profits as a result of heavy provisioning for bad debts. As Mr Kensuke Uchida, director for corporate planning at Sumitomo Bank puts it: 'Our policy of provisioning for bad debts means that this year will mark the end of the adjustment process.' The main piece of evidence to support the claim is that total disclosed nonperforming loans actually declined from September 1993, implying that last autumn banks scaled the peak of the bad debt mountain. But more important is the fact that the banks' loan loss reserves surged as the companies finally grasped the bad loans nettle. Declared non-performing loans now stand at a total of Y12.5 trillion, with specific loan loss reserves at Y3 trillion. Banks have thus now made bad loan provisions for 24 per cent of the total of disclosed nonperforming loans, up from 16 per cent last year. This is a significant step in the clearing up process and if it told the whole story would be an encouraging development. But it is, of course, only part of the overall picture. Banks' disclosed nonperforming loans include only those to bankrupt borrowers and those on which no interest has been paid for six months or more. They do not include 'restructured' loans, where interest rates have been pared to the bone to keep troubled borrowers alive. Last month Mitsubishi Bank gave the first tantalising glimpse of the real scale of the problem when it became the only Japanese bank to release its accounts under US accounting rules. They showed nonperforming loans to be twice the level declared in Japan. Furthermore, even some of the improvement recorded in the figures for last year is illusory. Last year banks sold Y3.3 trillion of their worst loans to a newly established institution, the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Council (CCPC). The CCPC helps banks 'dispose' of their bad loans by buying them at a discount. The banks write off the remaining charge. But the banks have to lend the money to the CCPC to enable it to buy the loans in the first place, so the risk, if the CCPC fails to dispose of the collateral, remains with the banks. The really bad news is that so far the CCPC has collected just one per cent of the value of the loans it has bought. And the average discount at which the CCPC buys the loans has been increasing sharply - last month it reached over 70 per cent. If it fails to dispose of the loans it has bought, the banks will have further provisioning to do. These two factors lead most analysts to estimate that Japanese banks' actual total problem loans are roughly twice the disclosed amount - more than Y25 trillion, or at least 6 per cent of total loans. That will require significantly higher write-offs, and, consequently, several more years of sluggish profits. According to IBCA, the bank credit-rating agency, 'it will take another two or three years for the average bank to clean up its balance sheet by using operating profits and hidden reserves'. But perhaps even more disturbing for the longer term is a growing weakness in the banks' underlying performance. Pre-provision operating profit declined for the first time in three years last year as interest rates fell close to the bottom of the current cycle, and non-interest-related revenue registered sharp falls in profits from forex and bond dealing. In fact, stripping away the various layers that disguise the weakness of the core performance, the only source of profits from which to offset the large loan loss provisions remains sales of equities. Once again the major banks are forced to rely on a rising stock market to support their profitability. At least the country's four major stockbrokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko - managed to record increases in pretax profits last year. But the earnings recovery was weak, and from an unprecedentedly low base Nomura, the largest stockbroker in the world, saw pretax profits rise to nearly Y50bn, down from almost Y500bn in 1989-90. But for the middle-sized and smaller brokers it was another difficult year. Nearly half of all brokers listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange recorded pretax losses. The principal problem they face is heavy dependence on equity commissions. Even the Big Four earn a third of their operating revenue in this way. For many of the smaller firms the figure is over 50 per cent. They are thus heavily vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of investor interest in the market. The last year has seen daily turnover on the TSE recovering slightly from post-bubble blues, but at 368m shares per day, it is still nearly 100m shares per day lower than the break even point for most brokers. Getting that breakeven point down has been the key task for most, and cost-cutting has been carried further in the sector than in most other parts of the economy. Staff levels for the industry are down by 22 per cent to 129,000 from the peak of 167,000 in 1991. The need to cut costs is made more urgent by the threat posed by deregulation. In the last year, three banks have established broking subsidiaries and later this year a further half dozen are expected to do so. Though the banks are prohibited from trading equities, their underwriting buiness is eating into the brokers' revenue base. The large banks and brokers have sufficient capital to see themselves through several more years of difficulties. But some smaller banks and brokers have very little room for manoeuvre. The Ministry of Finance is anxious to avoid collapses and is likely to try to organise a rescue through merger should a failure come. But this approach is itself symptomatic of Japan's problems. The financial institutions have operated for too long on the assumption that they would not be allowed to fail - hardly a major incentive to greater efficiency. They claim that current problems are merely the backwash of the collapse of the bubble economy. But as the excesses of the 1980s recede further into the past, the truth is that many companies never were world-class competitors. The last few difficult years have merely exacerbated their problems; they did not create them.</p>

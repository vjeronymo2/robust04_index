			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Selivanov in the "Ukraine" column: "To </F> Break Is Not To Build. Kiev Is Trying To Torpedo the CIS  Collective Security System"]    [Text] A recent visit to Kiev by Estonia Defense Minister  Indrek Kannik continued the series of Ukraine's bilateral  military contacts with various CIS states. His Ukrainian  counterpart Vitaliy Radetskyy promised the Estonian minister to  share some of Ukraine's surplus arms. That there is really  something to share is proved by a figure cited in his time by  Colonel General Boris Pyankov, Russian Federation deputy defense  minister: There are 15 million automatic small arms alone in  Ukraine's arsenals. A little earlier a representative  delegation led by Col. Gen. Ivan Oleynik, Ukraine deputy defense  minister, visited Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. During the talks  with the leadership of the national armies in these countries,  expansion of bilateral military collaboration was discussed. In  particular Ukraine expressed its readiness to resolve the  question of returning to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan their  military equipment which since the disintegration of the Union  has stayed at Ukraine's maintenance factories. Right at the  negotiating table, the Kiev paper HOLOS UKRAYINY reports, orders  were issued to prepare military trains for shipment. The  Ukrainian side expressed the readiness not only to make  available its maintenance facilities to the Uzbekistan and  Kazakhstan military departments but also to upgrade their  existing armaments. For its part, Ukraine showed interest in  ensuring the maintenance of its military transport aircraft at  Uzbekistan enterprises.    Commenting on the results of the Ukraine Defense Ministry  delegation's visit to the Central Asian countries, the Ukrainian  press states with satisfaction that the sides have come to an  understanding that full-scale relations between their military  departments should be formalized by direct treaties on military  cooperation at head of state level. Such an unequivocal accent  on the bilateral character of military ties promoted by Ukraine  is seen by observers as Kiev's attempt to thwart Moscow's  efforts to create a collective security system. The Ukrainian  leaders read into the latter primarily "the imperial ambitions"  of Russia which, in their opinion, is seeking to turn the other  CIS countries into its exclusive "sphere of influence." Kiev is  concerned that some of the former Soviet republics are showing  increasing readiness to be inside such a "sphere," which will  allow them substantially to improve both their financial and  economic and military-political situation.    Ukraine, whose leadership treasures above all its  independence from Moscow, is running the risk of finding itself  in a military- political isolation that can hardly be offset  even by its participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace  program. It is hard to imagine that the "counter-game" played  by Kiev, whose ultimate goal is to torpedo the "pro-Moscow"  collective security system and to surround Russia with a kind of  "cordon sanitaire" formed with states minimally linked to it,  would be crowned with success. The geopolitical contestants'  weight categories are too different and moreover, the situation  of the Kiev regime, oriented toward "super-independence," is  such that hardly anyone in the CIS would wish seriously to get  involved with it.    In any event, Ukraine failed to engage into an anti-Russian  military political game Georgia and Azerbaijan which, in spite  of Kiev's readiness to continue to render them the broadest  possible military assistance, nonetheless preferred to develop  relations with Moscow, including joining the CIS and agreeing to  the deployment of Russian military bases on their territory.</p>

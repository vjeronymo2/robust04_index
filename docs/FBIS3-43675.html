			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The latest statements by Pedro Maria Tonha Pedale,  the man who took over as the Popular Movement for the Liberation  of Angola-Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] defense minister thanks to the  massacres he was able to carry out against the Angolan people,  were today described by Angolan observers as being irresponsible  and of a militarist nature. Those observers say that Pedale  lacks universal democratic values. Instead, he prefers to  sacrifice the national interest in exchange for the benefits he  receives from Luanda's Futungo de Belas. Those observers see  Pedale as a real criminal. They say that the special forces  which concluded their military training yesterday were not  trained to kill more South Africans or Zairians. They have been  trained to attack the people and the opposition. They invited  Pedale to define the type of democracy pursued by the MPLA-PT as  its air force continues to kill Angolan people. Those observers  also said that the MPLA-PT is waging war against the very people  it claims to represent and they add that such a war can never be  regarded as democratic.</p>

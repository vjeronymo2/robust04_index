			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING SANDINISTAS KICK OFF ELECTION CAMPAIGN;  </P> <P> CONVENTION IN MANAGUA NOMINATES ORTEGA FOR PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY BALLOT  </P> <P> With an American-style political convention and the slogan "Everything Will Be  Better," the Sandinista National Liberation Front opened its electoral campaign  Sunday by choosing President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez to  run for reelection next Feb. 25.  </P> <P> After a daylong debate among 1,700 party delegates, the Great Convention of the  People also adopted a platform endorsing the revolutionary government's recent  turn toward fiscal conservatism and export-led growth to revive the country's  shattered economy.  </P> <P> The festive mood in Managua's modern convention center, animated by live folk  music and hundreds of balloons, was a reflection of the Sandinistas' enormous  advantage over the 14-party coalition led by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the  strongest of nine opposition candidates.  </P> <P> Clad in red and black neckerchiefs and armed with noisemakers, the delegations  of blue-collar workers, farmers, combat veterans, war widows and other interest  groups came from a Sandinista network of "mass organizations" that reaches into  nearly every town and neighborhood and dwarfs the opposition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Party of Militants'  </P> <P> "In other countries, there are more sophisticated ways of campaigning, but ours  is a party of militants," said Bayardo Arce, the convention chairman. "They  give their evenings and weekends to the party. They are always campaigning, and  this is our principal asset."  </P> <P> It was with this edge in mind that the Bush Administration proposed last week  to spend $9 million on the election campaign here, some in direct assistance to  Chamorro's war chest and the rest on poll-watcher training and get-out-the-vote  drives that will indirectly help the opposition.  </P> <P> The Sandinistas begin the campaign with a nearly 2-to-1 lead in independent  opinion polls, with about 40% of the electorate still undecided. They have  already begun an intense door-to-door campaign, seeking to identify and win  over the uncommitted, and they are counting on contributions from 40,000 active  party members, who give 4% of their salaries to the party.  </P> <P> Ortega, 43, who led the decade-old government as junta coordinator before his  election as president in 1984, is consistently the most popular candidate in  the polls.  </P> <P> He and Ramirez, a 47-year-old novelist and intellectual, were first nominated  last May in an unpublicized meeting of the nine-man Sandinista National  Directorate, of which Ortega is a member, and the two were ratified by  acclamation at the end of the Managua convention Sunday.  </P> <P> In a tribute to Ortega's growing personal stature in a collective leadership,  Interior Minister Tomas Borge, his longtime political rival, gave the  nominating address.  </P> <P> "The wisdom of collegial leadership has worked with success in the peculiar  conditions of Nicaragua, but we do not deny the role of individuals," Borge  said. "Who has run all over the world, tirelessly defending our point of view?  Who has visited every corner of our country, facing the people and listening  with infinite patience to complaints, demands and criticism?  </P> <P> "Who? Him!" Borge declared, pointing to Ortega, who sat near him on the dais.  Then the two men embraced.  </P> <P> Throughout the day, delegates wore T-shirts reading "Daniel Presidente," a sign  of the convention's rubber-stamp role.  </P> <P> But Sandinista leaders used the unprecedented public gathering -- and the weeks  of intense consultations that preceded it -- to promote grass-roots  participation in other decisions by the party, which is still evolving from its  origin as a guerrilla army obedient to its comandantes.  </P> <P> "The Sandinista Front is not a secret society, and this is not a secret  meeting," Ortega said. "This is an example of democracy."  </P> <P> The proceedings were open to the press and broadcast live on Radio Sandino, the  ruling party's station. Some delegates rose to sing, recite poetry or otherwise  praise the party leadership, but others offered blunt criticism.  </P> <P> In the process, about half of the incumbents were dropped from the slate of 180  Sandinistas nominated as candidates for the National Assembly, and several  proposals were added to a platform drafted by party leaders -- among them calls  for greater spending on universities and a more progressive tax structure.  </P> <P> The platform is more specific than the opposition's in promising progress. It  sets goals of 5% annual economic growth -- with 6,000 new houses, 1,000 new  classrooms and 600 new buses per year -- and promises a massive literacy  crusade like the one conducted in 1980.  </P> <P> Party officials said these goals are based on assumptions that Ortega will win,  that the election will be widely perceived as fair, that the war with the  U.S.-backed Contras will not resume and that Washington will eventually offer  to renew economic assistance cut off in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> The platform calls for a "respectful agreement" between the Sandinistas and the  United States.  </P></p>

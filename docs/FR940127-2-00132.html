			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Separate Accounts will use the securities redeemed in-kind and the cash proceeds received on redemption of the World Income Portfolio's shares to purchase shares of the Government Securities Portfolio. The World Income Portfolio will process the redemption request, and the Government Securities Portfolio will process the purchase order, at prices based on the current net asset values next computed after receipt of the request and order and, therefore, in a manner consistent with Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 22c&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. Investments of Contractowners in the Separate Accounts will at all times be fully invested, the value of such investments will not be changed by the Substitution, and the investment by the Government Securities Divisions of the Separate Accounts will not be diluted. On the business day following the Substitution, or as soon thereafter as is consistent with the stated purposes of the proposed transaction, Equitable Variable will redeem entirely for cash shares of the World Income Portfolio constituting its seed money. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Contractowners will bear none of the transaction costs triggered by the redemption in connection with the Substitution. The full net asset value of the redeemed shares held by the Separate Accounts will be reflected in the Contractowners' unit values following the Substitution. Any costs of liquidating the assets of the World Income Portfolio for the redemption that is part of the Substitution will be reflected in the next asset value at which Equitable Variable subsequently redeems its shares of that Portfolio. All other expenses of the Substitution will be borne by Equitable Variable and Alliance. Accordingly, the costs associated with the Substitution will not be borne, directly or indirectly, by the Contractowner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Contractowners will be given prior notice of the proposed Substitution and will have the option of transferring the portion of the value of their contract (``Policy Value'') allocable to the World Income Portfolio to any other Portfolio of the Hudson Trust, without charge. Otherwise, amounts allocated to the World Income Portfolio will be transferred to the Government Securities Portfolio, also without charge. All contractowners have received a prospectus describing the policies of the Hudson Trust and its Portfolios and have all information needed to make a decision with respect to reallocating the respective portion of their Policy Value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within five (5) days after the Substitution, Equitable Variable also will send to Contractowners indirectly investing in the World Income Portfolio written notice of the Substitution indicating that shares of the World Income Portfolio have been eliminated and shares of the Government Securities Portfolio have been substituted. Equitable Variable will include in such mailing a supplement to the prospectus of the Hudson Trust that discloses the completion of the Substitution or an updated prospectus, as appropriate. Contractowners will be advised in the Second Notice that they may transfer the Policy Value allocable to the Government Securities Portfolio, as substituted, to any other available Divisions investing in the other Hudson Trust Portfolios, without limitation, without charge and at any time. The Substitution will not be counted as a transfer under any contractual provisions of the Equitable Variable Contracts that limit allowable transfers. Following the Substitution, Contractowners will be afforded the same contract rights that they currently have, including surrender and other transfer rights with regard to amounts invested under the Equitable Variable Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis_Section 26(b) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Applicants request that the Commission issue an order under sections 17(b) and 26(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the substitution of shares of the Government Securities Portfolio for shares of the World Income Portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such substitution. The Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Equitable believes the Substitution is consistent with the interests of the owners of the Contracts. Both Portfolios have the same underwriter and investment adviser. Notwithstanding investments in different instruments, their investment objectives are substantially similar in that each seeks high current income consistent with relative stability of principal through investment in fixed income securities. Additionally, management fees indirectly paid by the Contractowners after the Substitution will be lower than those incurred prior to the Substitution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Additionally, the Substitution is expected to confer economic benefits on Contractowners because: (a) The World Income Portfolio's expenses and net redemptions are expected to make it increasingly difficult for that Portfolio to achieve competitive results; (b) operation of the consolidated Affected Portfolios will result in economies of scale and reduced operating expenses as a result of lower management fees paid by the Government Securities Portfolio; and (c) the size of the Government Securities Portfolio, its competitive return and its historically higher total return and yield suggest that it will offer a more favorable opportunity for achieving a substantially similar investment objective with more competitive results that the World Income Portfolio has been able to achieve, relative to other competitive funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Contracts reserve to Equitable Variable the right to replace the shares of one Hudson Trust Portfolio held by the Separate Accounts with shares of another Hudson Trust Portfolio or with another registered investment company, subject to Commission approval. The substitution right is disclosed in the Separate Accounts' prospectuses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Contractowners will incur no transfer fees in connection with the Substitution. The Substitution will have no adverse federal income tax consequences for the Contractowners. Additionally, the Substitution will in no way alter the insurance benefits to Contractowners or the contractual obligations of Equitable Variable. Contractowners will continue to look to Equitable Variable with regard to their rights under the Equitable Variable Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicants consent to the following terms of and the conditions to the issuance of an order granting an exemption under section 26(b): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Shares of the Government Securities Portfolio will be substituted for shares of the World Income Portfolio, whose investment objective is substantially similar to the investment objective of the Government Securities Portfolio; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

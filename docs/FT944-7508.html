			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Observer: Sheepish Pfizer, the US drugs company, has just paid Dollars 1.45bn for SmithKline Beecham's animal health business which includes a thriving sideline in 'swine and companion animal vaccines'. Come, come, Pfizer. If you are going to call a pet a 'companion animal', surely a swine should be an ungulate omnivorous mammal. Even swine have feelings.</p>

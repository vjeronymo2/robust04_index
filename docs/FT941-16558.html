			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / US in BCCI deal with Abu Dhabi The US has reached a deal with Abu Dhabi that settles some of the counterclaims on the assets of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International and gives US prosecutors access for the first time to a key BCCI executive. Representatives of the US Justice Department, the New York district attorney and the Federal Reserve Board, as well as trustees for First American, the US bank illegally controlled by BCCI, agreed on Saturday to drop a civil lawsuit against Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and BCCI's majority shareholder. They also agreed not to pursue any criminal charges against Sheikh Zayed. The charges have provoked a diplomatic controversy, with Sheikh Zayed claiming sovereign immunity. In exchange, Abu Dhabi agreed to give up claims on Dollars 400m (Pounds 270m) lent to the money-losing First American, and its 28 per cent stake in the Washington-area bank, and to make available to US prosecutors Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the second-ranking manager of BCCI, who has been under house arrest pending charges in the Gulf emirate. Justice Department officials yesterday said Mr Naqvi could be brought to the US within four months. Abu Dhabi has also agreed to give US investigators complete access to BCCI documents and to allow them to question 10 former bank employees being held in the country. According to reports, the Dollars 400m recovered under the deal will be split between the US government and BCCI depositors, with some of the money used to provide severance pay to First American employees and some to pay for the continuing civil lawsuits brought by First American's trustees against other defendants. A spokesman for the Abu Dhabi government said last night: 'We have always been keen to give assistance to BCCI creditors.' US and New York prosecutors have failed ignominiously in their efforts to pursue the fallout from BCCI's failure in 1991. Mr Robert Altman, a Washington lawyer who was accused of serving as a cat's paw for BCCI in its takeover of First American, was acquitted by a New York jury on charges of bank fraud, and similar charges against Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary and Mr Altman's partner, were dropped. Prosecutors have said that their inability to question Mr Naqvi, top assistant to BCCI founder Agha Hassan Abedi, has impeded their efforts. The United Arab Emirates has issued a formal summons to bring Mr Abedi to trial for his alleged role in the bank's failure, Reuter reports from Abu Dhabi. Mr Abedi, 71 and in ill health, is believed to be living in Karachi. He and 12 other former executives of the bank he founded in 1972 face charges and civil suits worth up to Dollars 10.2bn in Abu Dhabi.</p>

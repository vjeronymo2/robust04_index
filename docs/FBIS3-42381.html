Afanasyev under the rubric "Information for </F> Reflection": "Reusable Spacecraft"]    [Text] After the completion of the Apollo moon  program at the beginning of the 1970s, the U.S. National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department  of Defense launched the design engineering of the Space Shuttle  reusable space transport system (MTKS). The decision was made in  the USSR to create a transport system for analogous purposes in  order to preserve parity, although the conceptual framework for  air/space craft had begun to be developed here before the  Americans--since the beginning of the 1960s.  <H6>  Space Shuttle </H6>   Crew. Two astronaut/pilots and up to five flight  specialists.    Composition. The Space Shuttle MTKS has an orbital  aircraft (OS), an external fuel tank (VTB) and two solid-fuel  launch boosters (STU), sometimes called the first stage. The  sole non-reusable element of the system is the VTB.    Flight configuration. The three propulsion ZhRDs  [liquid-fuel rocket engines] of the OS and STU are ignited from  the moment of launch. The MTKS is launched vertically. The spent  STUs separate from the VTB and drop into the Atlantic Ocean by  parachute. The OS continues flight using its own propulsion  ZhRDs, and after the fuel in the VTB is expended the tank  separates from the OS and burns up in the atmosphere. The  aircraft is brought into orbit using the ZhRD of the orbital  maneuvering system (SOM), which operates using storable  hypergolic fuel. The MTKS is controlled on the injection section  by rolling the propulsion ZhRDs in swivel suspensions and  deflecting the STU nozzles in an elastomeric (flexible) bearing.  The OS is controlled in orbit by the ZhRDs of the low-thrust  rocket control system (RSU), which operates, like the SOM  engines, using storable hypergolic fuel and is installed in the  nose and in two rear sections. The OS, upon completion of  orbital operations, is slowed by the SOM engines, enters the  atmosphere and makes an aerodynamic controlled descent, a glide  and a horizontal landing with inoperative engines. The RSU are  used when leaving orbit and flying in the upper layers of the  atmosphere, and the aerodynamic control surfaces enter into  operation to the extent of the descent of the OS. The crew  pilots the OS on the glide and landing legs.    Design. The wing is a low-mounted delta wing with  dual sweep on the leading edge, split ailerons on the trailing  edge and without any means of mechanization. The fuselage is a  semimonocoque design with flat sides. It consists of three  parts--the nose holds a two-level airtight cockpit for the crew  and a compartment for the electronics gear, the middle has a  non-airtight cargo bay (OPN), under which runs the central  torsion box of the wing, and in the rear is the compartment for  the main engine installation (ODU), the SOM nacelles and the  swept tail with a split rudder. The lower portion of the rear  tail section has a balancing flap under the fuselage, which  plays the role of an air brake along with the rudder during  landing. The airframe was constructed principally of aluminum  alloys. The doors of the OPN and the fairing of the SOM nacelles  are manufactured of graphite-epoxy composite materials (KM); the  strength elements of the tail fin are made of boron-aluminum KM,  and the seating frame for the main ZhRDs of boron- epoxy KM; the  housing of the high-pressure tanks and some of the trunk lines  are made of Kevlar-epoxy resin type organic fibers.    Thermal protection of OS is passive, and covers  almost the entire surface of the craft. The most heat-stressed  locations on the OS--the tips of the fuselage and the wing--are  covered with reinforced carbon-carbon type KM, followed by  plates of silicon dioxide with a boron-silicate coating with  heat-resistant additives that are black in color protecting the  lower surfaces of the fuselage and the wing, as well as its tips  and trailing edge. White plates of silicon dioxide fibers with a  boron-silicate coating are installed on the upper surfaces of  the wing and fuselage, the tail fin and the SOM nacelles. The  least heat-stressed locations--the OPN doors, upper surface of  the wing and sides of the fuselage and SOM nacelles--are  protected with mats of nylon fiber covered with an organic  silicon resin.    Engine installations. The main engine installation  consists of three SSME oxygen-hydrogen propulsion ZhRDs from the  firm of Rocketdyne, with a thrust of 170 tones of force each on  Earth or 213 tons in a vacuum. The engines have a self-contained  configuration (both components enter the combustion chamber in  gaseous form), with the reheating of spent turbogas in  high-pressure combustion chambers, installed on the OS and fed  from the VTB. The two solid-fuel launch boosters from the firm  of Morton-Thiokol mounted along the sides of the VTB have a  thrust of 1,203 tons of force at sea level.    The power plant of the OS consists of three batteries of  hydrogen-oxygen fuel elements and three hydrazine auxiliary  power plants used to steer the main ZhRDs, as well as to control  the aerodynamic surfaces and the landing gear.    Status. The Space Shuttle MTKS had made 53 flights  as of January 1993. Six OS were built--the Enterprise (employed  as an analogue of the OS for horizontal flight testing), the  Columbia, the Challenger (lost in the catastrophe of January  1986), the Atlantis, the Discovery and the Endeavour. The system  continues to be in service.    Additional information. The existing configuration  of the MTKS was chosen in 1974. The flight testing started in  April of 1981.    The MTKS is currently employed for deliveries to space,  supporting astronauts in orbit and returning especially valuable  payloads to Earth, but the Department of Defense had decided by  the end of 1992 to refrain from the use of the MTKS to put  military payloads into orbit, and to use the non-reusable launch  vehicles of the Titan family for this purpose.  <H6>  Energiya/Buran </H6>   Crew. Two to four cosmonaut/pilots and up to six  flight specialists.    Composition. The Energiya/Buran MTKS includes the  Energiya launch vehicle (four Zenit-1 launch boosters and a  central second-stage unit), which is able to put various  payloads and the Buran orbital vessel (OK) into orbit. The OK  and the launch boosters are the reusable elements of the system.    Flight configuration. At the moment of launch the  MTKS includes the four RD-0120 oxygen-hydrogen engines of the  central unit and the four RD-170 oxygen-kerosene engines of the  boosters. Launch is vertical. The boosters separate from the  central unit after finishing their operation, make a parachute  descent in the atmosphere and land. The central unit ceases  operation before reaching the nominal orbit, separates from the  OK and is destroyed on entering the dense layers of the  atmosphere. The OK is brought up to orbit using two  oxygen-kerosene ZhRDs of the SOM system. The MTKS is controlled  during this ascent stage by steering the combustion chambers of  the ZhRDs in the central unit and the boosters on their bearing  suspensions. Low-thrust oxygen- kerosene ZhRDs mounted in the  nose and two in the rear RSU units control the OK in orbit.  After the completion of orbital operations, the SOM engine  issues a braking impulse, and the OK enters the atmosphere,  makes an aerodynamic controlled descent, glides and make a  horizontal landing with non-operating engines. The RSUs are used  when leaving orbit and in the upper layers of the atmosphere,  with the aerodynamic control surfaces coming into action to the  extent of the descent of the OK. The OK can be controlled on the  glide and landing legs either by the crew or automatically.    Design of the OK. The Buran is in principle  analogous to the OS of the Space Shuttle by and large, but its  wing is shifted forward somewhat. The tail section of the  fuselage, aside from the rudder and flap under the fuselage, has  the SOM engine installation, RSU units and a pod with the  braking parachute.    Thermal protection of the OK is passive and  plated. The tips of the fuselage and wing are covered with a  carbon-carbon type reinforced KM, with the less heat-stressed  places having plates of sintered quartz fiber with a protective  coating. The thermal protection of the Buran OK, as opposed to  the American craft, is "all-weather"--it can withstand rain and  hail.    Engine installations. The principal ZhRDs of the  launch vehicle and the ship are executed in a self-contained  configuration (hydrogen comes into the combustion chamber in  gaseous form, and the oxygen in liquid form) with the reheating  of spent turbogas in the combustion chambers under high  pressure. The RD-170 engines have a thrust of 740 tonnes of  force each, the RD-0120s 156 tonnes each (205 in a vacuum) and  the SOM ZhRDs 8,500 tonnes in a vacuum.    The power plant of the Buran OK is analogous to that of the  Space Shuttle OS.    Status. The Energiya launch vehicle has made two  flights--15 May 1987 with a Skif-DM (Polyus) module as the  payload, and 15 November 1988 with the Buran OK without  cosmonauts. The OK No. 1 had been mothballed by the start of  1993, with the OK No. 2 prepared for orbital flight; the  manufacture of OK No. 3 has been curtailed.    Additional information. The decree on the  development of the Energiya/Buran MTKS came out in February 1976  after the cancellation of the N1-L3 program. The manufacture of  five Buran OKs had been proposed. The MTKS was to meet the  country's needs for the placement into orbit of medium and heavy  payloads for civilian and military purposes, with the return of  some of them to Earth.    A special version of the VM-T bomber, which provided for the  separate transport of the launch vehicle and the OK on an  external hanger over the aircraft fuselage, was created in order  to transport the larger elements of the system from the  manufacturing plant to the engineering positions. The An-225  Mriya heavy-lift transport aircraft was later created for these  same purposes.    Smaller models of the OK (the BOR-4 and BOR-5) launched  using  the Kosmos launch vehicle were used to try out the aerodynamics  and thermal protection of the craft in the range of high  hypersonic speeds.    Flight testing of the Energiya/Buran has been halted, owing  to the cutbacks in appropriations and the loss of interest in  the program on the part of the Ministry of Defense. A  non-piloted flight of Buran OK No. 2 is being proposed for 1993,  with the subsequent mothballing of all of the MTKSs until such  time as spheres for its efficient utilization are found.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bernadeta Waszkielewicz and Pawel Reszka: </F> "`Solidarity' Is Weakened, OPZZ Will Not Act Against the  Government"]    [Text] After the weekend, which was dominated by trade  unions -- "Solidarity" ["S"] staged a demonstration and the  All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] held its Third Congress  -- the government can be satisfied. As a result of the protest,  which began in February, "S" has become considerably weaker. In  OPZZ Ewa Spychalska is the top dog, and it has become clear that  the union will neither leave the Democratic Left Alliance nor  organize any protests against the present government.    The demonstration of "S" was attended by...  <H5>  Fewer Unionists </H5>   ...than had been announced by the union's leaders. "All of  Poland will go there," they said; during the demonstration they  stated that there certainly are as many of them as there were in  the February rally. At that time 27,000 persons participated in  the demonstration; on 27 May there were fewer persons.    It seemed that after the strikes, which were not so great,  not "nationwide," not so "general," after the lost battles with  the government, "S" would like to attract as many persons as  possible to the demonstration heading for the premises of the  Office of the Council of Ministers; it seemed that it would want  to do that to show its strength and to shake its fist at the  government -- for the last time before the second stage of the  protest action. This is not what actually happened, though.  One can claim, of course, that it is not "S" itself that is to  blame for what went wrong -- because for example, the General  Directorate of the Polish State Railroads made the consequences  of the strike of the railroads workers easier to endure for the  people. It is also possible that, as Krzaklewski says, "if  there had been a strike fund in every enterprise, every second  company would have stopped work"; it is possible that to blame  are "the people with portfolios, travelling all over the country  and putting out strikes with pay raises"; it is also possible  that work forces and the trade union itself are simply  responsible and know which enterprises can go on strike, for how  long, and when. One thing that is certain is that the leaders...  <H5>  Were Saying More Than Was Actually Happening. </H5>   They discredited themselves and their actions by referring  to  short breaks in work, rallies, and collections of money for the  strike fund as "nationwide and general" actions.    "They should not have come here all the way from Gdansk and  have said at rallies: We will force the authorities to pay for  the strike," said one mining activist. Lignite mines extracted  this pay "from the throats of the authorities," and so did zinc  and lead mines, probably resorting to threats, because they  suspected that the "S" leadership is too weak and the  authorities of the Republic of Poland are too strong.    Hard coal miners agreed to join the strike, but supported  only the demands of their own branch -- they did not back the  slogan "a million for the bottom, a half million for the top."  It seemed that when they get what they want and achieve  political success, they will resign themselves to the lack of  pay for the strike. On the other hand, the government has  always paid and this was promised by the "top" of "S." There  was no fund, no support; the promises turned out to be empty.  Therefore, miners, just as many other enterprises in Poland,  felt deceived by their own people. They were not numerously  represented at the demonstration -- only the representatives of  several mines participated in it. There were fewer people  because...  <H5>  Since January They Had Already Become Tired </H5>   ...of the action, which was constantly being discussed.  Those who did come, however, were more determined and more than  ever had their gaze fixed on the chairman, who "folded up the  umbrella," cut the union off from parties, politicians, and the  president.    In the meantime, there are rumors that Silesia -- the main  force of the union -- is getting ready to have certain things  explained. Less than fifty percent of all mines took part in the  strike. The present heads of the regions and of the mining  secretariat at first implemented the decisions of the National  Committee; however, toward the end of the action they showed  impatience. All the other mines are said to sympathize with the  former authorities; therefore, in the present strikes strength  in bargaining about the region's stand was shown.    The second stage of the "S" protest action consisted of  "legal interventions" in all establishments; the union started  this stage weaker than it was before the strikes; it found  itself helplessly asking the question: What should be done next?    Let us now analyze...  <H5>  What Happened at Third OPZZ Congress. </H5>   It is worth recalling that last year Ewa Spychalska gave the  government from three to six months to begin implementing the  election program. OPZZ stressed the necessity for full  valorization of disability and retirement pensions, as well as  the annulment of the enterprise tax on above-normative pays  [popiwek]. Next the union voted for the budget on condition  that it was amended. After the Third Congress practically  nothing changed within OPZZ. Ewa Spychalska easily maintained  and consolidated her leading position. Generally, OPZZ does not  want to leave the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or protest  government activities -- it wants to negotiate. This is the most  important issue. For those who carefully followed the course of  the congress sessions, the rest of the decisions remains in the  sphere of rhetoric (at the congress unequivocal declarations  were made that "OPZZ will not be an umbrella for any  government," and that unionists would demand full valorization  of retirement and disability pensions, and oppose the new  enterprise tax on above-normative pays and insufficient  expenditure on the budget sphere). Both before and after the  congress...  <H5>  The Government Was Not Overly Concerned </H5>   ...about the demands and declarations. There is no  valorization; the government wants the new enterprise tax on  above-normative pays to stay (even though Prime Minister Pawlak  once again did not make a clear statement on that). Deputy  Prime Minister Kolodko told the unionists that the amendment of  the budget is now neither possible nor necessary. If there is  such a possibility, the changes will be only minimal.    In addition, Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and  finance minister, (in his speech, which was very good)  provocatively asked the unionists for advice:    Should the taxes, raised in 1994, be decreased, with all the  consequences for the budget sphere? Should they be maintained  at the present level? Or should they be further increased?    This statement caused consternation in the conference hall:  It was clear that the unionists of the industry and the  unionists of the "budget sphere" are aware of two different  answers. Taking advantage of the situation, the deputy prime  minister asked whether it would be a good idea to limit the time  of work and the salaries in regions that are particularly  threatened by unemployment, and to employ more people there.  "Because this is what solidarity is about." There was no  answer. Kolodko promised that, if the budget is amended, he  would ask unionists who should be given the additional several  billions of zlotys (he knew that the line of the people whose  interests the congress participants represented would be long  and that the interests would be conflicting).    There was no discussion with the deputy prime minister, nor  were there any statements of dissatisfaction.  <H5>  Following the Old Custom... </H5>   ...the participants started to clap their hands. The same  was done after the speeches of other officials, even though they  mostly complimented OPZZ. After the guests left, the  participants of the congress, again following the old custom,  adopted several resolutions demanding many things from the  government. Assurances were given that OPZZ would also be able  to stage a strike and that it would not serve as an umbrella.  The decision was made to form an union circle within SLD  (incidentally, all the time during the conflict with Stanislaw  Wisniewski, who was forming his own faction, Chairwoman  Spychalska claimed that such a circle had existed for a long  time).    Thus, the course of the congress does not suggest that OPZZ  will make any changes in the policy that it has been carrying  out thus far.</p>

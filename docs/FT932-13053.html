			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Cleaning up for the market - Sir Phil Harris's float of Carpetright THE re-emergence of Sir Phil Harris as chairman of a quoted company, through the flotation of Carpetright of London, due in the early summer at a value of around Pounds 75m to Pounds 100m, will bring back many memories for investors. Some of these will be happy, some less so. Sir Phil seems determined that he will avoid some of the problems of his former company, Harris Queensway. That was eventually taken over for Pounds 450m in 1988, though not until Sir Phil had attempted a management buy-out Some investors who sold out when Sir Phil did made money, although Harris Queensway's peak market value was Pounds 600m before the 1987 crash. Those who stuck with Lowndes Queensway, as it became, lost their money when it failed in 1990. High interest rates put up the cost of its debt at the same time as hitting consumer spending. Even before the takeover, Harris Queensway was a classic 1980s retail story. It had expanded rapidly through takeovers - Sir Phil says he did 38 in all - and outside its original focus of carpet retailing. This time round, says Sir Phil, Carpetright is a 'clean company'. By that he means 'no takeovers, all the shop leases are straightforward, new store opening costs are all written off at the time, any stock losses are taken straight away. It's a very simple structure - there are no complications'. Carpetright, he promises, will stick to selling carpets and not move into areas such as furniture, electrical goods, discount shops, even toys as Harris Queensway did. Takeovers are out, except for buying stores. For those of Sir Phil's followers who regard him as the 'carpet king' that will be reassuring news. Carpetright dates back to 1988, soon after the Harris Queensway takeover. Sir Phil refused to sign a non-competition agreement and was rapidly back in business. Because store sites were hard to get then, Carpetright was a joint venture with MFI Furniture, the retailer which floated last year, and opened stores on MFI sites. At first Sir Phil did not take executive control, but early losses and the need for extra finance brought him back to the chief executive job three years ago. He brought in a number of colleagues from Harris Queensway days. Since then profits have risen sharply. A pre-tax figure of Pounds 351,000 in 1990-91 rose to Pounds 2.8m the next year. That was beaten in the first of the current year (to end April) when profit reached Pounds 3.4m. The full year's figures will be shown in the prospectus, but analysts are looking for over Pounds 7m. Sir Phil takes pride in saying 'we've done it through a recession.' The chain is now second place in the highly fragmented carpet market, and Sir Phil has plans to open another 22 to 25 shops a year, taking the total from the current 115 to 200 in the next three to four years. That would take Carpetright's market share, he reckons, from 6 per cent to 12 to 15 per cent, giving it market leadership. It could be achieved with little addition to central costs, he believes, and the implication is that profits growth will continue rapidly. All that growth will be internally financed, he says, and the group has no debt. He also promises that given Carpetright's strong cash generation, 'we will be generous with dividends'. The outlook seems rosy. But investors tempted by the float may have a few concerns. First, Sir Phil's plans go no further than the 200 store target. After that, he says, there are no further economies of scale to be gained from suppliers. He has vague ideas about moving into Europe but nothing concrete. While this is not a matter for immediate concern, the history of retailers moving abroad is not good and Sir Phil's experience outside the UK is slim. There is also the question of MFI's position. It still holds a 20 per cent stake in Carpetright and has yet to decide whether to sell its shares in the flotation. It would seem odd for MFI to retain a 20 per cent stake without keeping a seat on the board. Mr Derek Hunt, who was chairman of Carpetright, and his colleague, Mr John Randall, who was a non-executive director, have both left the board. Mr Hunt says that they did not want to get involved in another float and were anxious to devote their time to MFI. Sir Phil, his family and his charitable trusts will own about 40 per cent of the shares. However, this proportion is likely to reduce, as the charities sell shares to raise money. The prospectus will also say that Sir Phil could sell a limited number of shares each year for tax planning and charitable reasons. Investors with long memories may need a little more reassurance about the strength and depth of management, and the financial controls at Carpetright, two perceived weaknesses of the former Harris Queensway. On the plus side, as well as the projected growth in profits, there is the near perfect timing of the float just as the economic recovery appears to be getting underway. There is little doubt that so long as the issue is correctly priced, and the recent recovery in the housing market does not suddenly reverse, the float should be a success.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Arts: 'La Vestale' opens La Scala season After the ill-received Don Carlo that opened the 1992-93 season at La Scala, Riccardo Muti, musical director of the great Milanese house, decided to inaugurate the current operatic year with a safer, because much less familiar work: Gaspare Spontini's La Vestale, last given at La Scala 39 years ago. This revival was to be an ultra-serious occasion: the opera would be given in the original French (though the cast was almost entirely Anglophone), the cuts would all be opened, and the substantial ballets would be performed complete. Liliana Cavani, who staged the successful Muti Traviata two years ago, was called on to produce the opera, which would be designed by Margherita Palli (scenes) and Gabriella Pescucci (costumes). Because of the political scandals that have rocked Milan and thanks, no doubt also to the recession, the opening night was less be-furred and be-jewelled than usual, but the television cameras were there to record the occasion and to transmit the enthusiasm of the few celebrities in the audience. The critics were also generally favourable, but anyone accustomed to reading between their lines caught a distinct whiff of boredom. On the second night, the audience was still polite, but icy. Not a single number was applauded. There was extended applause at the end, true, but there was also a fair number of emptied seats. Some members of the audience could recall the Vestale of 1954, in Italian, with dances and other music cut; but staged by Luchino Visconti (his debut in opera) and sung by the refulgent Maria Callas, at the zenith of her career. That evening was as unforgettable, as the Muti Vestale is forgettable. Callas's every inflection, every gesture had meaning and power. For his Julia Muti chose a young American soprano, Karen Huffstodt, of considerable vocal force, but without any dramatic profundity. Above all, she showed no feeling for declamation; her French words, often smudged, seemed to have little meaning for her. She dutifully went through the motions - love, despair, anguish, joy - but she conveyed no depth or truth of feeling. There was never any sense of vulnerability or of menace. Muti often drew beautiful sounds from his orchestra, and he deftly pointed out many enchanting instrumental subtleties. This is a period he loves and he has obviously absorbed and feels every note of the score (except perhaps for the almost silly ballet music); but at La Scala he did not communicate his conviction to the cast, not even to the usually responsive chorus. At times, stage and pit were simply not together; and even when they were, the emotion was all in the orchestra. Only Anthony Michaels-Moore made sense of his words and produced eloquent, varied, engaging song. Denyce Graves, that superlative Carmen, was a vocally correct but perfunctory Grand Vestale; Patrick Raftery, a cipher in the role of Cinna; and Dimitri Kavrakos, an inadequate High Priest. Part of the fault undoubtedly lay with the visual presentation. Cavani, this time, was uninspired and repetitious. Again and again, Licinius would make a move towards Julia, and every time Cinna would mechanically grab his arms or shoulders to restrain him. In the second act, for her long, crucial monologue, a superb and presumably private self-examination, Julia was never alone: a few intrusive sister-Vestals were always fussing around her. The action was set not in 3rd century Rome but more or less in 1807, the year of the opera's presentation. It is Napoleonic Rome, then, and this might be all right for the sets, but the costumes - especially for the High Priest, who looks like a 33rd-degree Mason - are distracting, and the Vestals, instead of wearing the traditional white, are in drab buff and maroon, some of them with hideous bonnets. The ridiculous ballet devised by Amedeo Amodio was obviously meant as a vehicle for Carla Fracci (she appeared in the Visconti Vestale two generations ago). It was cruel of La Scala to offer her this role, and it was unwise of her to accept it.</p>

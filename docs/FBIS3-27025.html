			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shen Weixing (3088 5898 2502): "Due To </F> Excessive Imports of CD Production Lines, the Department  Concerned Calls For Import Suspension and Standardized  Management"]    [Text] This reporter has learned from the Management  Department of the China Press and Publications Administration  that, in disregard of the relevant government stipulations, some  localities have blindly imported compact disk [CD] production  lines from abroad, resulting in a CD output far exceeding  domestic demand and bringing about rampant pirating activities.  This has disrupted the normal order of the compact disk  industry and infringed upon the interests of copyright holders.    Through investigation, this reporter has discovered that in  1992 China had only one CD production factory, the Xianke  Corporation in Shenzhen. Later, there were three factories and  three production lines. By the end of 1993, however, the  figures jumped to 25 factories and 30 production lines.    What impact do 30 production lines have on the CD market? In  1992 the total annual CD sales in China were around 3 million,  but a Xianke CD production line in Shenzhen alone had an annual  production capacity of 5 million CDs. We can thus see that even  if the domestic CD sales market grows several fold, a few CD  production factories can sufficiently saturate the market.    What is terrible, however, is that in less than 18 months 10  times as many production lines have emerged, with a full-load  production capacity of nearly 100 million CDs. Moreover, new CD  production lines are still being imported.    In March 1993 the State Planning Commission and the  department concerned studied the issue of importing CD  production lines. Taking into consideration the domestic market  demands at that time, the commission explicitly stipulated that  before the country's overall development plan for CD players and  laser disk players is promulgated, no department or locality may  approve the construction of new factories and the expansion of  existing production capacity. After the planning commission  document was transmitted to the lower levels, some localities  and departments, in total disregard of the document provisions,  blindly approved the construction of CD production factories,  with the result that CD output far outstripped domestic market  demands. What was especially serious was that some unscrupulous  overseas businessmen have taken advantage of the opportunity to  make an inroad and engage in large-scale pirating activities.  This has not only disrupted the domestic video market, but also  the international disk market. The Shanghai office of the  International Disk Industrial Association recently officially  brought a suit in the Shanghai Municipal Intermediate People's  Court against a certain Taiwan businessman called Hsu for  carrying out illegal pirating activities on the mainland. Hsu  was tracked down by the Taiwan authorities for carrying out  illegal disk pirating activities in Taiwan. Pending trial, Hsu  entered China in early 1993 and engaged in illegal CD copying  activities. While serving as deputy general manager of business  at Baodie Laser and Electronics Company Limited, a Sino-foreign  joint venture in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, he provided the  company with the masters of programs produced by the  International Disk Industrial Association, which has the right  over the programs, and copied 121,000 CDs in 35 varieties. He  also accepted a processing task for Huadie Guangdian Company  Limited, a Sino-foreign joint venture in Hangzhou, and produced  18,000 CDs in 14 varieties. Most of the copied and pirated CDs  have entered the international market.    At present, the issue of illegally importing CD production  lines has drawn the close attention of the relevant government  department. The department deems it necessary to immediately  stop importing CD production lines from abroad and exercise  strict and necessary standardized management over CD factories  currently in production and operation. Otherwise, the factories  will face the risk of bankruptcy and it will be impossible to  curb piracy in some domestic markets.</p>

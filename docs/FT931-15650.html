			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / North-east shows signs of recovery SIGNS THAT the economy of north-eastern England is heading for an upturn have been supported by the 1992 survey of the results of companies based in the area, published yesterday by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm. Of 17 plcs in the region that announced results covering the year as far as September 30, 12 reported increased turnover and 10 increased pre-tax profit. Excluding Barratt Developments, the housebuilder, the aggregate pre-tax profit of Pounds 231.7m in the results of the companies for 1992 was 10.2 per cent up on the previous year. Including Barratt, which turned a loss of Pounds 105.9m reported in 1991 into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 11.3m in the year to June 30 1992, the increase was 146 per cent. Excluding Barratt, turnover rose 6.5 per cent. The survey suggests that the long-term decline in the number of plcs with headquarters in the region - a trend which has aroused concern about a loss of decision-making power - has stabilised. The survey says that the impact of the recession in 1991 was demonstrated strikingly by a 51 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 111m from Pounds 227m in 1990. Problems at Barratt and MTM, the chemicals producer, were significant factors. But increased dividend payments in 1991 by 13 of the companies  - including four which recorded lower 1991 pre-tax profits - were a clear statement of confidence.

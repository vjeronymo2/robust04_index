			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Connien Molusi] </F>   [Excerpts] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- Explicit exclusion  of a change in the election date in the terms of reference for  international mediation on Wednesday [13 April] grounded efforts  by Dr Henry Kissinger and Lord Carrington to mediate the Inkatha  Freedom Party's [IFP] objection to the interim constitution.  IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi objected to the new terms of  reference, drafted with the government's participation on  Tuesday, which explicitly state the election date is not an  issue for mediation. [passage omitted]    Asked what would take the mediation process forward in the  light of the IFP's objection, Mr Buthelezi said he was not  intent on "putting new terms of reference as if I am demanding  ultimatums".    "There is nothing I prescribe as Buthelezi." The IFP had  already had to climb down on its original demands on mediation.    KwaZulu health minister and chief negotiator Dr Ben Ngubane  said there were a lot of things they had objected to but had  carried on with negotiations.    Mr Buthelezi said any further development in mediation would  depend on the attitude of the mediators. He had had breakfast  with former U.S. Secretary of State Dr Kissinger and former  British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington on Wednesday morning  and had bid them goodbye. He did not know and would not want to  speculate on how his supporters would react to the hitches that  threatened to scupper the mediation efforts, he said    In a statement issued later, Dr Kissinger and Lord  Carrington said they had had "extremely useful" meetings with  the leaders of the government, ANC and IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] subsequent to the opening reception of the international  mediation forum.    They said senior negotiators for the three parties would be  meeting in Pretoria from 12PM on Wednesday (today) to finalise  terms of reference for the mediation. The seven mediators and  their advisors held a meeting on Wednesday to discuss matters  that arose from the meetings with the three leaders earlier in  the day. The mediation would commence once agreement on the  terms of reference had been reached by the parties, the  statement said.</p>

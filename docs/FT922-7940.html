			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Pacific Rim telecom stocks find international support - Dollars 10bn of new equity is expected Telecommunications in the Pacific Basin are being unplugged from state control. As privatisation of utilities gathers pace, high growth rates are being forecast for the companies, and international investors have been showing increasing interest in the sector. Privatisations are expected in Singapore, Korea, Pakistan and Thailand in the next few years with, according to a recent report by Salomon Brothers, the US-based brokers, some Dollars 10bn of new equity coming on to the market over the next three years. Meanwhile, New Zealand has had the most recent experience of liberalisation. Telecom, the former state-owned utility, was privatised last July; since then, cost-cutting has allowed it to report a 20 per cent increase in net profits for the first nine months to February. The cost-cutting was initiated by Mr Peter Troughton, its former managing director, who announced his sudden resignation in mid-February. There was speculation that his decision to quit came after disagreement with leading shareholders Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US - each of which holds a 37 per cent stake - over handling of a price-cutting battle with competitor Clear Communications. Salomon says there is still room for further economies in costs, as well as renewed marketing initiatives to improve call volume. Together with BZW, the UK broker, it still rates the stock as a buy in spite of its recent disappointing market performance. BZW notes that the company should deliver long term earnings per share growth of just over 10 per cent. The Philippines, which liberalised telecoms six years ago, is dominated by Philippines Long Distance Telephone (PLDT). Listed in both Manila and New York, PLDT reported a 48 per cent jump in net profits for 1991, while EPS rose to 98.90 pesos from 64.56 pesos. Listed in New York, its share price movement in Manila is strongly influenced by its US performance earlier on any given day. According to Salomon, the potential for market growth in the Philippines is enormous, given that at present there are only just under two lines per 100 people, compared with over 40 in Hong Kong and New Zealand. Restraints to growth for PLDT, however, include the company's high gearing, estimated at 120 per cent in 1991, and the country's historic political instability. Economic growth in Malaysia, coupled with tight monetary policy, has already given a spur to institutional investment in the country. Telekom Malaysia, in which foreign investors hold 7 per cent of the equity, is felt by analysts to have excellent growth potential as the demand for improved services continues. The group recently reported a 45 per cent increase in pre-tax operating profit for 1991, helped by a 14 per cent rise in subscribers. Kim Eng Securities, the Singapore-based broker, notes that in spite of the expiry of Telekom's five-year tax-exempt status at the end of last year, which will cause a dip in 1992 earnings, long-term prospects remain good. Salomon is forecasting long-term dividend growth of some 12 per cent. Hong Kong is currently reviewing its telecommunications policy and assessing whether the territory, which reverts to Chinese control in 1997, needs a second operator. The domestic monopoly held by Hong Kong Telecom ends in three years. Hoare Govett argues that this review will have little effect on Hong Kong Telecom, in which Cable and Wireless, of the UK, is the major shareholder, since the group already has 'a high penetration in the domestic market and will retain its more lucrative international franchise until 2006'. However, along with a higher tax charge which will depress profits in 1992, this has made some analysts cautious about short term potential, leading to a number of 'hold' recommendations being issued on the stock.</p>

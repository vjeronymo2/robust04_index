			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] will name its  prime ministerial candidate at its extraordinary congress on 4  June. Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman for the party,  also told today's press briefing that he did not know of any  MSZP leaders having held talks with Miklos Nemeth on the  possibility of him returning home. Here are further excerpts  from the press briefing.    [Begin recording] [Szekeres] Inasmuch as it becomes a member  of government -- and this can be expected with great probability  -- the MSZP will respect landed property. We would like to  complete the process of compensation, as soon as possible. We  think that the law adopted by the National Assembly on the  (?return) of church real estate must be implemented.    Our position concerning privatization is clear: We would  like to use it as a means for drawing in capital, for creating  employment, and for renewing technology. We are not preparing  for small-scale or large clear-outs.    [Unidentified correspondent] The executive deputy chairman  said he would like the election campaign to deal with these  questions from now on. Coalition talks will be held after the  29 May elections. Then the new government will have to quickly  take stock of what is handed over by the outgoing government --  that is, the state of the budget, state assets, assumed  guarantees, payment obligations, and reserves. The MSZP is  preparing at a rapid pace for government work, the deputy  chairman said.    [Szekeres] We do not fear a 50-percent share of  parliamentary  seats, or two-thirds either. We would not fear such a thing in  the case of any party, because there is a constitutional setup.  There is an institution of the president of Republic, there is  a parliamentary opposition. There is a Constitution, there is  press publicity, and there is a Constitutional Court. Therefore  the power is divided, and that is good, because only in this way  can a balance be created in connection with any branch of power.  [end recording]</p>

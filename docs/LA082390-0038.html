			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A man who had been wanted for 53 outstanding misdemeanor counts was sentenced  to three years' probation and 350 days in jail after pleading guilty Wednesday  to 25 counts in Municipal Court, a court spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Antonio Anthony Simpson, 23, who police say is a transient, pleaded guilty  Tuesday to an array of misdemeanors that included illegal lodging, littering  the sidewalk, jaywalking, possession of narcotics paraphernalia and drinking  alcohol in a restricted area, court records show.  </P> <P> San Diego police officers caught up with Simpson on Monday and were planning to  issue him a routine misdemeanor citation on suspicion of breaking into a change  box at a downtown parking lot. After running a records check, police discovered  a backlog of warrants for Simpson's arrest because of his failure to appear in  court on other misdemeanor citations.  </P> <P> Simpson pleaded guilty to fewer than half the outstanding misdemeanor cases  against him because of a deal worked out with the city attorney's office, said  Laurent J. Comeau, the county public defender assigned to the case.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NAIA DISTRICT 3 PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> SCC HOPES THIRD TIME DOESN'T BECOME A DEFEAT  </P> <P> There are two schools of thought regarding Southern California College's  chances of advancing to the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics  basketball championships.  </P> <P> And Vanguard Coach Bill Reynolds knows them both.  </P> <P> Biola, Cal Baptist and Westmont -- the three other teams remaining in the NAIA  District 3 playoffs -- are a combined 0-6 against Southern California College,  each team losing twice.  </P> <P> "You hate to play somebody you've already beaten twice," Reynolds said.  "Conversely, if you've beaten a team twice, why not three times?"  </P> <P> The logic is sound, but Cal Baptist might be hard to convince.  </P> <P> The Vanguards, the district's top-seeded team, play the Lancers (20-10) in a  semifinal game at 8 tonight at Whittier College.  </P> <P> Although the Vanguards have beaten the Lancers by scores of 96-78 and 91-81,  Southern California trailed at halftime both times.  </P> <P> "The first game, we just fell apart in the second half," Cal Baptist Coach  Jerry King said. "The second game was tied with 2 minutes left and they just  beat us down the stretch. We're a much better team now."  </P> <P> Indeed.  </P> <P> The Lancers are fresh off an 81-75 victory Tuesday against Christian Heritage,  which was the third-seeded team in the district. Cal Baptist led by as many as  25 points in that game.  </P> <P> "I'm glad we don't have to play Westmont and Biola back-to-back, but I don't  know if it makes a difference at this point," Reynolds said. "I mean, Cal  Baptist has some really good athletes."  </P> <P> Such as Michael Banks, a three-time all-district player.  </P> <P> Banks averaged 18 points and seven rebounds per game this season and was a  problem for the Vanguards in their two games. He is not only big (6-feet-5, 210  pounds), but quick.  </P> <P> Southern California uses only one player taller than 6-2, Todd Bickmore (6-7).  </P> <P> "Todd just doesn't match up well with Banks at all," Reynolds said. "He tries,  but he doesn't have the quickness."  </P> <P> Cal Baptist also has its New Zealand connection in Warren Davis, Neil Swindale  and Tony Smith, all former members of the New Zealand national team.  </P> <P> Smith, a 6-4 guard, averages 13 points per game.  </P> <P> The Vanguards have five players who average in double figures, including  Bickmore (team-high 20 points).  </P> <P> Terry Scruggs (18 points), Todd Dixon (16), Kyle Lundy (15) and Phil Hills  (nine) also start. Jim Mansfield (11) and John Mounce (eight) are the players  Reynolds' uses off the bench.  </P> <P> "With SCC, you're not concerned about one or two guys, you have to be concerned  with the whole team," King said. "The first time you see them, they don't look  like much. They just don't look threatening. But they all shoot well and they  all play hard defense and they work well together as a team. They're tough as  nails."  </P> <P> The winner faces Westmont or Biola in Tuesday's championship game at Whittier  College. Westmont (18-12) and Biola (27-5) play in Saturday's 6 p.m. game at  Whittier.  </P> <P> The winner of Tuesday's championship game moves on to Kansas City for the  32-team national tournament, March 14-20.  </P></p>

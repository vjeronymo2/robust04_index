			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early advance lost in sharp sell-off MILDLY disappointing October consumer price statistics from the US abruptly wiped out early share gains on the London stock market yesterday, although the final picture was better than on some other European bourses. The FT-SE 100 Index lost the 3,100 benchmark under the influence of a sell-off in stock index futures, but was rallying in the closing minutes of the session. The final reading put the Footsie at 3,098.5 for a gain of 2.5 on the day. Equities had opened uncertainly following the faltering trend at the overnight close of the US bond market, but then turned smartly higher to reach a mid-session peak of 3,115 on the Footsie, 19 points ahead. The reaction to the announcement that the US consumer price index had contradicted analysts by gaining 0.4 per cent in October was slow at first. Although nervous ahead of the outcome of the day's auction of 10 year US Federal bonds increased , London was heartened by relatively bullish comments from Washington, where Mr Robert Reich, the US Labour Secretary, said that inflation was 'not starting to accelerate.' But in its currently nervous state, the UK equity market was taking no risks and early gains in shares quickly began to evaporate in fairly active trading. With Wall Street also in cautious mode, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average turning off slightly in UK hours, the Footsie was barely able to hold in positive territory in late afternoon. However, traders stressed that the stock market was not under serious strain. Much of the pressure came from marketmaking firms which were, in turn, responding to rapid changes in the futures market. The big institutions appeared to have resumed their policy of waiting for the Budget speech due at the end of the month from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor of the exchequer. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index remained uncertain, slipping down by 0.6 for a closing reading of 3,440.4. Activity focused around the blue chip stocks, which are more closely futures-related than the second liners. Seaq volume remained good at 778.1m shares compared with 772.2m on Tuesday when retail business was worth Pounds 1.5bn, at the top end of the daily averages for the year. UK strategists pointed out that the more extreme reaction on continental European markets reflected both trading news from leading companies and also the prospect of today's Armistice Day closure of some trading centres. Falling share prices in the second half of the session provided the backcloth for a raft of unsubstantiated rumours, chiefly focused around newsagency reports of military clashes on the Kuwait-Iraq border. The stock market closed on a calm note although some traders claimed to have scented a weak opening this morning. Transatlantic concerns showed themselves in a weak pharmaceutical sector and oil shares also closed a few pence easier. But the broad range of UK store and consumer stocks, still buoyed by optimism for a base rate cut at Budget time, performed well even where share prices ended below the day's best. The shock of the day came in Euro Disney shares, which traded throughout the session in London but fell heavily in the wake of the dismal trading statement.</p>

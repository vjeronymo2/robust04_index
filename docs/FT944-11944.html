			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: MEPC Australia awarded A3 rating Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday assigned an A3 long-term debt rating to MEPC Australia, part of the UK property group, and a prime-2 rating to its ADollars 500m (USDollars 370.3m) commercial paper programme, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. MEPC has announced plans to diversify its UK-dominated portfolio through greater investment in the the Australian property market. Commenting on the move, and associated rating, Moody's said it believed Australia to be 'the most volatile of MEPC's areas of concentration' and viewed 'additional exposure as incremental to the company's risk profile'. However, it added that such risk was 'somewhat mitigated by the company's long and successful presence in this market'.</p>

Sometimes it becomes a profitable business if  advanced recycling technology is used. Siemens Matsushita  Components GmbH in Heidenheim and Siemens-Steckverbinderwerk  [connector factory] in Speyer are demonstrating this.    The environment is being saved in the future from 18,000  m[.sup]3[/] of waste water and up to 7,000 metric tons of  compressed sludge residue. This previously resulted from the  etching of aluminum capacitors. At the same time, the  electronics firm of Siemens Matsushita Components has reduced  the operating costs in its capacitor factory in Heidenheim by  1.7 million Deutsche marks annually. The system required an  investment of 1.2 million Deutsche marks to realize these  production and environmental goals. It is about 500,000 Deutsche  marks cheaper than the previous model.    Jakob Bauer is the Siemens environmental manager who  provided  these figures. He also provided information regarding the  technical details. According to him, the new system is achieving  a high degree of recycling. "Of the hydrochloric and sulfuric  acids used here, 80% are recovered from used etching  baths.  Previously, these acids would be neutralized, the sludge removed  and sent for waste disposal." This activity shows up in the  statement of costs because resources are now being returned to  the production cycle. Jakob Bauer emphasizes that, in  Heidenheim, the bath residues coming from the etching process  are "separated into highly acidic and weakly acidic fractions  using a membrane method, diffusion dialysis. These fractions are  rich in metals." In this way, according to Bauer, it has become  possible to extend the working life of the etching baths. This  saves money. Besides this, not only is 96% of the aluminum  salts retained but also, in an additional step, they serve the  goal of environmental protection. Now, these salts are supplied  to community sewage treatment plants which can make use of them  again as precipitating agents.  <H5>  Electroplating in the Siemens Factory in Speyer </H5>   Waste water treatment that makes minimal use of chemicals,  water cycling for rinsing baths, and recovery methods for  resource recycling increase environmental protection and company  profit. Another example of methods providing both increased  environmental protection and profit potential is the  Siemens-Kabelwerk [cable factory] in Mudanya in Turkey. There, a  recycling system for cable remainders has been in operation for  a few months. This system first breaks up the incoming lines and  then separates the polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride of the  cable sheath from the copper by means of a vibrating chute. In  this way, the plastics can be used again and copper with a  purity of 99.5% and which can be smelted again is  recovered. In  addition, claims Bauer, this environmental protection system  also contributes to Siemens' profit with 250,000 Deutsche marks  annually.    Behind these and other production methods and products is,  according to Bauer, the idea that, "we need to work on complete  solutions for the emission areas of waste water, waste products  and exhaust air. In these solutions, the sum of all emissions  should represent an optimized minimum." These environmentally  conscious production methods and products will not always be a  profit-generating investment for the companies. In addition, a  safety system is to be created for the emission areas of soil  and ground water which "is adapted to the existing potential  danger."    Systems that traditionally pose particular problems for the  environment include electroplating shops such as those in the  Siemens Steckverbinderwerk in Speyer. These systems are  problematic because of their use of water-polluting materials  and because of their often large requirement for rinse water.  However, it can be seen even here how a modern plant of this  type can be created to protect the environment.    "In Speyer," says Bauer, "we no longer operate with the  conventional end-of-pipe technology. Rather, we treat the waste  water using the advanced side-stream method." Recovery methods  integrated into the process here serve the recycling of  resources. The remaining waste water is treated according to  special concepts designed to make minimal use of chemicals.  These innovations also include a control and documentation  system under computer control. The usefulness of these  innovations has resulted in a reduction in the quantity of waste  water by about one half. As "we now recover 2,000 kg of copper,  80 kg of palladium and 6 kg of gold and 7,500 liters of  polishing bath and 1,700 liters of nickel bath annually, the  metal hydroxide waste is also reduced by about one third,"  summarizes Jakob Bauer.</p>

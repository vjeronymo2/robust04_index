			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: West can aid former Soviet bloc nuclear clean-up Sir, Bronwen Maddox's trip to Chernobyl (November 15/16) has highlighted the need to clean-up the contamination caused by the world's worst nuclear accident. She was also right to point out that there is no evidence to support claims that 8,000 people have died as result of the accident. However, the fact that 42 people did die and considerable contamination remains, illustrates that the nuclear industry in the former Soviet Union needs all the help it can get to put things right. The British nuclear industry has been at the forefront of providing the necessary help. Take contamination. A British consortium, involving among others AEA Technology, has recently developed a 'Chernobyl clean-up strategy' which has been funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's 'know-how' fund. This project will help the Ukraine to secure the funding it needs for specific projects designed to return contaminated land to more normal conditions. Russian Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors were not built to western safety standards and they had inherent design weaknesses which were exposed in the 1986 accident. In response, Britain leads a consortium of European countries involved in a Ecu7m project, funded by the EU. This project will identify how to upgrade the safety features of RBMK reactors and how to make them as close to western standards as possible. Britain and other western nuclear powers have the ability to put right what is wrong in the former Soviet bloc. Your correspondent's report has made a helpful contribution by keeping the whole topic in perspective.

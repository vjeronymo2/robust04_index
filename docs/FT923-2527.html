			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2.8 per cent to below the 18,000 level TOKYO CAME back from a day's holiday to a fall of 2.85 per cent in low volume, on weak overseas markets followed by index-linked selling, agencies report from Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 526.70 down at 17,944.70, below 18,000 for the first time since September 2, after registering a high for the day of 18,422.82 and a low of 17,853.57. Volume rose slightly, to 250m shares from Monday's 228m, and arbitrage was said to account for a lot of the business. Declines outnumbered advances by 845 to 166, with 128 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 30.51, or 2.2 per cent, to 1,352.60, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 5.88 to 1,075.53. Many investors had run out of ideas after the recent rally, which took the market up by 32 per cent in just over three weeks to September 10. They were tired, said brokers, of buying special situations, and while Germany's rate cut encouraged people on Monday, they decided yesterday that the recent rally has little to do with overseas factors. Notable declining sectors were brokerage, banking and lending companies, non-life insurance, pharmaceuticals, warehousing, airlines, food and real estate. Transport was mixed, with railway and bus shares down and the trucking sector making the only advance of the day. Aids-related issues were also mixed. The most heavily traded stock of the day, Nippon Mining, gained Y3 to Y505, but Green Cross fell Y60 to Y1,670, Meiji Milk was Y30 lower at Y1,060 and Nippon Zeon lost Y31 to Y692. Biotechnology company Nihon Nohyaku receded Y40 to Y1,140 on profit-taking after Monday's jump. Roundup WEAK sentiment abroad was reflected in most of the Pacific Basin equity markets yesterday. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index dropped 24.0 to 1,506.4, with BHP's 50-cent fall to ADollars 11.98 responsible for a third of the decline. Overall turnover was a moderate ADollars 226.2m. Brokers said that there was increasing concern about BHP's newly acquired 32 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing, which posted an ADollars 950m loss and made an ADollars 1bn rights issue on Tuesday. BHP came under more pressure after it offered to buy a further 5 per cent of the Foster's equity from Citibank. Foster's shed 8 cents to ADollars 1.38. HONG KONG saw steep early losses pared by bargain hunters, the Hang Seng index closing 20.71 down at 5,633.13 after touching 5,599.10. Turnover fell further to HKDollars 1.18bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 1.29bn. Trade talks and Sino-British negotiations on airport financing ended yesterday morning, but there was no report of progress from either. However, Jardine Matheson gained HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 53 on hopes of pleasant surprises as its group companies announce interim results. SINGAPORE fell on institutional selling of blue chips, the Straits Times Industrial index losing 15.65 to 1,367.77 in volume of 34.6m shares. TAIWAN sank in sluggish trade on continued worries over last week's arrest of textile tycoon and major market player Oung Ta-ming, and the weighted index ended 52.20, or 1.4 per cent, down at a 20-month low of 3,664.52. Turnover fell to a very thin TDollars 13.8bn from Tuesday's TDollars 18.2bn. Brokers said overall selling was not too heavy as many investors believed prices were already low. However, stocks related to Oung continued to plunge, with Hualon Preferred losing TDollars 6.50 to TDollars 89. MANILA just managed to buck the trend, the composite index closing 4.17 up at 1,433.44 in increasingly active trade. A strong showing by Philippine National Bank, in spite of reports that it expects a sharp drop in 1992 profits, was taken as a mild bull point for the market. PNB gained 5 pesos to 285 pesos, as combined turnover at Manila's two bourses rose from 173m to 264m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR's institutional investors remained largely sidelined ahead of the Malaysian budget next month. Profit-taking countered support for selected second-liners and situation stocks, and the KLSE composite index closed 0.76 off at 585.15. NEW ZEALAND followed overseas trends to end lower on less than average turnover, the NZSE-40 capital index easing 10.39 to 1,469.87 in NZDollars 18m, of which NZDollars 6m was in Telecom. The utility was one of the few leaders to rise, ending one cent higher at NZDollars 2.32. BANGKOK took profits as trade slowed down in anticipation of the formation of a new government after Sunday's general election. The SET index ended 4.41 lower at 813.33 in turnover of Bt8.92bn.</p>

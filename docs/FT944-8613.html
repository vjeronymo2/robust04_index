			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / GM files lawsuit to block recall of 6m trucks General Motors yesterday filed a lawsuit against the US administration and Mr Federico Pena, transport secretary, in an effort to block a forced recall of an estimated 6m of its pick-up trucks. The US's biggest vehicle maker had threatened the action last month, when Mr Pena first said he planned to push for the recall. GM turned down a request for a voluntary recall made by the US transport authorities 18 months ago. The company's legal action marks an intensification of the fight over the vehicles, which critics say are liable to burst into flames when involved in side-on collisions. GM said yesterday it had filed a complaint in the federal court for the eastern district of Michigan against Mr Pena, the US transport department and the national highway traffic safety administration, on whose research Mr Pena based his recall decision. The suit seeks an injunction against the recall, and a declaratory judgment overturning the decision. Mr Thomas Gottschalk, the carmaker's general counsel, said the complaint 'directly challenges the secretary's position that he can disregard federal motor vehicle safety standards and retroactively require the redesign of older cars and trucks which unquestionably met the safety standards and which perform as safely or more safely than most other vehicles on the road today.' Ford and Chrysler have joined GM in criticising Mr Pena's decision. The three carmakers argue that the attempted recall throws US car safety standards into confusion, since it applies to vehicles which passed federal standards when they were sold.</p>

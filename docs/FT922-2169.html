			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (20): Satellite networks cut costs COMPANIES needing high quality telecommunications at lower costs are increasingly considering services provided by satellites, particularly in the US. Ninety per cent of the costs of running an integrated satellite business network (ISBN) is fixed and predictable, claims Hughes Network Systems which provides networks for companies to communicate through data, voice and video to remote sites. Hughes - a subsidiary of the Hughes Aircraft Company in the US - has developed VSAT (very small aperture terminal) technology, using small dishes for two-way communications. Equipment at remote sites supports a variety of user applications, via packet-switching and local area network technology, plus business TV reception. Typical users in the US include Chrysler, the car manufacturer; Wal-Mart Stores, the national retail chain; and Chevron, the petro-chemical company. In the retailing sector, VSAT technology is being applied at 'TV Answer,' the interactive video pioneer at Reston, Virginia. Hughes are installing 1,000 satellite terminals for the company, to allow TV viewers across the US to access their bank and brokerage accounts and respond directly to broadcast promotion offers. 'Once it was something of a dream to be able to retail via consumer TVs,' says Hughes. 'Now, with the systems similar to those at 'TV Answer,' it's a reality - and, because it's a low-cost satellite system, it could now be applied quickly in Britain without high level investment.'</p>

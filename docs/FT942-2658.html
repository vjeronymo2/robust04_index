			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Life insurers criticised for poor surrender values: Household names offer low refunds when customers cash in policies early, says OFT Some UK insurance companies offer such poor terms for cashing in life policies early that customers could be better off holding their savings in cash, according to the Office of Fair Trading. An OFT report on 60 of the UK's largest life insurers yesterday discloses wide disparities in the surrender values of life insurance policies. The study shows that companies with household names are among those offering the worst returns to policyholders. It will reinforce the OFT's campaign for greater disclosure of costs and charges by insurance companies. The OFT cites studies showing that one-quarter to one-third of policies lapse in the first two years alone. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said: 'On the basis of assumptions about lapse rates and projections of surrender and maturity values, the policyholders of some companies appear to receive average rates of return which are no more than marginally positive, or even negative.' For instance, on a 10-year 'with-profits' policy, involving payments totalling Pounds 3,000 in premiums over the first five years, the policyholder would earn a refund of Pounds 3,315 from Eagle Star but a refund of Pounds 2,244 from National Provident Insurance. On a 25-year unit-linked policy, where Pounds 3,000 in premiums had been paid in the first five years, Scottish Mutual would refund Pounds 2,534 while Allied Dunbar would repay just Pounds 1,500. The study shows that several companies that offer the worst early surrender values are also those which have been fined or disciplined by Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, for mis-selling. They include Guardian, London and Manchester, Reliance Mutual, Legal and General and Colonial Mutual. Other companies offering poor value to early leavers in at least two product types are Royal Life, Axa Equity and Law, Irish Life and Pearl. Only one company whose products rank in the top five of value for money on early surrenders - Norwich Union - has been fined for poor sales practices. Equitable Life ranked in the top five for almost all products. The study also examined the profit margin earned on each policy in each year of its life and concluded that for some companies, greater profits are earned on policies that surrender early. 'For a few companies, the pattern of profits suggests that returns to the company are higher when more policyholders surrender early with significant losses,' Sir Bryan said.

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Cholera outbreak in Russia Eleven people have now died from a cholera outbreak in southern Russia, a health ministry official said at the weekend. Mr Vasily Agapov, deputy minister of health, told the Itar-Tass news agency that 256 cases of cholera had been reported in the Dagestan region of Russia in the Caucasus. Five towns in the area have been put under quarantine, bus routes to other regions have been cancelled and air and rail travel has been restricted. However, one person, believed to have contracted the disease in Dagestan, has already died of cholera in Moscow. The outbreak of cholera, a disease historically so prevalent in the country that 'cholera' is a common curse in spoken Russian, is the most recent of a wave of infectious illnesses in the former Soviet Union.</p>

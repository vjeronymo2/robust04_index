			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARKS PROPOSITION AND IRVINE'S FUTURE  </P> <P> Something is happening on March 6 that will have a great impact on our city.  Irvine voters will decide whether to add to the system of parks, recreational  and cultural opportunities we now enjoy.  </P> <P> In 1974, the voters of Irvine looked to the future. The two bond issues they  passed, the Parks Bond by 73.8% and the Bike Trail Bond by 71.9%, created  today's park and recreation facilities in Irvine.  </P> <P> Thanks to these visionary voters, we now have parks, lighted ball fields,  community centers, an Olympic Aquatic Complex, the Fine Arts Center and the  soon-to-open Irvine Theatre.  </P> <P> Now it is our turn to look to the future, just as Irvine's voters did in 1974.  It's our turn to ensure that our parents, children and children's children will  continue to be well-served by the city of Irvine.  </P> <P> On March 6, we will be voting on "Proposition Parks," a ballot proposal that  will authorize money to build new projects, enhance existing ones, and provide  funds to maintain and operate the new facilities without need for any further  tax increases.  </P> <P> "Proposition Parks" is a comprehensive, full-spectrum proposal with a total of  27 projects planned throughout Irvine. The cost to each Irvine household will  be $10 per month, or about 33 cents per day, per household. This is a "total  cost package" that includes all construction costs, maintenance costs and  operational costs. It is a package that guarantees each project's quality.  </P> <P> The choice is ours to make. For 33 cents a day we can buy a can of soda for our  household, or we can add parks, biking/hiking/riding trails, cultural  activities, more lighted athletic fields, and landscaped park areas for picnics  and activities for all our citizens.  </P> <P> LARRY AGRAN, MAYOR  </P> <P> SALLY ANNE SHERIDAN, COUNCIL MEMBER  </P> <P> City of Irvine  </P></p>

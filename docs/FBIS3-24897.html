This request by the Democratic Party [DP] follows seesaw  talks between the government, the ANC [African National  Congress] and the Freedom Alliance. Dr. Zach de Beer of the DP  said it was unacceptable that South Africa's future was being  established behind closed doors by these groups while the  country was hovering on the brink of chaos. Dr. de Beer said  that all South Africans were demanding to be informed fully.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Equity Issues: Flow of new issues set to tail off as US demand weakens THE FLOW of new equity offerings, which reached a record volume in the first half of this year, was boosted by a constant stream of deals from the US, where companies took advantage of a bullish stock market to rebuild their balance sheets. Of a total Dollars 13bn of international equities launched in the first half, offerings by US companies accounted for Dollars 5bn, according to IFR Securities Data. In the US market, US companies raised Dollars 41.3bn. But in recent weeks the depressed state of the world's stock markets has taken its toll on the international equities market, and the strong US component of the market is now under threat. Investors have become increasingly disgruntled with the performance of deals launched earlier this year, with US initial public offerings (IPOs) down by an average of about 8 per cent, according to bankers. The cancellation of a large Dollars 600m initial public offering by Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the soft drink manufacturer, is the most significant of a series of pulled or postponed deals. However, the market is not closed, but rather has become highly selective. 'There are two trends: a flight to quality and an acute sensitivity to valuation,' said one banker. Some bankers point out that the new issues market normally experiences a seasonal lull in the summer, even without depressed stock market conditions. Still, a number of US IPOs with international tranches are under way. The planned offering for Revlon, the US cosmetics and consumer group, has been halved but is going ahead at just under Dollars 200m (or 11m shares). The deal will be priced shortly. The US tranche is arranged by Merrill Lynch and the international portion by Credit Suisse First Boston. Meanwhile, Equitable Life, the US life insurance company, hosted roadshows in Europe last week for its Dollars 544m IPO, arranged by Goldman Sachs. The deal is expected to be priced next week. Among other US IPOs, Computervision is planning a Dollars 300m deal, via Lehman Brothers and GTec Holdings, a lottery operator, is preparing a Dollars 150m offering, via Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette.</p>

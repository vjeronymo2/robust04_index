			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Californian farm yields at high water mark - Unrestricted irrigation and cheap immigrant labour give growers a big advantage / Farmer's Viewpoint WHEN BRITISH farmers discuss crop irrigation, they talk in terms of sprinkling inches of water per acre. Maximum applications, even in a dry summer, add up to the equivalent of about 6 inches of rain in a season, and that is only normally used on crops like vegetables and potatoes. Californian farmers, whose agriculture I have been studying for the last few days, speak of 'acre feet' of water. It is not uncommon for them to apply four or five feet of water to every acre of their land in a single season - eight to ten times as much water every year as UK farmers do occasionally. That said, the combination of all this irrigation with the reliable, warm, dry climate enables Californian farmers to produce prodigious yields and quality from what is essentially an area of marginal farming land, in other words a desert. Moreover, California claims to be by far the biggest producer of farm products of all American states, including Texas. The fact that water can be applied at will, whenever needed, means that the state can produce about 250 different farming commodities and, again in a US context, it is the most significant producer of 30 of them. It does most of that on just 8 per cent of the 40m hectares (100m acres) in the state, as only flat valley land is irrigated. Furthermore, the state's propaganda says California exports almost Dollars 5bn worth of its gross agricultural product of Dollars 20bn. Each Californian farmer is said to feed 129 people, 97 in the US and 32 in other countries. There is little doubt that many feel it is their right and privilege to feed the world. At least that is the way they are begining to feel again this year. A year ago they were still suffering from a drought that had lasted for 6 years and reduced production. The shortage of precipitation was not so much over California itself, because most of the state gets only a few inches of rain in a year. It was the lack of snow in the High Sierra and Rocky Mountains that was the main cause of the problem. It is the melting snows from these peaks that is trapped by a series of enormous dams as it flows down the white water rivers each spring and is then distributed via a complex network of canals providing the water for much of the irrigation as well as for the fast-expanding cities on the west coast. Last winter however, there were heavy snows in the mountains and significantly more rain than usual over much of California. For the first time since the mid-1980s many farmers are able to use as much water as they need for their crops and they have regained confidence that their extravagant ways can continue. The predominant method of irrigation is by the flood system - pumping water from open ditches and furrows between the rows of crops until it soaks into the soil and reaches their roots. It is undoubtedly the cheapest and most primitive method of irrigation, dating back to biblical times. But it is also vulnerable to the greatest waste of water by evaporation in the hot sun. A few farmers are using more economical sprinkler systems and some have installed even more efficient drip irrigation, most appropriate for fruit or nut orchards. But it is clear that most are buying their water cheaply enough not to feel they need to adopt more economical methods. Indeed it is well known that some still have a number of years to run on water leases for which prices were fixed nearly 40 years ago. Meanwhile, those farmers not fortunate enough to be alongside one of the many canals that cross the valleys and who have to pump their irrigation water from deep bore holes are reporting that they have had to double the depth of their wells over recent years to find sufficient supplies. And the deeper the well, the more the electricity or fuel oil is needed to pump water out of it. These are the people who are taking more care to conserve. I confess that I had expected that pressure from environmentalists, which finds animated expression among many influential west coast residents not a million miles away from Hollywood, would have forced California's farmers to go greener. But in spite of publicity to that effect this does not seem to be the case. Except for small but noticeable pockets, there appears to be little attempt by individual Californian farmers to address the environmental concerns of the urban population. The landscape across the productive valleys is almost devoid of vegetation save for massive crops of cotton, sugar beet, alfalfa and the like, and, as with so much of US (and European) society, the guiding rule seems to be: 'If it's there, use it and let the future take care of itself.' I am bound to say that, given the urban expansion of California, which is as great each year as in many Third World countries, and the inevitable increased demands this will impose on water resources, I did not share the confidence of some of the farmers I met that all would be well for them in the future. And without virtually unlimited supplies of cheap water every year, most of them would be out of business. The other benefit that Californian farmers currently enjoy is cheap labour. Apart from the farmers themselves few white people work on the land. Virtually all the labourers are Mexicans who have come across the Rio Grande in search of work. Some of the workers are legal with proper work permits, especially since the US government announced an amnesty a few years ago to enable the illegals to become legal without penalty. But since then it is estimated that at least a further 2m illegal workers have come into the US and the authorities have bowed to the inevitable and turned a blind eye to most cases. At least half of these new illegal immigrants are estimated to come to California for seasonal work, and although farmers claim to provide them with reasonable minimum wages and conditions, they concede there are far too many workers chasing too few jobs each year and employers would be saints if they paid more than they had to under those circumstances. Whether this will change if and when the North American Free Trade Agreement is signed and Mexican workers are allowed even freer passage is unclear. Although it seems unlikely that they will be able to find a better or more convenient state in which to seek work than California. It occurs to me, as I continue my tour, however, that these benefits of cheap, essentially subsidised water and cheap, partially illegal labour, are factors which are unlikely to be considered by the negotiators of any settlement in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aiming to produce fair agricultural competition throughout the world. Yet these hidden subsidies will give Californian farmers an enormous economic advantage over their European cousins.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE COVER  </P> <P> Call it a "Ties" breaker.  </P> <P> After seven successful years, NBC and the cast of "Family Ties" will part  company as the final episode of the Emmy-winning series airs Sunday at 8 p.m.  on Channels 4, 36 and 39. The show debuted Sept. 22, 1982; a photo from the  early days is shown on the cover, along with a picture from later in the run.  </P> <P> In the finale, titled "Alex Doesn't Live Here Anymore," Wall Street-bound Alex  (Michael J. Fox) accepts a lucrative job with an investment banking firm, a  decision that packs an emotional wallop for the rest of the Keatons.  </P> <P> Originally scheduled for one hour, the final episode will be extended an extra  10 minutes by NBC to include seven additional minutes of dialogue and three  minutes of spontaneous farewells by cast (Meredith Baxter Birney, Michael  Gross, et al.) and crew.  </P></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / If my memoirs serve me well ..: The Westland affair is now seen as the turning point in Margaret Thatcher's career as prime minister. What really happened? Malcolm Rutherford compares her ministers' competing accounts of one fateful meeting IN THE middle of 1985 parts of the British government became embroiled in a small argument about helicopters which, by the turn of the year, almost brought about the downfall of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. As Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, wrote in this space a month ago in his review of Lady Thatcher's The Downing Street Years: 'In many ways, the turning point of her tenure was the Westland affair.' Westland was a small aircraft company desperately in search of orders. Michael Heseltine, the defence secretary, saw the solution in a European consortium. Leon Brittan, the secretary of state for trade and industry, preferred to let the Westland management go its own way and seek arrangements with the American company, Sikorsky, and the Italian Fiat. The affair led to the resignation of both ministers, and perhaps had other consequences besides. At least a dozen former cabinet ministers have given accounts and recollections in their memoirs. Lord Howe's will be published next year. The outstanding omissions are the principal protagonists, Heseltine and Brittan. Even without them, however, there is some intriguing material. What follows is not an attempt to make a political point, still less to reconstruct in any detail what really happened, but simply to draw attention to the frailty of human memory and the way different people have recorded the same event. Nicholas Ridley, the transport secretary and a man who liked to regard himself as especially close to the prime minister, got the date wrong. 'I have a clear memory of the first cabinet in 1986 after the Christmas recess, on January 16,' he wrote in his book 'My Style of Government': the Thatcher Years. In fact, the crucial cabinet meeting, during which Heseltine left the government, took place on January 9. Where Ridley comes closer to the general consensus is in noting that it was 'one of the most extraordinary events I have ever witnessed.' Some cabinet ministers did not even get to see it. Lord Hailsham, the lord chancellor, recalls airily in his memoirs A Sparrow's Flight: 'I was not present on the famous occasion when Michael Heseltine stormed out of cabinet and announced his resignation on the steps of Number 10 since my duties had taken me to Delhi at the time to attend a Commonwealth meeting of Speakers or law ministers.' The only moral Hailsham can draw from what he calls 'histrionic performances of this nature' is that 'they should not normally happen without a formal discussion based on one or more cabinet papers'. He adds helpfully: 'My own view is that, on taking office, cabinet ministers should be given a short formal induction course in staff duties by the Sir Humphrey Applebys of the system. I learned mine in the war.' Lord Young, the employment secretary, was almost not there. He was on holiday in the Caribbean when the call to the meeting came. He was told that he could be excused but 'gained the impression that Mrs Thatcher would need all the friends she could get'. In his book The Enterprise Years: A Businessman in the Cabinet he tells of how he chartered an aircraft to Miami which nearly crashed on take-off. In Miami he found that the credit limit on his Visa card did not stretch to a seat on Concorde. Lord Young made a scene, prayed to Lord King, chairman of British Airways, and was allowed on board. Norman Fowler, the social services secretary, might as well not have been there. He recalls in Ministers Decide: A Memoir of the Thatcher Years that he was in Washington on official business when he received the summons to the cabinet meeting. He arrived back in London at 10 pm on Wednesday January 8 and was briefed (not very well, it seems) on the car phone. At the meeting next morning, Fowler was 'still slightly jet-lagged.' 'I sat in my usual place,' he notes, 'three or four down from the centre of the table facing the prime minister. On my immediate right sat Michael Heseltine. Although ending in unprecedented drama it was at no stage a stormy meeting.' Fowler was still puzzling about some earlier remarks 'when Michael's folder closed and he left the table'. At least Fowler had the excuse that since he had not been a member of a cabinet committee on Westland, he could not be expected to know too much about it, though he might have read about it in the newspapers. Another man who may have dozed off with rather less excuse was Lord Whitelaw, the leader of the House of Lords and deputy leader of the Conservative Party. Whitelaw admits in his own Memoirs to having become 'bored and irritated' by the Westland affair very early on. He writes that he thought the problems of the Westland Aircraft Company were being tackled by a 'powerful new chairman, Sir John Cuckney.' 'As 1985 drew to a close,' he goes on: 'I could never understand why the government should dispute the Westland board's judgment under Sir John.' According to Lord Lawson's book, which we shall come to later, Whitelaw had become jaundiced by Heseltine some years earlier for bringing 'modern gimmicks like massive computer print-outs to to the cabinet table and generally trying to blind us with science'. Of the famous meeting on January 9, Whitelaw remarks: 'I was thus surprised and amazed when he (Heseltine) decided to walk out of the cabinet.' Then, in a typical Whitelawism, he adds: 'I regretted his departure, because it takes all sorts to make a cabinet.' He concludes, in sharp contrast from some others: 'It was one of those incidents which, despite the furore at the time, had no lasting impact.' Nevertheless, Whitelaw confesses subsequently to blaming himself for what happened. He did not play his normal role of conciliator because he says he plainly believed one side to be right. With hindsight he should have 'helped the prime minister more by stressing the vital doctrine of cabinet responsibility . . . I should have realised earlier that Michael Heseltine was labouring under what he regarded as a genuine grievance at a time when I thought he had merely become obsessed with his own proposals and arguments.' Certainly other, younger cabinet ministers were struck by Whitelaw's passivity. Kenneth Baker as environment secretary was the most junior member of the cabinet at the time. For him January 9 was going to be an important day anyway. He was due to present his green paper on 'Paying for Local Government' (ie the poll tax), which was perhaps why other ministers were prepared to give the meeting a miss: Fowler in particular suggests that he might not have returned from Washington for the original cabinet agenda. When the agenda was changed and the January 9 meeting went awry, Baker notes in The Turbulent Years: My Life in Politics: 'I was amazed that not one of the experienced older ministers such as Willie Whitelaw, Quinton Hogg or Geoffrey Howe, who had heard these exchanges, said or did anything to avert Michael's walkout.' Either Baker or Hogg has made some mistake for, as we have seen, Hogg (otherwise known as Lord Hailsham) has said he was in Delhi not Downing Street. Lord Whitelaw has stated the reasons for his own reticence. Whether Howe could have intervened effectively, given the deteriorating relations with the prime minister, is questionable, though we must await his account. Yet Baker offers some corroborative evidence on what happened. He writes that while the first 30 minutes of the discussion had gone reasonably well, 'new life was breathed into the whole issue by Nick Ridley intervening about the ministerial statements that Michael had made off his own bat'. This, Baker suggests, is what led to the climax. Baker's account here is backed by Ridley several times over. The prime minister had said that Heseltine should make no further statements on his own account without clearance by the cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong. In My Style of Government, Ridley wrote of Heseltine's resistance to the new ruling: 'This was too much for me. I immediately challenged him on the lines that if we who held one view were to conform, surely he who held the opposite view should conform too? Michael Jopling (then the agriculture minister) came in behind me, and then I pressed him a third time. Twice he refused to agree. At the third time of asking, he closed his cabinet folder and said, 'I cannot accept this decision. I must therefore leave this cabinet.' He stormed out, and announced his resignation to some startled journalists waiting in Downing Street.' The problem with the Ridley version of events, however, is that it omits most of the undercurrents. Ridley may have lit the fuse, but the few who were close to events had a pretty good idea that drama was under way. The fullest accounts of the Westland affair by cabinet ministers are those by Lady Thatcher in The Downing Street Years and by Lord Lawson, who was chancellor of the exchequer, at the time, in The View From No 11. They are quite different from the rest in that they go into the background and help to explain the scene that burst on an astonished cabinet. As both Lawson and Lady Thatcher make clear, there had been several meetings between senior ministers about Westland since mid-June 1985. Norman Tebbit, who was then secretary of state for trade and industry, had been instructed to encourage the Bank of England to bring together the company's main creditors with the aim of finding new management: hence the emergence of Sir John Cuckney. The trouble was that all sorts of other issues became intertwined. Lady Thatcher calls this section of her memoirs 'Keeps Raining All The Time'. The Tory Party was going through one of its periodic bouts of unpopularity. First there was the cabinet reshuffle in September. Norman Tebbit moved (willingly) from the DTI to the party chairmanship; Leon Brittan moved (rather less willingly) from Home Secretary to be Tebbit's replacement. Most of the memoirs agree that being taken out of the Home Office  - traditionally one of the great offices of state  - gave Brittan a sense of insecurity. Then there was the prime minister's rising impatience with the ministry of defence, especially over its failure to deliver the Nimord early warning system at the right time and the right price. Not least there was Michael Heseltine. Cecil Parkinson writes in his autobiography Right at the Centre that 'Michael detested Mrs Thatcher.' For her part, she was none too sure about Michael, although she pays him a generous enough tribute in her memoirs: 'Michael is one of the most talented people in politics . . . Michael and I are similar in some ways, very different in others.' She adds that Heseltine's personality alone  - 'not mine or any other member of the government's - provided a kind of explanation for what arose'. It was when Heseltine insisted on seeking a European solution in spite of the installation of new management at Westland that the warning signals should have gone out loud and clear. They went to very few people. Lawson, who as chancellor was naturally opposed to spending government money, records the meeting of the economic affairs committee of the cabinet on December 9, at which Cuckney was present for part of the time. According to Lawson, the committee was offended by the prime minister bringing in outsiders. 'Margaret was visibly shaken by the degree of support, which included Norman Tebbit, for Michael's plea to be given a chance. While the balance of argument was clearly against Michael, sentiment was with him.' The prime minister subsequently played with the idea of sacking Heseltine, but decided it would be impolitic to do so. To cap it all, just before the January 9 meeting there was a huge row between the chancellor and the prime minister over exchange rate policy. Again very few members of the cabinet knew about it. On January 8, Lawson agreed with Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, that interest rates should be raised from 11 1/2 to 12 1/2 per cent 'forthwith'. The prime minister eventually acceded to their virtual ultimatum that rates should go up but, in Lawson's words, only after 'prolonged resistance' and with 'conspicuously bad grace'. This was hardly the best atmosphere on the eve of a cabinet meeting which practically all the participants were to agree was the most remarkable they had ever attended. Lady Thatcher has a different view. She writes magisterially in The Downing Street Years: 'I have learnt that other colleagues at the meeting (on January 9) were stunned about what had happened. I was not. Michael had made his decision and that was that. I already knew whom I wanted to succeed him at defence: George Younger.' (It remains unclear whether Younger had been advised in advance). On the question of whether Heseltine went to the meeting having decided in advance to resign, Lady Thatcher does not know. The only memoir which claims that he did is Ridley's, and even that is with hindsight. 'At the time,' Ridley wrote, 'I came to the conclusion that he was obsessed by his desire for the European solution . . . I think in retrospect he was determined on taking a course of action that would lead to a spectacular resignation, and that this was the best issue he was able to find . . . He thought that the next election might well be a disaster and he wanted . . . to distance himself from a sinking ship.' Lady Thatcher, incidentally, does not support the Ridley claim that it was he who made the decisive intervention. According to her version, most of the crucial talking was done by Heseltine and herself. 'I emphasised the importance of observing collective responsibility . . . At this Michael Heseltine erupted . . . He could not accept the decision recorded in my summing up. He must therefore leave the cabinet. He gathered his papers together and left a cabinet united against him.' Then, she writes, she called a short break and walked through to the private office. 'Nigel Wicks, my principal private secretary, brought George Younger out; I offered him, and he accepted, the defence post. I asked my office to telephone Malcolm Rifkind to offer him George's former post of Scottish Secretary, which he too subsequently accepted. We contacted the Queen to ask her approval of these appointments. Then I returned to cabinet, continued the business and by the end of the meeting I was able to announce George Younger's appointment. Within the cabinet at least all had been settled.' No-one else records events going as smoothly as that. Lord Young, who like some of his colleagues may have been nodding off, 'suddenly noticed that Michael had closed his papers'. Young reports Heseltine's parting words as 'Prime Minister, if this is how it is to be, I can no longer serve in your cabinet.' He adds that after an embarrassed silence the cabinet carried on with the next item on the agenda. The coffee break was called a few minutes later after a private secretary had passed a note to the prime minister. Young gave a more colourful account to Alan Clark, then his junior minister, by lunch-time. 'David recounted to me the scene,' say the Clark Diaries for January 9. 'Michael appears to have done it semi-spastically, not the grand geste. When he slammed his brief shut and walked out a lot of people just thought that he'd been a bit rude and then gone out to the loo. But the photographers were all waiting in Downing Street, so he must have tipped them off in advance.' Lord Lawson has it that the prime minister had set out to 'humiliate' Michael in the full knowledge that this would almost certainly lead to his resignation. At the January 9 meeting, Heseltine 'spoke quietly, and not at all aggressively, and sought to find some compromise arrangement. But Margaret was adamant. She could see that Michael was now isolated in cabinet . . . She pressed home her advantage; whereupon Michael slammed his cabinet folder shut, saying 'If this is the way this government is going to be conducted, I no longer wish to be part of it', picked the folder up and strode out of the room.' Lawson adds that in the 'stunned silence that followed' the prime minister announced a short break for coffee. This, according to Lawson, was to enable her to brief Bernard Ingham, her press secretary. Kenneth Baker has Heseltine closing his red ministerial folder 'with dignity' and his parting words as: 'There has been a breakdown of collective responsibility and I must therefore leave the cabinet.' At the coffee break, he writes, Willie Whitelaw, John Wakeham (the chief whip) and George Younger stayed behind in the cabinet room. I had the distinct feeling that the defence secretary's vacancy had not caught them unawares.' In the Norman Fowler account, Heseltine 'quietly closed his folder, said he could not continue as a cabinet member, and walked to the door . . . Cabinet continued in a rather shell-shocked way for another 90 minutes. The only unusual feature was that we were given an unprecedented coffee break after Geoffrey Howe had finished his report on international affairs . . . Michael's resignation had taken everyone, including the press, by surprise. He had left Downing Street with only a solitary photographer there to record the moment.' One account by someone not present at the cabinet meeting, but who was certainly close by, comes from Bernhard Ingham in his book Kill the Messenger. When Heseltine walked out of cabinet on Thursday 9 January 1986, he records, 'I had to dispatch every press officer into Whitehall to try to establish what he had said from reporters telephoning their copy from kiosks . . . His resignation took us by surprise.' Ingham adds that he had a telephone call from his brother from his farm in the upland Pennines saying: 'All you silly bloody lot down there have gone daft.' And There is a footnote from somebody who was certainly present, but will not write about it. The now Lord Armstrong told me the following weekend that the prime minister tried to make light of the matter by saying after the walkout: 'Now let's talk about something simple, like the common agricultural policy.' But even the cabinet secretary thought that it was the most extraordinary meeting he had ever attended.</p>

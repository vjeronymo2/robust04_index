			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil Equities retreated to close 3.1 per cent down in light trade on the Sao Paulo bourse as investors sold on concern about probable government restrictions on foreign funds into the country and a possible higher minimum wage. The Bovespa index fell 1,509 to 47,587. Brazil's real declined sharply against the dollar in the commercial foreign exchange yesterday as players rushed to the US currency after the news of possible restrictions. The real closed 1.3 per cent down at RDollars 0.858 to the dollar after the central bank sold dollars in the market to help the local unit. The approval yesterday by a Lower House committee of a proposal to increase Brazil's minimum wage to RDollars 100 from RDollars 70 as of December also weighed on prices.</p>

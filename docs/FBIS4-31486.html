			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- Romania's Supreme  Council of Defense has elaborated a document titled An  Integrated Concept on Romania's National Security, which makes  an analysis of domestic and external risk factors, as well as of  the general principles of Romania's defense doctrine.    Established on 14 December 1990, under a law adopted by  Parliament, Romania's Supreme Council of Defense assumed  responsibility to analyze the state of national security and to  approve organizational structures and rules on the functioning  of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI]. The council gathers  the country's president, the prime minister, and several members  of the executive (the defense minister, the minister of the  interior, the foreign minister, and so on,) the head of the  president's political analysis department, the director of the  SRI, the chief of the Foreign Information Department [DIE], and  the chief of general staff.    The document elaborated by the Supreme Council of Defense  views as domestic risk factors "a negative influence that the  lack of national political consensus can have on major issues  confronting Romania," "the lack of will to solve conflicting  interests between various social groups to the national interest  and in a democratic manner," as well as the decline in  production, the devaluation of the national currency, the budget  deficit, the high rate of inflation, the growing rate of  unemployment, and so on.    "Even if the risk of a foreign armed aggression has  considerably diminished, threats are still persisting generated  by pressure and foreign interference directed against Romania's  sovereignty, independence, integrity, and territorial unity,"  the document reads.    The supreme council's document enumerates among the external  risk factors: The losing of several traditional markets and  sources of strategic raw materials, the emergence of  preferential areas of financial and commercial influence, signs  of revisionism, attempts to approach the issue of the borders,  higher pressure and actions from abroad having in view the  granting of collective rights to national minorities, tendencies  favoring artificial self-rule in several areas on ethnic  criteria, the uncertain evolution of the situation in the former  Soviet territories, the expansion of the conflict in the  territory of former Yugoslavia, and so on.    The chapter titled National Security Strategy stipulates  that  "Romania has its own military potential for the military defense  of the country." The defense of national interests is ensured  "by its own forces," but "political, economic, and military  support coming from states or international bodies supporting  its cause would be welcome." The document reads that "the  Romanian state is viewing no state as potential enemy," pointing  out that under no circumstances Romania is to be the first to  start military action and shall not allow use of its force for  such actions.</p>

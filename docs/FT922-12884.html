			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Alcoa of Australia drops 41% ALCOA of Australia yesterday blamed depressed metal prices for a 41 per cent reduction in net profits to ADollars 64m (USDollars 49.2m) for the first quarter to end March. Sales revenue was down 27 per cent to ADollars 478m. The company said aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange rose by USDollars 122 per tonne to an average of USDollars 1,266 during the quarter, well down on the average price of USDollars 1,537 during the first quarter of the previous year. Mr Robert Sleagle, managing director, said there had been some improvement in the company's US and European order books, and noted that metal inventories in the hands of producers had fallen in March for the first time in many months. Mr Sleagle said the industry was 'still bouncing along the bottom'. He said the company's first-quarter profit was adequate in the circumstances. The directors said conditions in the industry were particularly difficult, and forecast that it would be some time before conditions improved. As a result, full-year profits would be below last year's level. Alcoa paid a first-quarter dividend of ADollars 60m in March, compared with ADollars 100m in the first quarter of the previous year. It paid ADollars 400m last year, but is unlikely to match that in the current year. Alcoa of Australia is 51 per cent owned by the Aluminium Company of America, and 48.25 per cent by Western Mining Corporation, the Australian resources group. The balance is owned by QBE Insurance.</p>

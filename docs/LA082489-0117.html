			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUROR ERUPTS OVER CLAIM BY INSURANCE COMPANIES  </P> <P> A furor erupted Wednesday over a bill adopted last year by the Legislature and  signed by Gov. George Deukmejian that some insurance industry lawyers are  saying should be construed as allowing the companies a rate of return on auto  insurance twice the 11.2% standard set by Insurance Commissioner Roxani  Gillespie.  </P> <P> The insurers are making that argument in filings with Gillespie's office  seeking to justify their current rates.  </P> <P> But if Gillespie agrees with the industry arguments, a Consumers Union official  contended, she will authorize huge increases in auto premiums when she gains  the authority to approve future rates beginning Nov. 8.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys), the author of the legislation, insisted in  interviews Wednesday that he did not realize that his bill would be interpreted  in that fashion and he said he will seek next week to revive a bill that he  says will clarify the original legislation's intent.  </P> <P> However, just the day before, on Tuesday, Bane had agreed to put his  clarification bill over until next year. Wednesday, he charged that he had been  misled by "those stinking little so and sos" in the Assn. of California  Insurance Companies, the state's leading insurance lobby, into believing that  it was safe to wait that long.  </P> <P> Ed Levy, an official of the association, responded that his lobbying group does  oppose the Bane clarification. He said it is satisfied with the 1988 bill's  language as an expression of state policy. But he said of Bane's claim about  being misled, "I didn't mislead him. You're darn right I didn't."  </P> <P> Bane's 1988 bill was described at the time as an excess profits bill to force  companies to rebate premiums to customers if the insurers realized an  underwriting profit of more than 5%. (Underwriting profit is the difference  between total premiums collected and all company expenses, including claims  paid.) Underwriting profits seldom reach the 5% level in the California auto  insurance business. Most of the companies' income is derived instead from  interest on investments made with the premiums collected. Bane's bill did not  mention investment income.  </P> <P> But the bill contained a provision stating: "The Legislature has determined  that the prima facie reasonable rate of return for underwriting of private  passenger automobile insurance is an after-tax profit of 5% of earned premium."  That language was amended into the bill by Bane in the last days of the  legislative session.  </P> <P> In a recent rate filing with Gillespie, attorneys for the Allstate company  contended that this language sets state policy and "translates into returns on  equity for Allstate of 27.8% for auto liability and 18.4% for auto physical  damage."  </P> <P> This would average out to at least twice the 11.2% standard Gillespie has  enunciated in recent news conferences as constituting the "fair rate of return"  the state Supreme Court told her in May should be applied to premiums under  Proposition 103.  </P> <P> An Allstate spokesman said Wednesday that actually the company lawyers were not  arguing for a rate of return as high as 27.8% and were merely reminding  Gillespie that this was the figure determined as fair by state authorities.  </P> <P> The spokesman said Allstate had noted in its filings that the commissioner  might set an overall rate of return for auto insurance as low as 19%.  </P> <P> This would still, however, be higher than what the insurers are getting now,  and morethan 70% higher than Gillespie's 11.2% standard. A Consumers Union  official, Judith Bell, said Wednesday that her organization has heard other  companies' lawyers are picking up the Allstate argument.  </P> <P> Deputy Insurance Commissioner Ray Bacon said, meanwhile, that he had discussed  the matter with Bane and that the assemblyman "didn't realize this was in his  bill. He forgot to include investment income."  </P> <P> Bane said he indeed had been unaware what his bill would do, and Wednesday  afternoon asked state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) to put his clarification  bill back on his committee calendar for next week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rosenfield's Demand  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in another development in the insurance issue, Harvey Rosenfield,  head of Voter Revolt and author of Proposition 103, demanded, in the wake of  Gillespie's statements Tuesday that hundreds of insurance companies are likely  to be exempted from rate rollbacks, that Deukmejian either fire Gillespie or  explain why he continues to support her.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's press secretary, Kevin Brett, responded:  </P> <P> "Who's Harvey Rosenfield? We haven't heard of him. The last time we checked he  was not a member of the governor's senior staff. If he thinks the governor is  going to take his advice, he's dreaming."  </P></p>

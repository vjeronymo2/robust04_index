			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / BA prices Russian venture at Dollars 900m BRITISH AIRWAYS expects the development of Air Russia, its new Moscow-based joint airline venture, to cost up to Dollars 900m, Sir Colin Marshall, BA chief executive, disclosed yesterday. The overall investment to set up the new airline would include Dollars 100m in equity, another Dollars 100m in new terminal construction costs at Moscow's Domodedovo airport, and the balance in working capital and aircraft funding. BA will hold a 31 per cent stake in the venture with the remaining 69 per cent held by Russian partners including the international commercial division of Aeroflot, the Domodedovo division of Aeroflot and the Russian Republican Innovation Fund. Sir Colin, speaking at an FT aerospace conference in Berlin, said that Air Russia was expected to start operations in 1994 or possibly even earlier. The new venture would create about 1,000 jobs. The airline plans initially to operate a fleet of seven jet aircraft with the Boeing 767 the most likely candidate. Sir Colin said the project had survived the political turmoil following the break-up of the Soviet Union last year. The joint venture's newly constituted board held its first meeting last January in Moscow. 'I do not suppose that throughout the complex and colourful history of air transport has an airline company been formed against a more extraordinary background,' Sir Colin said. BA and its Russian partners plan to make the proposed new terminal at Domodedovo airport the base of an international east-west airline hub. The new airline would operate flights from Moscow to western Europe, North America and Asia. It could also eventually operate domestic routes in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Sir Colin said the biggest problem facing the venture was regulation. 'Russia and the other CIS states must regard the re-establishment of a sound and stable organisational structure for civil aviation a priority,' Sir Colin said. This would require the devolution of Aeroflot, the former Soviet carrier, and the creation of a comprehensive regulatory framework to encourage growth and development.</p>

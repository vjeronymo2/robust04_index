			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / TV people meter alarms Japan's networks Times are tough for Japan's television networks. Advertising revenues have fallen for two consecutive years, the competitors - satellite and cable television - are getting stronger, and all this is happening as growth in the number of viewers has become stunted. Now the networks face another headache: the people meter. Already used in the US and Europe, the people meter is the new television ratings system by AC Nielsen Japan, the Japanese arm of the US television rating and marketing group. By providing more precise and timely information on who is watching what, the device can change the country's television advertising market, the second largest in the world at Y1,589bn (Dollars 16.05bn), by influencing programme schedules and advertisement rates. The concept of television viewer ratings and its use for advertising rates was brought to Japan by Nielsen in 1960. However, Dentsu, the largest advertising agency, and the leading networks set up their own ratings company, Video Research, two years later, which now holds a virtual monopoly in Japan. With the people meter, Nielsen wants to regain its foothold. The meters are also damaging for the networks because they can give advertisers more bargaining clout in what is already a buyers' market. When the people meter was launched in the US in 1988, US networks, which offer ratings guarantees to advertisers, incurred sharp earnings falls because they were getting lower Nielsen ratings than they were used to. Nielsen's announcement earlier this month of its plan to introduce the ratings system in Japan in November has triggered an outcry from television networks. The commercial television networks' association last week demanded that Nielsen retract its plan, saying the group's credibility would be hurt if it failed to do so. Mr Yasuhiro Urushido, an executive at a leading network and vice-chairman of the association's committee on individual ratings argues that the people meter had yet to be tested sufficiently. He also complains that a consensus had yet to be reached between the potential users of the system - the networks, advertisers, advertising agencies and the viewers. However, corporate advertisers are behind the company. The Japan Advertisers' Association has given the people meter its endorsement. Corporations have become frustrated with the current ratings system based on households and supplemented by information on individual viewers based on diaries in which viewers list the programmes they watch. Foreign advertising agencies, trying to break into the tightly guarded Japanese market, have also welcomed Nielsen's move to provide fast, target-group-oriented data. The household ratings system gives automated data from 3,600 households across the nation. However, the system fails to supply ample information to advertisers wishing to target a certain age or gender group. Meanwhile, the diaries, filled in by individual viewers for one week per month, rely on the memories of those who can bother to keep them up to date. Nielsen's system requires every viewer to push a button on a machine on top of the television each time he or she watches television. Each member of a Nielsen family will have a separate button, and a heat sensor which can detect the number of people in front of a television set will beep a warning if the number of buttons and viewers do not match. The networks' association argues that the people meter still relies on the diligence of the viewers to press the buttons, adding that the reliability of the sensors are yet to be proven. It is unlikely, however, that opponents of the system can prevent Nielsen starting its service. Although the networks say they will not allow advertisement rates to be based on Nielsen's ratings, they cannot stop corporate advertisers from referring to the figures. An official at a US-based advertising agency says: 'Ratings are like a currency in the industry. The stronger and more widely used one usually wins.'</p>

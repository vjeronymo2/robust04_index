			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities vacillate in thin year-end trading Wall Street US share prices ended mixed yesterday as investors adjusted their portfolios to finish the year, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 6.06 to 3,833.43. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 0.31 to 461.17, the American Stock Exchange composite rose 1.74 to 431.36 and the Nasdaq composite gained 7.07 to 749.53. Volume on the NYSE was 251m shares. The market was volatile in light trading. The Dow moved up and down from positive to negative territory several times during the day. There was no apparent reason for market movements on the penultimate day of trading this year because most economic data was generally within the range of economists' forecasts. The index of leading economic indicators rose 0.3 per cent in November, according to the commerce department, although analysts had expected an increase closer to 0.1 per cent. Initial unemployment claims fell 3,000 to 322,000 for the week ending December 24, according to the labor department. Although not considered among the most important economic indicators, the figures are viewed as a preview of all-important unemployment statistics due out next month. The bond market, which fell on Wednesday, was mostly flat, in part because it found some support from the dollar which bounced back from Wednesday's lows. Gibson Greetings, which dropped Dollars  3/16 at Dollars 14 9/16 , announced that it would cut the full-time workforce at its corporate and greeting card division by about 5 per cent, or 128 positions. Apple Computer gained Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 39 1/2 after reports that a company, partly-owned by Olivetti, had announced a clone of the California-based computer maker's Macintosh model. Other technology shares were also mostly higher. Hewlett-Packard rose Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 102 1/4 , Dell Computer climbed Dollars 1 5/16 at Dollars 41 15/16 , Compaq Computer was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 40 1/4 and Gateway 2000 rose Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 21 3/4 . Digital Equipment lost Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 34 1/8 . Intel gained Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 64 3/8 after Merrill Lynch increased its estimate of the company's earnings. The news brought up prices of other semiconductor companies, as it suggested that there would be no long-lasting implications from Intel's mishandling of public relations related to a flaw in its Pentium chip. Micron Technology rose Dollars 1 at Dollars 45 1/8 and Analog Devices was up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 35 1/8 . Telmex ADRs continued to rebound. The stock closed up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 42 3/8 .

The value of CDollars 368.1m was down from yesterday's CDollars 420.7m. Mexico Equities closed up 3.14 per cent spurred by President Ernesto Zedillo's address to the nation in which the replacement as finance minister of Mr Jaime Serra Puche by Mr Guillermo Ortiz was announced. The market advanced rapidly before he started to speak just before the market close. According to preliminary official information, the Mexican market's key IPC index closed up 73.34 points at 2,411.06. Volume totalled a moderate to heavy 1.6bn new pesos, on 125.3m shares traded. Brazil Shares closed up 3.8 per cent in moderate trade on the Sao Paulo stock exchange boosted by a strong buying spree by pension and equity funds squaring their portfolios ahead of the New Year Day holiday.

Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles) has  entered an alcohol rehabilitation center, a spokesman for Senate President Pro  Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) confirmed Friday.  </P> <P> Steven Glazer said the 57-year-old Greene checked into a Southern California  clinic shortly before the Legislature ended its summer recess Monday.  </P> <P> "I do not know his return. I expect him to be here for the end of the session,"  Glazer quoted Roberti as saying.  </P> <P> The Legislature is scheduled to adjourn Sept. 15.  </P> <P> In July, Greene acknowledged that he is an alcoholic and revealed that in the  past, he had attended legislative committees with a "full tank of liquor in  me."  </P> <P> At Roberti's urging, Greene said he had joined Alcoholics Anonymous and checked  into a rehabilitation program but withdrew after four days.  </P></p>

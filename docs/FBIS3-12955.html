Talks then centered on the peace process in the region,  as well as the EU delegation's mission on its current tour.

I met with  President Hafiz al-Asad in my capacity as chairman of the EU  Council of Ministers. I also met with Vice President  'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. A  cordial and warm atmosphere prevailed in all these meetings. He  added: At these meetings we discussed a series of issues,  foremost of which is the situation in the region, the  possibility of promoting the peace process, and EU- Syrian  relations. Papoulias also said: In my capacity as Greece's  foreign minister, we discussed bilateral relations. The results  of these talks were very good, and I will convey the concepts  and views of the Syrian leaders to my colleagues, the foreign  ministers of the EU member states. All these views are very  important and will help us make decisions at the EU regarding  future steps we will take.</p>

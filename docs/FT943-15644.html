This was one of a number of factors demonstrating renewed health of the smaller-company sector, The minister was launching the Department of Trade and Industry's first annual review of the state of small companies in Britain. Applications for loan guarantees rose in the first quarter to 500 a month from 300 a month in the same quarter last year. The scheme is designed to support companies that either lack security or sufficient track record to raise bank finance. However, the failure rate for companies supported by the scheme remains high.

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Weak UK finances may limit tax cuts THE WEAK STATE of the UK government's finances, which may limit room for tax cuts in the Budget, has been underlined by a figure for public- sector borrowing last month which far exceeded City expectations. The Treasury said yesterday it needed to borrow Pounds 1.2bn in December to meet spending commitments, despite raising Pounds 1.8bn from the sale of BT shares. Last month's high figure can be explained partly by weak economic activity reducing government tax revenues. In addition, the recession has increased government spending on measures such as unemployment benefit. The financial pressures are likely to reduce the options open to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as he considers possible cuts in income tax in the March Budget. Some believe a package of this kind could turn out to be a vote winner for the Conservatives. Better news for Mr Lamont came with separate figures showing only a 0.1 per cent increase in the retail-prices index between November and December, the lowest figure since July. Although the headline inflation rate last month rose to 4.5 per cent, from 4.3 per cent, the scale of the rise suggests inflationary pressures are weak. Mr Lamont believes the decline of such pressures could aid a recovery later this year. Last month's public-sector borrowing requirement contrasted with the surplus of Pounds 800m that the City had expected. It followed a low PSBR of Pounds 536m in November, and contrasts with a Pounds 244m surplus in December 1990. The PSBR for the first nine months of the financial year ending in March now stands at Pounds 10.5bn, the same as the Treasury's forecast for the full year. Many economists believe the government may face a PSBR for the full year of about Pounds 12bn, and with a figure of perhaps twice this in 1992-93. The Inland Revenue collected Pounds 5.89bn in taxes last month, against Pounds 6.76bn in December 1990. Corporation-tax income, payable on companies' profits, was Pounds 690m in December, compared with Pounds 622m in November and Pounds 1.19bn in December 1990. Inflation rises, Page 4</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The faction of the Russian Liberal-Democratic Party  of the State Duma expressed sharp protest against the article by  Yegor Gaydar "Stavka na negodayev" "Stake on Villains" published  in the newspaper IZVESTIYA on May 17 in which the leader of the  Russia's Choice faction stated that all "classic signs of a  fascist party, ideology, and personality exactly apply to  Zhirinovskiy and his Liberal Democratic Party."    A statement of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] made  public  in the State Duma on Wednesday draws attention to the fact that  Gaydar addressed these and many other insults to deputies of the  Liberal Democratic Party faction, all members of the party and  12 million voters who cast ballots for this party in elections  December 12, 1993.    Gaydar's reforms, which turned out to be unsuccessful in  conditions of a socialist political economy "made 90 percent of  Russian citizens miserable and suck all blood out of the body of  the great power during "the shock therapy" period, authors of  the LDP statement note. "As for your ethnic policy it would be  better if you leave the State Duma and move to live to the  Caucasus or Central Asia -- any Russian living in these regions  would be glad to exchange apartments with you," the statement of  the Duma's LDP faction transferred to INTERFAX says.    The faction also believes that the intensive activities of  Yegor Gaydar aimed at retaining power, will finally lead to  "Russia becoming the first multi-party fascist state in the  world."</p>

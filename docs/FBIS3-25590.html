"If it means going to war  to keep what is mine, then we'll go to war."    The prominent rightwinger, who is also the officer  commanding  of the Northern Natal Boerekommando said in an interview in  Newcastle on Tuesday: "It's no secret that we're training  them... We have trained them offensively".    Newcastle ANC leader Mandla Cele said he was aware of  training sites in the district and had requested the  Transitional Executive Council to act against them.    Mr Veenendal, who described himself as the Orde Boerevolk's  chief of staff, would not reveal the camps' whereabouts or  details, and refused reporters access to them. "We can not rule  out the possibility of war. We're preparing for war," he said  at a rightwing rally in Newcastle on Tuesday.    Earlier, he marched into the local ANC offices and delivered  to a surprised Mr Cele a declaration claiming "the area of  northern Natal as a volkstaat". "You are the aggressors," he  charged, before marching out of the office, dressed in a brown  military uniform and armed with a pistol.    His declaration said northern Natal had been acquired by the  Boere nation through "honest hard work" and through negotiations  with the Zulu nation. Anyone who attempted to deny the Boere  nation this right would be regarded as an aggressor and would be  met with the necessary reaction.    Questioned later on the volkstaat's boundaries, Mr Veenendal  said: "From here to Richards Bay." "Anything that differs with  the Zulu nation, we'll take up with the king."    He said the Boere nation had always had an amicable  relationship with Zulu people, hence his involvement in training  them.    Mention of ANC support among Zulus was met with rejection  from Mr Veenendal: "The ANC is not a factor. The ANC cannot  make a claim, where is their support?" "Their support is  through intimidation and the build-up of arms caches."    He claimed Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC  military wing] members and commanders had been "sent here from  outside" for the "onslaught".    On concessions regarding the demand for a volkstaat, Mr  Veenendal said: "I don't need the ANC's concessions, it's my  volkstaat."    On elections, Mr Veenendal said a mood of defiance was  growing in the district and "I don't see them (a newly elected  government) governing". "It's one thing being a government and  another thing governing," he said without elaborating.</p>

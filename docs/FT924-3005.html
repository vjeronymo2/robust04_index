			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Haiti puts itself high on the US agenda: Canute James on a foreign policy headache for the new president THE FEAR of a huge influx of people from Haiti into the US is pushing the country up President-elect Bill Clinton's foreign policy agenda, as pressure grows to resolve Haiti's plight. Mr Clinton's statements that he would allow Haitians to apply for asylum in the US have been viewed in Haiti as a softening of the Bush administration's approach, and the green light to a new wave of boat people. This has raised the pressure for Mr Clinton to break the logjam over Haiti prompted by the overthrow of former President Jean Bertrand Aristide by the army 14 months ago. The Organisation of American States and the US have railed against the Haitian military and imposed an economic blockade, but have been embarrassed by their seeming impotence. Meanwhile, Mr Aristide is becoming embittered and has not hidden his frustration at the fact that he is not yet back in the presidential palace, appearing to doubt the sincerity of the public commitments of several governments. Associates of Mr Aristide have expressed hope that Mr Clinton will make more effort than Mr George Bush to resolve Haiti's constitutional, political and economic crisis. They have already asked his advisers to try to involve the European Community and the United Nations in efforts to force the military leaders to accept Mr Aristide's return. The OAS secretary general has asked Mr Michael Manley, a former Jamaican prime minister, to jump-start negotiations for a return to constitutional government in Haiti. Mr Manley is seeking the support of several countries to get the UN involved, and is reported to have already secured commitments from Venezuela, Canada and France. One of the first aims is to get more countries, especially EC members, to support the economic sanctions imposed against Haiti by the OAS, but which have been, at best, sieve-like. It is Mr Aristide's hope that the Clinton presidency will be more firm with the military leaders, which explains his reluctance to participate in discussions with Mr Manley and emissaries of Mr Marc Bazin, the figure-head prime minister of the Haitian military. Contact with the Haitian authorities would give the country's rulers some degree of respectability, say Mr Aristide's aides, at a time when international pressure on Haiti will increase. The army's leaders also appear to have lost their patience with Mr Bazin, whose mandate was to negotiate not the return of Mr Aristide, but the ending of the embargo. Should he be sacked it would signal an end to military efforts to find a diplomatic solution. Mr Aristide's supporters in Haiti would not take this lightly. The military is funding its oil and other necessary imports through a return to the lucrative use of the country in the transshipment of narcotics. Known supporters of Mr Aristide have been abused and some murdered, and human rights agencies have concurred that dissenting voices are harshly silenced. Amnesty International said civilian authorities were 'totally unwilling or powerless' to stop torture, executions, arbitrary arrests and other human rights abuses that had become part of daily life in Haiti. Army leaders have said privately that Mr Aristide will not be allowed back into the country under any circumstances. Their public position, articulated by Mr Bazin, who came a distant second to Mr Aristide in the presidential election just under two years ago, is that there is room for compromise. Mr Aristide, maintains that senior army officers will be tried for treason or sent into exile when he returns to office. Any effort by Mr Clinton to bring the military into line, and undertakings such as Mr Manley's, will have to overcome positions taken by people such as Gen Raoul Cedras, the army leader, who said recently that Haiti's problems should be resolved by Haitians, and not by 'meddling from overseas'.</p>

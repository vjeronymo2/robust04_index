			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Fusillade ends Baghdad festivities ANTI-AIRCRAFT fire lit up the sky over Baghdad late last night. An air raid siren to the south was the only warning of an attack on the capital, before the guns opened up. As residents rushed indoors anti-aircraft shells and tracers crossed the sky for 15 minutes in brilliant yellow and red patterns. The Rasheed Hotel in central Baghdad, where delegates to an Islamic conference and foreign journalists are staying, was badly damaged. A crater at least 10ft deep lay gaping in the garden and the blast ripped through the main lobby, killing at least one person. Fifteen people were believed injured. 'I don't believe this is happening to us again,' said one Baghdad resident during the raid. Earlier in the day he had been in the streets when, with drums beating, torches burning and chants of 'Down, Bush' and 'Long Live Saddam', thousands of Iraqis had held well-orchestrated demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the start of the Gulf war. With only a few days left of Mr George Bush's presidency and Mr Saddam firmly in power, the feeling during the marches was one of victory for the Iraqi leader. It is a mood the anti-aircraft batteries are likely to have changed.</p>

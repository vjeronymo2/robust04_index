			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Newsreel" program] </F>   [Text] Referring to the agreement with the PLO, Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that if the negotiations are  resumed, we can reach an agreement within one month.    [Begin Rabin recording] I was aware that Hamas and the  Islamic Jihad on the Palestinian side will do everything to  intensify terrorism and kill Israelis--and I stress Israelis,  and my intention is Israeli Jews and non-Jews. Furthermore, I  was aware that there is friction, and there was friction, with  settlers, particularly with the most radical--the members of the  Kakh and Kahane Hay groups and their supporters. But I admit it  was difficult to imagine that such a hideous murder would be  perpetrated by an Israeli--and what is more, one who wears a  cap. I did not imagine that there would also be an Israeli  Hamas or Jewish Hamas. I appeal to the Palestinians and their  leadership in Tunis: I understand the pain and the anger.  Don't allow a lone Jewish murderer who killed Palestinian  Muslims just for being who they were, during prayers, to destroy  the prospect for peace. [end recording]</p>

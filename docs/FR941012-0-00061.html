			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters agreed that the personal protective equipment specified in the proposed rule should be used. (Ex. 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;64, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;16, 9&hyph;20). Some commenters urged OSHA to require that the employer be responsible for providing all PPE (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;13). They said that only if the employer provided the PPE could he assure its quality, design and maintenance. However, many other commenters opposed requiring logging employers to provide certain types of PPE, and their opposition focused primarily on logging boots (Ex. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;17, 9&hyph;18; Tr. W1 74&hyph;75, 110, 177, OR 22, 79, 205, 262, 441, 533, 632, 701). Many commenters did not give any reason why the employer should not be required to pay for PPE. Other commenters contended primarily that employers would be financially burdened if they had to pay for certain high cost PPE, such as individually-fitted and non-reusable logging boots, in an industry that has such a high turnover rate. Other reasons for not requiring the employer to provide certain types of PPE were the use of certain PPE by employees outside the workplace, and industry custom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters noted that employee turnover in the logging industry is very high (Ex. 5&hyph;11, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;56, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;65, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W1 74&hyph;75, 110, 177, OR 22, 79, 205, 262, 441, 533, 632, 701). Some commenters also indicated that employees sometimes work only one or two weeks before leaving, often taking jobs at another logging establishment (Ex. 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. OR 78). These commenters argued that it would be unfair to require employers to pay for expensive logging boots given the high turnover rate of the logging industry. One commenter said:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [I]t frightens us to think that we might be providing a $300 pair of boots for a man that's there a week (Tr. W1 74).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These commenters also contend that for some PPE, particularly logging boots, employers might have to buy new PPE every time they hire a new employee. First, this would be necessary because terminated employees do not return PPE they are issued (Ex. 5&hyph;45). Second, these commenters argue that, unlike PPE such as ear muffs and head and leg protection, logging boots are an item of PPE that cannot be reused by other employees because of size and hygienic concerns (Ex. 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;62, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;21; Tr. OR 78). Because logging boots cannot be worn by other employees, these commenters said employers view logging boots as ``personal clothing.'' In addition, these commenters said that even if employees did return their logging boots, new employees would be unwilling to wear used logging boots. One commenter said:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Suppose a new employee comes to work in the spring and finds he can't or doesn't want to be a logger so he hands in his $200 boots with two weeks wear and tear and leaves. Is the next guy going to accept ``used'' boots someone else wore? (Ex. 5&hyph;78)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters said that requiring employers to pay for new PPE, primarily logging boots, for each new employee would place a considerable financial burden on employers (Ex. 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 9&hyph;15; Tr. W1 74, OR 78, 350). They said the cost would be particularly burdensome for small establishments that comprise the vast majority of the logging industry. Their basis for this conclusion is that logging boots are very costly, ranging from $60 to $400 a pair (Ex. 5&hyph;45, 9&hyph;15; Tr. W1 74, OR 78, 350). In addition, they said employees need two to three pairs of logging boots a year. The commenters, however, did not present any financial or economic evidence as to the burden (e.g., effect on profits, sales, etc.) on the industry as a whole, and particularly small employers as a group, of providing logging boots.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said employers should not be required to pay for logging boots that are used by employees away from workplace (Ex. 5&hyph;39). This commenter said employees take their logging boots with them when they seek new employment (Ex. 5&hyph;39). He also said employees use their logging boots for hunting and cutting their own wood (Ex. 5&hyph;39). In contrast, the record shows that other types of PPE (e.g., leg protection, safety glasses and hearing protection) remain with the employer, therefore, they are not used away from the workplace (e.g., Ex. 5&hyph;32). In addition, one commenter said that these types of PPE are already being provided by many establishments as standard industry practice (Ex. 5&hyph;32).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

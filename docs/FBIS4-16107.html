			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From April 14, EESTI SENUMID, p 1; "News Bulletin" No. 71] </F>   [Text] The Riigikogu [parliament] approved amendments to  the law on the basis of the ownership reform. The economic  commission merged three draft laws on amendments in one. The  amendments concern compensation to bone fide owners who had  purchased property to be returned to legal owners and  municipalization of state property.    The law on the National Library was approved with 51 votes  in  favour and 20 against.    The debate of the law on political parties was suspended at  the second reading. The law stipulates, among other things, that  a party must have at least 200 members to be registered, and  that parties represented in the Riigikogu will receive state  funding proportional to the number of seats.    The draft law on auxiliary police was referred to the third  reading. MP Jaanus Betlem ("Fatherland") pointed out that the  rights and responsibility of the auxiliary police officer were  not balanced. MP Kristiina Ojuland ("Fatherland") recommended to  reject the draft law. Interior Minister Heiki Arike regretted  that the disputes started immediately prior to the approval of  the law.    A draft law on amendments and additions to the law on the  basis of the ownership reform and the law on dwelling-houses  reached its first reading; the amendments will guarantee the  rights of tenants in a building to be returned to a former owner.    The draft laws on amendments to the law on the use of  proceeds of privatisation of state and municipal property, on  the state border and others passed their first reading.</p>

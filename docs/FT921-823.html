			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Trouble in Docklands OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the Canadian property developer, made a fortune in the 1970s by turning a derelict area at the base of Manhattan into the hugely successful World Financial Centre. In trying to repeat the trick in London's Docklands O &amp; Y has hit trouble. Much of O &amp; Y's colossal office development at Canary Wharf is unlet and the developers are discussing their difficulties with about 200 banks. The question is what, if anything, should be done to influence the outcome in the wider interests of the capital. The problem is not simply one of hubris and bankerly excess. Docklands, the largest urban redevelopment project in Europe, came into being because London's political institutions had failed. It was the chronic inertia of local Labour-run boroughs that led Mrs Thatcher's first government to set up a special development zone in the abandoned docks. As the project progressed, mistrust between central government and Labour local authorities became all out war, culminating in the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986. It is hardly surprising that in these circumstances, relations between the development corporation and neighbouring Labour boroughs deteriorated or that strategic planners were ignored. The consequence was a catastrophe of infrastructure provision; Docklands lacks effective road and rail links to the nearby city. Only belatedly were plans laid to build new roads and to extend London Transport's Jubilee Line through Docklands. An immediate difficulty is that O &amp; Y's promised commitment of Pounds 400m to the Jubilee Line extension is in doubt. Relaxed rules Canary Wharf's prospects were also hurt by the City's relaxation of its planning rules to allow a further 20m square feet of offices in the Square Mile. As a result the City has an unprecedented office vacancy rate of 20 per cent and rents on empty office space have halved. It is tempting to argue that O &amp; Y and the banks should be left to extract themselves from the mess. Since much of the bank debt was advanced by Canadian and other foreign banks, O &amp; Y's problems are unlikely to pose a threat to the stability of the British banking system. Lower office rents are also a good thing, from the point of view of London's competitiveness as a financial centre. That would have been no more than a marginal consideration in the 1980s. But the City's competitive edge, which used to rest substantially on a light regulatory touch in wholesale markets, is now under threat as other European countries deregulate their financial markets. London's financial services sector may continue to grow through the 1990s, but its share of international finance will probably decline. Narrow view The government, however, cannot afford a narrow view. Docklands, for all its faults, is crucial to the task of rebuilding east London's economy. This is desirable in its own right and essential if planning pressures in overcrowded west London are to be tolerable in the next economic upswing. Also, if Docklands cannot be made to work, there is no hope at all for the more ambitious east London corridor project. That project is in turn the key to connecting London efficiently to the Channel Tunnel, a task which the government has thus far addressed with dismal lethargy. Whoever wins the general election will therefore look east from Westminster and see towering problems. The parties have proposed radically different blueprints for overhauling London's government: direct rule from Whitehall by the Conservatives and a new Greater London Authority from Labour. Neither has clear views on what should happen to the Docklands Development Corporation when its remit expires in the course of the 1990s. London desperately needs clear thinking and resolute action on these complex strategic questions. Meanwhile, the government must ensure that the Jubilee Line project is safeguarded. The banks will argue that it is not for them to stump up the cash promised by O &amp; Y. Yet their overriding interest lies in ensuring that the building finds tenants to fill the 40 per cent of space that remains unlet. Without that, loans will not be serviced and repaid. On this, at least, the government can afford to take a hard-nosed line.</p>

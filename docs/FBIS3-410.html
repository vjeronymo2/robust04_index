Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said this in a  statement on Saturday [5 March], after talks with the homeland  government about the possibility of it entering the election.    Welcoming the registration by the Inkatha Freedom Party and  the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front], through the  Vryheidsfront [Freedom Front], Mr Meyer said the government was  still waiting for the African National Congress's  recommendations about international mediation. "Aspects that  must still be cleared out include the aims of international  mediation, how it will be embraced, how long-winded it will be  regarding the constitution itself, what the process and  structure will be and who will be invited to become involved in  it."    Mr Meyer said once it had been established what  recommendations had been made, the government would be able to  give attention to the matter. "The government still believes  specific recommendations about the improvement of the  constitution can still be achieved in direct negotiations  between parties, and that international mediation is not  necessary. Negotiations emanating from agreements between  involved parties will honoured, with an eye open for amendments  to the constitution by the new parliament, after elections."</p>

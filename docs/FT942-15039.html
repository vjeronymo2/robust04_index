			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Fund seeking support for new issue of SDRs The International Monetary Fund is looking for new ways to make its idea of expanding global foreign exchange reserves more palatable to the industrialised countries by spreading the expansion out over five years. IMF managers are expected next week to ask finance ministers from member countries, as they have at each of their twice-yearly formal meetings for the last three years, to think again about a new issue of special drawing rights, the basket of currencies that the Fund uses as its own accounting instrument and which also functions as an international reserve asset. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, has repeatedly called for a new allocation of SDR36bn (Pounds 34.3bn) to member countries, arguing that many countries - especially those in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union who have joined the IMF since it last issued new SDRs in 1981 - are desperately short of currency reserves. These new members have no SDRs in their reserves, but older members have been reluctant to pass on any of their own SDRs. The IMF's statutes forbid a restricted issue of SDRs to only some members. In the face of continued hostility to the issue from Germany, the US and the UK, which fear the injection of new reserve assets could fuel inflation around the world, IMF officials have drawn up a scheme to allocate only SDR16bn at the outset, adding SDR5bn more each year until international reserves have reached the desired level. 'It would be a distinct mistake for the world not to avail itself of an SDR allocation at this moment. There is a huge number of countries with insufficient reserve assets, and a huge number of countries whose import capacity is constrained by lack of reserves,' a senior IMF official said. Officials have been dismayed at the difficulty of extracting money from the industrialised countries to finance development through instruments such as its enhanced structural adjustment facility (Esaf), which lends money at very low interest rates to the poorest countries. They argue that an SDR allocation would help to finance development ends by monetary means, rather than drawing on scarce budgetary resources and requiring a protracted parliamentary debate in donor countries. Parliamentary debate would, however, be necessary in many countries for a further plan for industrialised countries to give back their share of an eventual SDR allocation to the IMF, to help finance the developing countries and the transitional economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. IMF officials acknowledge that the idea of an SDR allocation is unlikely to come to fruition any time soon, but insist that it is making progress 'at a respectably slow pace'.</p>

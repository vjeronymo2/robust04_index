			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Airwaves sale bonanza for Washington The US Federal Communications Commission has received applications from 74 companies, consortia and individuals to bid next month in its auction of broadband wireless telecommunications frequencies, which it expects to be the largest ever auction of public sector assets. The licences are to run the personal communications services which are expected to compete with today's cellular telephone technology. Applicants, who need not necessarily bid and must still make an up-front payment by November 18 if they want to take part in the auction, include all the regional Bell telephone companies, long distance telephone companies such as AT&amp;T and Sprint, and cable television groups such as Cox, TCI and Comcast. But other companies such as EDS, the computer services subsidiary of General Motors, and Excelsior Parking have also applied to take part in the auction. EDS submitted applications mostly in small and medium-sized markets, avoiding large metropolitan areas. So has Mr Craig McCaw, the founder of McCaw Communications, the leading cellular telephone company which he sold to AT&amp;T. In general, Mr McCaw chose to bid, through his company ALAACR Communications, for markets in which he knew he would not be competing with AT&amp;T, but both are listed as applying for the Buffalo market. Some 23 bidders submitted incomplete applications, and have a week to amend their filings. The FCC conducted its first auction of spectrum frequencies in July, raising Dollars 617m in bids for narrow band frequencies for advanced paging services - although several of the largest bidders later defaulted. Another auction for regional advanced paging licences is now in its 25th round of bidding, with high bids totalling Dollars 394m. The broad band auction, due to start on December 5, is expected to be much bigger than these and could take more than a month to complete. The FCC's innovative auction rules allow applicants to bid by computer on all the available licences at the same time, so they can change their bidding strategy to target a different region if they see their first choice as too expensive. The 51 regional markets attracted an average of 26.5 applicants each, with 20 companies submitting applications for Los Angeles and 22 for New York. Applicants for the large New York market will have to pay an upfront fee of Dollars 15.8m by November 18, while the 34 bidders for the tiny American Samoa market will have to pay only Dollars 28,200. A company bidding for nationwide licences would have to pay Dollars 150m upfront. In the past, the US has granted frequencies either on the basis of public hearings or by lottery. The auction is expected not only to raise money for the government, but to bring down prices for the consumer by awarding competing licences in each area. 'We have made two fundamental changes: we are not giving away the rights, and we are not giving away monopolies,' said Mr Reed Hundt, the FCC chairman.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Business Law: The end of the hostile bidder MERGERS AND acquisitions have returned to business news headlines in the US, but the latest transactions are different from those of the 1980s. Large US and foreign corporations have for the most part replaced leveraged buy-outs (LBO) promoters and other financial buyers as bidders. The main reason is that financing for large LBOs and other non-industrial acquisitions has virtually disappeared. Whether friendly or hostile, these new bidders do not seem to be primarily interested in breaking up companies or drastically altering them for quick financial returns. The acquisitions that have been announced or completed so far in the 1990s probably have much to teach us about the likely future of acquisitions for the remainder of the decade. The friendly acquisition of MCA by Japan's Matsushita is a key recent example of an acquisition by a foreign company based on industrial rather than financial considerations. Among strictly US acquisitions, the hostile bid for NCR by AT&amp;T, already more than five months old, has many features in common with the first hostile acquisition of the 1990s, the successful bid by Georgia Pacific for Great Northern Nekoosa. Neither bidder had ever launched a hostile bid before and both were motivated by industrial concerns. Moreover, both bidders were capable of financing their bids from their own cash flow and assets. In other words, they did not have the difficult burden of assuring their lenders of untroubled access to the cash flow and assets of the target. In both instances, intense legal battles and proxy contests ensued, but price was the likely factor in the outcomes. Although a patient, well-financed, 1990s' bidder is unlikely in the long term to be thwarted in a hostile offer, hostile bids appear to be as expensive today as they ever were in the 1980s. A key reason is that takeover defences remain effective. State statutes and court decisions strongly favour defence. In addition, there is a large amount of legal and market pressure on target boards of directors to demand high prices. For bidders, on the other hand, there is the real risk of overpayment. Friendly bidders are not immune from the overpayment problem. This is not surprising since the markets for hostile and friendly bids are closely connected. Rupert Murdoch, for example, was recently quoted in the FT as saying he had overpaid by Dollars 1bn (Pounds 0.50bn) in his Dollars 3bn acquisition of Triangle Communications, the publisher of TV Guide. There are still no perfect takeover defences and there are unlikely ever to be any. Neither state legislatures nor courts would like to appear to be blocking all takeovers without regard to price. For example, in Delaware, by far the most important state for the incorporation of large public companies, there is concern that if perfect takeover defences were ever available, institutional investors might successfully push the administration and Congress towards federal intervention. This could take the form of a federal law of incorporation which would eliminate one of Delaware's main sources of revenue. In particular, it is highly unlikely that state legislatures or courts will do anything that would eliminate the importance of proxy fights. For one thing, in the US, the right to vote shares is closely associated with freedom of speech. Proxy fights during hostile bids have picked up considerably in importance in the past few years. The advantage they offer is that they allow a bidder to elect its own board of directors to circumvent takeover defences. Much more important, boards tend to abandon defences and negotiate in the face of a likely defeat in a proxy fight. The disadvantage of proxy fights for bidders is that they are slow and expensive. Staggered boards of directors, in which only a third of the seats become vacant each year, are an obstacle in a proxy contest. In theory, it could take two years or more to gain control of a target's board. In practice, however, the prospect of losing a third of the board usually leads to capitulation. NCR has a staggered board. The AT&amp;T victory in the March 28 vote was an important factor in convincing the remaining directors that it was futile not to negotiate with AT&amp;T. None the less, the stiff NCR defence appears to have gained its stockholders an additional Dollars 20 per share. Last year, in a surprising move, the legislature of Massachusetts held an emergency session to pass a special, highly unusual, law requiring companies incorporated in Massachusetts to have staggered boards. The legislation was an unabashed attempt to help a local manufacturer, Norton, fend off a hostile bid from BTR. Although Norton's defence against BTR was notably anti-foreigner, Norton, facing an unsuccessful proxy fight with BTR, eventually allowed itself to be taken over, at a much higher price, by a French white knight, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain. On the bidders' side, legal rules also contribute to high prices. There is no urgent legal pressure on US bidders to avoid paying high prices. While directors or target companies have to worry about personal liability for defending too blindly or accepting too low a price in a friendly deal, directors of bidders have little reason to be concerned about personal liability. Moreover, indemnification and liability insurance affect the two kinds of directors differently. Bidders' directors, even if found liable, are likely to be indemnified by the corporation without question. Target directors, on the other hand, face the likelihood after a takeover of a costly fight with the new owners of the corporation and directors and officers' liability insurers to obtain indemnification or insurance coverage, unless they settle before the takeover is completed. There is still no perfect way to protect an agreement for a friendly acquisition of a public company from higher, competing hostile bids. In the 1980s, anyone planning a friendly acquisition or merger had to worry about competition from highly aggressive, effective financial bidders. However, today, likely sources of competition are usually limited to other industrial bidders and their number appears to be sharply reduced. For example, Matsushita faced no competition in its bid for MCA. And no competing bidder has emerged for NCR. A quick comeback for financial bidders is unlikely for a long time. The machinery for doing 1980s-style leveraged acquisition deals has been largely dismantled. Lenders' and investors' attitudes have turned chilly and the political atmosphere for financial bidders is negative due to the insider trading scandals and disillusion with leverage. Prospects for the success of domestic and foreign industrial bidders are much more favourable because of the elimination of the highly potent, flexible competition from financial buyers. However, a cheap dollar should not be considered an advantage for foreign bidders. Cheap dollars paid by foreign bidders get cheap dollars back. For foreign bidders who want to speculate that the dollar will appreciate, there are simpler, less risky ways than acquisitions. Nevertheless, a surge in hostile bids by foreigners in the US is unlikely. In the past, most bidders from countries other than Britain wisely avoided hostile bids in the US. A proliferation of hostile foreign bids would probably result in a swift negative political response. Companies in countries such as Japan or Germany are particularly vulnerable because their industries are highly competitive with US industries and widely believed to be protected from hostile foreign bids and, in the case of Japan, other forms of foreign competition. Hostile bids by foreigners, therefore, are likely to remain scarce. On the other hand, there are plenty of opportunities for friendly, negotiated acquisitions in the US, at high prices.

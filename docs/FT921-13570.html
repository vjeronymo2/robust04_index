			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: WI Shipping suspends operations WEST INDIES Shipping Corporation (Wisco) has suspended operations after the seizure of two of its vessels for unpaid bills. The line, owned by the governments of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), was being prepared for privatisation when it cancelled its schedule. Government officials say efforts will be continued to sell the company to private business in the Caribbean. The shutdown will adversely affect the Caribbean Community's efforts to increase intra-regional trade. Wisco traditionally carried over 80 per cent of the goods traded among Caricom members. Mr Charles Pennycooke, general manager of the company, said the line's recent troubles were caused by the failure of the shareholders to pay over USDollars 7.5m which they had committed to the company. One vessel was impounded in Miami because of outstanding payments of Dollars 95,000 for leased containers, while another was impounded in Antigua because of overdue payments of Dollars 80,000 in agent fees. The vessels were released after shareholders provided Dollars 250,000 to settle outstanding bills. The line's third vessel is under mandatory docking in Trinidad. The shareholding governments agreed six months ago to pay off the outstanding liabilities of the company so that it could be sold. The company has, however, received only a half of the promised funds, including the recent payments to secure the release of the impounded vessels.</p>

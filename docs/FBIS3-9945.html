			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Ignacio Mayorca] </F>   [Text] During a news conference in the presence of the 100  members of the Inter-American Defense College's [CID] Class 33  currently visiting Venezuela, Brigadier General Alvaro Rafael  Barboza Rodriguez, Joint Staff operations director, reported  that between 50 and 60 tons of various drugs circulate through  Venezuela annually.    The CID director and U.S. Army Major General James Harding  said that the students come from 14 countries on the continent.  CID courses last 10 months, beginning in July. "This is an  opportunity to exchange views and get to know these countries a  little better. It is a very simple project," he said.    In halting Spanish, Maj. Harding said that according to data  supplied by CID and the Inter-American Defense Board, which he  leads also, terrorism and drug trafficking are the major threats  to the continent's security. "We should strive jointly to find a  solution to the drug trafficking problem, which goes beyond  borders and helps the entire world. The cooperation of all  governments is required," he said.    In the morning Harding paid a courtesy call to Defense  Minister General Rafael Montero Revette. The CID members will  fly to Colombia on Thursday.    Gen. Barboza, former commander of the Venezuela unit which  operated in Honduras and Nicaragua on pacification duties, was  selected by the Defense Ministry to make a general assessment of  the "military situation" in Venezuela. He described as a threat  the use of Venezuela as "a springboard for the traffic of drugs  to Central America and their final destination, the United  States." An estimate of the quantity of drugs circulating  through Venezuela was made by the National Guard. "Only 10  percent of this quantity is seized. This gives an idea of the  seriousness of the problem," he said. He also reported on the  discovery of marijuana and coca plantations in the Perija  Mountains and areas close to the Colombian border. Money  laundering "has been detected essentially in four areas:  Tachira; Zulia, near Maicao; Caracas, through real estate  operations; and the country's eastern region," he said.    He recalled that the most successful years in the  counternarcotics struggle were 1991 and 1992, when 11.981 tons  and 12.681 tons, respectively, were confiscated. In 1993 the  drug seizure level again was close to 3 tons, a figure similar  to that of 1990. Cocaine is the most often confiscated drug.  Next comes marijuana, 400 kg of which are seized annually. "The  fact that heroin is entering the local market again is  worrisome," he said.    The UN believes this is a worldwide problem. The number of  involved countries has risen from 64 in 1990 to 138 in the first  half of 1993.    Gen. Barboza announced that this year the Armed Forces will  put two flight control radar sites into operation. One of them  will be located in Falcon State and cover the country's central  and western region. The other, located in Nueva Esparta, will  serve to monitor flights between the country's central and  eastern regions. These sites are being installed through  agreements with U.S. counternarcotics agencies, such as DEA,  CIA, and others. "These sites will be operated jointly with our  Armed Forces," he said.    This illegal activity can be monitored more effectively by  observing the flight patterns of the drug traffickers' planes,  that is to say, speed, altitude, time, and routes, as well as  the types of planes used. A special overflight program,  originating in Panama and reaching Peru and Bolivia with  observers aboard, is being set up. Special surveillance  operations can be conducted at the request of the Venezuelan  Government or the U.S. Southern Command.</p>

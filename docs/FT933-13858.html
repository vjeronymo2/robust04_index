			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties advance Recent buoyancy in the property sector swelled into a wave of support as investors vied to take advantage of attractive yield rates and a shortage of stock pushed up prices. As gilts have strengthened and their yields have fallen back, the appeal of property has increased and share prices were boosted as big investors crowded into an area with few sellers. More upbeat signals moved the sector, with Savills, the chartered surveyors, predicting that there will be a shortage of office space in London in three years. And yet another successful rights issue further stressed the interest in property shares. The wave of excitement also triggered a resurgence of a number of bid rumours in the market. One trader commented that the optimism was likely to last: 'There has been a lot of good news but the sector is also very strongly underpinned.' Trading began very briskly in property stocks, although it trailed off a little towards the end of the day. British Land added 2 at 343p and Brixton Estates put on 8 at 210p. Great Portland Estates firmed 6 to 183p, while Frogmore Estates gained 10 at 394p as hopes rose that its recent rights issue would be a success. Burford, which announced a 98.7 per cent take-up of its rights offer, went up 2 to 69p. Peel Holdings, which plans to buy a minority stake in Manchester Ship Canal, climbed 11 to 244p. The latter was 5 higher at 26 1/2 p. Norcros hardened 2 to 154p after SG Warburg and NatWest Securities placed the rump of the recent rights issue. The two securities houses placed 38.8m shares at 151p. Heavy turnover in Cray Electronics left the shares 5 adrift at 149 1/2 p as one large shareholder sold a block of 7.6m shares - just under 4 per cent of the issued equity - to SG Warburg at 44p, the broking house selling the stock on at 46p. A shortage of stock early in the session drove Standard Chartered sharply forward for the second day in a row, the shares adding 16 at 843p in the first hour of trading. However, profit-taking later in the day saw most of the gain surrendered and the shares finished 6 up on balance at 833p. Lloyds Bank moved ahead 13 to 588p amid reports that some of the proceeds of Wednesday's big agency cross in Abbey National had been used to buy Lloyds shares. Volume was 4.3m at the close. Abbey finished 5 lower at 404p. TSB ended the session 3 firmer at 198p, with Swiss Bank Corporation said to be positive following a visit to the group. Wednesday's announcement of a new chairman at Simon Engineering continued to cheer the market and the shares climbed 6 to 50p. TT Group gave up 7 to 286p after announcing a Pounds 51m rights issue to help fund the company's expansion. BICC was in demand ahead of next month's figures and the shares appreciated 10 to 411p. Among motor issues, general profit-taking in Lookers saw the shares relinquish 11 to 143p. ERF Holdings continued to be powered by a recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing and the stock jumped a further 21 to 281p. General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange retreated after Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, reiterated its negative stance. Mr Graham Warren at the bank believes the earnings recovery will not be as fast or as sustainable as that predicted by many. In addition, he said: 'There is likely to be tougher competition from European companies in due course.' General Accident closed 7 cheaper at 617p, while GRE receded 3 to 199p. However, Goldman favours Commercial Union, 3 easier at 616p, and Royal Insurance, which shed 2 to 319p. International trading group BAT Industries continued to attract attention following Wednesday's 'buy' recommendation from Morgan Stanley. Volume rose to a hefty 14m, with most of that total said to have been a result of strong overnight US buying. The shares rose 9 to 427p, with NatWest Securities also said to have shown a keen interest in the stock. US buying of shares in transport rental company Tiphook reversed an earlier decline. At the day's worst the shares were down 15 at 244p, before recovering to end just a penny off at 258p. Positive trading news from Marks and Spencer added strength to a strong stores sector. M&amp;S gained 5 at 337p. Elsewhere, Kingfisher put on 9 at 583p, with Goldman Sachs said to be positive, while Boots climbed 5 to 422p. Coats Viyella, which is a main supplier of fabrics and soft furnishings to Marks and Spencer, moved up 6 to 234p. Forminster, the clothing manufacturer, advanced 25 to 538p in a thin market. Sherwood Group staged a rally after the previous day's fall, improving 9 to 144p. NatWest Securities, its broker, switched its stance from hold to buy. Welsh Water moved forward 9 to 562p after better than expected figures.</p>

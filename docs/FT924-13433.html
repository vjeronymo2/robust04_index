			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (18): A vision of the future - Broadband communication IT IS the year 2000. The basic tools of people working in offices are voice-activated terminals capable of mixing speech, text, data and full-motion, full-colour video at will. Connections between any of the world's business centres are virtually instantaneous. After work, people relax in their homes by accessing central video or audio databases containing all the films and music ever recorded worldwide: the conventional videotape and compact disc are endangered species. This is the broadband vision of the future. Billions of research dollars, not to mention the reputations of some of the world's foremost telecommunications, computing and networking companies, are being staked on efforts to convert the vision into reality. Scepticism is widespread, but the broadband beat goes on regardless. Broadband communication is basically about speed of information processing and transfer. Frame relay, a new, fast packet data transmission technology being introduced in around 14 European countries ranging from Czechoslovakia to the UK, operates at speeds up to 2m information bits per second. True broadband technology, such as asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), will run at speeds seventy times higher. Higher speeds do not simply mean that existing tasks can be transacted much faster. Indeed, it is probable that broadband technology will initially be cost-justified only in new, high capacity applications. Part of the challenge, according to Stephen Harbour, marketing director of GPT's Telecommunications Systems Group, is to identify these new applications. One starting-point for the broadband story is the recent and dramatic growth of personal computer-based local area networks, (LANs). To give an example, California-based Market Intelligence Research Corporation says that the European PC LAN market will expand from Dollars 6.8bn in 1991 to over Dollars 10bn in 1997 at a compound annual rate of 18 per cent. Following on from the expansion of the installed LAN base is the requirement to interconnect several LANs in remote locations, either as metropolitan area networks (MANs) or wide area networks (WANs). Existing LAN traffic can be interconnected by a variety of means. At relatively low speeds, LAN links use packet switched data technology, narrowband ISDN and bandwidth compression, in which signals are compressed so that more can be squeezed on to a telecom circuit. Bandwidth on demand, in which users dial-up extra capacity as and when it is required, is another solution. Operators in around 12 European countries presently offer this service, and talks are underway with a number of North American carriers to expand its availability. For very high speed LAN interconnection, industry has developed frame relay and what is termed the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI). The latter, from the US, is the fastest LAN standard so far devised, operating at 100m information bits per second. However, many experts do not believe that either frame relay or FDDI have the flexibility to support multi-media service. Multi-media is a method of transporting and processing text, data, images and voice, and presenting the results on a screen in an integrated format. 'Multi-media computing will soon take the world by storm and will have an enormous effect on how we do business in the next few years,' says Ralph Ungermann, president of networking specialists Ungermann-Bass at last year's Dataquest European Telecommunications Industry Conference. 'It will be what leads the networking industry, as well as the computer industry, into the next decade.' Multi-media will be used in interactive training, publishing, financial services, healthcare, point of sale and video conferencing, as well as in a whole range of general desk-top office applications. A study by the Frost &amp; Sullivan market research concern estimates that the European multi-media business was worth around Dollars 1.5bn in 1990 and will rise to Dollars 3.06bn by 1996. Ungermann-Bass believes that ATM is one of the best candidates to handle multi-media. The UK's GPT views ATM as a means of moving information around the public telephone network as well as presenting high bandwidth multi-media to the desk top - 'it's both a desk-top and a backbone trunk technology,' comments Stephen Harbour. Through its Stromberg Carlson affiliate, GPT and its partner Siemens have delivered trial ATM-like broadband systems to six US telecom carriers - MCI, PacTel, US West, Ameritech, Bell Atlantic and Southwestern Bell. The duo are also working on similar projects in Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Austria and Sweden. GPT has detected variations in the application of ATM from country to country. 'The US has focused exclusively on high-speed data applications, whilst Europe has had more emphasis on the universal use of ATM,' notes Mr Harbour. 'Different operators and users are initially using ATM to solve different problems.' One of the most ambitious ATM programmes anywhere in the world has launched in Japan; in early 1991, the country's dominant carrier Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) selected AT&amp;T International, Northern Telecom and Siemens, along with seven Japanese vendors, to jointly develop ATM equipments to function as main elements in its future broadband ISDN (B-ISDN). The original plan was to replace NTT's existing trunk telephone infrastructure by ATM-based B-ISDN facilities in the year 2005, and to furnish all subscribers with broadband access, through fibre optic connections to their homes, around ten years later. In recent months, NTT has been back-peddling on its B-ISDN plans, citing the dent in its profits caused by the operations of the country's enlarging base of competitive carriers. NTT is also thought now to be reluctant to carry Japan's estimated Dollars 260bn B-ISDN investment burden all by itself. Nevertheless, the company has begun experimenting with broadband extensions to its narrowband ISDN services. Among business offerings being trialled are 'soft' fax, which electronically files messages for display on a PC or electronic display board, data retrieval from an optical mass storage system at the rate of two seconds a page. For the general user, NTT is looking at video pay-phones, and imagery and voice stored in a central database which can be replayed as part of foreign language conversation lessons, or used in tourist information systems. NTT is a past-master at commercialising new telecom services, but a question mark remains over the extent and timing of the materialisation of a high volume, global market for B-ISDN services. GPT believes that, as will narrowband ISDN, much of the demand for B-ISDN is latent. High tech businesses are spending huge sums of money on getting their products to market faster than previously. According to Stephen Harbour, this is increasing the requirement for business-to-business interconnection: 'Faster time-to-market, which is one of the most important things that modern businesses are working on, is achieved with inter-business links not intra-business links.' The opportunity is for public operators to use ATM products to carry these inter-business services: 'The public network operator will always be able to amortize the capital cost of these things more effectively over a higher number of users, and in particular in things like transmission and databases where the ownership of data is less important than access to it,' argues Mr Harbour. Mercury Communications instances computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing, insurance, finance and healthcare as ATM applications which exist now, but believes that the broadband market won't start to ramp up for another three or four years. 'The applications exist, but some of them are fairly specialised. It will really take off when there are more general applications,' concludes Alison Lockyer, the company's broadband networks product manager.</p>

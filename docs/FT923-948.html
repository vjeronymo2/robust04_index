			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Hounded down MR DAVID Mellor was hounded from office by the British tabloid press. He was right to refuse to resign for as long as he did, and he should not have been forced to go in the end. The private life of a politician should not determine his or her suitability as a minister; Mr Mellor's admitted adultery was an unfortunate incident which in other countries might not have been thought worthy of mention. A peculiarly British prurience led to it being magnified out of all proportion. It might be argued that it was not his affair with an actress that brought his downfall. By accepting an expenses-paid holiday in Spain as the guest of the daughter of a senior figure within the PLO Mr Mellor showed a lack of judgment. True, although the prime minister has supported him in his denial that the visit breached the ministerial code of conduct. The same lack of judgment might be discerned in his business/holiday visit to Abu Dhabi, which would have looked better had Mr Mellor bought his own ticket. These are not incidents of which the former secretary for the national heritage can be especially proud, but they would never have been carried on so many front pages had it not been for the interest aroused by the original adultery story. To say now that it was the foreign visits alone that brought Mr Mellor down is humbug. There is a certain irony in all this. The task of deciding whether to introduce laws to protect the privacy of individuals will now fall to other ministers. Few of the likely candidates are as clearly opposed to a privacy bill as was Mr Mellor. Even if he favoured one, he would, given his circumstances, have found it difficult to propose such a law. His departure, and the manner of it, will not weaken the determination of those who want to curb the press. It is a curious fact about the British way of politics that a relatively unimportant minister can be forced to resign from office for his personal peccadilloes, while a chancellor may safely see his entire strategy collapse in ruins and lose his credibility with the markets. We may question his judgment on the management of the economy, but hound him out? Never.</p>

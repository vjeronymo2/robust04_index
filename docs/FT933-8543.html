			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Walton: the Compleat truth: Angling BEFORE travelling to the ancient city of Winchester in Hampshire for my exclusive 400th birthday interview with the man we call 'The Father of the Angle', I first read the book which secured his immortality. Never before had I got far beyond the Compleat of the title, and wondering about the old chap's spelling. Actually, it is not half bad, if that doesn't sound too condescending. When you think what else was on offer to lovers of prose in the 17th century - Milton's Areopagitica for instance - it is hardly surprising that Izaak Walton's musings on fish, milkmaids and the pastoral beauties of England became a best seller. I tracked him down to his study in the home of his son-in-law, Prebendary Hawkins. It is a fine old house in the cathedral close. Outside the sun shone fitfully on a pleasing garden enclosed by antique walls, with a view of the cathedral beyond. As he made me welcome, I mentioned Milton. 'As a man, I did not love him. He was as a pike, a tyrant melancholy and bold, a pertinacious schismatic and Republican. For you should know, Master Thomas, that I was ever for the King and the established Church. But he was the chief poet of the land, and I a mere chronicler of the lives of better men.' He nodded, and was quiet for a moment, then added: 'And my Compleat Angler, if I am not mistook, has been published in nigh on 400 editions in this kingdom, and America, and even in distant Japan; which, I trow, is a fate unenjoyed by that tedious Areopagitica.' Anyone who has dipped into Walton's book will have been struck by its distinctive tone: sweet, amiable, innocent, without malice. I asked him about Sam Johnson, whose enthusiasm for the Compleat Angler inspired its revival after a period of comparative neglect. 'Johnson was a man of prudence, deep learning and piety, a good Royalist filled with virtue and mental vigour and wit. True, he was an abomination to behold, dropsical and ever a-twitch. He was unquiet in spirit. I believe angling would have been more beneficent medicine to him than the tea he drank in such immoderate volume.' I had spotted inside the front door, hung on a brass knob, a bulbous leather container which I assumed to be Walton's creel. Stretched along the wall above was six yards of ash and hazel, with a tendril of horsehair attached to the narrow end. 'Dost thou', I began, then corrected myself. 'Presumably, Mr Walton, you don't do a great deal of fishing now?' 'I am too old and infirm, Master Thomas', he replied. 'And, besides, it would fill my heart with sadness to see the streams I remember from my young manhood as they are now. What fate has o'ertaken the Wandle, whence Thos. Barker and I would walk of a Maytime morn to ply the angle?' 'It runs by Youngs Brewery in the London borough of Wandsworth, Father Izaak.' 'And what of its trout? I recall one of more than 20 inches, which I took with a caterpillar. Its belly was as yellow as a marigold, and part as white as a lily. We, Barker and I and Dr Donne - who was no fisher but loved abundantly the eating of them - had it in a sauce of marjoram, sweet thyme, winter savory, anchovies and sweet butter.' The Wandle is now a dark, lifeless stream, strewn with supermarket trolleys and beer cans. 'They are no more, I fear, sir. Though they make a fine ale at its banks.' 'And what of the lovely Lea?' he inquired. 'And of the Dove, where so oft I angled with my beloved friend Cotton?' 'There are still trouts in the Dove', I said. 'And, marry, the cottage which Cotton built for you still stands, with its motto piscatoribus sacrum above the door, and the initials of yourself and Cotton intertwined on the keystone.' The old man sighed. 'Ah, Charles, I loved him as a son. Doubtless he was, as they told me, a roisterous soul and dubious versifier. But to me he was ever gentle and filled with reverence; and in the matter of angling with the fly for trouts and graylings he was a master of guile.' There was much I wished to ask him, but I could tell that he was growing weary. I knew that I had to hit him with the controversial questions now. I asked: 'Forgive me for vexing you, Mr Walton, but I must put to you the charge that the Compleat Angler was not original, that you took other people's ideas without acknowledgement.' 'Master Thomas', he chided. 'He who turns his back on the wisdom of others is no wise man but a fool. This complaint was made against me by one Richard Franck, a trooper in Cromwell's army and a right cribbed and dolorous soul. And how many editions are there of his dreary tales, I wonder?' I pressed on: 'And what about the allegation that you were - sorry, are - a credulous dupe? Believing that pike were bred from a special weed, and that eels were spawned by dew, and that frogs eat fishes' eyes and so on?' 'Peradventure I was wrong. Many matters are known now which were not known then. But for all this knowledge, Master Thomas, are we more contented now?'</p>

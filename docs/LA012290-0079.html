			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP REVIEW;  </P> <P> AILING ESPERANZA ISN'T LIMPING ON SOCCER FIELD  </P> <P> Three years ago, when John Coppage left the Esperanza High School boys' soccer  team to coach the girls, he took over a young, lackadaisical program and  quickly turned it into a winner.  </P> <P> In his first year, Coppage, a walk-on coach, led the Aztecs to the Southern  Section 3-A final and a 22-2-2 overall record.  </P> <P> Last year, Esperanza finished with a 24-0-2 record, but was eliminated by Simi  Valley, on penalty kicks, in the 4-A semifinals.  </P> <P> This year, Esperanza (18-2-1 overall, 4-0-1 in the Empire League) continues to  win, despite being plagued by illness and injury through most of the early  season. Along with a team-shared flu, the Aztecs have been struck with  everything from back injuries (Chrissy Coppage and goalkeeper Tymerie Busser)  to a heart murmur (Jenise Webb).  </P> <P> "All the luck I've had as far as not having injuries in years past (is gone),"  Coppage said. "It's incredible, you don't even want to say it. It's like, well,  what's gonna happen Monday?"  </P> <P> But few coaches are feeling sorry for Coppage, who was 109-6-10 in four years  as the Aztecs' boys' coach, leading Esperanza to four Empire League titles and  the 3-A title in 1986.  </P> <P> Although the team's two losses -- to Mater Dei and Mission Viejo -- are two  more than it had last year, and it has allowed more goals (10) than it did all  of last year (seven), Esperanza is looking good elsewhere.  </P> <P> Balanced scoring has helped Esperanza score 71 goals this season -- nine more  than at this point last year. All but one of the team's 18 players, excluding  the goalkeeper, have scored.  </P> <P> Esperanza's talent is based on its core of 13 seniors -- the same players  Coppage referred to as a bunch of squirrels three years ago -- but the team's  underclassmen have provided a boost as well.  </P> <P> "Because of the injuries we had, actually we're stronger than we were last  year," Coppage said. "We have more depth than last year because with so many  injuries we were forced to play freshmen."  </P> <P> The freshmen are Megan Murray, younger sister of junior Lynn Murray, and Kathy  Haerle.  </P> <P> "Kathy is 5 feet tall and weighs probably about 105," Coppage said. "I call her  a Smurf but she's really more like a bulldog. She's scored two goals this year,  that's unheard of for a freshman. . . .  </P> <P> "I'm telling you, it's a riot. The one thing that really turned this team  around were these two freshman because all these other hot shots (seniors) saw  them and said, 'Gee, they're out there hustling and making their way onto the  varsity. We'd better do something.' "  </P> <P> Esperanza, which plays at Loara Thursday, began the season as the third-ranked  team in the preseason Southern Section 4-A poll. A week later, it moved to  second where it stayed until today. After last week's 1-1 tie with league rival  Los Alamitos, ranked 10th in the poll, Esperanza dropped to fourth.  </P> <P> Simi Valley is ranked No. 1, Upland is second and Arcadia is third.  </P> <P> Coppage, who is not shy with his opinions, was not pleased.  </P> <P> "We already beat Arcadia (in the Ocean View tournament). . . . Now two top 10  teams play and tie and what does that mean?" Coppage said. "What a joke. I  think the whole top 10 thing is a farce. It's not a top 10 soccer poll; it's a  top 10 popularity poll."  </P> <P> Jan Lipinski, the 4-A coordinator who puts out the weekly rankings, said one  representative from each of the 4-A's nine leagues vote on the rankings.  </P> <P> Despite all that, Coppage, who has a career record of 145-12-14 through seven  years of coaching high school soccer, is assured of his team's capabilities.  </P> <P> "Without a doubt, we have the best team, the best talent in (the 4-A)," he  said. "But that doesn't necessarily mean we're gonna win. But the only team  that can beat us is ourselves."  </P> <P> Rounding out the 4-A poll are No. 5 Dana Hills, No. 6 El Toro, No. 7 South  Torrance, No. 8 Corona del Mar, No. 9 Mission Viejo and No. 10 Edison.  </P> <P> The Five Counties Invitational wrestling tournament at Fountain Valley High  School received plenty of praise by many area coaches.  </P> <P> Last weekend's tournament packed the gymnasium with about 2,000 fans who got to  see the most highly contested meet in Orange County.  </P> <P> "It was a real great preview for the state meet (March 2-3 at Stockton)," El  Modena Coach Alan Clinton said. "You had almost all the sections (of the  California Interscholastic Federation) there."  </P> <P> Clovis, the top-ranked team in the state, won with 151 points. Canyon, the  third-ranked team in the state and the tournament's defending champion, was  sixth with 108.5.  </P> <P> Clinton, president of the Orange County Wrestling Coaches Assn., released this  week's county poll: No. 1 Canyon, No. 2 El Modena, No. 3 Valencia, No. 4 Laguna  Hills, No. 5 Irvine, No. 6 San Clemente, No. 7 El Dorado, No. 8 Mater Dei, No.  9 Savanna and No. 10 Buena Park.  </P> <P> Out go the lights: The Marina-Fountain Valley girls' basketball game had to be  postponed Tuesday after the lights in the Marina gymnasium went out minutes  into the game.  </P> <P> The cause? Marina junior Colleen Hatch was chasing a loose ball down the  baseline when she hit a padded fuse box on the wall.  </P> <P> "It was a total freak thing," Marina Coach Pete Bonny said. "We could do it 100  times and it wouldn't happen again. She hit it, there were a couple sparks and  all of a sudden we were all in the dark."  </P> <P> After much debate, the game was postponed. It will continue -- with Fountain  Valley leading, 4-0, tonight at 5 at Marina.  </P> <P> Marina is 13-7 overall, 2-2 in the Sunset League. Fountain Valley is 14-5, 3-1.  </P> <P> Big 8 Recruit: Tim Manning, Trabuco Hills' all-everything football player, took  a recruiting trip to Iowa State last weekend. There, Manning was hosted, in  part, by Blaise Bryant, one of the nation's leaders in all-purpose offense last  fall, and a former Golden West College player.  </P> <P> Lights, camera . . . Rainer Wulf, Trabuco Hills boys' basketball coach, has  been seen on television recently. Wulf twice has hosted the halftime and  postgame shows for KDOC (Channel 56) during Nevada Las Vegas home basketball  games.  </P> <P> "I did the UCI game (last Thursday)," Wulf said. "We watch the game in the  studio (in Anaheim), then we pick out highlights from both halves, talk about  the game, show the highlights, and then we have trivia questions and take phone  calls.  </P> <P> "I have a lot of (Trabuco Hills) players threaten to call in and ask me a tough  question. It's a live show. If you screw up, you screw up."  </P> <P> Wulf had worked with the program's director, Paul Higgins, on past projects.  </P> <P> Wulf, who played at UC Irvine from 1980-82, got his start in television with a  beer commercial five years ago. He played a player being chewed out by UCLA  Coach Jim Harrick, then at Pepperdine.  </P> <P> "It was fun," Wulf said. "They paid us $80 an hour."  </P> <P> Justin Zayas, a 5-foot-6 junior fullback for Orange, returned from Indiana this  season and has boosted the Panthers' defense significantly.  </P> <P> Orange, 12-0-2 overall and the second-ranked 2-A team in the Southern Section,  leads the Pacific Coast League with a 9-0 record.  </P> <P> Zayas was an all-league selection as a freshman before the family moved to  Indiana. Zayas wasn't doing well in school, said Orange Coach Ed Carrillo, so  the Zayas family moved back to Orange.  </P> <P> Last season without Zayas, the Panthers were 9-11-3.  </P> <P> Said Carrillo: "He's so quick, they (the forwards) can push harder and not  worry so much because he's back there. In fact, I think we depend on him too  much."  </P></p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / EC to help Kenya cope with refugees The European Commission agreed yesterday to release EC emergency aid worth Ecu3m (Pounds 2.1m) to help Kenya to cope with a large influx of refugees because of drought, Reuter reports from Strasbourg. 'Kenya is currently facing a critical emergency situation which would have been unthinkable 12 months ago,' a Commission statement said. The Commission, the European Community's executive body, said about 260,000 refugees had fled from Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia to Kenya to escape drought. The number could soar even higher, Kenyan sources said. President Daniel arap Moi, launching Kenya's first-ever appeal for international aid, said on Tuesday the refugees were putting a huge strain on the government at a time when resources were already stretched to the limit.</p>

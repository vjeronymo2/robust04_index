The meeting's main topic was to review and sum up Shanghai's  work in 1993 and to set guidelines for the current primary  tasks. Mayor Huang Ju delivered an important speech at the  meeting. He said: The past year was one in which Shanghai  thoroughly carried out the guidelines of the 14th CPC National  Congress and of the Sixth Shanghai Municipal CPC Congress, and  in which Shanghai began to seriously implement the  municipality's long-term development strategy to develop it into  the locomotive for the development of the areas along Chang  Jiang, and into an international economic, financial, and trade  center. Last year was also an important one in which Shanghai  strived to push its economic development to a new level, sought  new breakthroughs in its reform and opening up, and strived to  bring new changes in its urban construction, in order to score  new achievements in building spiritual civilization and to lay a  foundation for the municipality to change its face every year  and to have a complete face-lift every three years. With the  common efforts of all Shanghai people, we have fulfilled Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's exhortation made early last year: "Let us work  hard for another year; and let us brave the wind and waves, work  in a down-to-earth manner, and overcome all difficulties to  scale new heights." Huang Ju reviewed Shanghai's work in 1993  from eight aspects: First, Shanghai's economic development was  raised to a new level -- its annual total output value amounted  to 150 billion yuan, an increase of 14.9 percent, which was  higher than the previous year. Since the beginning of 1993,  Shanghai's financial revenues increased steadily, resulting in  an annual increase of 30.6 percent. Also, Shanghai's economic  structure continued to improve, as did the quality of its  economic functioning. Second, we made new progress in  Shanghai's urban construction; a total of 13 billion yuan, which  was a record amount, was used to improve the city's  infrastructural facilities. A number of key projects that  constitute the framework of the city's three-dimensional traffic  network were completed and breakthroughs were made in  constructing elevated highways, bringing about quite a change in  the city's skyline. Third, new steps were made in deepening  Shanghai's reform. The framework for developing a large market  system was initially completed, and work in this area rapidly  became more law-based and regularized. The market's fundamental  role of budgeting resources was further strengthened. Fourth,  new progress was made in opening Shanghai to the outside world.  Last year the city attracted more than twice as much foreign  funds as it did the year before; in addition, the percentages of  large foreign projects and of well-known multi-national  companies' investment were comparatively high, and the  percentage of their investment success was also high. Fifth,  new breakthroughs were made in Pudong's development. Pudong's  export-oriented economic function focusing on international  financial services, foreign trade, and export processing, began  to work. Sixth, new development was made in all social sectors  of the city. A giant stride was made in the city's educational  reform, and the process of industrializing Shanghai's new and  high technologies accelerated noticeably. Seventh, we continued  to improve the people's livelihood, people's income increased,  and all projects of practical benefit to the people were  completed. Housing construction was raised to a new height --  new houses with a total floor space of more than 6 million  square meters were completed; the quality of city residents'  living conditions further improved. Eighth, the building of  spiritual civilization reached a new level. Simultaneous soft  and hard construction formed a powerful force for driving  Shanghai's reform, opening up, and modernization forward. Huang  Ju stressed: We must not be dazzled by our achievements; we  should realize that many contradictions, difficulties, and  problems still lay ahead. It is relatively difficult to handle  the relationship between reform, development, and maintaining  stability properly, and it is quite an arduous task to maintain  the good trend of economic development. We need to double our  efforts to overcome these difficulties and to solve these  problems.    While reviewing and summing up Shanghai's work in 1993,  Huang  Ju emphatically pointed out: Under the leadership of the CPC  Central Committee, State Council, and Shanghai Municipal CPC  Committee; and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the party's basic line adopted by the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee, we must unswervingly adhere to  the central task of economic construction, insist on constantly  emancipating our minds, and insist on continuing to make  explorations with Chinese characteristics, the characteristics  of our time, and the characteristics of Shanghai -- this is the  foothold for Shanghai's constant efforts to create a new  situation in reform and opening up, and to quicken the pace of  Shanghai's modernization drive. We pursued the following five  principles in carrying out our work in 1993: First, we adhered  to the principle "development is the last word," seized the  opportunity, quickened the pace of development, and did  everything possible to speed up our economic construction.  Second, we strived to maintain an edge in reform and in opening  up, and quickened the step of building the socialist market  economic system framework. Third, we insisted on using high  standards for our urban construction work in order to lay a  foundation for developing Shanghai into a modern international  city. Fourth, we insisted on correctly handling the  relationship between reform, development, and maintaining  stability, to create a good social environment for accelerating  reform and development. Fifth, we insisted on rallying the  enthusiasm of the municipal government and the district and  county governments to actively explore new ways for  administering a super-size city.    Huang Ju continued: As to this year's work, an initial plan  was set forth at the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth  Municipal CPC Committee. We need to rely on the common efforts  of all the people of Shanghai in carrying out the work ahead of  us. We need to start from the beginning of the new year and to  attend to everything we must do; we must ensure a good  beginning, add a new dimension to our work, and maintain a good  trend, in order to lay a solid foundation for completely  achieving all the targets set for this year.    While discussing Shanghai's current tasks, Huang Ju pointed  out: First, we should ensure a prosperous market, maintain  economic stability, and attach great importance to price issues.  Concerned departments of the municipal government should fully  cooperate with each other, keep a close eye on the market  situation, tighten market controls, and strengthen price  supervision. They should resolutely crack down on any attempt  to drive up prices and to manipulate the market, and on other  illegal practices; and should sternly punish those involved. We  should do everything we can to secure commodity supplies, ensure  abundant stocks, and ensure commodity supplies during the coming  Spring Festival season. Commercial establishments and the  service sector should launch emulation campaigns on providing  civilized and good services; all sectors should work hand in  hand to enable Shanghai residents to enjoy a peaceful and happy  Spring Festival. We should conscientiously carry out the  state's major policies and ensure that all reform measures are  instituted in due time. The municipal government, and all  district and county governments should continue to enhance their  ability to deal with new situations and problems; they should  strive to ensure that things proceed steadily and endeavor to  maintain economic and social stability. Second, we should  ensure social stability; we should continue to sternly and  swiftly crack down on crimes, resolvedly wipe out all kinds of  social evils, and manage the population from other localities  properly. We should further improve traffic control and  conditions, and step up publicizing traffic regulations. Public  transportation departments should take positive measures to  solve commuting problems. We should take effective measures to  improve safety work and to prevent major accidents from  occurring. We should correctly handle the internal  contradictions among the people and remove all destabilizing  factors. Following the municipal government's guidelines,  departments concerned should launch extensive activities to help  the less fortunate; we should ensure that living allowances for  retired workers and people with special difficulties are  delivered to individuals. Third, we should ensure that rural  areas' year-end distribution work is properly carried out; we  should do our best to raise sufficient distribution funds to  ensure that the peasants' burdens that have been removed by  order are not reinstituted at year-end distribution. All county  and township (town) governments should provide better guidance  for conducting distribution work, step up coordination and  inspection work, and endeavor to complete the work by the end of  January. Fourth, we should step up work on preventing  contagious diseases prevailing in winter and spring; we should  strengthen inspection and supervision of food production work  and food hygiene in all food stores; we should continue to ban  the sale of blood clams. The news media should feature health  education programs to enhance residents' health-care  consciousness.    The meeting also decided the further division of work  concerning preparatory tasks for holding the next municipal  people's congress; the municipal government's efforts to restore  and improve the Waitan financial district's functions; the  establishment of new enterprise systems; the building of a  central commercial district; and concerning the co-investment of  large projects. Attending the meeting were vice mayors of  Shanghai; responsible persons of all commissions, offices, and  bureaus of the municipal government; and responsible individuals  of all district and county governments.</p>

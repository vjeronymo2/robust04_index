			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Pictures of lorry bombers released THE CITY of London Police have released video pictures of two men walking away from the parked lorry containing the bomb which devastated Bishopsgate in the City. The enhanced pictures from a commercial video tape taken by a camera mounted in Bishopsgate show two men walking south and apart down the street just before 9am. Both are wearing hooded jackets to hide their faces. Commander David Tucker, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, said: 'We are convinced these are the two men who left the lorry and it is reasonable to assume they are the bombers.' Witnesses, he said, had confirmed seeing them getting out of the lorry parked 200 to 300 yards away from where the film was shot. The first man, seen getting out of the driver's side, was between 5ft 8in and 5ft 9in and stockily built. He wore a slate grey three-quarter length anorak and dark trousers. Immediately he got out of the lorry, he pulled his hood up. His passenger was slimmer and about 5ft 9in tall, wearing pale blue jeans and a blue and white mottled jean jacket with a hooded jogging top underneath. He also pulled the hood up to hide his face. Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, appealed to all premises to check for any tapes which police had not seen. Mr Kelly said the pictures showed the value of security cameras. 'I urge those who don't already have them to acquire them. Those who do should check they are operating properly. One common fault is the tapes wear and don't give very good images and so should be changed regularly.' Police repeated an appeal for help in tracing the movements of the lorry, which was stolen on March 20 in Staffordshire and was later painted blue.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Cost cuts in NHS drugs bill sought THE GOVERNMENT is targeting the Pounds 3.4bn National Health Service drugs budget in its efforts to meet public spending targets for the next three years. Ministers see the fast-growing NHS drugs bill as a prime area in which further savings could be made. The government has a manifesto commitment to raise year by year the 'level of real resources' committed to the NHS, but ministers privately admit that the drive to reduce the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement means this year's increase is likely to be small. The government has also said that savings generated through improved efficiency will be ploughed back into the service. Earlier this year it offered the drugs industry a new five-year agreement on the prices of pharmaceuticals including a 2.5 per cent cut in prices for three years. Most drugs groups - some of which had feared price cuts of up to 7 per cent - greeted the proposals with relief. The NHS drugs bill grew last year by 14 per cent. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, yesterday accused the government of using 'sleight of hand' to give the impression it was meeting its election spending pledges on health. He said the government was 'using efficiency targets as a way of introducing cuts in the NHS, but is offering the money back as though it is additional spending'. He said the government was introducing an accountancy sleight of hand which counts private-sector investment as though it were extra expenditure. 'No one should be misled into believing that the government will fulfil its pledge to increase health service spending.' Talks aimed at setting departmental budgets until 1996-97 are to continue this week in the cabinet's so-called EDX committee, with ministers aiming to propose a settlement to cabinet before the end of the month.</p>

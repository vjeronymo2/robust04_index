			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Italian banks Italy's fragmented banking sector certainly needs rationalisation. But one wonders whether Credito Italiano's L2,000bn bid for 48 per cent of Credito Romagnolo is the right way of achieving it. Recently-privatised Italiano is still suffering from its public-sector past. Its return on assets at 1.39 per cent in 1993 was much lower than Romagnolo's 2.25 per cent. In a rational world, more efficient institutions would take over their less efficient rivals, not the reverse. Those who bought shares at the time of Italiano's privatisation last year cannot be too pleased. The share price had slumped following last month's announcement of a L1,520bn capital-raising. Yesterday, the shares fell further and are now nearly 25 per cent below the privatisation issue price. Investors may be puzzled why Italiano is issuing its own shares at a discount to net assets, while bidding for Romagnolo's at a premium. Observers detect the hand of Mediobanca, the powerful Milanese merchant bank. It effectively controls Italiano and is keen to extend its influence in the commercial banking sector. Mediobanca also controls Banca Commerciale Italiana, another newly-privatised bank that recently raised L1,575bn for its own acquisition war-chest. Unsurprisingly, the market is betting BCI will launch its own banking bid, Ambroveneto being the favoured target. With its shares now almost 40 per cent below the privatisation price, BCI investors are also paying for their management's excessive ambition.</p>

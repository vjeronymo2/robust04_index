			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> BILLIONS IN U.S. HOLDINGS GIVE TOKYO BIG LEVER  </P> <P> Japan, which holds at least $60 billion worth of U.S. government securities and  billions more in American corporate stocks and bonds, has the economic leverage  to back up Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's intention to obtain for his  government a share of the United States' global leadership.  </P> <P> In recent years, Japan has become a major lender in the United States, helping  to finance the huge budget deficits of the Reagan Administration and buying up  important blocks of American real estate and corporate securities. As a result,  Japanese investment decisions could have a major impact on the American  economy.  </P> <P> So far, Japan has not used its economic power to force changes in American  diplomatic and political policy, and there are some very good reasons why it  would be reluctant to go that far. But Takeshita made it clear in his Thursday  meeting with President Bush that Tokyo expects to be consulted before  Washington takes action on a wide range of global issues.  </P> <P> "There have been rumors for the past several years that the Japanese are ready  to manipulate the U.S. Treasury bond market to affect policies that are  important to them," said Edward J. Lincoln, an Asia expert at the Brookings  Institution in Washington. "The evidence of them having done this is very  thin."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Japan clearly is ready to cast aside the reticence which has  marked its diplomacy since World War II. For most of the Analysis  </P> <P> past 40 years, Japanese governments have followed Washington's lead on  political matters while building Japan's war-shattered economy into the  second-largest and, probably, most robust in the world.  </P> <P> "It is not clear whether the Japanese only want to speak up and make sure they  are heard or if they have something specific they want to push the United  States on," Lincoln said.  </P> <P> It may be that Takeshita is doing nothing more than following U.S. allies in  Europe in demanding additional consultation on such subjects as U.S.-Soviet  relations.  </P> <P> "A great many of these calls for more consultations have been justified," said  Martin E. Weinstein, holder of the Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and  International Studies in Washington. "I would hope that we would act in such a  way that we won't have to hear any more of it."  </P> <P> But a congressional staffer who specializes on Asia policy said Japan wants to  be consulted on important issues but does not want to assume ultimate  responsibility for shaping global events.  </P> <P> "Never in world history has a country acquired so much wealth without acquiring  military and political power," said the staff member, who declined to be  identified by name. "You are going to see the second round of the Greater East  Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."  </P> <P> The staff member's pointed use of the term that Japan applied to the  expansionist policy of its military government in the late 1930s seems to  reflect the skepticism Japan faces on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> Although Japan trails Britain as a lender to the United States, the Japanese  government, Japanese corporations and individuals have invested well over $100  billion in the United States.  </P> <P> According to Commerce Department figures, Japanese residents and the government  held $60.3 billion in U.S. Treasury securities at the end of 1987, the most  recent year for which the report was available. In addition, Japanese owned $38  billion in corporate stocks and bonds. They also held direct investments  totaling $33.4 billion in corporations in which they own at least 10% of the  stock.  </P> <P> However, it seems unlikely that Japan would try to use its economic leverage.  Although the Japanese military establishment has grown substantially in recent  years, Tokyo concedes that it is unable to defend itself without American  assistance. Also, an economic confrontation between the United States and Japan  would damage both nations, an outcome that neither country would relish.  </P></p>

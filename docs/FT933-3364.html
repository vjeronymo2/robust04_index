			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mellon sues Primerica over 'broken promises' MELLON Bank is suing Mr Sandy Weill's Primerica financial services group over what it claims are broken promises concerning its administration of some Dollars 50bn of former Shearson mutual fund assets. Mellon took on the administration of Shearson's mutual funds in September 1992 when it bought The Boston Company, a trust and administration company, from American Express, then the parent of Shearson Lehman. The Shearson administration business accounted for around Dollars 100m of Boston's annual revenues, Mellon said. In its legal actions, filed in the district court for Western Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh-based bank claims that the merger of Shearson with Primerica's Smith Barney has threatened its role as administrator to the Shearson mutual funds. Mellon also said that the purchase of Boston had contained a provision for it to continue to administer the funds, and that Primerica had later expressly endorsed this arrangement. Also named in the action are Smith Barney, Lehman Brothers and American Express. Mellon said that, among other things, Smith Barney 'has created new mutual funds that are virtual clones of existing Shearson funds serviced by The Boston Company; has initiated mergers of Shearson funds into Smith Barney funds that are not serviced by The Boston Company; and has otherwise attempted or threatened to attempt to siphon off assets from the Shearson funds'. Mellon said that it had not quantified the size of its claim, and that the legal actions were in part intended to prevent Smith Barney Shearson from taking further steps which would damage its interests. In response, Smith Barney said: 'We are surprised by the lawsuit. It is factually incorrect. We believe it is without merit.'</p>

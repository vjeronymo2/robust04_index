			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DEATH SENTENCE VOIDED OVER BIBLE  </P> <P> A federal judge has overturned a condemned murderer's death sentence because  the jury that convicted him 10 years ago asked for a Bible during  deliberations, court officials said today.  </P> <P> In overturning the sentence of Brandon Jones, 31, who was convicted of killing  a policeman during a service-station robbery, U.S. District Judge Charles Moye  ruled that the Cobb County jury "had a duty to apply the law of the state of  Georgia . . . not its own interpretation of the law or its own interpretation  of precepts of the Bible." The state attorney general's office is now  considering settling for a life sentence for Jones.  </P></p>

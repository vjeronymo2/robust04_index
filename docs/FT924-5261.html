			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Concentric almost doubles to Pounds 8.25m CONCENTRIC, the engineering and components group, almost doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.22m to Pounds 8.25m for the year ending September 30. The profit rise, on sales of Pounds 113m (Pounds 112.9m), was mainly due to the turnaround at two of the group's subsidiaries. New management at Concentric Pumps, which produces parts for diesel engines, was responsible for producing an operating profit of Pounds 1m. It had incurred a loss of Pounds 2.5m. Mr Tony Firth, chairman, said the former management at Concentric Pumps had been replaced last year because it had lost control of costs. Capital expenditure, which remained unchanged at Pounds 4.8m, is likely to be increased as a result of the company's net cash position of Pounds 11m, due to this year's rights issue. About Pounds 1m had been earmarked for Concentric Pumps, with further expansion of its plastic mouldings and automotive businesses. Mr Firth said he was encouraged by the 7 per cent rise in overseas sales. Earnings increased to 23.25p (13.21p). The final dividend is held at 7.63p for an unchanged total of 11.17p. The group is proposing a 1-for-1 scrip issue. COMMENT Having shot themselves in the foot by losing control of costs at key businesses the group has aggressively regained control of its subsidiaries. It is difficult to fault the timing of its rights issue which will allow a needed increase of capital expenditure. The recent devaluation of sterling is expected to further underline the growth in overseas sales. Its house brokers are forecasting pre-tax profits next year of Pounds 10m, giving earnings per share of 24.3p. This puts the shares - up 7p at 360p - on a prospective multiple of 14.8, a slight discount to the market. Not a get rich quick stock but may prove attractive to investors willing to wait a few years.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Approval for finance deals that shift risk to private sector - Leasing BEFORE the public sector can take advantage of the new freedom to use leases where they offer the best value for money, much more detail on how the scheme will work will be needed. Current government rules usually require the capital value of leased assets to be set against public sector bodies' spending allocations. This has strongly discouraged their use. In future, the way leases are treated will be based on where the risks associated with the lease - typically, the question of the residual value of the asset - falls. Under so-called operating leases, common in the private sector, the ownership of an asset remains with the lessor, usually a bank or finance company. The value of the asset - and hence the risk that its residual value will prove less than expected - is borne either by the financier or the supplier of the equipment. In future, as public sector bodies carry out operating leases with the private sector, they will only have to show the annual payment on a lease in their accounts. Just as significant as this accounting change is the shift in the climate, to one in which leases are regarded as an acceptable form of public-sector finance, rather than an attempt to evade spending controls. The Treasury said yesterday that the private sector should assume the risk in such arrangements and stressed that 'there must be no creative accounting'. In fact, the new rules bring the treatment of leases more in line with the accounting rules used by the private sector. In an accompanying announcement, the government has allowed British Rail to take advantage of the new approach to lease Pounds 150m of rolling stock over the next three years. It also cited areas such as contract energy management. Mr Eddie Oliver, managing partner of the infrastructure and government practice at KPMG Peat Marwick, said: 'Whether there is an avalanche or no change as a result will all depend on the details that follow up these statements.' We need a lot more information to know how radical they are.' But Mr Chris Elliott, head of the project advisory unit at BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays, said: 'This is overall good news.' He cautioned that financial institutions had traditionally been reluctant to take on risks in asset-related projects and there were many questions still to be answered.</p>

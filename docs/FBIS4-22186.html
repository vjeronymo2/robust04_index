			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel Petr Belov, candidate of technical </F> sciences: "Who Needs the SS-25 Missiles?"    [Text] A report recently appeared in the press that it has  been decided to base the nuclear missile power of the future  Russia on missiles of the "modernized SS-25 type." The optimum  nature of such an important decision was confirmed by the  opinion of the editor's office of the newspaper that is most  read by intellectuals, which considers the SS-25 to be "one of  the most successful mobile ground missile systems," and also by  statements from a top scientist, an acting member and a  corresponding member of several academies.    I admit that the decision to enter into polemics with  respect  to the correctness of such a choice did not come about  immediately. Disturbing were the great authority of the  indicated opponents, the author's lack of the corresponding  scientific titles, and the difficulty that most readers would  have in following the unavoidable factual details in the  arguments. But should one remain silent if the consequences of  this decision affect all of us in the most direct way?  Especially since the references to authority are less convincing  in comparison with the conclusions obtained below with the help  of certain facts and laws.  <H5>  Is Rearmament Necessary at All? </H5>   I remind you that in the event of the ratification of the  treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation on  the reduction of strategic offensive arms (START II) we will  have to reduce the total number of nuclear warheads to  3,000-3,500, of which 1,700-1,750 nuclear warheads will have to  be deployed on submarines and the rest on heavy bombers and  single-warhead ground-based missiles. The traditional  superiority of the United States in aviation and the navy will  force Russia to do all it can to preserve the combat capability  of ground-based missiles even to the point of arming them with  the maximum allowed 1,300 nuclear warheads. At the present time,  however, we do not have that many single-warhead missiles and  will scarcely be able to produce them by 2003.    Taking into account the approximately 300 mobile land-based  single-warhead SS-25 missiles now in existence and 195  multiple-warhead SS-18's and SS-19's permitted for conversion,  Russia will be forced to build approximately another 800 new  missiles. Alternative decisions may be the following: Not to  build any new land-based missiles but limit ourselves to the 500  that exist now and the same number of nuclear warheads on old  bombers; begin to build new single-warhead missiles, not all 800  but half that many. My opponents favor precisely the latter  version, proposing that 60-70 percent of the missiles be in the  form of modernized mobile SS-25's and the rest in silos.    The questions arise: Do we need the fortunately still  unratified START II Treaty and in developing a new nuclear  missile program should we proceed on the basis of its  injunctions that are unacceptable for us? Who really needs SS-25  missiles that the media have praised? Can it really be that we  cannot do without these "safe to operate" and "very economical"  mobile complexes, which "do not burn in fire," "do not break  apart on rocky ground," and "cannot be penetrated by various  kinds of weapons"? And is not this campaign just the latest  monstrous disinformation inflicted on the public?    In response to these questions, we will point out still  another alternative--to refuse to ratify START II until there  has been a thorough investigation of all the peculiarities of  the rearming that it imposes, a comprehensive evaluation of the  real performance characteristics of the SS-25, and an  elucidation of the possibility of its improvement through  modernization. At the same time, it should be remembered that  the only reliable means of deterring an aggressor in the next 10  years is our multiple-warhead missiles in silos rather than the  aging submarines and strategic bombers. The SS-25's under review  here are inferior to such missiles in every parameter without  exception--safety in operation, economy, and survivability; we  will become convinced of this in a systematic way.  <H5>  Are the SS-25's Really So Safe for Us? </H5>   The most significant shortcoming of mobile land-based  (ground  and railroad) strategic missiles is the danger from the nuclear  warheads that they have and from the extremely toxic and  explosive missile fuel. The threat of the occurrence of  accidents with catastrophic nuclear contamination of the terrain  was the reason why every country except Russia renounced such  missiles. For a fire is possible in a collision with an SS-25  and this is the most probable cause of the explosion of the  conventional explosive material in the nuclear warhead and the  dispersion of radioactive plutonium. A burning nuclear warhead  of a land-based missile cannot be extinguished by on-board  water, as at sea, and cannot be dropped, as from an airplane.  And this will take place on well-traveled roads rather than in  the "far seas" or "way up in the sky."    It can also be asserted that fundamentally missiles of the  SS-25 type cannot possess a high degree of safety while on the  move. At least their safety is always less than that of naval  and air delivery systems of nuclear warheads, not to mention  stationary missiles in silos. Indeed, for the SS-25, it is  significantly more difficult to preclude collisions with outside  means of transport or the intentional or natural destruction of  the road surface--at least because of the great accessibility of  these missiles for outside persons in comparison with submarines  on patrol and bombers. Just as obvious is the threat of other  preconditions for accidents (driver error and breakdown of the  vehicle) that do not exist in silo launch facilities where there  are no people around.    In this connection, the arguments for the safety of the  present SS-25's linked with the mention of eight submarine  disasters and the absence of such in the Strategic Missile  Forces seem strange. The significantly larger number of  submarines on patrol and the duration of these patrols is  thereby ignored and no mention is made of the fact of serious  accidents with the overturning of more than 10 missiles of the  SS-25 type that took them out of action, fortunately without  nuclear warheads burning or exploding. The quantitative  assessments of the probability of accidents with SS-25's that  the opponents have presented are quite erroneous: They have been  underestimated by a factor of more than 10 in terms of one  system per year and by a factor of 40 for the entire grouping of  500 missiles.    It is likewise impossible to agree with the assertions about  the so-called safety of solid-fuel SS-25's and SS-24's. Why,  then, is it recommended to personnel that they quickly abandon  them in the event of a fire and move away to a distance of 2.5  km? Nor have people forgotten the explosion of the solid-fuel  boosters of the American "Challenger" with the loss of seven  astronauts and the tragedy in 1988 at the SS-24 assembly plant,  which had to stop its work for a long time. The most frightening  thing, however, as specialists at Arzamas-16 have shown, is the  spontaneous start-up of the engines of the solid-fuel SS-25, for  it is impossible to stop or knock down this monster flying over  the earth. And it can fly to Moscow from that same Teykovo  Kostromskaya Oblast. Basically this could not happen with  liquid-fuel missiles.  <H5>  About the Economy of Operation of the SS-25 </H5>   Another argument in favor of the optimum nature of the  building of new mobile missiles of the SS-25 type, in the  opinion of their supporters, is their high degree of economy  compared with the cost of stationary missiles. Such an assertion  is fair, but only in part. It is not difficult to be convinced  of this by examining in turn the expenditures necessary for the  building and operation of different types of missiles and  comparing them.    Yes, the deployment of SS-25's in the position areas of the  silo missiles SS-17 and SS-18 to be destroyed will provide for a  certain saving of funds: There are roads, towns, engineering  structures, and communications. Instead of expensive silos, it  will be necessary to build only ground garages with movable  roofs for the launch of the missiles in the event of an extreme  emergency. But is such an economy necessary if the volume of the  previous network of roads is inadequate for the dispersion of  SS-25's at safe distances and if you cannot move very fast on  dirt roads? In such a case, all of the SS-25's will be the easy  prey of naval "Tridents" even with less accurate and powerful  nuclear warheads.    And the assertions of the low operating cost of  single-warhead ground-mobile missiles do not stand up to any  sort of criticism. Taking into account the depreciation costs of  the vehicle chassis, the network of roads, and the engineering  structures as well as the expenditures for fuel and lubricants  and the development and guarding of the patrol routes, the loses  from disruptions in the transport of freight needed in the  national economy, and the results of possible disasters, the  operation of the SS-25 will be just as devastating as the use of  strategic bombers and nuclear submarines.    A special category of expenditures has to do with need for a  large number of operating personnel, which one must not fail to  consider with the growing shortage of service members. Where can  Russia obtain additional tens of thousands of people and what  will they cost?    Nor should there be any illusions with respect to the low  cost of converting SS-25 launch silos. For the reconstruction of  a huge silo to suit a small missile will be just as costly as  the construction of a new one. This will require work to uncover  and revise numerous communication lines, the replacement of  obsolete equipment, and the use of colossal amounts of concrete  and the best kinds of cement and metal. And it is all senseless,  because it will not give the silo the required survivability:  The smaller the silo is, the more resistant it is to external  influences.  <H5>  Are SS-25's Dangerous for the Enemy? </H5>   Is it possible that the shortcomings noted above are more  than compensated by the potential merits of the SS-25--its high  degree of protection against any counteraction by the enemy and  timely maneuvering? Indeed, in principle the mobile means of  basing strategic missiles guarantees their invulnerability but  under these conditions: If they are small in size, protected  against outside influences, placed in containers camouflaged as  normal freight, dispersed throughout Russia, and constantly or  periodically change their location randomly.    Precisely this was the original intention of the creators of  the SS-25 and it is precisely this desirable feature that its  advocates are striving to present as reality. As a matter of  fact, they were not successful in keeping it small and the  camouflaging and continuous patrolling is impossible in  principle and forbidden by the START I treaty that we have  already ratified. Also, it is doubtful whether one can speak of  random changes in the location of these missiles. The  cross-sectional stability is quite unsatisfactory, the extremely  high axial loads have rigidly restricted them to a limited  number of roads for dispersal, and the great weight of the  missiles along with the small power of the traction engine  prevented flexible maneuvering through speed. We note that  everything enumerated above is also fair for the railroad  SS-24's that again exist only in Russia.    Hence it follows that with the knowledge of the permanent  deployment sites (provided by START I), the unique unmasking  features of ground-mobile missiles (this same treaty prohibits  changes in form), and the existing means of space  reconnaissance, the enemy has no problem in determining the  present location of our ground-mobile missiles and in  forecasting their coordinates in the next 15 minutes. Under  these conditions, the SS-25's and SS-24's are more vulnerable  than stationary missiles in silos and even bombers and  submarines in ports.    Indeed, the enormous size of the transport-launch container  with the missile (the area of the external surfaces is more than  120 square meters) did not permit their being made of metal,  which would require an additional increase in weight of hundreds  of tonnes and would definitively deprive these missiles of  mobility. In turn, the large lateral "sails" estimated at an  area of 100 square meters or more as well as the inadmissibly  narrow width of the track greatly facilitated the overturning of  our ground-mobile missiles through excessive aerodynamic  pressure. All of this made it much easier for them to be  disabled through a powerful electromagnetic pulse, all sorts of  firearms, and even simple overturning. But it is easiest of all  to achieve the destruction of the patrolling ground-mobile  missiles with the help of sabotage. For this it is sufficient to  have several specially trained "switchmen" or explosive devices  set up in advance near the probable routes that are tuned to the  emissions of the moving SS-25's and activated from space.    And in the most extreme case, for the destruction of the  mobile missiles that have miraculously survived, it is possible  to utilize missiles of submarines cruising near enough to  deliver their nuclear warheads to the position areas of the  SS-25's within 15 minutes. Calculations show that in this time  they will be unable to leave the range of their destruction  through shock wave factors.    A comparison of the survivability parameters of mobile and  stationary land-based strategic missiles indicates the  preferability of the latter. Indeed, silo missiles are  guaranteed protection against the electromagnetic pulse,  firearms, and highly accurate conventional and nuclear weapons:  Their reliable destruction requires an average of 10-15 cruise  missiles with conventional explosive charges or 2.4 nuclear  warheads. Taking into account the impossibility of destroying  silos simultaneously through several nuclear warheads  ("fratricidal effect"), the preclusion of their delivery through  high-speed low-angle trajectories (which reduces the possibility  of hitting and destroying hardened launchers), the high combat  readiness of stationary missiles, and their great distance from  the borders of Russia, the multiple-warhead SS-18's that we have  in silos are capable of fulfilling their intended purpose even  if it is just 5 percent of those left for the retaliatory  strike, not to mention preventive and counter  [otvetno-vstrechnyy] strikes. The ground-mobile SS-25 and SS-24  missiles now in existence are suitable at most for a first  strike. So are not they (rather than multiple-warhead silo  missiles) the "destabilizing" missiles that the United States so  fears?  <H5>  Is Modernization of the SS-25 Realistic? </H5>   Since the new nuclear missile program involves modernized  missiles of the SS-25 type, it is appropriate to analyze the  possibilities of a fundamental improvement of existing  ground-mobile complexes. Otherwise the arguments presented above  may be rejected as not corresponding to the systems under  development. The unconditional acknowledgement of the reality of  their qualitative improvement is fraught with the danger of  senseless economic outlays that are completely unacceptable in  our time.    I dare to assert that the task of freeing mobile missiles of  the SS-25 type from their shortcomings is not soluble in the  next decade. The reasons for this are not only economic but also  technical, organizational, and political. If we do not  understand this, then once again the billions required for the  modernization of the SS-25 will be totally wasted.    In the foreseeable future, we will be technically unable to  build a miniature intercontinental missile and guarantee its  invulnerability through the means examined above. The reason for  this is the more and more frightening technological backwardness  of the military-industrial complex and the prohibitions in START  I.    Organizationally, it is presently impossible to raise the  discipline of the movement of traffic on the roads of Russia or  to improve the state of the roads and the safety standards for  the entire population of the country. It is likewise impossible  to interfere endlessly with the movement of national economic  transportation or to establish an alienation zone around the  patrol routes to reduce the danger of sabotage and the severity  of possible accidents. It is equally unreasonable to keep mobile  missile complexes at bases permanently and hope that they will  be allowed to leave them in a threatening period.    Politically, it is hardly admissible to contribute to an  increase in social tension--to raise the degree to which the  people living near bases and the patrol routes of SS-25's are  informed about the serious danger that threatens them. It is  equally obvious that is unethical to keep citizens permanently  ignorant of the terrible threat against them and not to prepare  them in time to take action under the conditions of possible  extreme situations.    The question arises: Why did the advocates of the SS-25  ignore these rather important aspects? Or is it possible that  the author of these lines is wrong and there is no problem with  the SS-25? Then why does no one refute him in a public  discussion? But to be fair, I will note that that there were  three published articles denying the danger of these missile  systems for us. True, their authors presented incorrect  arguments to justify their positions, but on the other hand,  they did not forget to stress their own high scientific and  official rank and in some cases involvement in the creation of  the SS-25.    Still, in the opinion of independent experts, the problem  with the SS-25 is extremely pressing. Moreover, every effort is  being made to hush it up, which suits very influential forces:  Our "partner" in START II, who is prepared to utilize them as  his own "Colt" that is already aimed at the heart of Russia; the  generals from industry and the army who still hold their high  posts; the corporate interests of a well-known group in the  military-industrial complex that receives orders amounting to  many billions for a mobile missile technology that is needed by  it but not by the taxpayer; and the command of the Strategic  Missile Forces that is striving to maintain the size of its  staff and the number of generals' billets.    No, Russia has no need for START II and the SS-25 that are  being imposed on it, neither for those in existence nor for  modernized versions. Their acceptance will plunge the country  into the next spiral of rearmament. The result is obvious--two  zeros at the same time: The final destruction of the economy and  the total loss of the country's defensive capability. So is it  not better to realize what is happening in time and not to allow  such a prospect? The time is not yet past.</p>

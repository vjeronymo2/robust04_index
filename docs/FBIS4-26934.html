			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- Zou Xiangqun, deputy  secretary general of the State Planning Commission, told a  XINHUA reporter that since March, the momemtum of price rises  throughout the country has weakened and the margin of price  rises has begun to drop thanks to the gradual implementation of  the major reform measures as well as measures to strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control adopted by the party  Central Committee and the State Council.    Zou Xiangqun said: According to statistics, in May the  general retail price level rose 18.9 percent over the same  period last year, while the price rise margin dropped 0.6  percentage points compared with April. In May, retail price  rises in the country's 35 large and medium-sized cities were 1.3  percentage points lower than in April. According to an analysis  of the changes in the residents' consumption price index, rises  in the prices of various kinds of commodities, except clothing,  were slower in May than in April. Among these, the price rise  margins for food; household equipment; medical care; means of  transport and communications; articles for recreational,  educational, and cultural use; housing, and services dropped  0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.9, 0.4, 1.7, and 0.8 percentage points,  respectively. This shows that the state supervision of the  prices of daily necessities, the requirement for prices to be  clearly marked, and the launching of a general price check have  begun to yield results.    From the current situation in the development of the  macroeconomy, it can be predicted that the rise in the general  price level of the whole country will continue to weaken, and  the price rise margin will drop further.    According to an analysis by Zou Xiangqun -- he based his  prediction on the following facts:    -- The serious effect of last year's inflation will dwindle  graudally. In 1993, the general price level throughout the  county began to rise every month from the beginning of the year  and reached its peak in December. Because prices rose in a  step-like pattern; because the prices of electricity, railway  transport were readjusted; and because the prices of a large  number of steel products, coal, and grain were decontrolled,  inflation mainly occurred in the second half of last year, and  particularly the prices of grain and edible oil fluctuated in  the fourth quarter of last year. This had a serious effect on  price rises this year. This effect will gradually weaken with  the passage of time and will dwindle markedly in the fourth  quarter of this year.    -- The macroeconomic environment is improving. The financial  situation is stable. From January through May, the amount of  currency withdrawn from circulation was 54.57 billion yuan more  than the same period last year; residents' savings deposits rose  by 151.8 billion yuan over last year; revenue increased by 24.3  percent over the same period of last year. The margin of  increase in fixed assets investment continued to drop because  management over loans for fixed assets investment was  strengthened and because a general inspection of investment was  launched. From January to May, the size of the increase in the  amount of investment by state-owned units dropped 35.1  percentage points over the same period last year.    -- The supply of important commodities is turning for the  better. At present, the supply of and demand for commodities in  the domestic market are basically balanced, and the acreage  planted in grain this year is expected to be the same as last  year's level, but the acreage planted in rape seeds is nearly 8  million mu more than last year. This will lay a foundation for  the stable growth of grain and oil-bearing crops. With the  advent of the brisk vegetable growing season, the supplies of  vegetables will increase, and prices will drop further.    -- The practice of raising prices arbitrarily and collecting  various types of fees indiscriminately is beginning to be  checked. The practice of noninterference in market prices has  been gradually reversed through the launching of a general price  checkup and the implementation of state measures on establishing  grain risk funds, on price monitoring, and on marking prices  clearly.    Zou Xiangqun said that in accordance with the above  comprehensive analysis of the four aspects of the macroeconomic  situation, it is estimated that from now on price rises will  gradually weaken, but prices will still remain at a  comparatively high level. In other words, there is a tendency  that prices will gradually drop from a comparatively high level,  prices of some commodities might rise again for a short while.  Therefore, we must resolutely continue to implement the various  regulation and control measures to stabilize market prices and  to create a good economic and social environment for reform and  development.    Zou Xiangqun pointed out: To further stabilize prices, we  must do the following tasks well:    1. We should grasp agricultural production and strive to  increase grain and cotton production this year. We should work  hard to grasp the production of grain, cotton, and other major  farm products and successfully carry out the "vegetable basket"  project. We should strive for a bumper agricultural harvest to  increase the supply of essential products in the market.    2. We must strictly control the scale of investment in fixed  assets and put a stop to the excessive increase of consumption  funds. We must keep bank loans under control and strictly  forbid loans other than those approved by the state for  investment in fixed assets.    3. We should continue to strengthen management over price  regulation and control and strive to stabilize the prices of  life's daily necessities for the people. We should ensure an  ample supply of goods, keep prices down, and prevent drastic  price fluctuations. We should speed up the process of price  legislation. The State Planning Commission is drawing up  provisions against price swindling and seeking staggering  profits. It will strive to promulgate them as soon as possible  to protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers.    4. We should continue to launch general price inspections to  check price violations.</p>

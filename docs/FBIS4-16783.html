			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Petr Shcherbakov report: "We Will Make It To the Next </F> Harvest.... -- Notes From the Food Commission Session"]    [Text] What is the situation regarding reserves of grain  in the country? How much will bread cost this fall, or by the  end of the year? What is the volume of grain purchases which  can be realistically expected in 1994? These tricky questions  were discussed last Thursday by members of the Russian  Federation Government Food Commission under the chairmanship of  Agriculture and Food Minister V. Khlystun.    In respect of current reserves of bread grain, these,  according to "Roskhleboprodukt" Corporation President L.  Cheshinskiy, are sufficient to last until the next harvest.  There are particularly plentiful reserves of rye, which will  meet the requirements of the Russian population right up until  1996.    But it is grain purchases from the 1994 harvest which are  prompting alarm. And this alarm is wholly justified. After  all, last fall, for a number of reasons, a sizable area  earmarked for winter crops was left unsown. The wintering of  cereal crops took place in difficult conditions. As a result,  owing to frosts and rot over large areas, farmers were forced to  undersow or even resow winter grain with spring grain. All  this, of course, will affect the harvest.    In the light of this, forecasts by food commission members  regarding appreciable price increases for bread were completely  justified.    "It is clear even today," V. Khlystun said, "that, by fall,  because of inflation and for other reasons, purchase prices for  grain will rise to 200,000 rubles [R] a tonne."    It will be remembered that the average purchase price in  1993  was R57,000 per tonne. But then the situation was different to  the one taking shape now. The custom of state grain  procurements was still genetically strong. However, political  infighting, in which bread prices constituted a bargaining chip,  led to a situation where debts for products submitted were not  paid to agricultural commodity producers for many months. As a  result, virtually all farms -- large farms and private  smallholdings -- ended up on the brink of economic collapse,  irretrievably disenchanted with the word of the state as a  guarantee of any kind of commitment.    The volume of grain purchases destined for the Federal Fund  is currently defined at a level of roughly 11 million tonnes, or  1 million tonnes less than it was planned to purchase in 1993.  Then, you may recall, the plan was exceeded. The drop in  planned volumes for this year is attributed to the fact that the  government has restricted the circle of users of the "state corn  bins," suggesting to many that they themselves take care of  grain and other food reserves. The market, after all, is the  market.    Whether these 11 million tonnes will be poured into state  silos is, so to speak, another matter.    These fears are not arbitrary. Unless purchase prices for  fall 1994 are determined sufficiently reliably in the very near  future, and unless appropriate contracts are signed, the peasant  will not assume commitments to deliver grain on credit. To all  appearances, the Russian Federation Government Food Commission  understands this only too well, having given instructions to a  number of ministries and departments to define the volume of  budget funds necessary to cover expenditure on grain purchases  as soon as possible, and with due account of inflation and other  factors.</p>

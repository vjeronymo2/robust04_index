			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16, IRNA -- Demands for oil across the  world are expected to rise to 79 million barrels per day by the  year 2010 from 65 million BPD at present, Iranian Ambassador to  Japan Hosein Kazempur-Ardabili said Thursday [16 June].    The member states of the organization of petroleum exporting  countries could meet more than 53 percent of the world's oil  demands, he told IRNA.    The ambassador urged OPEC member states not to let political  differences have adverse effect on their economic interests.    Kazempur, who has been nominated by Iran for the post of  OPEC  secretary general, said it would be regrettable to make any  concession to buyers and let them buy this God-given gift at the  lowest price just because of political differences.    He said the most important role that OPEC can play now was  to  prevent political differences among its members from having any  adverse effects on their economic interests.    Kazempur felt confidence that by setting an oil output  ceiling and taking into consideration the growing demands for  oil, OPEC would soon witness considerable increase in the prices  of oil provided that its members refrain from overproducing.    OPEC members are now meeting in Vienna to determine an oil  production ceiling and elect OPEC's new secretary general.</p>

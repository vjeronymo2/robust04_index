In all, the new  Spanish contribution will comprise around 200 men, who will be  joining the 1,200 Spanish blue helmets stationed in the Mostar  area. It is expected that they will be able to travel to the  former Yugoslavia during the course of next week. According to  an official spokesman, a radar detection unit, which locates  mortar and heavy weapon trajectories, will be sent. The unit  will comprise six vehicles and 25 men, who will have the task of  monitoring and consolidating the cease-fire in the city of  Mostar, which is considered vital for the security of the  population.</p>

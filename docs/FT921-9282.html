			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Polls point to change in Romania ROMANIA'S political scene is likely to change significantly following the success of the Democratic Convention (DC) in recent local government elections. A loose coalition of opposition parties, the DC did well at the expense of the governing National Salvation Front in last weekend's polls. Although only two of the 40 mayors in the counties were elected with an absolute majority, the results so far indicate the emergence of a democratic opposition capable of challenging the Front in parliamentary elections. These are due three months after the second round of local elections on February 20. The Democratic Convention, which includes the intellectual-based Civic Alliance and the National Peasants Party, one of the 'historic parties' of the 1920s, won an outright victory in Timisoara, cradle of the 1989 revolution which toppled the Ceausescu regime. In Bucharest, the capital, the DC won 45 per cent of the vote; the National Salvation Front was next with 31 per cent. It also won the biggest share of the votes in the Transylvanian cities of Cluj, Sibiu and Brasov. But in the Transylvanian counties of Covasna and Harghitu, where ethnic Hungarians are in a majority, local Hungarians were swept into power, confirming that they will continue to play an important role in political life.</p>

At the court hearings in  Moscow Wednesday he said that soldiers had to shoot only under  extreme conditions. He said that in line with the military  regulations servicemen have the right to use fire arms in case  of an attack on a patrol.    Yazov said that the eight armored personnel carriers that  moved along the Garden Ring were patrol vehicles and soldiers  inside them were forced to open fire when they faced danger to  their lives.    The ex-minister said that as a result of the investigation  into the murder of three persons, experts found no corpus  delicti in the actions of servicemen of the Taman Division who  were involved in the incident.    The court hearings will continue January 27 at 10 a.m.</p>

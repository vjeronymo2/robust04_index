These optical characteristics present application  potential.[.sup]4,5[/]    The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) developed in the  early 1980s has been widely used in different  fields.[.sup]6,7[/] The study of polycrystalline Si thin film  with STM has achieved some results,[.sup]8-11[/] mainly in  the exploration of the film's surface characteristics and  topography. However, so far there has been no report of STM  research on the nanoscale material's crystal interface, which  has an important effect on the structure and properties of the  nanoscale material. In this paper, we utilize a locally made STM  to study the surfaces of nanoscale Si thin films whose thickness  varies from sub-micron to atomic scale. A series of data,  especially on the crystal interface structures, is obtained.  <H5>  1. Experimental Method </H5>   The nanoscale Si thin-film specimen is prepared with a  plasma  capacitively coupled chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system,  with highly hydrogen-diluted silane as the reaction gas, and by  the excitation of an r.f. + DC double-power  source.[.sup]1,2[/]    The instrument used in the research is a type CSTM-9000 STM  for atmospheric use,[.sup]12[/] manufactured by the CAS  Institute of Chemistry and equipped with a needle made of  80Pt-20Ir alloy (diameter: 0.25mm) by mechanical cutting or a  tungsten needle (diameter: 0.25mm) made by chemical etching. In  a constant-current operating mode, each image is sampled with  180 x 180 points. The surface heights are reflected by the  varying shades of grayish color in the image. The voltage  between the needle and the specimen tunnel junction is between  0.5 V and 2 V, with needle as positive. The maximum tunnel  current selected for use has reached 1 nA, and generally is  about 0.5 nA. In the following test results, the STM images are  only the outcomes after the original data were smoothed. The  scanning time for each image varies: from 3 min (for large  images) to 15 s (for small images).  <H5>  2. Results and Discussion </H5>   The STM images of nanoscale Si thin film of different  magnifications in atmosphere are displayed from sub-micron to  atomic dimensions. Figure 1 shows the obverse STM image of the  nanoscale Si thin film obtained with the tungsten needle. The  needle bias is 1 volt; and the current, 0.45 nA. The scanning  areas of Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are 40.9 nm (x-direction) x 48.8  nm (y-direction), and 20.5 nm x 24.4 nm, respectively. Figure 1  shows that the nanoscale Si thin film is composed of many  ultrafine particles. The densities of the surface particle  arrangements vary. The particle boundaries are very clear. From  Figures 1(a), and 1(b) especially, the sizes of the nanoscale Si  thin-film particles can be estimated as 3 nm-5 nm, which closely  coincide with the results from high-resolution electron  microscopy (HREM).[.sup]1,2[/] The image obtained with the  mechanically cut Pt/Ir needle shows comparatively smooth regions  between the nanoscale particles in the nanoscale Si thin film,  due to the large radius of curvature of the mechanically cut  Pt/Ir needle tip.[.sup]13[/] Figure 2 shows the  three-dimensional STM near-atomic image of the nanoscale Si thin  film obtained with the Pt/Ir needle. The STM parameters are:  needle bias V[.sup]t[/] = 1.0 V; tunnel currents  I[.sup]t[/] are 0.4 nA and 0.6 nA for Figures 2(a) and 2(b),  respectively; and the scanning areas are 4.10 nm x 4.88 nm and  1.7 nm x 1.0 nm, respectively. Figure 2(a) shows that the atoms  in the brighter areas arrange in an orderly pattern, and the  darker areas are the boundary surfaces of the crystals where the  atom arrangements are somewhat random. This observation  essentially coincides with Gleiter's nanoscale material  structural model.[.sup]3[/] Two scratch marks caused by the  unstable needle are displayed in Figure 2(a). Figure 2(b)  displays the orderly arrangement of atoms with a distance of  about 3 Angstroms between neighboring atoms. At this position,  we believe that the area of STM observation is focused on the  particle. Since the particle is crystalline,[.sup]1,2[/] the  orderly arrangement of the atoms is observable.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-16A>           Figure 1. Plane Image of Nanoscale Si Thin Film </FIG>    This experiment has found that the needle bias for image  formation should not be too low to cause needle instability,  which is probably due to the nanoscale Si thin-film surface  oxidation. On the other hand, during the preparation of the  nanoscale Si thin-film specimen, the reaction between silicon  and hydrogen may hinder the surface oxidation. These results are  only preliminary. Further study is in progress.  <H5>  3. Conclusions </H5>   The STM study of nanoscale Si thin film reveals that this  film is composed of nanoscale particles with average particle   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-16B>           Figure 2. Three-Dimensional STM Near-Atomic Image of Nanoscale Si Thin Film </FIG>  size of 3 nm-5 nm. Through the STM's high-resolution imaging  capability, the near-atomic images on the thin-film surface are  directly observed. The images show that the atom arrangement of  the nanoscale particles is orderly, and the atom arrangement  between the particles is comparatively random. These results  coincide with past observations by HREM, and further disclose  the microstructure of the nanoscale Si thin film.

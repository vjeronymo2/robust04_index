			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / No majority for Banking unions Banking unions have failed to win the majority they needed to take joint strike action against compulsory redundancies at Barclays Bank. Bifu won a 54 per cent majority for a national one-day strike on a low turnout. Barclay's Group Staff Union, which has a much larger membership in the bank, had a similar vote in favour - 55 per cent - but its rule book has a 60 per cent threshold for action. The unions say they are seeking an early meeting with Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, in an attempt to remove the threat of 505 compulsory redundancies from staff in London and the south-east.</p>

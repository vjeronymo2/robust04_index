			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Attwoods claims evasion in BFI battle Attwoods, the UK waste services group, yesterday sought to throw off balance the hostile Pounds 364m bid from Browning Ferris Industries of the US by claiming the predator had evaded questions over possession of confidential information. The move was aimed at complicating preparations for the publication of BFI's offer document, which is expected next week. The UK company claimed that its major shareholder Laidlaw of Canada, was selling to BFI at a cut price under pressure from its own shareholders. Laidlaw agreed to sell its 29.8 per cent stake in Attwoods at 109p a share nine days ago. Attwoods said late yesterday evening that it was concerned that sensitive price competitive information could have been passed to BFI by Laidlaw. Three Laidlaw directors, including the chief executive Mr Jim Bullock who negotiated the deal with BFI, sit on the Attwoods board. Attwoods said they had received 'evasive answers' from both BFI and Laidlaw about the bidder's information. But BFI's corporate development director, Mr Greg Muldoon said: 'If they believed we had anything price sensitive, they would be in court.' The US company said the Laidlaw directors had provided geographical background and historical information dating from 1991 and 1992. This was not material and would not have to be disclosed in the offer document. BFI said Attwoods was running scared from its offer. 'You have to ask what they are so concerned that Laidlaw has, which should not be disclosed to shareholders,' the company said. Attwoods said it feared BFI would be able to use such information to its advantage competitively if the bid failed. However, if BFI did not have price sensitive information, 'it gives the lie to last week's whispers that BFI bid at such a ludicrously low price because it knew something other shareholders did not', said Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive.</p>

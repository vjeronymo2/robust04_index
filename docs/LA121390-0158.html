			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 1990 PREP FOOTBALL ALL-STARS;  </P> <P> HERD OF 1,000-YARD RUSHERS THUNDERS THROUGH VENTURA COUNTY  </P> <P> The Ventura County football season was a story of a premier quarterback, a herd  of prolific running backs and spirited races in three of the four leagues. It  also was the story of a dismal playoff showing by 10 of the 12 county teams  that qualified.  </P> <P> Westlake High's Todd Preston, the Ventura County back of the year, set passing  records by the bushel, but his exploits were overwhelmed in sheer volume by the  nine running backs who rushed for more than 1,000 yards.  </P> <P> Oxnard's Kenyon Lewis led county rushers with 1,368 yards, but he was chased  closely by Thousand Oaks' Cory Bowen (1,257), Westlake's Reuben Allen (1,230)  and Ventura's Jack Hammond (1,217).  </P> <P> For the first time in school history, Ventura had two 1,000-yard rushers --  sophomore Derek Swafford complemented Hammond by racking up 1,069 yards.  </P> <P> For the first time in Southern Section history, a freshman rushed for 1,000  yards. Buena's George Keiaho, a Fiji native who turned 15 years old after the  season's first game, had 1,134 yards.  </P> <P> Swafford and Keiaho, the All-County second-team running backs, should keep  Ventura-area fans entertained for several years.  </P> <P> Fillmore's Tory Cabral (1,037) had his second 1,000-yard season in a row  despite late-season injuries, Moorpark's Toussaint Powdrill rushed for 1,018  yards and Santa Clara sophomore Lloyd Mix finished with 1,010.  </P> <P> The most productive ground-gaining team, however, did not have a 1,000-yard  rusher. Camarillo's wishbone attack rolled up 3,247 yards behind five backs  with more than 400 yards.  </P> <P> Camarillo also had the most impressive playoff showing, posting a 33-8 upset  victory over previously unbeaten Pacific League champion Glendale in the first  round of the Division II playoffs. Camarillo qualified for the playoffs as an  at-large team after finishing fourth in the Marmonte League.  </P> <P> Under first-year Coach Dick Billingsley, Oak Park was the only other county  team to win a playoff game. The Eagles, who wrestled the Tri-Valley League  championship from Carpinteria, defeated Salesian, 42-20, in the first round.  </P> <P> Westlake was the county's best team early in the season, winning its first  eight games. Thousand Oaks continued its domination of the Marmonte League,  however, winning its fifth title in the past six years with a 41-10 win over  Agoura on the final week of the regular season. Lancer two-way starter Bryce  Elliott was named Ventura County lineman of the year.  </P> <P> Royal's 37-0 pasting of Westlake the same night enabled Thousand Oaks to come  away with the championship despite having tied both Royal and Westlake. Royal's  second-place finish was its best in school history and Coach Gene Uebelhardt  was named Ventura County coach of the year.  </P> <P> Ventura rolled to the Channel League title, falling only to Rio Mesa the final  week of league play. Buena, despite starting the season 1-4, rallied to finish  second in the Channel League and make the playoffs for the third consecutive  season.  </P> <P> Rio Mesa's victory over Ventura persuaded principals of Channel League schools  that the Spartans deserved the league's third playoff berth over two teams with  the same 4-3 record.  </P> <P> Fillmore appeared invincible in zipping to an 8-0 start, but losses to  Calabasas and Santa Paula cost the Flashes the Frontier League title. Santa  Paula, by contrast, dropped two nonleague games but came on strong to post a  4-0 Frontier League record and win the championship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1990 ALL-VENTURA COUNTY FOOTBALL TEAM: PLAYER SKETCHES  </P> <P> BACK OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> The Ventura County back of the year is Todd Preston, the Westlake quarterback  who rewrote the Warrior record book. Preston, a 6-foot-3, 190-pound senior,  threw for 2,427 yards this season, easily eclipsing his year-old school record  of 2,014, and a school-record 5,608 yards in his three-year career. He  completed 166 of 285 passes (58.2%) for a school-record 21 touchdowns -- the  most in the county this season -- in leading Westlake to a record of 8-2-1.  Preston, who is being recruited by many NCAA Division I colleges, passed for 46  touchdowns in his career, another Westlake record.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LINEMAN OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> The Ventura County lineman of the year is Bryce Elliott of Thousand Oaks, a  two-way starter and vocal team leader who helped the Lancers to the Marmonte  League championship and a record of 7-2-2. Elliott, a 6-3, 210-pound senior,  played tackle on offense and alternated between end and tackle on defense. On  offense, Elliott laid devastating blocks to help the Lancers gain 3,889 yards  in offense. On defense, he made 93 tackles and recorded seven sacks. And when  the team needed to be motivated, Elliott, the son of longtime Thousand Oaks  line coach Rob Elliott, was quick to provide inspiring words to his teammates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COACH OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> The Ventura County coach of the year is Gene Uebelhardt, who turned Royal from  a perennial loser into the county's best defensive team. Royal was 8-2-1,  posting the most wins in school history and finishing second in the Marmonte  League after tying Thousand Oaks, 26-26, and crushing highly regarded Westlake,  37-0. The Highlanders notched five shutouts and allowed an average of only 8.2  points a game. Before taking the Royal position in 1988, Uebelhardt served as  an assistant for nine years at Cal Lutheran, his alma mater. As a college  sophomore, he played fullback on Cal Lutheran's NAIA championship team in 1971.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OFFENSIVE BACKS  </P> <P> Preston was not the only record-setter at Westlake this season. Tailback Reuben  Allen rushed for a school-record 1,230 yards in 175 carries. Allen, a 5-8,  170-pound senior, complemented Preston's passing and kept opposing defenses  from defending solely against the pass. He rushed for a county-leading 16  touchdowns and averaged 7.0 yards a carry for a Westlake team that averaged 31  points a game.  </P> <P> The only junior on the All-County offensive team is Cory Bowen, a Thousand Oaks  tailback who rushed for 1,257 yards in 162 carries. Bowen (5-7, 170), whose  running style is marked by exceptional balance and dogged second effort, rushed  for 11 touchdowns. His longest run was 84 yards. Although Bowen ran primarily  between the tackles, his average of 7.8 yards a carry led the county among  rushers with more than 65 carries.  </P> <P> Jack Hammond, the fullback in Ventura's veer option, was equally impressive as  a ballcarrier and a blocker. Hammond, a 5-10, 170-pound senior, rushed for  1,217 yards in 158 carries for a 7.7-yard average. "Most of his yards were  tough yards inside," Coach Harvey Kochel said. "Sometimes it was even more fun  watching him block, though. He really laid some people out." Hammond's blocks  helped tailback Derek Swafford rush for 1,069 yards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RECEIVERS  </P> <P> The county's most prolific receiver by far was Westlake's Seamus Gibbons, who  made 67 receptions for 1,082 yards and nine touchdowns. Gibbons, a 5-11,  170-pound wide receiver, set school records for catches in a season and career  and receiving yardage in a season and career. "Seamus was a tremendous threat  who could run a variety of patterns," Coach Jim Benkert said.  </P> <P> Another deep threat was Royal wide receiver Jeff Creed, who teamed with  quarterback Ryan Fien and wide receiver Tony Liming to form a potent passing  game. Rangy and strong, the 6-2, 180-pound Creed made 38 catches for 634 yards  and 10 touchdowns. His longest reception was for 77 yards and he averaged 16.7  yards a catch. Creed also played defensive back in passing situations and  notched an interception.  </P> <P> Another member of Westlake's talented group of skill-position players was tight  end Dave Monheim, who made 37 receptions for 514 yards (13.9 average) and one  touchdown. Monheim, 6-3, 210, began playing football only two years ago, but he  quickly became the most feared receiving threat from the tight-end position in  the county. Monheim also started at outside linebacker.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OFFENSIVE LINEMEN  </P> <P> For the first time in school history, Ventura had two 1,000-yard rushers. Doing  the bulk of the blocking for Jack Hammond and Derek Swafford were guards Samsun  Okinaga and Brandon Evans. Crucial to the Cougars' veer offense, this pair of  exceptional guards rarely allowed defensive penetration.  </P> <P> As well as being excellent players, the Ventura guards are excellent students.  Okinaga, a 6-0, 220-pound senior, holds a 4.2 grade-point average, never having  gotten a grade lower than an A in high school. Evans, a 6-5, 255-pound senior,  holds a 3.3 GPA and is being recruited by several NCAA Division I schools.  </P> <P> Also blocking in an option offense was Camarillo guard Dan Hile, a 6-3,  215-pound senior who was the best blocker on a team that rushed for 3,247 yards  out of the wishbone. Like Okinaga and Evans, Hile is an honor student. "Dan is  very intelligent, he picked things up very fast and was able to make  adjustments quickly," said Carl Thompson, Camarillo coach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KICKER  </P> <P> Sal Balsano did a little bit of everything for Rio Mesa, leading the Spartans  to an upset win over Channel League champion Ventura and a Southern Section  Division II playoff berth. He averaged 36 yards a punt, made 18 point-after  kicks, rushed for a team-high 863 yards, had 15 receptions for 167 yards and  intercepted three passes, returning them for 77 yards. Balsano, a 5-8,  160-pound senior, scored a team-high 84 points.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEFENSIVE BACKS  </P> <P> The county's best defensive back was Royal's Tim Ross, a 6-4, 215-pound senior  who was the backbone of the stingy Highlander defense. Ross, who might be the  county's top NCAA Division I prospect, intercepted five passes and returned  them 63 yards, including one for a touchdown. A three-year starter, he played  most of the time at free safety but also saw action at linebacker and defensive  end.  </P> <P> Newbury Park's best player on offense and defense was Jason Smith, a 5-8,  160-pound senior. Smith, a free safety, intercepted three passes and returned  them 53 yards, including one for a touchdown. A wide receiver on offense, he  also set a school record with 694 receiving yards on 39 receptions. The  sticky-handed Smith caught four touchdown passes and also returned kickoffs.  </P> <P> Anchoring the Thousand Oaks defense from free safety was David Watts, who Coach  Bob Richards said was as effective as last year's Lancer standout safety, Steve  Rudisill. Watts, twin brother of Lancers standout receiver Jeff Watts, had four  interceptions and was rarely caught out of position on running plays.  </P> <P> Camarillo defeated Royal and scored an upset victory over Glendale in the first  round of the playoffs after putting quarterback Corey Tucker in the defensive  backfield as well. Tucker, it turned out, was an exceptional defensive back,  intercepting three passes. As quarterback of the Scorpion wishbone, Tucker  rushed for 796 yards and eight touchdowns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LINEBACKERS  </P> <P> Kenyon Lewis, Oxnard's best player on both sides of the ball, was a tremendous  rusher in more than one respect. As an outside linebacker, Lewis (6-2, 190)  registered nine sacks and led Oxnard in tackles. As a tailback, he led the  county with 1,368 yards rushing and nine touchdowns in 225 carries.  </P> <P> Chuck Mullaney was the player in the middle of the defensive and offensive  schemes for Buena, which finished second in the Channel League. Mullaney, a  5-11, 185-pound senior, was a ferocious hitter from his linebacker position.  Mullaney also played fullback, opening holes for freshman tailback George  Keiaho and rushing for 621 yards and 12 touchdowns himself.  </P> <P> The Channel League defensive player of the year was Rio Mesa's Frank Tinoco, a  6-3, 200-pound middle linebacker. Tinoco spearheaded a Spartan defense that  allowed a lot of yards -- but precious few between the guards. "Frank's  strength and intensity were an inspiration to our entire defense," Rio Mesa  Coach John Reardon said.  </P> <P> Another middle linebacker who stuffed running plays up the middle was  Camarillo's Tag Johnson, a 6-0, 190-pound junior. Johnson led the Scorpions  with 115 tackles and he also had three interceptions. He also played fullback  in Camarillo's wishbone offense and rushed for 634 yards and five touchdowns  and had one game of more than 200 yards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEFENSIVE LINEMEN  </P> <P> One of only two juniors on the All-Ventura County defense is Royal's Jason  Evans, a 6-0, 252-pound defensive lineman. Evans' strength and quickness made  him very difficult to block. He was named the Marmonte League's co-lineman of  the year along with Elliott of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Another stalwart member of Royal's defensive front was Matt Tomaszewski, who  played on the line and at middle linebacker. Tomaszewski, a 5-11, 195-pound  senior, was not only the Highlanders' leading tackler, he was the most spirited  defensive player as well.  </P> <P> Largely because of the play of Evans and Tomaszewski, Royal posted five  shutouts and held opponents to 1,030 rushing yards.  </P> <P> Senior Mike Ciandella continued the strong Thousand Oaks tradition of  hard-rushing defensive linemen. Ciandella, a 5-11, 190-pound senior, registered  13 sacks, second most in school history. An intelligent and emotional player,  Ciandella helped the Marmonte League champion Lancers register two shutouts and  hold opposing teams to an average of 134 yards rushing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1990

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Dismay marks small businesses' response - The Battle for Midland DISMAY WAS the overriding response of Britain's small businesses to yesterday's announcement of Lloyds Bank's plan to bid for Midland Bank. Reducing the number of large high street banking groups from four to three would restrict competition and further tilt the balance of power towards the large banking groups, according to small business owners and small business organisations. The proposal comes at a time when small businesses are already disillusioned with the quality of service provided by the banks, particularly in the wake of last year's government investigation of allegations that bankers were not passing on lower interest charges to their customers. The Forum of Private Business, with 19,000 members, calculated a merger would create a bank with 32 per cent of the small firms market (20 per cent from Lloyds and 12 per cent from Midland) compared with the 25 per cent market shares held by National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank. Mr Jonathan Fowler, chairman of Chinecrest Archives, a Pounds 1m turnover company which stores documents for the banks and for insurance companies, pointed out: 'The larger companies have the bargaining power to stand up to the banks, but we have to go along with what they say'. A merger of the two banks would concentrate power in the banking field and in secondary areas of financing such as leasing and factoring, where both banks already have sizeable operations. Mr John Cartwright, joint founder of Excalibur CBK, a Stoke-on-Trent-based manufacturer of fire fighting vehicles with sales of Pounds 2m and 25 employees, said: 'I see this as the thin end of the wedge'. Mr Cartwright, who has banked with Barclays since setting up Excalibur eight years ago, said he feared that small businesses would have very limited choice if they wanted to change banks in future. Apart from a lack of choice he considered that a merger would also create banking organisations even more remote from the concerns of small businesses. Ms Jane Lyon, managing director of Clam-Brummer, an east London manufacturer of industrial adhesives, said: 'A merged Lloyds/Midland would be even more out of touch with its small business accounts'. The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 50,000 members, described the timing of the proposed merger as particularly unfortunate. Mr Stephen Alambritis, for the FSB, said: 'This is a backward step during a recession. The banks already have a bad name for trying to recoup their losses from small businesses.'</p>

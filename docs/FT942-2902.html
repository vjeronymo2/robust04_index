			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Strong yen lifts car imports Sales of the big three US carmakers in Japan have surged recently with the help of the strong yen and more aggressive marketing, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. Japanese sales of GM, Ford and Chrysler from January to May doubled from the same period last year to 16,531 units, according to the Japan Auto Importers Association. While the yen's sharp appreciation has made US cars more affordable, the rise in sales was also helped by the greater awareness among Japanese consumers of US cars. Ford has launched prime-time advertising on Japanese TV and is putting the Ford name on dealers previously known as Autorama, which it owns through a joint venture with Mazda.</p>

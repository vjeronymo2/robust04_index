			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Jose Luiz Longo from Cape Town, </F> South Africa]    [Text] The military issue was at the center of a meeting  held yesterday by PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz  Inacio Lula da Silva and Minister Jay Naidoo, the coordinator of  the South African social reform program. Lula voiced concern  over the redemocratization of the Armed Forces. He said he  intends to set up rules based on constitutional provisions in  coordination with military commanders.    Lula expressed his concern about redemocratizing the Armed  Forces when Naidoo alluded to the extreme care with which the  South African Government is addressing the issue, taking into  account that security in South Africa continues to remain  exclusively in the hands of the white minority.    Lula acknowledged that the situation in the Brazilian Armed  Forces is different, because they have fewer resources than the  South African military, whose budget will have to be streamlined  to allow the government to increase investments in social areas.    Lula said: In our case, our military even have financial  problems in procuring polish for their boots. Yet we share the  same concern about democratizing the Armed Forces.    Before having dinner with Naidoo -- a former president of  COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], a trade union  organization similar to CUT [Sole Workers Center] in Brazil --  Lula said he hopes to have the support of trade union  organizations, especially CUT, to give greater dynamics to  government-labor-management committees if he is elected  president.    Lula said: Government-labor-management committees are  important tools in relieving unions from merely channeling wage  demands to addressing issues such as economic growth goals in  our talks with the government and employers.</p>

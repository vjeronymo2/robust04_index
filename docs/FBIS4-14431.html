			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Shpachkov: "What Color Will Bryansk Duma </F> Be?"]    [Text] Bryansk -- Elections have been held to the Bryansk  Oblast Duma in an unstable sociopolitical situation. The  oblast, in turmoil at the constant change of leaders (this is no  joke, last year they changed governors three times!), has again  been sent into a spin. In the local mass media and at meetings  with the voters deputies of the Russian Federal Assembly -- Petr  Shirshov, former chairman of Bryansk City Soviet, Oleg  Shenkarev, leader of the Russian Federation Communist Party  oblast organization, and other opponents of the course of  reforms -- have been trying to mobilize public opinion in favor  of reinstating the communist Yuriy Lodkin, previously ousted by  the president, to the post of governor.    The oblast duma cannot expand indefinitely. It has 27 seats.  One-hundred-and-fifty-two deputies want to occupy them.  Furthermore, it is mainly economic managers and leaders of  production who wanted to contest those seats. A real danger  emerged that instead of a constructive body here there might be  a recurrence of the old party-economic aktiv. This, of course,  was bound to affect the voters' attitude.    Emerging from the woodwork, the partyocrats and opponents of  the radical transformation of the country bombarded people with  a torrent of propaganda that has been so well rehearsed in the  past. Leaflets appeared in Bryansk "advising" voters to vote  unfailingly for the communists and, of course, against the  oblast Charter, which has been submitted to the residents'  verdict. Such a familiar "corrupt leadership," such a familiar  method! Victory at any price -- that is the usual principle of  the opponents of the reforms. But it seems that the "champions  of the people's well-being" had not given any thought to what  actual work they would do on the voters' behalf should they  happen to win. For example, how did Federation Council Deputy  Petr Shirshov, recently elected chairman of the CIS Countries'  Defense Committee, plan physically and geographically to combine  that job with his work in the oblast duma? After all, Petr  Petrovich was so busy that he could not even attend a  prearranged news conference, and the candidate sent an assistant  to represent his interests.    Do these factors not explain the unprecedentedly low turnout  of voters in Bryansk? By the end of polling none of the city  electoral districts had managed to pass the necessary 25-percent  target. It was only the turnout among rural inhabitants which  made the elections in the oblast valid.</p>

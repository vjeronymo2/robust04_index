			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A STAR BY WORD OF MOUTH;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: SALLY JESSY RAPHAEL WORKS WITHOUT THE RAZZLE AND DAZZLE OF HER  COMPETITORS, BUT SHE'S BEEN NOMINATED AGAIN FOR AN EMMY AS BEST TALK-SHOW HOST.  </P> <P> Sally Jessy Raphael has learned to live with the question: Is she upset that  talk-show competitors such as Oprah Winfrey are far better known?  </P> <P> "Oh, gosh, no. I don't feel bad," maintains Raphael. "I'm grateful to be where  I am."  </P> <P> It would be only human, of course, if she really felt otherwise. Last year, in  a TV Guide interview, her husband was quoted as saying that the Oprah  phenomenon was discussed "ad nauseam." But Raphael simply and diplomatically  said the other day, "Oprah is magic."  </P> <P> If Raphael, whose show is carried in Los Angeles by KCAL Channel 9, has a major  strength, it is that she knows her place. Better yet, she knows who she is. She  is an average-looking, hard-working, down-to-earth broadcast professional who  has been through the mill -- fired 18 times -- but has not let it embitter her  as she tackles her daily syndicated series with a matronly warmth.  </P> <P> The approach works. Last year, she won the Daytime Emmy Award for best  talk-show host, beating out Oprah, among others. And last Thursday, both she  and her show were nominated again for this year's Daytime Emmys, which will be  televised on ABC from New York on June 28.  </P> <P> What's more, Raphael is out promoting her new book, "Sally," which she wrote  with Pam Proctor. Typically, it focuses on what she calls the "funny, crazy"  experiences of her career: "It tells the stories of a man and a woman and their  kids going from town to town trying to find work.  </P> <P> "This is the story of thinking you've made it 20 times, and each time the show  gets canceled or the station changes language and you're back at ground zero.  And you're going, 'Why does it take so long?' It's also the story of telling  people that if you stay around long enough, having nothing to do with talent. .  . . Well, I think the talent is in staying."  </P> <P> The day after her latest Emmy nomination last week, Raphael sat calmly on a  couch in her suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel amid hurried reminders that she  had to leave soon to tape her guest shot on the Arsenio Hall show. She refused  to be rushed.  </P> <P> No, she said of her image, she did not try to keep a low public profile  compared to competitors Winfrey, Phil Donahue, Geraldo Rivera and, now, Joan  Rivers: "It may be because there's nothing sensational about me. I mean, I'm a  lady who's been married to the same man for 25 years. I have my children; I  travel with them. The tabloids don't call. There's no dirt, there's nothing,  just somebody working at their job.  </P> <P> "I think that in today's world, that says something. And I think the reason you  last is that you're a comfortable, not objectionable, person to a lot of  people. Now, there's two ways of making it. There's making it with a great big  splash. But Hugh Downs is a slow guy who's always going to work. Sally Jessy  Raphael is a slow person who's always going to work."  </P> <P> No one, of course, epitomizes the big-splash species more than Winfrey. And  Raphael has sized up her competition: "In any business, there's always somebody  who comes along who wins all the prizes. Oprah's the one who won all the  prizes. There is no comparison in terms of fame or salary or acceptance or  timing or anything. I don't feel that anybody, either Geraldo or Phil or I or  any of the other shows, comes near to Oprah's phenomenal success.  </P> <P> "This lady did not get lucky. This lady is a good broadcaster. She's what  America wants to see. I don't know what other people earn. I don't know what  stock they have. But none of us could put up a studio (as Winfrey has in  Chicago). It's like saying to some man who's working somewhere, and he thinks  he's done well -- and has -- 'Let's compare you with John D. Rockefeller.' "  </P> <P> As for Donahue, Raphael says: "That guy probably would have been pretty happy  being an Irishman in politics. I know him, so I know that's true. He's been  doing this 23 years. He's forgotten more than this lady is going to learn.  Would he ever give this up and run for politics? I wouldn't be surprised."  </P> <P> KCAL broadcasts the "Sally Jessy Raphael" show twice daily -- a rerun at 11  a.m. and new segments at 2 p.m. Low profile or not, she has become one of that  special breed of national TV schmoozers whose first name alone is sufficient  identification -- Phil, Geraldo, Oprah and Sally -- and whose styles and  frequently flamboyant content provoke endless debate.  </P> <P> Raphael says that perhaps 70% of her programs come from viewer mail: "Please do  a show on. . . ." And although her first-run broadcasts are presented at 2 p.m.  on KCAL, she says her national exposure is vastly different: "My audience is  largely 10 o'clock in the morning, predominantly female, surprisingly young --  but they're home because they're mothers. They've had their baby and they're  staying home with their child."  </P> <P> The mid-morning time slots nationally could also explain why Raphael's profile  is lower than those of Oprah, Phil and Geraldo, who, in Los Angeles for  example, are used as lead-ins to the local evening news, and thus become part  and parcel of hard-hitting TV packages.  </P> <P> On a national basis, too, says Raphael, "Oprah, Phil and Geraldo are late  afternoon. People put us together in one bag. But by late afternoon, when  they're on, there are many more men watching, and their audiences also have  children included. There are very few school systems where there are many  children home at 10 o'clock in the morning."  </P> <P> Still, with her mix of subjects ranging from matchmakers to diseases to social  issues to a bikini contest, Raphael is definitely on a roll. And in her effort  to enhance her down-home image as opposed to the big boppers like Donahue and  Geraldo, she's made it a point to take her show to many cities.  </P> <P> Maybe she shouldn't have stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel. You almost expect  to find Sally Jessy Raphael at a Holiday Inn, gabbing in the lobby with  families checking in. The fast lane really isn't her speed, and that's clearly  her appeal to her fans.  </P> <P> "I love the show," she says. "I want to stay here as long as I'm allowed. You  get your 10 minutes in the sun and you do what you do, and then you have to be  prepared for the day it's over."  </P></p>

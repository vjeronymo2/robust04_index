			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The Milan Public Prosecutor's  office has sensationally asked for 37 politicians and  businessmen involved in the Enimont affair to stand trial. This  was the same affair for which financier Sergio Cusani was tried  and found guilty. Dario Carella reports from the Milan  courthouse.    [Carella] [passage omitted] Chief Public Prosecutor Borrelli  said that Deputy Prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro has requested to  Examining Judge Italo Ghitti that 37 people, mostly politicians,  stand trial on various charges connected with the Enimont  investigation. Among the 37 are Northern League leader Umberto  Bossi, former Northern League treasurer Alessandro Patelli,  [former Prime Minister] Bettino Craxi, [Italian Republican Party  leader] Giorgio La Malfa, [former Justice Minister] Claudio  Martelli, [former Italian Liberal Party leader] Renato  Altissimo, Pino Berlini, Luigi Bisignani, Montedison's Carlo  Sama, ENI's Alberto Grotti, [former Foreign Minister] Gianni De  Michelis, [former Christian Democratic Party Treasurer] Severino  Citaristi, [former Prime Minister] Arnaldo Forlani, [former  Italian Liberal Party Minister] Egidio Sterpa, [former Milan  Mayor] Paolo Pillitteri, and [former Budget Minister] Paolo  Cirino Pomicino.    Turning to the one billion lire that was allegedly paid to  the Italian Communist Party -- the Milan Criminal Court's Second  Section also found Cusani guilty in relation to this. Borrelli  said that as yet it is not known to whom the one billion lire  was physically paid, and no decision has been made for the time  being. Borrelli stressed `for the time being,' so the  investigations are continuing.</p>

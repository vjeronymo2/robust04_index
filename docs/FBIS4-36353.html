			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will  arrive for another shuttle mission between Israel and Syria  toward the end of the month. Our political correspondent Gadi  Sukenik has learned that the political echelons were notified of  this by the State Department. Our correspondent further learned  that, in the meantime, peace talks coordinator Dennis Ross and  his aides continue delivering secret messages between the  leaders of Israel and Syria in an attempt to reach agreements  and establish a better basis for the success of the U.S.  secretary of state's visit to our region.    At the same time, Israeli sources denied the reports from  Jordan regarding an arrangement that was allegedly reached on a  withdrawal from the Golan. The sources said that the road to an  agreement with Syria is still long. They believe that the  report from Amman was designed to justify the Jordanian decision  to resume the peace negotiations with Israel.    Minister Yosi Sarid said today that it can be assumed that  the negotiations with Syria will resume in the near future, and  it may be that the next round of talks will be more promising  than the preceding ones. Mr. Sarid made the remarks during a  tour of the Golan, and our correspondent Moti Eden heard him  there.</p>

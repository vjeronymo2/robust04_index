			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates end lower RATES IN the sterling money markets finished lower yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a large shortage that was quickly taken out in the morning. The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn at the start of the day and, in the early round, purchased Pounds 250m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 1.05bn of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on June 9 and 10 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The speed with which the shortage was eliminated took a number of dealers by surprise. One money market analyst suggested that, not so long ago, the Bank's stance yesterday might have been seen as accommodative, and signalling a base rate cut. However, recent comments from the deputy governor of the Bank of England and the chancellor of the exchequer make this hard to believe. Most dealers spoken to yesterday felt that the Bank was, at the very most, showing that it was happy with rates at the current levels. Others said that the speed with which the shortage was removed was part of the well-tried strategy of pushing the overnight rate down as far as possible before a bank holiday weekend. Everything from three-month money to one-year ended the day at 9 15/16 per cent, down  1/16 on the day. The overnight rate closed sharply down, at 9 1/2 per cent having ended at 12 3/4 per cent the previous day. At one stage of the day it was as low as 8 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank's forecast was revised to a shortage of Pounds 1.45bn before taking account of the morning operations. In the afternoon the Bank purchased Pounds 58m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. There was less activity in the sterling futures market. The June short sterling contract closed at 90.04 per cent, up 6 ticks on the day. The closing price indicates that the market believes three-month LIBOR in mid-June will be at 9.96 per cent. The September contract ended at 90.34, up three ticks. The closing price suggests that the market thinks three-month LIBOR in September will be at 9.66 per cent. In Germany, call money rates were easier yesterday due to high levels of reserves held on deposit at the Bundesbank. But traders said that the decline in overnight rates, which were quoted at 9.45-55 per cent yesterday, was chiefly due to technical factors.</p>

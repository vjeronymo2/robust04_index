			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ON WEEKEND TV  </P> <P> The final weekend of the National Football League's regular season will share  the sports television spotlight with three college bowl games.  </P> <P> The Raiders could clinch their first AFC West Division title since 1985 today  if the Kansas City Chiefs lose to the Chicago Bears, 9:30 a.m., Channels 4, 36  and 39. Today's other NFL game matches the Philadelphia Eagles and Phoenix  Cardinals, 1 p.m., Channels 2 and 8.  </P> <P> For most Southland viewers, Sunday's best game will come last, when the  Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Oilers figure to decide the AFC Central  Division championship at 5 p.m. on ESPN. The Buffalo Bills, already assured of  home field advantage throughout the playoffs, meet the Washington Redskins at  10 a.m. on Channel 4.  </P> <P> In a game without meaning, the Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers close out  mutually disappointing seasons at 1 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. KNSD Channel 39  in San Diego and KMIR Channel 36 in Palm Springs will carry the Raiders-San  Diego Chargers game from the Coliseum at 1 p.m.  </P> <P> College Football: Although there will be 16 college bowl games in a six-day  period, today's Sea World Holiday Bowl between Brigham Young and Texas A&amp;M  does figure to stand out, mainly because of the Cougars passing attack led by  Heisman Trophy quarterback Ty Detmer. ESPN's coverage begins at 4:30 p.m.  Today's other bowl games are the Peach, matching Indiana and Auburn (9:30 a.m.,  Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) and the Freedom from Anaheim Stadium between Oregon  and Colorado State (5 p.m., Channels 9, 51 and 63.)  </P> <P> Basketball and hockey: Fans wanting alternatives to football today can turn to  the Clippers and Utah Jazz (12:30 p.m., Channel 5); the Kings and Montreal  Canadiens (7:30 p.m., Prime Ticket); Nevada Las Vegas and Pacific basketball (8  p.m., SportsChannel) or UCLA-San Diego State basketball (11:30 p.m., Prime  Ticket.). On Sunday, the Lakers are home against the 76ers for a 7:30 p.m.  Prime Ticket telecast.STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Vote for double-digit inflation]: John Willman says Labour does not need big ideas to win the election I FIND it hard not to feel sorry for Neil Kinnock. Whatever he does, he cannot please his critics. He has spent the past nine years purging the Labour party of ideology. Out have gone unilateral nuclear disarmament, nationalisation of the top 200 monopolies and free television licences for pensioners. In have come reams of worthy papers setting out plans for making the trains run on time, tightening company law and improving reading standards in schools. The result? Kinnock's critics say that he lacks a 'big idea,' that no one knows what he stands for. Newspapers which used to declare Labour unelectable because of its policies now claim that it cannot be trusted for changing them. Personally, I think that Labour needs a big idea like it needs a hole in the head. After 11 years of Thatcherism, I am sure that not having an axe to grind is worth a few million votes. But Labour does need to assemble a few simple themes which give people something to latch on to. I cannot be the only voter who is unclear about just how life would be different under a Labour government. So, in the spirit of improving what looks otherwise to be a lacklustre election campaign, I offer three election-winning policies for an ambitious prime minister-in-waiting. The first is to bring back double-digit inflation at the earliest opportunity. Since it will almost certainly happen under a Labour government, anyway, Kinnock might as well claim the credit for its beneficial effects now. Weekend FT readers who are owner-occupiers will need little reminding of those beneficial effects. Rising nominal house prices shrink away mortgage debts, avoiding the sort of misery caused by the present decline in house prices. They make people feel good. They make people spend money which creates jobs. And since most people get pay rises in excess of inflation (or are on index-linked benefits), burdensome mortgage payments swiftly dwindle away to affordable proportions. Indeed, I predict that the double-digit inflation rates of the 1970s will soon join regional railway companies and learning by rote on the political nostalgia Top Ten. My second election-winner is a promise to bring back the grammar schools and direct grants. This would be hugely popular - their abolition provoked widespread 'save our schools' campaigns because of the esteem they enjoyed locally. It would also be recognisably a socialist policy. Parents who can afford it now buy a grammar school education for their children from the independent schools. Children whose families cannot afford the fees are denied the quality of education which the grammar schools provided. I cannot be the only voter who finds this unacceptable in a society which claims to offer equality of opportunity. It is also a waste of talent if children from working-class families find it harder to get into tertiary education. My third suggestion is a confiscatory inheritance tax extended to include all lifetime gifts. I would exclude gifts and bequests between husband and wife, as at present. And I would introduce complete exemptions for small businesses so long as they remained in the family - to encourage the development of a Mittelstand on German lines. But I would rake off anything else other than a few thousand pounds of gifts and bequests and the cost of a decent burial. The proceeds of such a tax would allow Labour to give every 18-year-old an endowment of Pounds 10,000. To stop them spending it all on sex, drugs and rock'n'roll, this endowment would be encashable only for a limited range of uses. At the top of the list would be vocational training and higher education (a beneficial side-effect would be that universities would then get their income from their students, not the state). It could also be used to buy a house, start up a business or for long-term investments - with provisions to stop it being cashed in. A massive step towards greater equality of opportunity, it would empower young people to make real choices about their lives. It would also be in sharp contrast to the Conservatives' plans to reduce inheritance tax, which could be lampooned as encouraging the sons and daughters of the rich to become idle layabouts. So, there we are. Three unbeatable policies - and none of them costs a bean in extra spending. Is anyone listening out there?</p>

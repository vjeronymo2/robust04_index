			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bundesbank acts to curb money supply THE Bundesbank acted again yesterday to drain funds from the money market and prevent a further ballooning of the money supply in the wake of the heavy intervention on currency markets in recent weeks. This week's round of securities repurchase agreements (repos), totalling DM28bn, (Pounds 11bn) would be cancelled, it said. Last week's DM20bn transaction also did not take place. Commercial banks use repos as a form of refinancing. The German central bank also made use yesterday of Treasury bill offers and currency repos to banks for the seventh day running. They were issued at 8.8 per cent to run for three days. Altogether, dealers estimated, the Bundesbank has now drained at least DM65bn from the money market, including the latest cancelled repo, with a remaining overhang of liquidity of between DM70bn and DM100bn. Further liquidity draining operations were thus likely to occur in coming days, they added. This could mean that the DM16bn repo due next week could also be cancelled. While the Bundesbank is concerned that the growth rate of M3, the broad monetary aggregate - already running well above its target range this year - should not be accelerated by the effect of the massive currency intervention, some economists think it could act more vigorously to remove liquidity. 'They have a lot of scope to compensate any short-term oversupply of central bank money supply', said Mr Peter Bofinger, economics professor at Wurzburg university. 'They can absorb a huge amount of liquidity at very short notice.' He said the central bank should go more on the offensive and show its strength in the international foreign exchange and money markets. It is the rapid growth in M3, at a higher than expected annualised rate of 9 per cent in August against a 1992 target range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent, that mainly lies behind the Bundesbank's determination to keep interest rates high. Last week economists forecast that an annualised expansion rate of more than 10 per cent could be recorded for M3 this month because of the liquidity created by unprecedented D-Mark central bank sales throughout Europe in recent weeks. The Bundesbank cut interest rates two weeks ago as part of the lira devaluation package in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). But many German economists reckon it will now keep the Lombard rate at 9.5 per cent and the discount rate at 8.25 per cent. There has been speculation of further cuts on Friday when the Bundesbank holds its next council meeting - outside Frankfurt in Schwerin in the east German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. But several economists said they expected no more reductions yet. Economists from Dresdner Bank, Nomura Research, and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said the Bundesbank would concentrate on trying to bring the money supply into line and thus dampen inflationary tendencies.</p>

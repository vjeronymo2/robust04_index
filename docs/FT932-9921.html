			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Germany questions its role as Zagreb's chief supporter CROATIA'S military support for the Bosnian Croats will come under sharp criticism when Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, makes his first visit to Zagreb on Friday. During talks with President Franjo Tudjman and Mr Zdenko Skrabalo, the Croatian foreign minister, Mr Kinkel is expected to ask why Croatia continues militarily to back Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats, and the new offensive against Moslem forces in western Bosnia-Hercegovina. The visit coincides with greater questioning in the German media about Bonn's decision to push through the European Community's recognition of Croatia's independence in January 1991. That policy, spearheaded by Mr Hans Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, punctured any semblance of unity among EC states about how to deal with the unfolding crisis in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Kinkel, however, has become more openly critical about Croatia's military involvement in Bosnia-Hercegovnia, and Croatia's attempts earlier this year to regain control of the Krajina area of south-western Croatia which, although a UN protectorate, is run by Serb nationalists seeking autonomy from Zagreb. 'Mr Kinkel will keep stressing the need for a negotiated settlement as a means of stopping the war. The longer the war continues, the more Germany will have to bear the brunt of the refugee problem,' a Foreign Ministry official in Bonn said. But requests for German economic aid to reconstruct the Croatian economy are unlikely to be high on the agenda as long the area remains unstable. More than 460,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia have arrived in Germany in the past 18 months. At the same time, Germany has been at the forefront among EC countries in providing humanitarian aid to Croatia, which includes financing a hospital in Karlovac, south of Zagreb, and setting up a food and medical distribution network in the republic and extending into Bosnia. Bonn has already allocated direct humanitarian assistance totalling DM155m (Pounds 63m), in addition to DM196m towards EC aid for the region.</p>

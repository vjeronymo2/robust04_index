			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHALLENGES TO PORTRAYALS AND CASTING  </P> <P> Is it a tribute -- as the makers of "Memphis Belle" say in the credits -- to  show bomber crew members fighting among themselves in mid-air while leading a  raid and the co-pilot whining because he is not the skipper and the navigator  dissolving into tears at the first ack-ack?  </P> <P> And did the fliers really spend their time on the ground shouting and arguing  and taking night walks to pat the nose of their plane? No wonder Gregory Peck  had such trouble in "12 O'Clock High."  </P> <P> CYRUS MUNDALL (Ex-member 8th Air Force), Hollywood  </P></p>

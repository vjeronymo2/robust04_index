			<p>BFN     [Text] Mikhail Shmakov, leader of the Federation of  Independent Trade Unions of Russia, outlined in a letter to the  Kremlin chief of staff and the chairman of the Yeltsin-sponsored  Public Chamber, the Federation's own view on the Civic Accord  which it signed in Moscow 28 April.    To begin with, the Federation says there can be no question  of a moratorium on strikes. The unions, it says, reserve the  right to collective action if the government fails to comply  with accords on pay and work conditions, employment, and social  security guarantees.    The Federation insists that the government must clear its  debt of back wages in the first half of 1994 rather than later  in the year and help keep intact the existing system of free  secondary and vocational education, something that the Accord  does not guarantee.    The Federation also demands that its special view is made  known to the conciliatory commission and used as a basis for  further talks with government officials on controversial points  of the Accord.</p>

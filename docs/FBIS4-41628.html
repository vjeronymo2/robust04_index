			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 26 June TASS -- "Ukraine will march the road of  radical political and economic reforms. This is for sure. We  have no other way if we want to build an economically strong and  independent state and if we want to improve the life of people,"  incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk said in reply to journalists  after casting balloting papers at one of Kiev's polling stations  on Sunday.    "If I'm elected president, I shall continue reforms, shall  work to resolve all difficult issues concerning the state and  the government," he continued.    He stressed that special attention "will be given to  privatisation, a change in currency regulation, the tax system,  price formation, labour remuneration and pensions.    "It will be necessary to tackle urgently also foreign  economic problems: Customs houses, customs duties, relations  with other states and stimulation of exports to earn hard  currency."</p>

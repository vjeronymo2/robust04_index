			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE UNREPRESENTED  </P> <P> Harry Bernstein's thought-provoking June 13 column, "Union Nudges L.A. School  Board Toward Power Sharing," makes a disquieting reference to the composition  of the soon-to-be-formed central school council. According to the column, the  only teachers permitted to be on the council would be those belonging to the  teachers' union. As one concerned with the rights of all teachers I see this  provision as inimical to the interests of those teachers who choose not to  spend $400 a year to support a group whose leadership doesn't or can't  represent everyone.  </P> <P> WILLIAM FARRAR  </P> <P> Huntington Park  </P> <P>  Editor's Note: Union teachers are expected to be elected to the central  council because of the majority that union members command in the school  system, but nonunion teachers are eligible for election to the council.  </P></p>

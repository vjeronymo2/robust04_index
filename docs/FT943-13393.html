			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / World Trade News: WTO chief contender with trade in his veins - Guy de Jonquieres interviews South Korean Kim Chul-su who is seeking to head the new world body Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister, is not a natural attention-seeker. Soft-spoken, courteous and discreetly attired, he looks every inch the product of his 20-year career as an influential government technocrat. But in the next few weeks, the 53-year-old Mr Kim will be pounding the campaign trail, canvassing support in ministries around the globe for his bid to become head of the World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. Australia, eager to emphasise its Asian links, has already come out in his favour, and he is optimistic about winning backing in the rest of the region. He is more guarded about the attitudes of the US and the EU, whose support, he acknowledges, will be crucial. He bases his claim to the WTO job, first, on Korea's spectacular economic development, which is emblematic of Asia's rapidly growing importance in the global economy and international trade. He relates with pride how, in three decades, his country has risen from poverty to the stage where it is ready to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Paris-based 'rich man's club'. His second claim is his long specialisation in international trade affairs. He participated in the Uruguay Round and has represented Korea in many bilateral trade negotiations with the US, the European Union and Japan. 'I have the feel of the trade policies of industrialised and developing countries,' he says, adding that Korea's trade is equally divided between them. 'I think I can deal with trade and investment issues in an impartial way.' The US-educated Mr Kim, who speaks fluent English, is respected as an astute negotiator in support of his government's interests. 'He is a tough cookie who is always on top of his brief,' says a senior European official. Other observers, however, were less impressed by his chairmanship of a key Uruguay Round committee. 'Much of the nitty-gritty work was done by others,' says an official in Geneva. 'You couldn't say he made the difference between success and failure.' Mr Kim believes his penchant for technical detail would be valuable in getting the WTO running smoothly. 'The leader should be ready to act as conciliator and mediator. In that capacity, he has to know the details of trade problems. Willingness to work with details is very important to the job,' he says. His skills at settling international disputes were severely tested in the late 1980s, when US threats of trade sanctions against Seoul inflamed relations with Washington and outraged Korean public opinion. 'But in the end, we were able to solve the problem in a relatively calm way,' he says. That experience left him with a deep aversion to bilateral trade offensives. 'There is always political resistance when a big country tries to pressure people in a smaller country to accepting its own standards and preferences,' he says. Mr Kim is reluctant to enunciate any sweeping vision for the future of the WTO, saying it will have plenty to do implementing the Uruguay Round and negotiating the entry of about 20 new members. He is equally reticent about how he would handle politically contentious questions, such as the links between trade, the environment and workers' rights, arguing that more research is needed to define an 'intellectual basis' for policy-making. He stands 'somewhere in the middle' of the debate on workers' rights and trade, which has put the US and many developing countries at bitter odds. However, he would like the WTO to study how to help the very poorest countries benefit more from international trade. Though such cautious attitudes may not impress those who believe the WTO needs charismatic, high-profile leadership, they are unlikely to arouse hostility, either. More controversial may be Korea's reputation for being slow to remove trade barriers. In a recent survey of international companies, it emerged as the most protectionist country in the Asia-Pacific region and the most hostile towards inward investment. Mr Kim concedes Korea may have 'a negative image', but considers it unfair. 'One would be hard-pressed to name a country which has moved so fast to liberalise in the past 15 years,' he says, adding that the process has recently accelerated. He also insists that critics - particularly in Europe - are partly to blame for ignoring opportunities in Asia. 'European governments and businessmen need to be more aggressive,' he says.</p>

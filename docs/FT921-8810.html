			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Rumours fuel share rise as banks support WPP SHARES of WPP, the world's largest advertising agency, jumped 25p to close at 83p yesterday after a meeting between the troubled company and its bankers produced 'no surprises'. The stock has doubled from 42p a week ago. Support has come from heavy US buying and rumours about positive developoments for WPP. WPP and auditors from Price Waterhouse are understood to have presented the group's 1992 budget yesterday to its bankers. The company did not request additional funds from the banks which last January refinanced Dollars 1bn of debt. Bankers said, however, that WPP could require another Dollars 75m either in April or in the autumn. The main rumour during the week was that Interpublic, the US agency, was looking at Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the agency which Mr Martin Sorrell, WPP's chairman, bought in 1989. Interpublic denied any knowledge of such interest. A further rumour that bankers had sewn up a Dollars 200m financing package was also denied, and a story that Mr Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire, would back WPP, was also believed to lack any basis in fact. Bankers at the meetings said WPP had performed well enough since its restructuring last January not to have breached its new covenants, an achievement one banker said, was 'not a common occurrence in restructurings.' The banks were being supportive and while WPP had not done particularly well it was 'hanging in there' while waiting for an upturn.</p>

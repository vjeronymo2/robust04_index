			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Viktorovich Sakharnov, president of AO </F> Boguchangesstroy, by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA staff correspondent  Vladimir Khrustalev, Kodinsk: "To Whom the Angara Dividends Will  Accrue"; date and place not given]    [Text] The joint-stock conversion of the largest  Russian power project under construction has begun -- that of  the Boguchanskaya GES [Hydroelectric Power Plant], and, along  with it, the transformation of the hired hand into an owner. Our  correspondent talks with Yuriy Sakharnov, president of the AO  Boguchangesstroy [Joint-Stock Company Boguchanskaya GES  Construction].    [Khrustalev] From the government's decision on joint-stock  conversion of the Boguchanskaya GES to the issuing of  certificates is an enormous distance.    [Sakharnov] The lengthy procedures have in no way violated  the privatization conditions stipulated by the Russian  Federation President's edict for the version chosen by us. What  has occurred has been just the transfer from the Krasnoyarsk  Kray's Property Fund to the Russian Joint-Stock Company, the  Unified Power System of Russia, of 49 percent of the shares  intended for sale at auctions to large investors, including  foreign ones. This, I believe, is a correct and sensible step.    We have overcome the psychological barrier of the  preconceived opinion: whatever goes outside the boundaries of  the kray is no longer ours. Indeed, if things are considered  objectively, the kray authorities are in no position to invest  in a construction project. But, having transferred the block of  shares to RAO YeES Rossii [Unified Power System of Russia], they  have opened the oxygen valve for a project which is of paramount  importance both for the kray's economy and for the  transformations of all of Russia.    In other respects, however, the distribution is as before.  Almost a fourth of all the securities will be sold to small  investors at check auctions. And 26.6 percent remains in the  labor collective.    [Khrustalev] Is this a lot or a little?    [Sakharnov] Sufficient, if it is kept in mind that the  overall number of shares is around one and a half million. A  third of the cited portion, or 8.7 percent, will be received  free of charge by the workers of AO Boguchanskaya GES  Construction. A tenth part, or 2.6 percent of the securities,  will go by private tender at a discount of the face value of 30  percent and on a 3-year installment plan. Five percent of the  shares is for officials and the administration. In the event of  the introduction of new production lines and an increase in the  collective, there still remains an enterprise workers  joint-stock conversion fund of 10 percent.    [Khrustalev] I would like to know, what will the individual  Ivanov, Petrov and Sidorov have?    [Sakharnov] The collective is diverse. And here, of course,  consideration will be given to the realities in each specific  instance. The number of preferred shares, for example, will  depend on the salary (after all, it corresponds to the  qualifications) and the length of service in Boguchanskaya GES  Construction. Also not forgotten will be those who are on  pensions or who left because of a reduction in force. If a male  worker's length of service in Boguchanskaya GES Construction is  not less than 10 years and that of a female worker is 7.5 years,  they are alloted securities at a 30-percent discount on the  installment plan.    Of course, one owner will not be equal to another. But if  you  are interested in average figures for the joint-stock company,  here they are: each worker will receive 38 shares, of which, 11  will be preferred.    [Khrustalev] And how will it be with the vouchers?    [Sakharnov] They will also figure in. Half of all the shares  can be acquired using privatization checks.    [Khrustalev] Tell me honestly, Yuriy Viktorovich, will it be  possible for the shares owned by a Boguchanskaya GES  Construction worker to provide income for him in his old age?    [Sakharnov] Everyone will very quickly become aware of the  fact that this is no mirage. Judge for yourself: just the July  revaluation raised the face value of a share from 1,000 rubles  [R] to R27,000. I am confident that the new revaluation will  increase this figure by a factor of 5 or 6. But it is necessary  to distinguish clearly between the dividends and the actual cost  value of a share.    Of course, the income will depend, first of all, on how many  shares the worker has and, to a large extent, on what kind of  dividend there is. Presently, it amounts to 10 percent of the  net profit. If we currently have a net profit of R500 million,  then the portion for each shareholder is determined  arithmetically: we divide R50 million by the number of  securities. Pretty slim, you might say. True, it is slim for the  time being. However, profit is a quantity which fluctuates. When  the plant is commissioned and all credit debts have been paid  off, it will become very respectable.    But the actual worth of a share is already currently  sufficiently high. In really comparable current prices of the  charter fund, if a share were sold at auction, it might, even  today, go for $100. Under conditions, however, when new projects  are started, the worth of a security also increases.    It is also possible to give a specific example of this. It  would be appropriate, for example, to recall that, after the  power plant's start-up, according to the specialists'  calculations, the annual profit will amount to $280 million. So  it is easy to imagine what kind of pursuit will begin for  Boguchanskaya GES shares in some 5 to 10 years.</p>

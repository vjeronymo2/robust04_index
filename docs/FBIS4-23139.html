			<p>BFN     [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the  UN secretary general in Angola, returned to Lusaka today after  consultations with U.S. senators in Luanda. Our correspondent  Manuel Conceicao in Lusaka has further details.    [Begin Conceicao recording] The delegations from the  government and the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] did not hold talks in Lusaka today. UNITA  presented a verbal protest to the mediators this morning, saying  it was not ready for talks with the government delegation today  because of alleged air raids on Huambo by the Angolan Air Force  yesterday.    The government negotiating team says it is not aware of the  protest because the mediators have not said anything. This  morning, the UNITA negotiating team phoned the government  delegation leadership, suspending the meeting scheduled for  today, because it was waiting for a reply from the mediators  over a certain issue. We learned from reliable sources that the  leadership of the UNITA negotiating team presented a protest to  the mediators this morning. Alioune Blondin Beye was informed  about the protest when he was still in Luanda and scheduled a  meeting with the UNITA negotiating team.    Alioune Blondin Beye is now in Lusaka. Early this evening,  he held a meeting an informal with the government negotiating  team. The meeting that Alioune Blondin Beye will hold with the  UNITA negotiating team this evening will decide whether or not  there will be talks tomorrow. [end recording]</p>

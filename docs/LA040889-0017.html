			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING STUDENT BEFORE ATHLETE  </P> <P> Many Americans believe major colleges athletics lack integrity. There is an  easy solution.  </P> <P> Make the number of new scholarships available for next year equal to the number  of players graduating this year. If four basketball players graduate, four  scholarships can be awarded. If none graduate, the college better pray for some  highly talented walk-ons, real "student-athletes."  </P> <P> Of course, John Thompson's program at Georgetown won't skip a beat. He  graduates (almost) all of his players.  </P> <P> But some programs could be wiped out overnight. Fair enough. Those schools that  benefited from recruiting and other NCAA rules violations would then pay for  their transgressions.  </P> <P> Finally, maybe a few major college coaches, besides Thompson, would be  concerned about the education of their athletes after their athletic  eligibility ends.  </P> <P> TOM LALLAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

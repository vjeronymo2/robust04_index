			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Obituary: FT editor with a European vision - Fredy Fisher Max Henry Fisher, known invariably as 'Fredy', who died on Sunday at the age of 71, was editor of this newspaper for eight years from 1973 to 1980. He spent a total of 23 years working on the staff - years which coincided with the great growth period of the Financial Times. Fredy was a member of that select band of UK citizens forced by the Nazis to flee prewar Germany. He wanted to succeed in his adopted country and he wanted to be accepted by it. He achieved both those objectives, to the considerable benefit of this newspaper. He brought to journalism a well-trained and finely tuned mind. But it is for his restless energy and combative personality that Fredy is most remembered by colleagues who worked with him at Bracken House, the FT's former offices by St Paul's cathedral. He loved talking and arguing, sometimes (one suspected) for its own sake. This combination of qualities served him well as a journalist. As foreign editor and subsequently as editor, he guided the second important stage of the Financial Times's development. His predecessor, Sir Gordon Newton, had taken over what was essentially a stock market news sheet and turned it in 15 years into the UK's leading journal of business information. Under Fisher, the FT was launched on its development as a European journal of information and opinion. That was an advance bearing very much his own personal stamp, for he was by background and deep conviction a European, and by ability and training an intellectual. He was born in 1922 in Berlin, where he lived for the first 13 years of his life, of a German father and a Russian mother and, until he was 3 1/2 , his first language was Russian. His father subsequently remarried a French-Swiss, and Fredy grew up bilingual in French and German. After Hitler's accession to power, his family embarked on the disrupted life of all German Jews of the period. His father moved first to Switzerland, then to Italy and, at the outbreak of war, back to Switzerland. Fredy, who had been sent to school at Rencomb College in Gloucestershire, was cut off by the outbreak of war and did not see his family again until 1945. Though still in his teens, Fredy was interned at the outbreak of war under the deplorable Regulation 18B as an enemy alien and subsequently sent to a camp in Australia - an experience which, he liked to recall, at least gave him time to learn to play a good game of bridge. In 1942 official policy changed, and Fredy and others in his position were released. He returned, volunteered for the army, and thus began his life as an acknowledged Englishman. His army career started with the Pioneer Corps, took him to Normandy as a trooper in the 8th Kings Irish Hussars, and ended with him as interpreter-Sergeant with the investigations branch of the Military Police. He then returned to civilian life and started his first chosen career as an academic. He won first-class honours in modern history in a short degree course at Lincoln College, Oxford, and after a few months of postgraduate work he was appointed by the Foreign Office as one of the team of three editors of documents on German foreign policy from Versailles to 1945, a task which was to last seven years. In May 1956 he went to Melbourne University as a visiting lecturer in diplomatic history. But he became disillusioned with the academic life and, in March 1957, at the relatively mature age of 34, he joined Gordon Newton's team of first-class brains at the Financial Times. It was Newton's policy to staff his rapidly growing paper with writers of high academic attainment, regardless of background, and give them their heads. Fisher joined a team which was, to say the least, lively. It included Nigel Lawson, Shirley Williams and Jock Bruce-Gardyne - who all became UK government ministers in later years; William Rees-Mogg, Robert Heller, Michael Shanks and Samuel Brittan. The birth of what subsequently became known as Fredy's foreign empire was in characteristic style. Newton simply remarked one day: 'You speak foreign languages - you'd better join the foreign side' (which at that time filled one half page, with a staff of two at Bracken House and three foreign correspondents). He worked with characteristic intensity as a reporter, securing an important scoop when he gave the first news of Britain's initiative in launching the European Free Trade area, and covering the subsequent negotiations and those concerned with Britain's first attempt to join the European Community as far as he could single-handed, commuting to Brussels. He subsequently became foreign editor, launching the expansion of FT foreign coverage; assistant editor on the home side - a period which saw a significant expansion of industrial coverage and the launch of the Management Page, and, in 1971, deputy editor. When he became editor in 1973, he was driven both by inclination and temperament to change the style in which the newspaper was run. The carefree recruiting of untrained graduates had fallen foul of the industry's unions, and more of the intellectual direction had to come from the top; he also wished to develop the consistency and trust to make the paper an influential journal of opinion. The editorials became more incisive, and were more widely noticed - not always favourably. For example, a sustained attack on official monetary tactics in 1976 led, for the first time in the paper's history, to a distinct chilliness between the FT at Bracken House and the Bank of England at Threadneedle Street. However, the paper continued largely to avoid party-political attitudes, as it still does. There was an internal price to pay for this change of style. Some members of the staff found the new approach difficult to accept. Such problems caused Fredy episodes of distress in a term of office which he otherwise hugely enjoyed; he was temperamentally ill-fitted to handle them. His turbulent childhood had left him, in some senses, acutely lacking in self-confidence, despite his sometimes authoritarian exterior. He would turn to one or two intimates repeatedly for advice. With others, he sometimes seemed a bad listener, though staff members in any real trouble would find a warm, tireless sympathiser and supporter. In 1980 he felt, after the launch of the Frankfurt edition, that he had completed his planned contribution to the development of the Financial Times, and decided at the age of 58 to launch on a third career as a director of S G Warburg, the merchant bank - which proved in some ways the happiest epoch of his working life. He was able to deploy his talent for analysis and negotiation, and his streak of real charm, in the cause of clients, a role which suited him so well that he cheerfully worked far too hard. With typical sensitivity, he refrained from any interference or even comment on the policies of his successors at the FT, but he continued as a warm friend to many who would have valued his advice. One constant theme illuminated the last 30 years of this often stressful life - his total devotion, once memorably confessed on the air, to his Australian wife, Rosemary, and his family of two sons and a daughter. He had a lifelong passion for music and the arts. From the point of view of his friends, this left all too little time for the good bridge and chess, and confessedly bad golf, which he so enjoyed.</p>

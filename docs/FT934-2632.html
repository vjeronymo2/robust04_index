			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The harmful myth of hidden state debt According to an ancient sage there are three kinds of human ills: those inflicted by providence, those inflicted by our fellow men and women, and those we inflict on ourselves. The scare campaign to increase the size of estimated government debt by adding in unfunded public sector pension liabilities belongs to this last category. The origins of the campaign are an innocent enough attempt to study the increasing burden that state pensions will be putting on ageing communities in the years ahead. The burden arises from the combination of falling birth rates and increasing longevity. The EU dependency ratio - those aged over 65 as a proportion of those aged 15 to 64 - is expected to rise from 22 per cent in 1980 to 40 per cent in 2040. The error has been to project government pension commitments for the years ahead, and (to the extent that they cannot be met from existing taxation) to add their present value to the outstanding government debts as normally measured. The effect of adding in these unfunded liabilities goes well beyond accounting niceties. The result is to double the ratio of debt to GDP on which so many governments focus, to make most countries seem even further removed from the Maastricht guidelines than they are at present; and above all - by persuading public opinion that government finances are even worse than they are - to encourage hairshirt fiscal policies, involving an increase in taxes at a time of uncertain recovery from long-running depression. Some economists are wont to replace crude government borrowing targets with aims such as maintaining the net value of public sector assets. But if government balance sheets are recalculated to include the supposed hidden pension debt, then existing public sector balance sheets will look much worse and appear to be deteriorating, thus encouraging the fiscal zealots who look for any pretext to raise taxation. We need a more pessimistic presentation of government balance sheets as much as we do a hole in the head. The latest pessimistic estimate to land on my desk is from CS First Boston and is entitled Employment and Hidden Debt. It is indeed the estimate of the debt which makes the employment prospects worse than they need be. I am using this firm's estimates because they are particularly comprehensive and carefully researched - and my spirits were raised when I read the quotation from T S Eliot's East Coker, one of his Four Quartets, at the end of the paper. The study is devoted to 'unavoidable yet unfunded' public sector liabilities, of which pensions form a large part. The result for most countries is that hidden debt is higher than conventional debt. All EU countries, bar the UK, have debt ratios several times the 60 per cent Maastricht guideline. The combined debt-to-GDP ratio for the Netherlands is blown up from nearly 80 per cent to over 225 per cent. The UK emerges far better than any other country from these computations; but its debt ratio in 1990 is still increased from 40 to 74 per cent and would doubtless be much higher now. The fallacy of such estimates is to treat pension commitments differently from other forms of public spending. The pay-as-you-go schemes, from which the scare stories stem, are based on each generation of workers paying through taxes and contributions sufficient to cover the cost of pensions for those already retired. Thus pensions are, like any other form of rising public expenditure, to be met from higher tax revenue or social security contributions, or reduced spending elsewhere. The hidden debt estimates assume that governments will either try to default on their commitments or try to meet them by increased borrowing, irrespective of the state of their economies. The CS First Boston authors cite General Motors, where a new accounting standard, providing for the inclusion of current and future healthcare liabilities, slashed 75 per cent off the corporation's equity in 1992. The analogy is wrong because General Motors - heaven be praised - does not have the power of a government to raise taxes. Since financial topics give rise to so much emotion, I must make some disclaimers. Of course CS First Boston and other analysts are right to worry about the burden of rising pensions. Alternatives, such as more private pension provision, should indeed be considered. The point of disagreement is the limited but important one of estimating national debt ratios. The question is: do the European financial institutions really want to promote fiscal policies which will make the present economic stagnation worse and delay recovery still further?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                'TRUE' GOVERNMENT DEBT 1990 (% OF GDP)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Conventional    Unfunded   Tax claim   Tax claim   'True'                        debt  liabilities  on  public  on private   debt                                            pensions    pensions  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium               128        112         22           0        218 Denmark                67         97         19           0        145 France                 47        106         21           2        130 Germany (W)            44        179         36           5        182 Greece                 96        196         39           0        253 Ireland               102        103         21          12        172 Italy                  98        184         37           0        245 Luxembourg              7        238         48           0        197 Netherlands            79        210         42          21        226 Portugal               68        167         33           0        202 Spain                  45        183         37           0        191 UK                     40         70         14          22         74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CS First Boston  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

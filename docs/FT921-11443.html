			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK to give Russia more aid: Major tells Yeltsin the Trident programme will be maintained BRITAIN and Russia yesterday signed a declaration of friendship providing for closer economic and military co-operation, including joint efforts to reduce forces and armaments. The 15-point declaration, to be converted into a treaty later this year and including an agreement by Britain to give extra economic assistance to Russia, was signed in Downing Street by Mr John Major, the in, the Russian president. Mr Yeltsin was making a stopover in Britain on his way to New York for today's United Nations Security Council summit. Mr Major, during four hours of 'warm and friendly' talks, made it clear to Mr Yeltsin that Britain would not cancel or reduce its Trident nuclear weapons programme, which represented a minimum 'credible deterrent'. Although it had been suggested previously that Mr Yeltsin would put pressure on Britain to reduce its nuclear weapons in line with the latest US and Russian proposals to cut strategic arms, the Russian leader proved to be surprisingly accommodating. Mr Yeltsin said he respected the British government's decision, adding: 'The number of nuclear weapons at the disposal of the UK is not comparable with ours and therefore the matter is not really worth any discussion.' In spite of Mr Major's declared intention to go ahead with the Trident programme, the Russian leader announced on the steps of Downing Street that Russian missiles would no longer be targeted at Britain, echoing a similar undertaking he has already given to the US. Mr Major said in a toast at a working lunch in Downing Street that the visit, the first to Britain by Mr Yeltsin as Russian leader, had turned 'a new page in history'. The joint declaration, 'Partnership in the Nineties', was an indication that co-operation had replaced confrontation in Europe, 'we hope for ever'. The extra UK economic assistance for Russia and other members of the new Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) pledged in the declaration is in addition to financial and food aid it has already provided. The UK would make available Pounds 280m in new export credits and investment insurance for Russia and the other CIS republics, in the context of an International Monetary Fund programme, Mr Major said. The UK, the first country to propose Russian membership of the IMF, would also press for Russia to be admitted to the organisation by April. It would also make an improved European Community trade and co-operation agreement with Russia one of the priorities of the next UK presidency of the EC, which starts in July this year. In the defence field, the UK has agreed to co-operate with the Russians in handling surplus former Soviet nuclear weapons and safeguarding nuclear materials. Britain has also agreed to help in the restructuring of the former Soviet armed forces and Mr Major announced that Ministry of Defence officials might be sent on secondment to Russia's defence ministry. Mr Major said he and Mr Yeltsin had agreed on further discussions on how the UK could help Russia 'to use the talents of their scientists in the cause of peaceful development'. The two leaders had agreed to set up a 'hot line' between their offices to facilitate their new relationship and agreed on the opening of new British and Russian consulates in St Petersburg and Edinburgh. Mr Yeltsin said he had accepted an invitation to make an official visit to Britain in the first half of this year and Mr Major is to visit Moscow in the second half.

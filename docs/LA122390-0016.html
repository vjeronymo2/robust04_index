			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORTRAIT OF A PLANET  </P> <P> Did everyone marvel at those stunning photos of clear-cut forests in "Portrait  of a Planet" (Nov. 11)? I would be very surprised if the ongoing devastation in  Northern California has nothing to do with the decrease in rainfall in Southern  California since World War II. For what it's worth, I'm planting trees in my  own yard, and I'll give them all the water they need, Bradley's  10%-water-reduction decree be damned. If Central Valley farmers can throw away  their cheap water running sprinklers in the noonday sun on surplus crops like  cotton and alfalfa, I can take all the 15-minute showers I please.  </P> <P> WILLIAM LEIDENTHAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  Copper Cathodes Shipped From Iquique </H8>   The Cerro Colorado Mining Company has shipped its first load  of copper cathodes to Japan and Taiwan. The shipment totals 500  tons and marks the return of mining activity to Iquique  Province. Copper now accounts for 10 percent of the cargo  passing through the port of Iquique, which handles mostly  fishing industry products and goods entering the Free Zone.  Copper's share is expected to increase when the three mines in  the area (Cerro Colorado, Quebrada Blanca, and Dona Ines de  Collahuasi) are in operation. The Cerro Colorado company, which  is part of the Canadian mining corporation Rio Algom, views the  shipment as the start of a new phase and anticipates exporting  about 40,000 tons annually. The company's open-cast mine is  located 120 km east of Iquique and represents an investment of  $290 million.

The government has set two priorities in  its export strategy: identifying emerging markets for Chilean  products, and taking specific actions to increase  competitiveness. These actions could include quality  certification, environmental standards, increased investment in  infrastructure, and expansion of worker training. He noted that  the Latin American market has been expanding and diversifying  while sales to the EU and Japan have declined over the past  year. Thus, the government will emphasize trade liberalization  in the region. Garcia stressed the need for flexible machanisms  to react quickly to changes in international economic relations.  He stated that the Economy Ministry has come to the conclusion  that existing export incentives are inadequate under the current  circumstances and must be reviewed with special attention to  export diversification in both products and markets.

He  reiterated the government's intention to change the Law on State  Enterprises to modernize the public sector and ensure greater  efficiency. He said that a sustained increase in productivity is  required in order to reach the goal of 6 percent economic growth  this year, and noted that controlling inflation means "avoiding  any populist temptation concerning public spending, salaries,  subsidies, and taxes; and moderating private spending on  consumption and wage demands in excess of productivity." The  government will continue to increase programs to improve income  distribution, and proposes to create a national job training  system, a workers training fund, and a national employment  information and guidance system. The government is also  concerned about expanding the process of collective negotiation,  creating unemployment insurance, and promoting competition in  all areas possible. These steps would involve a significant  revision and strengthening of regulatory agencies and the  Antitrust Law.

Fernan Ibanez and Felipe Larrain presented the  study to the Chilean-Canadian Chamber of Commerce. One of their  main conclusions is that Chile is well-prepared to enter NAFTA,  given the country's macroecomic stability and open and  transparent commercial law and business practices. Chile has  also had a lengthy and active tradition of participation in  international agreements such as the GATT. Chile would need a  minimal number of legal and procedural changes to comply with  NAFTA, because most tariff rates and government procurement  practices meet NAFTA standards. The study concludes that Chile  would benefit from guaranteed access to a large market; an  impartial conflict resolution mechanism; uniform regulations for  trade among four countries, especially regarding nontariff  matters; and assured access to goods and services.

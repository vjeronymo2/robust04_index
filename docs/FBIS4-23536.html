			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Text] Kigali, June 8 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels and the army  fought fiercely on several fronts Wednesday [8 June] as their  delegates came out of a new round of peace talks without a  ceasefire accord, UN officials said.    A French cameraman was shot and wounded in the southwestern  Nyamirambo district of Kigali where government troops and  militiamen from Rwanda's Hutu majority have dug in to resist an  assault by the mainly Tutsi rebels.    General Romeo Dallaire, the head of the UN Assistance  Mission  in Rwanda (UNAMIR) said the talks between general staff officers  from the warring sides had been "very positive" and that they  had agreed to meet again on Thursday. "We studied the principal  document (put forward by UN mediators) and discussed the  modalities of a ceasefire, but there is still work to be done,"  Dallaire said after after chairing the discussions.    Two months of clashes and ethnic bloodletting between the  minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus have left up to 500,000  dead and displaced another two million people, according to  estimates by relief workers. Half a million Rwandans have fled  abroad.    The warring sides met under UN auspices last week and came  to  an agreement on the security of UN relief operations and safe  passage for civilians being evacuated, but failed to cut a  ceasefire deal.    During a break in Wednesday's talks, rebel delegation chief  Colonel Frank Mugambage said the RPF was insisting on "firm  commitments" from the government, which the rebels want to halt  massacres behind Hutu lines.    The RPF also wants pro-government radios to stop  broadcasting  incitements to ethnic slaughter. The army wants the civil war  to stop before agreeing to anything.    After the previous round of talks last Thursday, Mugambage  declared that the rebels were "capable of fighting and winning  this war if that is the (only) option."    The rebels, who have the upper hand on the battlefronts,  refuse to recognise the all-Hutu interim government formed after  president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspected rocket  attack on his plane on April 6.    The government has left Kigali for Gitamara, some 50  kilometres (30 miles) from the capital, where further fighting  was reported Wednesday. The RPF claims to have pushed back  government counter- offensives in the area.    The French journalist, Jean-Christophe Klotz, 32, who works  for the French film agency CAPA, was hit in the thigh as he  accompanied aid workers in a visit to a school where displaced  people have sought shelter from the fighting. He was taken to a  hospital run by the International Committee of the Red Cross  (ICRC), where medical staff said he needs rapidly to be  evacuated from Rwanda, the ICRC delegation chief in Kigali,  Philippe Gaillard said.    The Rwandan military delegation led by General Marcel  Gatsinzi met the rebel team headed by Mugambage at the UN  headquarters in the Amohoro hotel in northeastern Kigali.    The army's team was brought to the talks in a UN armoured  vehicle, but the rebels later arrived aboard their own transport  at the hotel, which lies in a district of the largely abandoned  city controlled by the guerrillas.    Dallaire, a Canadian, chaired the talks exceptionally in the  absence of his deputy, Ghanaian General Henry Anyidoho, who was  unable to return to Kigali in time from a mission abroad because  the airport was closed.    The United Nations suspended flights on Sunday after  government troops fired a shell as a UN plane was on the tarmac  at the airport, which is jointly administered by the rebels and  UN forces.</p>

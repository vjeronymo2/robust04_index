			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 20 Jan--Deputies began the first day of work  of the Ukrainian Supreme Council's ninth session with a  discussion of issues connected with organizing the present  parliamentary session's 12th meeting and the procedure for  broadcasting the session's work. Some deputies proposed to hold  plenary sittings of the ninth session of parliament in cases  where issues will require urgent discussion by Ukraine's Supreme  Council. Such a step was motivated by the start of the  pre-election campaign, in which a significant number of deputies  are participating.    The agenda for the Supreme Council's work for January 1994  was proposed to deputies. The issue concerning the results of  the trilateral negotiations in Moscow is not among the 70 issues  designated for discussion at the session. A report from Popov's  commission (concerning the "Blasko" concern [Black Sea shipping  company]) has been added to the list of issues that may be  discussed depending on their state of preparedness and time  permitting. Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch described  the examination of the law on additions to Point 7-2 of Article  115 of the Constitution to be among the most important issues.  It states that the president may repeal acts of the Cabinet of  Ministers and other bodies of central power if they are in  violation of Ukraine's constitution. This issue is connected  with events in Crimea.    Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil voiced a demand from Rukh  to convene a parliamentary commission connected with attacks on  Rukh's headquarters in Chernovtsy and Ternopol, an attempt on  the life of Colonel Butko, a parliamentary candidate from Rukh,  and the kidnapping of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, head of Rukh's  secretariat.    Chornovil proposed that the issue of the anti-constitutional  actions of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who blatantly  violated a parliamentary resolution of 18 November (regarding  the ratification of START I) and the situation in Crimea, be  included on the agenda and discussed immediately.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hohhot, March 16 (XINHUA) -- More than 400,000  herdsmen in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region  reported an average annual income of over 1,500 yuan last year,  with the most at 4,000 yuan.    Statistics from the autonomous regional government show that  this upper one-fourth of the total number of herdsmen in the  region are living more comfortably than in the past.    Most of the herdsmen who have become well off have  cultivated  their own pastures and grasslands with good irrigation  facilities, silages and permanent livestock shelters. These  facilities have made them better able to resist natural  disasters.    Statistics show that the number of new and hybrid livestock  totalled 27.58 million, or 54.65 percent, of all livestock in  the region. The improvement of new species of domestic animals  has highly raised the returns of animal husbandry.    In the past, large animals were few and most livestock  consisted of small animals of lower species, local officials  said.    In addition, they said that the introduction of a contract  system greatly improved herdsmen's enthusiasm in grooming fields  and grassland. Science and technology service stations were  also established in almost every township (sumu) to provide  training in new techniques to local herdsmen.    As a result, the total number of livestock reached 55.78  million head last year, up 197,800 over the previous year. The  general output value of animal husbandry topped 6.48 billion  yuan, an increase of 41,900 yuan over 1992.    Officials said the net income of all the herdsmen in the  autonomous region increased by an average of over 100 yuan last  year.</p>

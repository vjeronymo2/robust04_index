			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Heatwave boosts already rising Vimto sales Sales of Vimto, the soft drink best known in the Midlands and north of England, have risen 15 per cent in the recent heatwave after increasing steadily for 10 years, Maurice Samuelson writes. Launched by an industrial chemist 86 years ago in Manchester, where it is still made from 29 ingredients, Vimto was first marketed as a pick-me-up at a time when many families could not afford a visit from the doctor. The managing director and finance director of J. J. Nicholls, the company that produces Vimto, are grandsons of the founder. The drink has become so much of an institution it is the subject of a travelling exhibition, currently at Gunnersbury Park in west London. The advert shown dates from the late 1930s. About 60 per cent of the drink is still sold in its traditional heartlands. Once favoured by the UK temperance movement, its main export sales go to the teetotal markets of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</p>

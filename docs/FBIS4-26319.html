			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan will open its  service markets wider to foreign competitors in exchange for a  longer period of time for adjustment of its farm-trade  regulatory system with a view to facilitating its entry into the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), senior government  officials said Friday [17 June].    The decision was made Thursday during a meeting of a  cabinet-level task force responsible for working out the  government's GATT negotiation strategy and coordinating  different views of different government agencies on GATT-related  issues, the officials said.    "Further liberalization of service industries will benefit  our bids to join GATT and to become a regional operation center  in East Asia," said Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for  Economic Planning and Development, who chaired the panel meeting.    Hsiao said the government is working on a list of services  to  be open to foreign competitors after Taiwan joins GATT. "The  list will cover items required by GATT and our major trade  partners," Hsiao noted, adding that the list will be finalized  at the end of June.    "Taiwan will benefit from the service-market opening, as  free  competition will speed up progress in our service sector," Hsiao  explained. "Moreover, we hope greater liberalization in this  field will increase our bargaining chips in farm-trade  negotiations with GATT members."    Taiwan has agreed to remove some nontariff restrictions on  farm trade, such as area and quota restrictions, Hsiao said.  "Nevertheless, we hope we'll be allowed to keep such  restrictions for a specified period of time for some major  agricultural items to enable our farmers to adapt themselves to  market-opening challenges," he added.    The interministerial task force also reached on Thursday  several other groundbreaking decisions that are expected to  accelerate Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade  regulatory body, said Huang Yen-chao, director-general of the  Board of Foreign Trade.    Among others, Huang said, the Ministry of Finance will  within  two months work out a detailed plan for restructuring the  country's decades-old wine and tobacco monopoly system in line  with GATT regulations.    The government will further lower tariff rates for some  agricultural and industrial products to meet the demand of some  GATT contracting parties, Huang said.    Taiwan will also start to negotiate with GATT members the  opening of its public construction and procurement projects to  foreign bidders and is determined to sign a multilateral  agreement on such projects after it enters GATT, Huang said.    "We'll inform GATT authorities of these new decisions next  week so that the GATT working party screening Taiwan's  membership application can set the agenda for its next meeting  scheduled for late July," Huang explained.    The working party has already held five multilateral  meetings  to discuss Taiwan's market-opening and trade-reform measures.  Taiwan has also held bilateral tariff-concession talks with 15  GATT members, including New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the  United States. It is scheduled to hold similar talks with  Singapore, Hong Kong, the 12-member European Union, Argentina  and north European countries in July.    Taiwan applied to join GATT as a separate customs territory  in January 1990 and hopes to be admitted as a full member by the  end of this year to qualify it to become a founding member of  the World Trade Organization, which will supersede GATT early  next year.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The encore that's a long time coming - Wall Street THE problem facing many US equity investors is that having discounted a US economic recovery and sent the Dow Jones industrial average to record levels, it is hard to come up with an encore. Wall Street has been pretty much treading water for the past two weeks; the Dow Jones index has stayed comfortably above the 3,200 mark and trading volume has been moderately heavy at an average of 200m shares a day. But the big shift to equities from money market funds, certificates of deposit and bonds appears to have abated. There seem little fuel left to drive the December-January rally. Since last Monday the Dow Jones index gained a net 17 points - it stood at 3,242.40 yesterday. The gain could have been much higher, since the market was up by 51.43 points by Wednesday. But on Thursday the Dow Jones index dropped by 30.18 points on the back of a sharp decline in bond prices and fears that monetary policy will not be eased in the near term. Yesterday's decline of 4.25 points suggested a market that is slightly weary, and increasingly uncertain. Uncertainty is the by-word for most top US bankers and economists. Although scattered statistics such as the 0.6 per cent jump in January retail sales and stronger US car sales in the first ten days of February suggest a glimmery of recovery, few forecasters expect much of a turnaround before mid-year. Add to this equation continued market uncertainty over the plans of the Federal Reserve Board on the interest rate front, plus uncertainty over the fate of President Bush's budget package and election year tax gimmicks, and the result is a growing malaise among investors. One is tempted to say that the lemmings should have known better, having begun the Wall Street rally with typically overdone fervour about the macro-economy's prospects. Now it is back to the day-to-day shift in sentiment that is conditioned largely by the flow of data from Reuters screens. Few are claiming a grand vision of the US economy's prospects, including some members of the Fed's own board. As one member said recently: 'I think prospects for the economy are probably more uncertain now than in the past.' A rough consensus is emerging that if growth in the second half of 1992 can notch up to the three per cent level, the current year will end with an average growth rate of around two per cent. But even that is something of an if. Art Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, said this week he feels pretty sure of little or no growth for the first six months of 1992 and is 'not even sure' there will be much growth in the second half of the year. Both the American business community and federal officials are in an impatient mood, wondering why last December's full-point cut in the discount rate has not already produced an upturn in consumer confidence and capital investment. A partial answer may be that many potential consumers, as well as borrowers and lenders, are still feeling traumatised by the recession. Sentiment is at best equivocal for most. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was also equivocal this week. He repeated his earlier view that 'we believe that the monetary ease now in the pipeline is adequate to turn the economy on to the path of sustained recovery.' But he allowed that the Fed would, 'if necessary, move toward an increased degree of monetary ease.' In coming weeks Wall Street will probably be moved by the fortunes of President Bush's budget package, which this week was partly sandbagged by Congressional Democrats, who are keen to replace it with their own election year gimmicks. The slow-motion dismantling of the President's proposals led some in the US media to quip that when Bush said in his State of the Union message that the US recession 'will not stand' what he really meant to say was that his own proposals would not stand. This week's statistics may indicate that car sales improved in early February, but the dire state of Detroit looks unlikely to improve in a substantial way. Witness, for example, the Dollars 2.6bn after-tax loss revealed by Ford this week, with the company's fourth quarter loss alone totalling Dollars 476m. The upcoming fourth quarter results from General Motors are likely to show an even larger loss, in the order of Dollars 600m to Dollars 750m.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Monday      3245.08   +  19.68 Tuesday     3251.57   +   6.49 Wednesday   3276.83   +  25.26 Thursday    3246.65   -  30.18 Friday      3245.97   -   0.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

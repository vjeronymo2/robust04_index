			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Dollars 41m sale in US by Dalgety DALGETY, the food and agribusiness company, is to sell Modern Maid Food Products, its US food coatings business, to DCA Food Industries, a US subsidiary of Allied-Lyons, for Dollars 41m (Pounds 23.4m) cash, writes Guy de Jonquieres. Dalgety, which plans to use the proceeds to reduce borrowings, said it had decided to sell Modern Maid because its food ingredients strategy was to focus on Europe. Modern Maid supplies batters, breadcrumbs and speciality coatings to food processors and sells prepared flour and baking mixes to fast food and catering outlets. It made a Dollars 4.6m trading profit on sales of Dollars 42m in the year to June and had net assets of Dollars 11.7m.</p>

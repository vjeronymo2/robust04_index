			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 22 January commentator's article: </F> "Modernization Requires the `Hard-Boned' Spirit"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- Thirty years ago, the  Sixth Company of a Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA] unit  enjoyed great honor in the armed forces and was honored by the  National Defense Ministry as "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" because  of its steadfast combat readiness, strong militancy, toughened  military skills, and strict military and administrative  discipline. In 1985 after it was named by the Central Military  Commission as the "Heroic Hard-Boned Sixth Company," the company  became the only company in PLA history to have received the  highest honor for two times. Over the past several decades,  this heroic company has continued to perform new meritorious  services in safeguarding the motherland and socialist  construction; its "hard-boned" spirit has taken root, blossomed,  and borne fruits throughout the armed forces; and many Sixth  Company-typed companies have come to the fore one after another.    The CPC Central Committee and the Central Military  Commission  always speak highly of the Hard-Boned Sixth Company and its  "hard- boned" spirit. Addressing an enlarged meeting of the  military commission in 1977, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out:  "As far as companies are concerned, they are doing the right  thing to emulate the Hard-Boned Sixth Company because the  company's work style should not be the work style of one company  alone. All companies, and even cadres at all levels, should  study hard and train hard like the Sixth Company, and should  have the political awareness of the company." While inspecting  the company in 1991, Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed that great  efforts should be made to promote the "hard- boned" spirit,  saying that "hard-boned" spirit means never bow before any  adversity, but dare to fight and be brave to sacrifice to seize  victories.    The "hard-boned" spirit is a fine tradition and a precious  spiritual wealth of our armed forces. During the war years, it  was this spirit our troops counted on to fight strenuously,  march forward courageously, and win one victory after another.  After New China was founded, it was again this spirit our armed  forces have counted on in building themselves into modern and  regular armed forces as well as in taking an active part in  socialist construction and accomplishing missions of combating  emergencies, providing relief, and rescuing people in distress.  Because of their great contributions to China's economic  revitalization and economic take- off, they have become  important forces in socialist modernization.    The "hard-boned" spirit is also the Chinese nation's  traditional spirit needed by people on all fronts of socialist  modernization. Especially today when China has entered the stage  of tackling key problems of reforming the economic system,  deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, and  gradually building a socialist market economic system, many new  problems have to be resolved, and many hardships have to be  surmounted. This requires our cadres and masses to emulate and  foster the "hard-boned" spirit, defy all hardships, wage  persistent and strenuous struggles, and move forward  courageously until victory has been won.    To emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, we must  strive  to arm our minds with scientific theory. Only when we are armed  with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought can we have a firm and  correct political bearing and a strong spiritual support.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics has inherited and developed Mao Zedong  Thought. If we earnestly study the third volume of the  "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and have a firm grip of the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we  will have a firm conviction and be able to uphold the party's  basic line without wavering under all circumstances.    To emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, we must work  hard to master the knowledge and abilities which modernization  needs. Our modernization drive is an extraordinarily formidable  and complex mission which cannot be accomplished with courage  and zeal alone. It also requires real abilities and close  integration of revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude.  Comrades of all trades and professions must seize the time to  study specialized knowledge and make constant efforts to improve  their professionalism so that they can contribute their wisdom  and talents to socialist modernization.    To emulate and foster the "hard-boned" spirit, we must take  the interests of the whole into account and fight in unity. The  key reason why we have been able to win in revolution and  construction lies in the fact that our party and our people are  a united whole. No matter how mighty it may seem, our personal  strength and the strength of a small group are tiny, and only  when our strength converges and pools together can it become an  indomitable force. During the course of reform, opening up, and  modernization, we must submit our personal, partial, and local  interests to collective interests and the interests of the whole  so that our party and the people of the country can become more  united, and so that our strength as a whole will be even  stronger.    The "hard-boned" spirit has strong characteristics of the  time. While this spirit was needed in the past and is needed  today, it will be needed in the future forever. In the future  when our country's socialist modernization has developed with  great vitality and when the people's living standards keep  improving, the "hard- boned" spirit will continue to be the  spiritual pillar supporting us to combat hardships and move  forward, and it will continue to shine and go down from one  generation to another when we are accomplishing our great cause.</p>

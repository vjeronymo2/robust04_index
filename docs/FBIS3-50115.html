Bosnian Croat troops (HVO) on Thursday afternoon recaptured  a  part of the Buhino Selo village near Vitez, taken by Muslims in  the latest offensive, and found the bodies of 11 Croats, among  them of massacred civilians whose hands were tied, Croatian  radio said.    Muslim troops have undertaken a new mobilization in Zenica  since they plan to launch a new offensive, Bosnian Serb military  sources said on Friday.    The special instructions issued for the mobilization insist  that as many as possible non-Muslims be mobilized, especially  Croats, but specifies that their number in units of the  so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina must not exceed five  percent so that the Muslim character of the units would be  preserved.    According to Bosnian Serb military sources, Vitez and Novi  Travnik will be the targets of the Muslim offensive.    The steel plant in Zenica, a Muslim-held town in central  Bosnia, has stepped up the production of mortars and artillery  ammunition. The capturing of Vitez is vital for the Muslim side  because of the very large quantities of explosives stored there  and because it would mean the elimination of the last obstacle  standing in the way of the Muslim side's full political and  military domination in central Bosnia.    It is said that the local bank in Zenica has received 10  million German marks from abroad for military purchases. The  Muslim side is now seeking a channel for making the purchases  and securing their delivery.    Muslim forces in central Bosnia have been staging attacks on  Croat positions around Novi Travnik, east of Travnik, and in the  western section of the front, at Zepca, according to Croatian  radio.    According to Bosnian Serb military sources, fighting between  Croats and Muslims continues also in the River Neretva Valley  and the southern zone of Mostar.    In the past 24 hours, Muslim forces continued attacking  Bosnian Serb positions at Doboj, a town in northern Bosnia, on  the front north-east of Teslic, in the area of Maglaj, on Mounts  Ozren and Vlasic, also in northern Bosnia, along the upper and  central parts of the River Drina in eastern Bosnia, in the area  of Foca and the area of Cajnice, also in eastern Bosnia, Bosnian  Serb military sources said on Friday.    The movements of smaller infantry and reconnaissance Muslim  groups, which have been trying to infiltrate the Bosnian Serb  ranks, have been observed in eastern Bosnia.</p>

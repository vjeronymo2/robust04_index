			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Meeting today on Polish debt Poland's chief debt negotiator, Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, will give the first sign of Polish willingness to compromise on its long-standing demand for a 50 per cent reduction in its Dollars 13bn debt to foreign commercial banks when he meets negotiators from the London Club of creditor banks in Frankfurt today. He will present Warsaw's response to last week's revised package which marked an improvement on the overall 28 per cent debt reduction package offered by the banks in July. Mr Krowacki described the revised London Club offer as 'a step in the right direction' but added: 'The situation remains very difficult and the two sides remain far apart.' Poland's response to the revised offer was 'part of an on-going process, it is not a question of sign or reject,' he said. 'We still want the banks to offer us a deal which is within our balance of payments possibilities, bearing in mind current budgetary restraints and the repayment schedule to official creditors laid out by the April 1991 agreement with the Paris Club.' This sanctioned a two-stage, 50 per cent reduction of Poland's Dollars 33bn official debt but imposed a repayment burden which will peak towards the end of the century. To date, the only movement on the Polish debt negotiations has come from the 300 commercial banks represented by the London Club, chaired by Mr Ernst Moritz Lipp of Dresdner bank. The German banks hold 30 per cent of the Polish bank debt, but US investment banks are big holders of debt bought on the secondary market. Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski yesterday said he had presented his country's case for membership in Nato to US secretary of state Warren Christopher, Reuter adds from Washington. Mr Olechowski said he was given no immediate assurance from Mr Christopher that the US would endorse the admission of Poland into the western military alliance. Poland was partitioned from 1795 until 1918 among Prussia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Russia, and was dominated by Moscow between the end of the second world war and the collapse of communist rule in the late 1980s.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: PRIME RIB HASH THAT'S IDEAL FOR BRUNCH  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: At the Jolly Roger in Rolling Hills Estates I tasted a prime rib hash  that was so good. If you could get them to share their recipe, I'm sure many of  us would appreciate it. They serve it as a special on their Sunday breakfast  menu. -- ELIZABETH  </P> <P> DEAR ELIZABETH: It's a terrific recipe to keep in mind whenever you have  leftover prime rib and cooked potatoes from a feast the night before. Ideally,  drippings from roasted meat should be used for flavoring the meat and potatoes,  however, if none is left, you can use commercial meat glaze or brown cooking  sauce. The rehash is a satisfying meal, especially for Sunday brunch, when most  of us have more time to spend in the kitchen.  </P> <P> JOLLY ROGER  </P> <P> PRIME RIB HASH  </P> <P> 1 pound potatoes, cooked and diced  </P> <P> 1/2 pound cooked and diced prime rib  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons au jus concentrate or drippings, meat glaze or brown cooking  sauce  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> Mix potatoes, prime rib, drippings, salt and garlic in skillet heated with oil.  Saute until heated through. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: My husband and I have just returned from Florida where we enjoyed Key  Lime Pie at several restaurants. I would like to try making one, but so far,  have been unable to find a recipe in any of my cookbooks.  </P> <P>  -- CHARLENE  </P> <P> DEAR CHARLENE: Here's a Key Lime Pie that uses the small Key or Mexican limes,  which are sometimes available in markets. If you can find them, use the largest  available, but if you can't find them, any lime will do. However, the taste  will be different compared to a true Key Lime Pie. And while you're at it, you  might want to remember that lemon can be substituted for lime for variety.  </P> <P> KEY LIME PIE  </P> <P> 6 eggs, separated  </P> <P> 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk (do not substitute evaporated)  </P> <P> Juice of 7 large Key limes or Mexican limes, about 1/2 cup  </P> <P> 1 baked (9-inch) pie shell  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar  </P> <P> 3/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> Beat egg yolks lightly, then blend in condensed milk. Add lime juice and blend  well. Turn into pie shell and bake at 350 degrees 10 to 15 minutes to heat and  thicken filling slightly.  </P> <P> Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until stiff. Gradually beat in sugar, 1  tablespoon at time. Continue to beat until very stiff. Swirl meringue onto pie,  making sure to seal all around edge of pie.  </P> <P> Bake at 400 degrees 5 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees and bake 15 minutes  or until meringue is pale tan.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I lost my recipe for Bourbon Baked Beans made with canned beans and  instant coffee. My family loved them.  </P> <P>  -- VIRGINIA  </P> <P> DEAR VIRGINIA: We love them too. You can use any spirits you want -- bourbon,  sherry or rum.  </P> <P> BOURBON BAKED  </P> <P> BEANS  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound 12-ounce) can baked beans  </P> <P> 1/3 cup bourbon, sherry or rum  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon instant coffee powder  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon prepared mustard  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon lemon juice  </P> <P> Combine beans, bourbon, brown sugar, coffee powder, mustard and lemon juice.  Turn into individual bean pots or casseroles. Bake at 350 degrees 40 to 45  minutes. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P>  Only recipes of general interest will be printed.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 29 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian National  Police Headquarters (ORFK) and the National Security Office  launched joint legal proceedings against two founders and  current leaders of the Hungarist Movement on Thursday [28  April], the ORFK told MTI this morning. Albert Szabo, a  39-year-old Australian-Hungarian citizen and Istvan Gyorkos, a  54-year-old Hungarian citizen were taken into custody and now  face trial for anti-community incitement.    As reported by MTI on Thursday, the Hungarist Movement (HM),  which was founded recently by the leaders of the Federation of  Persecutees of Communism, the Hungarian National Front, and the  World National Popular Rule Party, held a news conference on  Wednesday.    Co-Presidents Gyorgy Ekrem Kemal, Istvan Gyorkos, and Albert  Szabo informed the journalists that they had applied for  registration at the Budapest Metropolitan Court on April 25.  They claimed partial identification with the arrow cross  party's Hungarist movement, which rose to power in 1944 under  the leadership of Ferenc Szalasi (1897-1946). (Szalasi was  sentenced to death as a war-criminal in 1946.)    At a Thursday press conference, Prime Minister Peter Boross  condemned the new movement on behalf of the government and of  the Hungarian Democratic Forum.</p>

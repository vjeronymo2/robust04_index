			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Tory unease at scale of possible spending cuts: Parents may face university fees - Restrictions considered on benefits THE GOVERNMENT faced the threat of a backlash from its own supporters yesterday as it became increasingly clear that the scale of spending cuts under consideration could lead to significant inroads into the welfare state. Among controversial moves being considered in the spending review now under way are understood to be the charging of parents for university tuition fees and restricting the availability of benefits which are not protected by election pledges. A change to the existing system under which university tuition fees are automatically paid by the government would seriously hurt the pockets of middle-class parents. Typical tuition fees would be just less than Pounds 2,000 a year for arts subjects, and Pounds 2,770 for science. Government spending on fees in higher education is expected to rise from just under Pounds 600m in 1990-91 to Pounds 1.6bn in 1993-94. The scale of a possible backlash from Tory backbenchers already worried by the government's recent series of political setbacks will depend on how far the spending cuts affect key groups of Conservative supporters among the middle classes and pensioners. The need for a by-election in Christchurch, which has been a rock solid Tory seat and which contains a large proportion of pensioners, will ensure that the impact of the spending review on the elderly remains a high-profile issue. Mr John Major, prime minister, yesterday confirmed that the review would look at state benefits but promised that the government would honour its manifesto commitments, and that the 'most vulnerable' people would be protected. Some Tory MPs, however, were quick to insist that pensioners and those just above income support levels should not suffer. The prime minister's attempts to seize on the encouraging unemployment figures and the completion of the Maastricht bill by the House of Commons, were overshadowed at Westminster by the row over the prospect of ending free prescriptions for all but the poor. In noisy scenes in the Commons yesterday afternoon, Mr Major emphasised that no decisions on next year's spending had been made and that none was imminent. While there was support at a meeting last night of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers for Mr Major's insistence that nothing could be ruled out of the spending review, there was also concern among Conservative MPs that extending prescription charges would be just the first of many unpopular options to be canvassed in coming weeks. One MP suggested that the government appeared to have 'a death wish'. The anxiety was reinforced by Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, who said prescription charges were 'only one of 100 different things to look at'. The entire Pounds 80bn social security budget was 'a cuckoo in the nest', he said. Targetting benefits, Mr Portillo added, must be one line of inquiry in the review. 'The whole point of this is to make sure that our public spending goes to the people who need it most, and produces the best possible benefit,' he said. Against the prospect of difficult spending decisions, cabinet ministers held a special political discussion yesterday morning to discuss how they could present the government's case more compellingly. Labour, however, is determined to press home its attack. Mr John Smith, the party leader, said he could not imagine 'a more gross betrayal' of the Tories' election commitments than cutting back free prescriptions. Mr Major accused him of 'scaremongering'. The cabinet is expected to discuss public spending in June, but meetings between Mr Portillo and spending ministers have been going on for the past month or so. Some ministers are already warning that the decision not to press ahead more vigorously with paying benefits through automated credit transfer rather than through post offices - a retreat earlier this week in response to Tory concern about rural sub-post offices - would mean that more savings would have to be made in the benefits themselves. 'You can't spend the same money twice. What you spend on administration you can't spend on benefits,' one minister said yesterday. Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

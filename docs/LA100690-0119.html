			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFRICA / RECIPE FOR DISASTER;  </P> <P> 2 LIBERIA FACTIONS AND PEACEKEEPERS KEEP WAR BOILING  </P> <P> Not very long ago, it was an article of faith among Liberians anxious to see an  end to their country's civil war that peace would return when President Samuel  K. Doe left.  </P> <P> Doe was captured by rebels and slain a month ago, and things have only become  worse.  </P> <P> Today, three armies, including a "peacekeeping" force deployed by five members  of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), are engaged in  full-scale war in and around the capital, Monrovia. Neither an end nor a  predictable outcome of the nine-month-old war is in sight.  </P> <P> In recent days, the West African force has gone on the offensive, strengthened  by the assignment of a Nigerian combat officer as its field commander. Nigerian  planes have bombed positions held by Charles Taylor, the strongest and most  obdurate rebel leader, and soldiers of the 6,000-strong force have moved into  Monrovia from their base at the city's port.  </P> <P> But like all previous developments in this vicious conflict, these developments  only further cloud the future of what was always one of Africa's most unruly  lands.  </P> <P> Liberians in exile and other observers believe that the political and social  structure of the country has been so shattered by the length and ethnic nature  of the civil war that it could take years to restore genuine order after the  fighting stops.  </P> <P> "So many of the assumptions about how Liberia works have been destroyed," said  one longtime observer of the country, "that it's not clear how the people are  going to organize themselves into a political structure."  </P> <P> The progression of tragedy has confounded Liberians and foreigners alike. When  a group of prominent Liberian exiles met in August in Banjul, Gambia, to  nominate a provisional president and government to take over after the West  African task force landed, they assumed that an end to the turmoil was just  around the corner.  </P> <P> "They thought they would be in Monrovia by the end of September," says Ellen  Johnson-Sirleaf, an exile who participated in the meeting but declined a post  in the provisional government. "They thought that by this time everybody would  be sitting around a table to negotiate."  </P> <P> Instead, the weeks since then have been a succession of slim hopes violently  dashed.  </P> <P> When the two opposing rebel armies, under Taylor and his rival, Prince Yormie  Johnson, arrived in Monrovia about the beginning of June, most observers  believed that Doe's departure from office was the only way to restore order.  But his death at Johnson's hands has added to the turmoil. Taylor declared a  cease-fire late last month, but it collapsed days later after Johnson's forces  unearthed a cache of ammunition hidden by Doe's forces and again opened fire on  Taylor.  </P> <P> "I guess Doe was right," said a dispirited Johnson-Sirleaf, who once served in  the Doe government but later fled the country and now works as an international  banker in Washington. "He said his death would only cause more chaos."  </P> <P> One disappointment to many leading Liberians outside the country has been the  performance of the West African task force. The detachment's original  assignment, to monitor a cease-fire, was its first problem because there was no  cease-fire to monitor when it landed Aug. 24. It has been hampered by the  absence of a clear objective ever since.  </P> <P> Even now, with the task force on the offensive, some observers question how  long it can continue to fight Taylor. Taylor is convinced that its principal  objective is to deprive him of power, and the force's sponsoring countries are  not likely to have the resources or will to pursue a sustained campaign.  </P> <P> Others complain that under Nigerian leadership, the task force's "peacekeeping"  portfolio has been discarded. "I'm disappointed with the ECOWAS view now that  this has to be won by military means, not by compromise and negotiation," said  Johnson-Sirleaf.  </P> <P> Christopher Clapham, a professor at Britain's University of Lancaster and an  authority on Liberian politics, said: "You have a West African force going  about in a strange country, with little financial backing and little idea about  what kind of political system it should set up. That's a recipe for disaster."  </P> <P> Leaving Taylor in nominal control of the country is not itself a guarantee of  order. Taylor's own force is largely disorganized, and his control over his own  deputies is dubious; at least one has already set himself up as an independent  warlord.  </P></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / PM warning to Tory rebels MR John Major set about the biggest fight of his political career yesterday by arguing that the crucial issue at stake was whether Britain would play 'a central role in Europe's future development.' In a measured speech aimed both at his Euro-sceptic backbench Tory critics and his Europhile Liberal Democrat allies, he backed up this keynote theme by insisting that pressing ahead with ratification of Maastricht was a vital national interest. 'I don't believe it is credible for this country to sit on the sidelines of Europe and let other people determine policy,' he said, adding shortly after: 'It is not in our national interest now, not in the future and never will be.' Using words tailored for his own back benches, he insisted that a centralised Europe was more likely if 'Britain scowls in frustration on the fringes'. In spite of numerous hostile interventions, some from his own side, Mr Major managed to command the attention of the house with a low-key delivery aimed at appealing to reason, not passion. A confident performance, which skilfully tackled or brushed aside the points of his critics, also played heavily on the dire economic consequences of Britain's being left on the sidelines. Anticipating a Labour attack on the motives behind the paving debate, he said that it had come as a consequence of a request from Mr Neil Kinnock, when Labour leader, in June. He asserted that progress had been made on creating a framework for a definition of subsidiarity at the Birmingham summit and said the Danes had now made clear their aims for an addendum to the treaty that met their concerns without seeking a renegotiation. Turning to Labour, Mr Major won cheers from the Conservative benches by charging that the amendment tabled by the opposition was 'a fraud.' Exploiting the fact that Labour was arguing for a delay in ratification while also claiming to be a firmly pro-Maastricht party, he aimed a steady stream of fire at the integrity of Mr John Smith. Although a long-time pro-European, the opposition leader was 'hiding behind the Danes' to disguise the splits in his own party,' he said. 'The right honourable gentleman's principles have been cast adrift on a sea of expediency,' he added to loud cheers. After winning noisy Tory support for these attacks, the prime minister then attempted to address what he acknowledged were the 'genuine concerns' of the doubters. He underlined that his negotiation had firmly established Britain's right not to proceed to Economic and Monetary Union, adding that such a prospect looked increasingly unlikely within the treaty's timetable. Heavy stress was put on Britain's successful persuasion of its European partners to keep key policy issues such as security and foreign affairs at an intergovernmental level and outside the competence of the European Commission. Asked by Mr Tony Marlow (C Northampton N) why the Commission had the right to initiate policy under the treaty, Mr Major replied that that was only by unanimous agreement of the Council of Ministers. The problem of 'creeping competence' eroding to the Commission was tackled by the need not only for that but, in addition, the approval of member states' parliaments. In his concluding remarks, he appealed directly to his own backbenches when he argued: 'I have to tell the House and . . . the country that we cannot continue to make a success of our membership of the Community unless we ratify the treaty we have agreed to. 'That is my clear judgment and I would be doing the country a disservice, if I did not back that judgment with all the force at my command.'</p>

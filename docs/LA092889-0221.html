			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NORWEGIAN TO LEAD NATO DEFENSES  </P> <P> Norwegian four-star Gen. Vigleik Eide took over today as chairman of NATO's  military committee, the alliance's highest military authority.  </P> <P> Eide, 55, formerly Norway's chief of staff, replaced West Germany's Wolfgang  Altenburg at the end of his three-year term.  </P> <P> The chairman of the military committee acts as a link between NATO political  authorities and its military commanders, including Gen. John Galvin, Supreme  Allied Commander in Europe.  </P> <P> NATO officials said Eide, an infantryman by training, is relatively  inexperienced for the post and was chosen as a compromise after the most  popular candidate, Sir John Fieldhouse, formerly British chief of defense  staff, was taken ill in December, 1988, and later retired.  </P></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Smith steps down as head of Magellan fund FIDELITY Investments, the big US mutual-fund manager, is losing Mr Morris Smith, head of its flagship Dollars 20bn Magellan mutual fund only two years after he replaced money manager Mr Peter Lynch. Mr Smith, 34, said he was stepping down as head of the US's biggest mutual fund to devote more time to his family and his religion. Mr Smith, a devout Jew, plans to take his wife and children to live in Israel for at least a year. Mr Smith's resignation, from July 1, is likely to rattle Magellan's investors. When Mr Smith replaced Mr Lynch in 1990, investors had been concerned that he would not be able to match Mr Lynch's performance. Mr Jeffrey Vinik, 33, will replace Mr Smith. Mr Vinik, who was once an assistant to Mr Lynch, is currently portfolio manager of Fidelity Growth and Income Fund with Dollars 3.7bn in assets.</p>

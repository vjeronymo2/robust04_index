			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: The sinister side of a jolly uncle THE INVISIBLE MAN: THE LIFE AND LIBERTIES OF HG WELLS; by Michael Coren Bloomsbury Pounds 20, 240 pages IT IS difficult to think of any modern English writer who was less The Invisible Man - invisible either in print or in person - than HG Wells. Wells embodied the idea of the writer as a public figure, the writer as a source of wisdom sought out by society to pronounce judgment on any issue of the moment, from the modern girl to modern warfare. If Wells were alive today we would be sick of the sight of him, constantly bobbing up on television and telling us in his pipsqueak voice what ought to be done about the ozone layer, AIDS, disarmament talks, the inroads made by artificial intelligence, John Charmley's view of Churchill, and so on. He would seem like Patrick Moore, Anthony Burgess, Tony Benn, Alan Clark and Melvyn Bragg rolled into one. But apart from being a pundit he was also a marvellous comic novelist in the direct line of descent from Dickens - Kipps, for instance, is still a joy to read and earns its rightful place in Oxford's World's Classics series. Anne Veronica is another fine novel and a landmark of feminism. This is the important side of Wells, the side that is still alive and kicking, Wells the literary artist, the aspect of him that this book woefully neglects. Michael Coren would no doubt justify using that early SF title against its author for his partial view of Wells by telling us that the whole point of his book is that, behind the legendary public man we know, there is a sinister, concealed Wells that needs to be exposed. The young Wells who delighted the Edwardian reading public with his scientific fantasies also wrote Anticipations (1901), a think-book outlining his sense of the collapse of the established order and his concept of a new Utopia to replace it: he advocated genetic engineering, the suppression of inferior races, black, yellow and Jewish. This proto-fascist attitude cannot be dismissed as a mere youthful aberration. Wells's racism and his view that the world should be run by an elite of samurai persisted and crops up, as Coren documents, in later works; some are now totally forgotten, but others like Tono Bungay and The New Machiavelli are still read. It was only at the end that Wells gave up all hope for the world in that final book, Mind at the End of its Tether, published in 1945 when he was a sick and dying man. In making his case Coren is obliged to take down some pretty dusty Wells tomes from the shelves and, even if he did not have to cut their pages, he must be one of a rather small group troubling to read them today. Still, Wells put his name to these programmes of ethnic cleansing and he published them. They were read, reviewed and made their contribution to the climate of opinion. There is no gainsaying them and Coren is perfectly right to draw attention to them. Even at the height of his fame the image of Wells as a jolly uncle at a family Christmas party was not accepted wholly uncritically. Rebecca West, in a famous essay she wrote after her great affair with him was over, had serious reservations about his work: 'All our youth (she wrote) they hung about the houses of our minds like Uncles, the Big Four (Bennett, Shaw, Galsworthy and Wells) . . . They had the generosity, the charm, the loquacity of visiting uncles. Uncle Wells arrived always a little out of breath with his arms full of parcels, sometimes rather carelessly tied, but always bursting with attractive gifts that ranged from the little pot of sweet jelly that is Mr Polly, to the complete meccano set for the mind that is in The First Men in the Moon'. After more in this vein she put the boot in and cruelly parodied him: '. . . his prose suddenly loses its firmness and begins to shake like blanc-mange. 'It was then that I met Queenie. She was a soft white slip of a being, with very still dark eyes . . . Oh, my dear, she said, my dear . . . darn your socks . . . squaw'. But take him all in all, Uncle Wells was as magnificent an uncle as one could hope to have.' Wells was livid. 'The thing' he wrote in a private letter to her, 'is a lie and a damned stupid one. You can go through all my books and list the woman characters, not a bad lot from Aunt Pondervo to Joan and from Ann Pornick to the Meanwhile women - and you can't find three pages to justify this spiteful rubbish'. What hurt especially was the crack about 'darning his socks . . . squaw'. It was the role played by Wells's wife Jane who condoned his numerous affairs. In spite of her husband's ceaseless pursuit of younger women, Jane remained firmly married to Wells until she died suddenly from cancer in 1927. Coren gives yet another account of Rebecca's affair with Wells. We have already been through it several times in earlier biographies and viewed it from the points of view of all the principal players - including that of Anthony West, the fruit of the affair. Coren has had access to the Wells papers in the University of Urbana, Illinois and he interviewed Anthony West before he died. Coren's chapter, 'A Woman of Some Importance', is the best researched part of his book. Here are the main events of the affair from the standpoint of a detached observer. Indeed, Coren has written a punchy stimulating book, if over-selective in its treatment of the vast material. He deals much more more briskly with most of the other mistresses, dispatching Moura Budberg - whom Wells said was one of the few women he really loved - in half a sentence. Nor does Coren seem to realise quite what a feat it was for this son of a housekeeper and a professional cricketer to gatecrash an Edwardian literary world run by the darlings of the country house set like Harry Cust, another great Don Juan of the time. He appears here as Harry 'Crust' - a misprint but rather an apt name for him. Coren seems unaware too that Wells was in New York in 1941 lecturing at the behest of the British Ministry of Information. The lectures were a flop. Maugham, who heard them, commented on his old friend: 'he has always been too busy to be much of a philosopher'. Coren's book makes the same point at rather greater length.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Trinidad (Uruguay), 8 May (EFE) -- Today, Alberto  Volonte, UTE [General Administration of State Electric Power and  Telephones] executive board chairman, became the fourth  presidential candidate aspiring to succeed President Luis  Alberto Lacalle. He will stand as National Party (Blanco Party)  candidate in the general elections.    Some 600 "Blanco" leaders officially proclaimed him during a  rally in the city of Trinidad, located 190 km northeast of  Montevideo. Volonte did not participate in this rally as he is  banned from engaging in partisan politics while he holds a post  within the state's autonomous agency.    The new presidential candidate from the ruling party will  resign from his post as UTE executive board chairman when the  momentum for the 29 November elections, in which the national  government, lawmakers, and municipal authorities will be chosen,  gathers steam.    Volonte had been discarded by President Lacalle, who  hand-picked his former Interior Minister Juan Andres Ramirez as  his successor. Volonte was proclaimed by a splinter group that  broke with the government's top leaders.    Volonte's candidacy within the Blanco Party should be added  to those of Vice President Gonzalo Aguirre, who was proclaimed  candidate in Montevideo last week, and Senator Carlos Julio  Pereyra, leader of the second largest faction within the ruling  party who has taken a different line from Lacalle, especially  with regard to economic policy.    In Uruguay, political parties may field several candidacies,  which according to the Elections Law, the party is elected first  and then the candidate who receives the most votes within the  winning party.    As for the Colorado Party, the main opposition party, the  candidacies of former Presidents Julio Maria Sanguinetti, who  heads public opinion polls in voters' preferences for president,  and Jorge Pacheco Areco, leader of the right wing, have already  been confirmed. It is also believed that Jorge Batlle, a  three-time candidate for president, will also run. The Broad  Front, a coalition of leftist parties, will field only one  presidential candidate, Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez.    Public opinion surveys show that the Colorado Party is the  favorite choice of voters, with 34 percent, followed by the  Broad Front with 27 percent and the Blanco Party with 24 percent.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Labour warns on gas deregulation Labour yesterday warned the government not to deregulate the domestic gas market without consulting parliament. Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, said: 'Political decisions on the provision of fuel should be made by elected politicians rather than by unaccountable regulators.' He was reacting to a statement by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, that she would consider various ways to introduce wider competition if the government failed to put forward a new gas bill in time to meet the 1996 deadline to begin phasing in deregulation.</p>

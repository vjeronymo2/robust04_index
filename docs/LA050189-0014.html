			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> INSECT LINK DISCOUNTED  </P> <P> Scientists last week reported evidence debunking the theory that a distant  relative of the AIDS virus that causes leukemia could be spread by insects. The  researchers said they produced evidence that mosquitoes and ticks do not  transmit HTLV-1, the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1, a virus related  to the AIDS virus that causes leukemia.  </P> <P> "This is reassuring," said Dr. Edward Murphy, an assistant professor of  laboratory medicine at UC San Francisco, who headed the research reported in a  letter in the New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> Some researchers had speculated that HTLV-1 may be spread by insects because it  is found mostly in the tropics and other areas where insect-borne diseases are  common.  </P> <P> The researchers tested 90 Jamaican patients who had antibodies to HTLV-1 for  antibodies to other viruses transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes and compared  them to 110 subjects who did not have HTLV-1 antibodies. They found no  significant evidence that those infected with HTLV-1 were more likely to have  been exposed to mosquitoes or ticks.  </P></p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Chancellor rules out prospect of early tax cuts Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday dismissed any prospect of tax cuts in his November Budget despite the shadow cast over next month's Conservative party conference by the rise in interest rates. In a move that will dash remaining hopes among Tory MPs of a significant upturn in the government's political fortunes this autumn, Mr Clarke said there was 'no chance' of lower taxes while the government was borrowing Pounds 30bn a year. Yesterday's base rate rise and the chancellor's curt rejection of recent speculation that he might find room for a small income tax cut clashed awkwardly with the launch of the agenda for the annual party conference. Mr Jeremy Hanley, the party chairman, inadvertently showed his anxiety about the impact on Tory morale by voicing hopes that there would be no further increase in borrowing costs. Still unsettled by the political row following his weekend 'gaffe' over law and order, Mr Hanley broke with the carefully scripted official response to comment: 'What we have to do is make sure that this interest rate rise is it.' With the Tories trailing Labour by more than 30 points in the opinion polls, the conference agenda reflects growing discontent among local activists over the government's handling of the economy. It includes a series of demands from constituency associations for tax cuts and the scrapping of the planned doubling next April of value added tax on domestic fuel. Ministers acknowledged that the strength of the recovery shown by the latest batch of indicators has yet to be reflected in a 'feel-good' factor among voters. Their fear is that higher interest rates and the round of further tax rises due in the coming months will further damage the government's standing. But Mr Clarke, in characteristically robust form at a Treasury press conference, coupled a reaffirmation of the government's medium-term commitment to lower taxation with a rejection of any early tax cuts. He acknowledged that public borrowing this year might be below the Treasury's latest Pounds 36bn forecast, but said it was still expected to be more than Pounds 30bn. Against that background, 'talk of tax reductions in November is hopelessly premature. No chance'. Some ministerial colleagues believe the chancellor was pushed into his rate move by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. They want Mr Clarke to take a stronger line against the bank's 'over-cautious' stance.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System The peseta moved from the bottom of the European Monetary System's grid to the top last week after Spain protected its currency by imposing exchange controls. The peseta then returned to the bottom after Spanish share prices collapsed in the wake of the move. The central banks' determined defence of the French franc helped it join the ranks of the strongest currencies. The top four currencies are in a position to move quickly towards monetary union, while those below could adopt a slower timetable. Samuel Brittan, Page 22; Finance ministers aim to boost confidence, Page 24; High speed train to Emu, Page 25; Currencies, Page 35; Monday Interview, Page 38 The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the narrow band cannot rise more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the system. The Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo operate with 6 per cent fluctuation bands.</p>

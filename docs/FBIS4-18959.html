			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aslak Bonde report: "Center Party Wants Broad Front in EU </F> Battle"]    [Text] The central executive of the Center Party held an  extraordinary meeting yesterday to discuss strategy on the EU  [European Union] question. The main message from the central  executive was also the extraordinary: The battle to win the  referendum takes precedence over everything else.    The planned program of preparations for the 1995 local  elections will be postponed to leave enough room for the EU  struggle, and money need be no obstacle. The Center Party  leadership told the press yesterday that its successes in the  elections last year has given the party the finances which make  it possible to invest millions of kroner in the campaign against  EU membership.    "We will do our bit, and we have some resources. But we also  know from the last EC battle that it was the broad alliance  across the great divides which ensured a `no' majority. In the  same way we must allow `No to the EU' to coordinate the fight  this time too so that the resources of all organizations and  parties are used in the best way possible," Center Party leader  Anne Enger Lahnstein said.    She dismissed a question about whether this is an indication  that she does not want to be the "no" queen.    "We are not the ones using such titles, but there can be no  doubt that there is teamwork both among us and in other  organizations combined with a cross-political grass-roots  involvement which will guarantee victory," she said.    There is little reason to expect the Center Party to slip  into the shadows, even if it does become clear that it will be  "No to the EU" which will coordinate the campaign against  membership. The party has plans to advertise posts so that it  will be able to improve its EU competence, and leaflets will be  produced. The Center Party will make its contribution through  its part of what the party calls popular education and facts  about the EU and the results achieved in the negotiations.    Yesterday the central executive also set up its own strategy  committee which will evaluate the EU battle more or less day by  day. The committee consists of the party leader, the two deputy  chairmen, and the party secretary in addition to the Storting  group's political and administrative leaders and the Center  Party's members of the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee.    Of the eight members of the strategy committee only two are  not at the Storting every day. Nevertheless the party  leadership is stressing that the real work against EU membership  must take place at grass-roots level.</p>

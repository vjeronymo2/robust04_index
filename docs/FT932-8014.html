			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Reconciling economics and ecology in New England - An area that could benefit from environmental pressures elsewhere DRY STONE walls running through mature hardwood forest in New England evoke a powerful picture of the sheer effort needed by the colonists to clear their new land of both trees and rocks in order to plant crops. The ruins of a farmstead, complete with rusting implements, overshadowed by towering red and sugar maple, black cherry, ash, beech, pine and hemlock also bear witness to the regenerative power of nature. The remains of barbed wire fences, once wrapped round a sapling, run straight through the centre of a 14-inch diameter oak. 'There is no virgin forest here. This is all land cut over and used,' says forester Bruce Jacobs, president of New Hampshire-based Fountain Forestry, which looks after 150,000 acres of US forest land, mostly in New England. He reckons that the potential of the second-growth north-eastern forests of the US as a source of hardwood has been overlooked at a time when US timber exports are booming and environmental concerns are reducing supplies. The most visible example of environmental pressures has been the battle over the endangered spotted owl, which last month took up several hours of President Clinton's time in Portland, Oregon. 'We'll get some of the action because of the spotted owl,' says Mr Jacobs, who says that protecting the species will locks up 12 to 14 per cent of the Pacific north-west's timber, and will have a big impact on the US domestic market. Already timber from the north-east is being sold in Chicago, which used to take all its construction timber from the west coast. The abandonment of the farms in New England followed the Civil War and the opening up of the American west. A century and a half ago 70 to 80 per cent of Vermont was open, but now between 80 and 85 per cent is wooded again. A time-travelling Indian would find the mix of species in the forest exactly the same as it was several hundred years ago. But he would wonder what had happened to the giant white pine, which was relentlessly cut down to supply masts for the battling navies of Europe. While the white pine is readily found, none have been around the 200 years or so necessary to reach 150 feet high and 3 feet in diameter. That is not surprising considering the region's first saw mill started to operate in Maine early in the 17th century. Timber harvesting has not stopped since - and a white pine reaches its maximum commercial value after only 80 years. In upper New York state about 40 per cent of the Adirondack mountains is now managed by the state as wilderness. Apart from the maintenance of trails, the forest is left alone, and presumably some white pines will once again reach 200 years of age. But most of the rest of the land is in private hands and the owners want to make it pay. Mr Jacobs argues that it is possible both to make a profit from timber and to conserve the forest for hunting and leisure purposes. About 25 per cent of the entire US population is within a day's drive of the north-eastern forests. The most profitable hardwood in the New England forests is black cherry, which produces beautiful timber for furniture manufacture. If left alone the black cherry reaches maturity in 80 years, although management of the forest can shorten the time to 65 years. It is fetching Dollars 250 to Dollars 350 per 1,000 board feet at present, although a tree suitable for producing veneer can fetch up to Dollars 2,000 per 1,000 board feet. But the difference in price between the top value trees and those that can be used only for pulp is considerable. Pulped hardwood, which is needed for top quality paper such as that used in glossy magazines, fetches Dollars 3 to Dollars 5 a cord (a cord is a stack 4ft by 4ft by 8ft). It takes about 25 6-inch diameter trees to make a cord - valuing each tree at only a few cents. In surveying for good prospective forest land, Mr Jacobs will look for timber that is at the pulpwood stage, but on the verge of reaching saw log stage. 'You can buy at 20 cents a tree, and 30 years later you have potentially a tree worth Dollars 200 to Dollars 300,' he says. 'You also still have the land.' However, this means taking a long-term view. Many owners succumb to the temptation to take out all the best timber in one go, leaving the next harvest 60 to 70 years away. As Mr Jacobs points out: 'It's very difficult to really hurt the forest from a biological view, but very easy to hurt in terms of economic value'.</p>

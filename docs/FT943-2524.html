			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / People: Diplomatic move by Volvo It has been clear that Volvo has been looking to beef up its corporate communications team ever since the fiasco of its failed merger with Renault last December, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. But the vehicle group's announcement last week that Lars Anell, Sweden's EU ambassador in Brussels, had agreed to take the newly created job of head of the corporate affairs section as a senior vice president certainly raised a few eyebrows. After all, he still has two years to run in his current post - which he describes as the 'best job in the Swedish civil service' - and he will be foregoing the chance of seeing his country into the European Union next January. There is also the fact that Anell has been a civil servant all his working life - apart from his time in Brussels, he has been Sweden's ambassador in Geneva and served as chairman of GATT for two years. The closest contact he has had with Volvo is the model of car he drives. So what has prompted the move? Anell admits it wasn't an easy decision but says the crucial factor was his age - he is 52 - and the desire 'to try something new. This was probably my last opportunity to have a substantial career in private industry,' he says. The role will be a broad one. Apart from the media and investor relations side, he will be asked to evaluate broader political and economic developments. He will also be expected to boost the group's presentational skills, avoiding, if possible, the sort of furore that blew up last autumn after an initially favourable reaction to the Renault plan. Anell's political/economic experience is clearly one of his main qualifications for the post. But he will also bring to Volvo the sort of international contacts it has lacked since the acrimonious departure of former chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar last December.</p>

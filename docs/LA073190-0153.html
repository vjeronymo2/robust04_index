			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CITY;  </P> <P> BERNARDI LEADS BID TO OVERTURN CITY'S CAMPAIGN FINANCING PLAN  </P> <P> City Councilman Ernani Bernardi and state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp today announced  a legal challenge to the city's voter-approved plans to provide partial public  financing for municipal campaigns.  </P> <P> Kopp (I-San Francisco) was one of the authors of state Proposition 73, enacted  by the voters in 1988, which bans public campaign financing.  </P> <P> He and Bernardi are going to court to halt implementation of the public  campaign financing provisions of City Charter Amendment H, a comprehensive  ethics measure approved by Los Angeles voters in June.  </P> <P> Amendment H requires the council to place $2 million each year into a trust for  matching campaign funds to be handed out to qualifying candidates in the 1993  election and beyond.  </P></p>

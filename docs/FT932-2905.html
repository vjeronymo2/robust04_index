			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mandatory Pounds 87m bid for Watts Blake WATTS BLAKE Bearne, a 280-year business based in Devon and the world's biggest supplier of ball clay, received yesterday a 420p a share bid from Sibelco, a Belgian producer of silica sand for the glass industry, which values the British group at Pounds 87m. The company rejected the offer saying it 'represents a wholly inadequate premium for control.' The board urged shareholders to sell no shares in the market and wait for a circular explaining in detail its opposition. Watts Blake shares failed to rise above the offer price, and later fell back to 415p, a net gain of 24p. There is a loan note alternative on the basis of Pounds 21 for every five shares. The notes carry interest at 4.75 per cent and are redeemable at par in September 1994. The bid was sparked by a decision earlier this year by Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family, to dispose of its 15.6 per cent stake. This triggered a concert party agreement under which Sibelco and Quarzwerke of Germany, each owning 14.8 per cent, were also required to put their stakes up for sale. The agreement also provided a formula allowing the partners to buy each other out. The combined offer for sale lapsed last month leaving Sibelco free to launch its own bid yesterday. Sibelco said it has arranged to buy the stakes of Ceramics and Quarzwerke. This would take its holding to 45.2 per cent, leaving it only 4.9 per cent short of winning majority control. It said the Stock Exchange requirement to make an offer once the holding had gone above 30 per cent was the impetus for the bid, rather than a desire to take over over the company. Sibelco had always held the current management of Watts Blake in high regard, it added. 'The purchase of the Ceramics stake really was a tidy up operation. Rather than have the stake overhang the market, we decided to buy it.' An adviser to Sibelco said it would be happy to end up owning 'any percentage from 45 to 100' of Watts Blake's shares. Ceramics is thought to need new funds to support its other business interests; it has unconditionally agreed to sell its shares to Sibelco at the offer price. Quarzwerke, a private company producing silica sand, has also agreed to sell its shares 'subject to Sibelco's ability to purchase shares under the City Code.'</p>

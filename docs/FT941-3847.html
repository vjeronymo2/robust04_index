			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Clinton friend expected to quit as justice aide Mr Webster Hubbell, the US associate attorney-general and a close friend of US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, is expected to resign as associate attorney general, Justice Department officials said yesterday. Administration officials yesterday tied the likely resignation to questions of overbilling by Mr Hubbell at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where he and Mrs Clinton held partnerships. However, Mr Hubbell, number three at the Justice Department, has also been linked to the Whitewater affair, which involves the Clintons' financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s. Mr Hubbell's father-in-law borrowed heavily from the Madison Guaranty savings and loan institution at the centre of the controversy, and failed to repay more than Dollars 500,0009 (Pounds 335,000). He did some work for federal thrift regulators, although Rose had once also represented Madison Guaranty. Another of the Clintons' friends, Mr Bernie Nussbaum, was forced to resign as White House counsel earlier this month when it was revealed that he met Treasury officials to discuss an investigation of Madison. A third of the Clintons' friends, Mr Vince Foster, another White House lawyer, was found dead last summer, in an apparent suicide. Asked about the reports that Mr Hubbell was set to quit, Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, said: 'I'm not confirming it, but I'm not denying it. The president knows the state of play.' Mr Hubbell's likely resignation comes just as the administration seemed to be taking the offensive in the Whitewater affair. Mr Lloyd Cutler, the new but temporary White House counsel, was co-operating closely with Mr Robert Fiske, the special counsel investigating the Clintons' financial dealings and all related issues. Mr Hubbell, the subject of conservative attacks even before he took office, was a golfing partner of the president. In Little Rock, where he had served as mayor, he was seen as a reformer who crusaded for open government. He also headed the state lawyers association's ethics committee. He has denied any overbilling, and said he was co-operating with a Rose internal investigation into billing matters. In Washington Mr Hubbell came under severe scrutiny from the Wall Street Journal, which portrayed him as the Justice Department's political fixer for the White House. For the administration's opponents he came to symbolise the supposed cronyism of the Clinton White House, with its numerous Arkansas operators out of their depth in Washington.

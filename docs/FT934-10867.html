			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Quebecor lifts sales, earnings in third term QUEBECOR, the Montreal-based publishing group which controls North America's second-biggest commercial printer, reported a gain in sales and earnings in the third quarter, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Net profit was CDollars 17.5m (USDollars 13.5m), or 27 cents a share, up from CDollars 16.1m, or 24 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 789m, against CDollars 623m. Nine-month profit was CDollars 52.6m, or 77 cents, up from CDollars 36.8m, or 55 cents, excluding special items in both periods. Revenues for the period advanced to CDollars 2.2bn from CDollars 1.8bn. Quebecor is controlled by the Peladeau family. It owns Canada's second-biggest daily newspaper, and weeklies and magazines. Much of its income comes from the 55 per cent-owned Quebecor Printing. Talisman, the former BP Canada, earned CDollars 4.3m, or 7 cents a share, in the third quarter, double the total of a year earlier. For the first nine months it earned CDollars 19.2m, or 33 cents, up from CDollars 7.5m, or 15 cents, a year earlier. The company has doubled oil and gas production and reserves this year through a significant acquisition, and gas prices have risen steadily. A lower Canadian dollar has also helped. Bow Valley Energy, 33 per cent held by British Gas and expanding internationally, earned CDollars 10.4m or three cents a share in the first nine months, up from CDollars 7.9m or one cent a share, on revenues of CDollars 178m, little changed.</p>

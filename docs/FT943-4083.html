			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The sharp rise in US producer prices brought widespread selling in the London derivatives markets yesterday afternoon. The September contract on the Footsie collapsed to show a discount of around 15 points to the cash market for much of the afternoon - fair value premium is worth about three points at present. And little recovery had been seen by the close when it stood at 3,125. Heavy arbitrage business was reported. Of the 22,149 Footsie contracts traded, around 600 represented roll-overs into the December contract.</p>

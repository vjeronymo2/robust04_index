			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Details of FT-SE announcements This is the text of the notice issued on Wednesday by the FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee. The Committee, at its meeting today, proposed a change to the rules concerning the definition of a UK company for index purposes. It is a principle of the indices that only UK companies are eligible and the purpose of the rule change is to clarify the treatment of stapled units which include shares in both UK and non-UK companies. The proposed rule change involves an additional requirement that companies eligible for membership shall pay dividends franked for UK corporation tax purposes (or if there is currently no dividend, would do so). Cases where shareholders may elect to receive either a franked or a non-franked dividend (ie, where it is not mandatory, when receiving a dividend, to receive a franked dividend) would not be eligible. All index rule changes require to be approved by the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices Steering Committee which next meets on October 6, 1993. If the proposed rule change is approved by that Steering Committee, neither new Rothmans units nor Vendome units would be eligible for inclusion in any of the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices for the UK; 'old' Rothmans International would remain a constituent of the indices until the forthcoming reorganisation becomes effective. The status of SmithKline Beecham units (which have been included in the indices for several years) would become anomalous. Each unit consists of B ordinary shares in the UK company (which pays no dividend) and US preference shares of a US subsidiary which is responsible for all the dividends on the unit; thus the unit pays a dividend which is not franked for UK corporation tax. The units will continue to be included in the indices while consultation takes place with interested parties including the company and its advisors. SmithKline Beecham A shares (whose dividends are franked) are not the subject of such consultation and will remain a constituent of the indices. Notes: Rule 4.9 of the Ground Rules for the Management of The UK Series currently defines an eligible UK company as a company 'incorporated and registered for tax purposes in the UK'. Under the proposed revised rules, Eurotunnel plc will remain eligible for inclusion in the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices. The weighting of Eurotunnel plc will remain unchanged at 50 per cent of the Eurotunnel units.                    *             *           * Details of annual changes The Committee approved constituent changes to be made to the FT-SE SmallCap and FT-A All-Share after close of business on 31 December 1993.

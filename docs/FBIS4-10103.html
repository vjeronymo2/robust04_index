			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sixth and final part of a judicial reform series by Victor </F> Andres Ponce]    [Text] The history of the judicial branch's budget has  always been characterized by a lack of resources to efficiently  serve the demands of justice.    During the past few years the judicial branch's percentage  of  the country's budget has varied a lot. From 1965 to 1969, the  average was 0.52 percent. It was 0.59 percent from 1970 to 1974.    Matters did not change during the 1980's (it must be  recalled  that the 1979 Constitution established that 2 percent of the  budget was to be set aside for the judicial branch). From 1980  to 1984, the judicial branch's average share of the budget was  0.42 percent. From 1985 to 1990, the average was 0.55 percent.    Now, it is worthwhile to comment that in 1964 salaries  accounted for 86.7 percent of the judicial branch's budget,  while in 1990 it was only 20.9 percent and a mere 14 percent in  1994. In other words, judges' salaries became a mere ancillary  element when the budget was being drafted.  <H5>  The Current Situation </H5>   In 1994, the judicial branch submitted a budget for 440  million soles. The Treasury allocated barely 116 million soles,  0.70 percent of the national budget.    Of the 95 million soles asked for in the remunerations  category, only 16.8 million soles were given. In other words,  less than 20 percent of what was asked for. And what is even  worse, in this item there has been a 2 million-sol reduction  compared with last year's budget because the judicial branch  received 18.5 million soles in 1993.    As mentioned in a previous report, a Supreme Court justice  gets a salary of 3,800 soles. The judicial branch's governing  law establishes that a superior justice must get 90 percent of a  Supreme Court justice's salary, in other words 3,400 soles. But  matters are very different: He gets only 1,600 soles.    In the case of penal, civil, and assorted judges, the law  indicates that they must get 80 percent of a Supreme Court  justice's salary, 3,000 soles in other words. Reality is  dramatic: They only earn 1,100 soles.    Justices of the peace they should earn 2,600 soles, but they  only get 700. A judicial branch official said: "In submitting  this plan, our objective was to pay the salaries in accordance  with the law." But this will not be possible now.    Regarding the works category, the judicial branch requested  15 million soles and was given 7.439 million. The sum that had  been requested was to have been used to equip the new courts  that will operate in the former seats of the Economy and  Education Ministries and for other minor works.    A sum of 28 million soles was asked for assets, but the  Treasury only released 10.2 million.  <H5>  Some Improvements </H5>   But not everything is bad. Important improvements have been  made this year. For example: There is a rule that allows the  judicial branch Executive Council to administer its own  resources within determined parameters: It can use 30 percent of  its budget to improve salaries.    This rule in itself is revolutionary because there have been  occasions when the judicial branch has not been able to dispose  of its own resources, and, therefore, could not resolve problems  within its scope.    For example: In 1993 it was hoped the category for its own  resources would be 10 million soles, but 13.2 million soles were  accrued, over 3 million soles more than estimated.    Since the budget was controlled by the Economy Ministry's  Public Credit Directorate and the programming is rigid, a budget  increase request had to be submitted to Congress. This was not  obtained due to the complicated and bureaucratic rules.    A high-ranking judicial branch official has said: "Had a  larger budget been obtained, it would have been possible to  establish the first court of appeals in buildings that used to  seat the Economy and Education Ministries. Progress could also  have been made in eradicating corruption from the courts."    This new situation allows officials of the Executive Council  of the judicial branch to increase its resources. The 1994  budget has 14 million soles but based on several measures there  are plans to collect 24 million soles.    How is it possible to reach this goal? For example, a  decision was made to end the forging the paid certificates of  the Record of Sentences.    Things would go better if a law -- which is being prepared  --  is approved returning to the judicial branch its right to  legalize accounting books. In this way it can collect another  10.2 million soles.    Something similar will occur with the official application  forms that must be purchased. There will be no longer any  forging because high security paper will be used. This  represents greater security. This measure is expected to yield  another 30 million soles.    Despite the law of own resources and the ambitious projects  of the judicial branch, some Economy Ministry officials want to  deny this right to the judicial branch. To do that, they talk  about the differences between the concept of "own revenues" used  in the law favoring the judicial branch and the "other concepts  of the Treasury" established in the Budget Law. A harsh  campaign must be carried out on behalf of the judicial branch.    Another important improvement is the Basic Spending  Concentration Program included in the 1994 National Budget.  This program will be used in judicial matters, health, and  education. It will serve to make disbursements from the  Treasury without the ridigity of the budget regulations.    The idea is to increase the number of justices of the peace  with law degrees and to train those who do not have any degree.  It is estimated that $10 million will be invested in this  project.  <H5>  A Basic Objective </H5>   The possibility of managing its own resources will make the  judicial branch eligible for credit from national and  international organizations. Sources close to the Executive  Council of the judicial branch have said that one way to finally  resolve the problem of the low salary of judges would be to  request a loan from the World Bank or the Inter-American  Development Agency. A high- ranking official said: "A request  of $20 to $30 million payable over two to three years could be  made."  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   An evaluation of the figures and percentages allocated to  the  judicial branch this year indicates that apparently no important  changes would be made. There is a growing trend for even less  money being allocated for salaries.    The law allowing the judicial branch to manage its own  resources opens the possibility of producing its own income and  being eligible for international credit. The reaction of some  Economy Ministry officials who want to deny this right to the  judicial branch cannot be understood.    The Basic Spending Concentration Program represents an  important progress because it establishes priorities by the  government.    But a budget to solve all the needs of justice is still far  away.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 9 May (AFP) -- University students staged  flash demonstrations at noon today in downtown Caracas and  burned a vehicle distributing office paper, according to  Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) officers. Police said the  university group was protesting a decision by transportation  workers not to honor bus rates for students.    Despite a vast police deployment along the streets of the  capital in the wake of a strike by 35,000 drivers, demonstrators  from the National University of Venezuela (UCV) marched to the  entrance of Venezuela Plaza. After briefly blocking traffic,  they closed in on the delivery vehicle and forced its occupants  to get out. After that, they set the vehicle ablaze and fled.    Student protests erupted last Thursday when students from  Fermin Toro High School staged major disturbances near  Miraflores presidential palace, which ended with the death of  student German Sotillo.</p>

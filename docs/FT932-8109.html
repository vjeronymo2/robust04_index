			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Major mumbles GOOD NEWS, a positive message, a sympathetic audience: an after dinner speaker could hardly ask for more. Yet the prime minister's speech to the CBI dinner on Tuesday night came out like a damp souffle. Concocted from cliche and assertion rather than reasoning, it failed to satisfy either by force of oratory or strength of argument. Mr Major is at his best in small gatherings, when his courtesy and decency win friends. At the big set piece, he can be strangely uninspiring. His CBI performance began with scars of recession, then waded through ripples of recovery and tides of manufacturing output before gasping into a jungle of enterprises choked by weeds, where he said industrialists were digging away to cut red tape. The poverty of expression obscures the fact that the prime minister has a story to tell, especially before a group of industrialists. He shares most of their views about free trade and deregulation, and - with the agony of Maastricht nearly over - about Europe as well. The relevant government departments are eager to talk constructively to business. And he no longer has to feel embarrassed about economic prospects. All that is needed is a sense of phrasing, a couple of good jokes and the ability to pull the different strands of policymaking together into a coherent and practical whole. Sir Ronald Millar made music for Mrs Thatcher, not herself the most gifted of orators. Peggy Noonan did the same for President Reagan. If Mr Major cannot discover a latter-day version, then a sharp-eyed sub-editor and a dictionary of cliches would be better than nothing. At least the dinner guests would then have longer to chat over the coffee.</p>

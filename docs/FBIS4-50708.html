			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 20 (XINHUA) -- The private economy is  booming in Shanghai, China's largest economic center.    According to the latest statistics, the city now has about  10,000 private enterprises with a registered capital of 2.6  billion yuan, increases of 14 percent and 50 percent,  respectively, over 1993.    China's private economy disappeared in the 1950's, but  resumed and burgeoned after 1979, when China began its national  reform and opening to the outside world.    To help the private economy develop healthily, the municipal  government has worked out a package of policies in favor of  private businesses.    Encouraged by the municipal government, more and more  scientists have left their research institutions to set up  non-governmental enterprises specializing in spreading research  findings, and Chinese scholars studying abroad are retuning to  Shanghai to set up businesses.</p>

The law minister said Prime Minister  Ms. Benazir Bhutto invited the leader of the opposition in the  National Assembly, Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, for talks on  several occasions to evolve consensus on common points contained  in their respective manifestos on vital national issues,  including matters relating to national security, so that harm is  not caused to national interests. But Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif  refused. The president, he added, also invited PML-N [Pakistan  Muslim League-Nawaz faction] leader in Islamabad and then in  Lahore for creating understanding in the political field, but  Mr. Nawaz Sharif again refused. The law minister renewed the  government's offer of a dialogue on major national issues to Mr.  Mohammad Nawaz Sharif.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pedro Perez, director of the Cuban import </F> company, Cubametales, by reporter Carlos Santana Ojeda -- place  and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Santana] What can you tell us, Pedro, about this  report on the sale of Colombian crude oil to Cuba?    [Perez] I can tell you that for many years Cubametales [Cuba  Metal Import Enterprise] has been holding talks with the  Colombian company Copetrol [expansion unknown] for direct supply  of Colombian crude oil to Cuba because this is a product we know  very well, having been receiving it through negotiations with  other commercial companies.    We recently held a new meeting to discuss the possibility of  this sale under normal market conditions. The Colombian  officials are studying this, and we are waiting for the final  results of those studies. This is the situation today concerning  the possible supply of Colombian petroleum to our country.    [Santana] Pedro, I have an AFP report that says Colombia  will  sell from 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of petroleum to Cuba daily as  of next June. Can this be taken as a confirmation of the  situation?    [Perez] Well, that is a point of reference because petroleum  amounts are usually determined according to shipments received  at port, not according to daily delivery of products. In any  case, I believe that is an amount we can assimilate. It will be  so -- or it can be so -- if we reach an agreement.    [Santana] Well, you have just heard the news we received  here  at our studio confirmed by Pedro Perez, director of Cubametales.</p>

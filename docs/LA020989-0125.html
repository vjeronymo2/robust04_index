			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has pardoned political prisoners in Iran in a  general amnesty declared during celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of  the Islamic Revolution, Tehran Radio announced, without specifying how many  would be freed or when it would take effect. The state radio said Khomeini  proclaimed the amnesty at the request of Intelligence Minister Mohammed  Mohammedi-Reyshahri, who said in a letter to Khomeini that the political groups  "no longer constitute a threat to the revolution." The radio said all but 900  prisoners jailed for belonging to outlawed opposition groups will be freed  under the amnesty.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Abdul Turay] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong's whitecollar criminals are raking in  hundreds of millions by swindling mainland businessmen. Police  and financial sources say scams often involve foreign-exchange  and debt- collecting deceptions, as well as letters of credit  and securities fraud.    The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is holding  monthly meetings with mainland authorities to find ways to clamp  down on the problem, which is riding on the back of China's  economic boom. A memorandum of co-operation between the two  sides was signed in June last year. SFC public affairs manager  Wesley McDade said companies and individuals which had fallen  foul of SFC regulations in Hong Kong frequently re-established  themselves in China. "The SFC has no authority over offshore  companies but we are able to give the authorities on the  mainland details on suspected companies," he said.    An investigation by the SUNDAY HONGKONG STANDARD has  revealed  that Kingly Commodities, the brokerage firm which had its  licence revoked by the SFC in March last year, is operating in  Shenzhen under the name World Wide Forex. Last year, the SFC  revoked the licences of 10 individuals, suspended four others  and warned another 16.    Debt-collectors have also earned a bad name for widespread  fraud. Commercial Crime Bureau chief superintendent Neil McCabe  said: "We've had a number of cases where mainlanders have hired  a dodgy debt collector who then makes off with the money. The  debt collector shows up at the office of the Hong Kong company  and says 'give us the money'. The people they are dealing with  are fairly respectable and easily intimidated, so they pay." Mr  McCabe said although these criminals were one or two-man shows,  the amounts involved were sums of hundreds of thousands, or even  millions, of dollars.    Peter Kwok, a former forex trader, said most crooked  operators were doing business on the mainland. "They are  running the same kinds of scams they were running in Hong Kong.  There is a lot of interest in these companies on the mainland."    Inspector Tres Nielson, of the Commercial Crime Bureau, said  Chinese were not necessarily more gullible. "They are attracted  by any deal with a promise of a high return because they are  unable to invest in China," he said. "Any kind of investment  opportunity they will take."</p>

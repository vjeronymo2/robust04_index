			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / FT Ski Expedition: The pre-war experience Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are currently exploring the mountains of New Zealand Last time anyone told me not to be afraid was 10 years ago when an instructor, Daniel Hansjacob, was about to take me down my first couloir in Val d'Isere. This time it was Arthur Tschepp, a 67-year-old Serbo-Croat and he was reassuring us about the hair-raising drive (reminiscent of some of our journeys in the Andes and Himalayas) to Awakino, New Zealand, in his ancient Land Rover. Tschepp who learnt to ski on barrel staves in the hills above Zagreb (where he also diced with death with the trams by tobogganing in the streets using ice skates to steer) is patron of Awakino club field, with the smallest membership in New Zealand (200). He is also the latest member of New Zealand's One Ski In the Grave Club (open to 55-year-olds and over). The Land Rover, made in 1950 and brought from Britain to New Zealand in the 1970s by a visiting Maori, makes a noise like a tug-boat. 'It was perfectly all right until some hoodlums out possum shooting shot through the windscreen, and stole the carburettor, battery and drive shaft,' explained Tschepp. 'I managed to make a new drive shaft by cutting down an old one from a standard vanguard, and I cannibalised three carburettors to make a new one.' Arthur knows a thing or two about cannibals. He worked with them in Papua New Guinea in 1954, clearing up the havoc after 3,000 people were killed when Mount Leamington erupted. 'I can work with cannibals. They are much less difficult than some of today's teenagers.' By now we have reached the Awakino ski lodge. Even Tschepp admits it is basic. But he is such a gem we do not mind. It is so cold that Lucy and I climb into our borrowed sleeping bags still wearing our cold-weather Degre ski suits. Outside, in this rarefied atmosphere the stars sparkle like a million snow crystals. This, it occurs to me, is a skiing time warp. We are experiencing pre-war skiing: it is still happening today in New Zealand's club fields. On our bedroom wall is an account of a skiing trip by children from Otematata School. Choice highlights include: 'The ski instructors kissed us all goodnight (yuk])' and 'We all liked the times Mr Gulliver and Mr Gray fell over'. Lucy and I sympathised with Mr Gulliver and Mr Gray. We just could not get on with the 'nut-cracker' devices used to attach yourself to the tractor-driven rope tows. (There are four at Awakino: Access, Ridge, Main and Learners.) I suffered quite a nasty rope-burn during my first attempt, and when we both finally got to the top of the mountain, snow conditions were among the most difficult we had experienced in almost 200 ski resorts. It was the moment of truth for us as we started our tour of New Zealand's club fields. Like many of them, Awakino has no grooming. If we were clumsy in our attempts to get up, we were inglorious in our attempts to ski down. 'I guess this is just what it must have been like between the wars in the Alps,' I said to Lucy. 'I'm glad it's not like that any more,' she said.</p>

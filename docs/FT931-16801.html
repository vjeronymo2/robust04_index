			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Tokyo to relax tax rules for foreign importers THE JAPANESE government is almost certain to approve a change in tax regulations to provide increased incentives for foreign manufacturers exporting to Japan. After negotiations with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), the Ministry of Finance has agreed to relax controls on a controversial tax-break system introduced in 1990 to increase manufactured imports and reduce Japan's trade surplus. Under the present system, foreign manufacturers' distribution subsidiaries in Japan are classified for tax purposes as 'non-manufacturers,' as they are considered to be trading houses rather than producers. This denies them tax credits on imports. The EC and US lodged complaints about this classification system, which has allowed Honda Motor and other Japanese manufacturers to claim the tax credits, but has excluded European car and electronics makers which do not have factories in Japan. It is understood that the amendments will be presented to the parliament next month, and the finance ministry will advise that the changes should apply from April 1, the beginning of the 1993-94 fiscal year, and last for at least two years. A second important change is that the original legislation required foreign manufacturers to increase exports to Japan by at least 10 per cent year-on-year before becoming eligible for the tax credits, which are equivalent to 5 per cent of the value of the increase in exports. The finance ministry has agreed to lower the increase hurdle to 2 per cent, above which a rising scale of credits will apply up to the same maximum of 5 per cent. For non-manufacturers, the same scale will apply, allowing them to defer payment of 20 per cent of the tax due on the increased exports. Miti is pleased that the finance ministry has relented after three years of negotiation, as the system, intended to help foreign manufacturers, has instead created trade friction with Washington and Brussels. 'We have heard many complaints from companies like Philips and BMW, and we understood why they were unhappy,' a Miti official said. 'When we introduced the original tax breaks, we did not intend to discriminate against foreign companies, but it turned out that we needed to change the way we looked at tax collection,' he added. The ministry hopes that the reforms will be recognised by other governments as a sign that Japan is attempting to reduce its large and growing current account surplus, which was a record Dollars 106.2bn (Pounds 69bn) over the first 11 months of 1992. The previous record was Dollars 87bn during 1987.</p>

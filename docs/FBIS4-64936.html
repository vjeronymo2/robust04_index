			<p>BFN     [Text] Addressing the 10th meeting of the European Union  [EU] parliamentary committees in charge of European affairs,  Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou said that if Turkey  accepts the European principles Greece will be the first country  to help it join the EU. Papandreou said he hopes solutions will  be found soon to smooth Athens-Skopje relations.    In his address, the deputy foreign minister said the Turkish  Cypriot community should have pursued Cyprus' accession to the  EU. Referring to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM], Papandreou said it must be understood that it  is in Greece's national interest that Skopje survives. He  added, however, that Skopje must stop violating the CSCE  principles.    Chamber of Deputies President Apostolos Kaklamanis opened  the  conference and stressed: The continuing bloodshed in the former  Yugoslavia is another great challenge for all of us. He  specifically stressed the dangers facing the Balkans and greater  Europe. Kaklamanis concluded: You realize the additional  reasons that have caused concern for the Greek people and the  intense interest in restoring peace.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: 3i subscription rate implies good judgment Sir, In a somewhat odd article ('Exco issue more than three times subscribed', July 12), Simon Davies appears to be implying that Exco's new issue on Monday was very successful, because it 'was 3.2 times subscribed', whereas 3i's flotation last week was less successful, because it 'was only 1.1 times subscribed'. This point of view, apparently quite widely endorsed in recent newspaper comment, misunderstands the purpose of a flotation or rights issue, which is to gain maximum value for new shares issued for pre-issue shareholders of the company. Since a greater than three times subscription means that, almost inevitably, one third of those subscribing (all that was needed) would have been prepared to pay a higher price for the shares, we may deduce that the Exco offer was at least somewhat unsuccessful in getting top price for its shareholders. On the other hand, a 1.1 subscription rate implies that 3i and its advisers, far from being unsuccessful, judged nicely (even if possibly somewhat too finely) the highest price they could get. The reason financial advisers are paid so much by their clients in these transactions is because they are expected to judge well the highest price possible, commensurate with full take-up. So it is clear that, on the only objective evidence available, 3i and its advisers have done extremely well, and Exco and its advisers not so well, for those for whom this exercise was conducted - the pre-issue shareholders of those companies.

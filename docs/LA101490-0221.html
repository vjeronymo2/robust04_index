			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HOME SELLER WANTS TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT WILL COST IN  CLOSING FEES  </P> <P> QUESTION: We are in the process of selling our home and it is going to be real  close if we are to get enough cash to pay off our debts. In addition to the  real estate sales commission, is there any rule of thumb as to how much the  sales costs will be?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Everything is negotiable. For example, in many communities it is  customary for the home seller to pay the buyer's title insurance fee. However,  if you are short of cash, you can put in the offer that the buyer is to pay for  all title insurance. Of course, that would be risking loss of that buyer if he  refuses to pay.  </P> <P> As a general rule, home sellers should expect closing costs of about 2% of the  sales price, in addition to the real estate sales commission. Your real estate  agent can give you a more exact estimate of closing costs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Think Carefully Before Co-Signing a Mortgage  </P> <P> Q: Some very close friends want to buy their first home. But they don't have  quite enough income to qualify for a mortgage, since they are only making a 10%  down payment and need to get a 90% mortgage.  </P> <P> They asked us to co-sign on the mortgage. According to their real estate agent,  after we help our friends get their mortgage we can quitclaim our interest in  the house to them and not have any further liability. Is this true?  </P> <P> A: Not exactly. When you co-sign a mortgage, most mortgage lenders insist that  you also hold title to the house along with the other owners. However, the  lender cannot stop you from later quitclaiming your interest in the house. But  adverse consequences can still happen to you if the residents default on the  mortgage.  </P> <P> In the event the residents for whom you co-signed fail to make the payments,  you are almost certain to have the default entered on your credit report by the  credit bureaus, since you co-signed on the loan.  </P> <P> For your protection, since your friends will have little equity in the house,  if you co-sign, you should be certain the property alone is security for the  loan, so you will have no personal liability. Please think carefully about the  possible consequences of co-signing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Getting Deposit Back Can Be Difficult  </P> <P> Q: We made a $1,500 earnest-money deposit to buy a house. Then, through no  fault of hers, my wife lost her job due to cutbacks at her company. Her  prospects of finding a similar high-paying job are not very good. So I notified  the realtor to cancel the sale and refund our $1,500. But she refuses because,  she says, the seller won't refund our money. What can we do to get our money  back?  </P> <P> A: It sounds as if you breached your contract to buy the house. Just because  your wife lost her job doesn't make it impossible for you to buy the home.  Unless your purchase contract limits the seller's damages, called a liquidated  damages clause, the seller might even sue you for damages caused by your breach  of contract. For further details, please consult a local real estate attorney.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Getting the Right Agent Is Crucial  </P> <P> Q: Thank you for your suggestion several months ago of asking real estate  agents, before listing a home for sale, for a list of their recent home sales  and phoning the sellers to learn if they were satisfied. We interviewed four  local agents and were about to list our home for sale with the one we liked  best.  </P> <P> Then I remembered to ask for the names of his most recent home sellers. He  replied business had been a little slow recently and he hadn't sold a listing  since February. So we phoned our second favorite agent and she gladly gave us  details of her four most recent sales.  </P> <P> We called those sellers and they all gave her glowing recommendations. Within  two weeks of our listing with her, another agent with the same brokerage firm  produced a buyer. It was a pleasure working with these very professional agents  who got the sale closed in only about 30 days. Many thanks for the idea.  </P> <P> A: Selecting the right agent to list your home is a major part of selling it.  Even in today's slow buyer's market in many cities, the best agents are doing  very well because they know the successful techniques for getting homes sold.  </P> <P> For example, a few weeks ago I had lunch with one of my favorite real estate  agents. This young salesman, age 73, told me this year has been his best for  sales volume out of the 15 years he has been selling homes.  </P> <P> But not all his listings have sold. However, rather than reduce the asking  price on one troublesome listing, which he feels is fairly priced, he got the  seller to raise the sales commission to 8%, so the selling agent will earn 5%  and he will receive 3%. He feels this will ignite enthusiasm from cooperating  sales agents to get this "difficult home" sold.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No IRS Extension of Replacement Tax Rule  </P> <P> Q: My husband and I are in a bind concerning taxes on the home we sold in  April, 1989. We then bought land on which to build our dream home. But there  have been many construction delays. We hope to complete the home before our  two-year deadline next April. Is there any special IRS ruling concerning  extension of the reinvestment period when a new home is built? Do we need a  certificate of occupancy?  </P> <P> A: Sorry, the IRS cannot grant any extension of the 24-month principal  residence replacement period.  </P> <P> The law says you must buy and occupy the replacement home within 24 months  before or after the sale. It doesn't mention any certificate of occupancy, so  perhaps you might get away with camping out in your new home if it isn't  entirely completed by April, 1991. Please check with your tax adviser.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fixed-Rate Mortgages Are Better Deal Today  </P> <P> Q: We want to buy a home, but are undecided whether to get a fixed- or  adjustable-rate mortgage. I think interest rates will drop in the next few  months as the nation goes into a depression. But my wife thinks we should get a  fixed-rate mortgage just in case we have inflation and interest rates go up.  What do you advise?  </P> <P> A: Listen to your smart wife. The adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are almost  as expensive as fixed-rate mortgages. Compare the APR (annual percentage rate),  and you will discover the ARM and fixed-rate loans cost virtually the same  interest rate, after the initial ARM teaser rate for the first few months.  </P> <P> But mortgage lenders want to promote ARMs because these loans shift the  interest rate risk from lender to borrower. So the lenders make it easier to  qualify for an ARM than for a fixed-rate loan.  </P> <P> My advice is to take a fixed-rate mortgage. If interest rates decline  substantially, then you can refinance at the lower rate. But if your wife is  right and interest rates go up, then you will be protected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Be Sure Lease-Option Has Assignable Clause  </P> <P> Q: I like your advice to first-time home buyers who are short of cash to obtain  a lease with option to purchase. My son and his new wife are considering such a  lease-option on a house where the seller will give them a $450 per month rent  credit toward the down payment.  </P> <P> However, my son might be transferred by his employer. If he and his wife don't  exercise the purchase option, is there any way they can get that $450 per month  rent credit back?  </P> <P> A: I have never seen a lease-option where the rent credit is refundable to a  tenant who doesn't exercise the purchase option. However, in my lease-options I  always make the purchase option assignable, so the tenant can, if desired, sell  the purchase option and perhaps earn a little profit. Only one of my  lease-option tenants ever assigned their purchase option, but assignment is an  alternative to consider. Just be sure the option is assignable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Don't Hire Inspector Until Offer Accepted  </P> <P> Q: We are first-time home buyers who have been looking for at least a year at  homes for sale. Looking back, we now realize there are several homes (now sold)  that we should have bought.  </P> <P> But we are afraid something will be wrong with the house we buy and we will get  stuck with big repair bills. Another problem is we are worried we will pay too  much for the house. Any ideas how to overcome these problems?  </P> <P> A: Your first step is to make a written purchase offer to buy a home. Until you  have the home under purchase contract it is a waste of time to have the home  professionally inspected.  </P> <P> But before making your written purchase offer, to avoid offering too much for  the home, ask the real estate agent to prepare a written "comparative market  analysis."  </P> <P> This form shows recent sales prices of similar nearby homes, as well as asking  prices of comparable neighborhood houses. It is the same form which was  prepared for the home seller when the listing agent put the home on the market  for sale.  </P> <P> By adding and subtracting value for the pros and cons of the house under  consideration, you can make a purchase offer at or slightly below market value.  Remember, you can always come up in price, but you can never drop your offer  price after it is accepted.  </P> <P> In addition to customary inspections such as for termites, to protect yourself  against buying a home with unexpected defects you can take two steps.  </P> <P> The first is to put a contingency in your purchase offer conditioned on  approval of the seller's disclosure statement. This form, which your real  estate agent should have readily available (required in some states), asks the  seller to disclose all known defects. The realty agent also should sign it,  noting any defects the agent observed which the seller may have overlooked.  </P> <P> Your second step is to include in your purchase offer a contingency for your  approval of a professional inspection of the house. You get to choose and pay  for the inspector, such as a general contractor, and either approve or  disapprove the report. I highly recommend you accompany the inspector, so you  can see for yourself if a problem is major or minor.  </P> <P> By following these suggestions you can offer the right price and learn all the  home's defects before you purchase. However, please be aware no home is perfect  and surprises will sometimes happen.  </P> <P> For example, about a week after I bought my current home the water heater  developed a bad leak and had to be replaced. Fortunately, the seller and realty  agent had purchased a one-year home warranty policy for me, so I only had to  pay a $25 service fee to get a new water heater. You may want to insist on such  a warranty policy too.  </P> <P> Letters and comments to Robert J. Bruss, a San Francisco-area lawyer, author  and real estate broker, may be sent him at P.O.

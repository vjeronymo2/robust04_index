			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Companies renew attack on quality standard A FRESH ROW has flared up between groups representing small businesses and the British Standards Institution over the controversial management quality standard BS5750. The standard ensures that a company's management systems are effective so that sales orders are handled efficiently, raw materials and tooling are in the right place at the right time and any complaints are dealt with speedily. Small business organisations have complained that the standard is bureaucratic, costly and more suited to large companies. The simmering row between small-business groups such as the Federation of Small Businesses and the Forum of Private Business appeared to have been defused when the institution set up a joint committee in February to discuss BS5750. But it has flared again following a letter from Mr Vivian Thomas, BSI chairman, to Mr Roger Dunn, the committee's chairman, saying that the institution was not prepared to provide Pounds 150,000 to fund research into the problems surrounding BS5750. The funding had not been formally sanctioned, Mr Thomas wrote, and was the result of 'misunderstandings'. Mr Thomas said the committee should cease its activities by the end of November, although BSI might lend staff to help complete any initiatives which had been started. The issue is expected to come to a head at the next meeting of the committee on Wednesday. A telephone conference of committee members involved in the research project held last Friday considered withdrawing from the joint committee and carrying out an independent review. Mr Bernard Juby, representative on the committee of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'The clear brief we were given was that this was to be an ongoing review of all British standards and their impact on small business. We want an independent review of the problems and then we can advise BSI what to do - if anything. We are very anxious about the way things are going.' Mr Thomas said that BSI had supported programmes to increase awareness of BS5750 and had published details of its prices to show that much of the cost resulted from the fees of independent consultants advising companies. He added: 'But I don't believe in setting up a talking shop which goes on for ever and ever. If they don't come up with some robust suggestions by November we could be there for another 12 months.' BSI was not prepared to lower the requirements it set for BS5750 for small firms because this would be a betrayal of the 22,000 companies which were already registered, he added. BSI received between 15 and 20 letters of support for BS5750 for every one complaint, he said. BSI was also concerned that it had become the focus for criticism of BS5750 when there were 25 other companies with approval to certify companies to the standard and monitor compliance. They should also be involved in funding any research project, Mr Thomas said.</p>

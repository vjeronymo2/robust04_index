			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 The novel is not dead, nor even in trouble, despite what the rubbish-heads say. A highlight of my fictional year was Melanie Rae Thon's Iona Moon (Penguin, Pounds 5.99), about a farmer's girl in White Falls, Idaho, who smells of the byre and is generous with her favours, coming to terms with small-town life and its unforgiving righteousness. Thon's talent is reminiscent of Peter Carey's: distinctive, sharply lyrical and based on masterly characterisation. Also very good: Masai Dreaming, by Justin Cartwright (Picador, Pounds 5.99), a stunningly well-realised tale of a would-be movie scriptwriter researching the story of a young Frenchwoman, Claudia, who lived among the Masai before being sent from Paris, days before its liberation, to Auschwitz. Complex, sad, poetic. 'Whatever happens to me,' writes Claudia to the Masai in her last, unbearable message, 'I wish that you may have many cattle and plentiful green grass. And wherever God takes me I will dream of you.' Honourable near-miss, but memorable and enjoyable: Thomas Keneally's too-ambitious Jacko The Great Intruder (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 15.99), a tale of TV folk (monsters, all). This is Keneally's 22nd novel, and has enough material (New York, Sydney, the Northern Territory, fall of the Berlin Wall) to have succoured his 23rd and 24th ones as well. Here's to his 25th.</p>

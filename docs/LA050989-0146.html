			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> WILLIAMS AND WILSON EVOKE GALAXY OF STYLES  </P> <P> The Orange County Performing Arts Center's jazz singers series ended Sunday  with performances by two singers in varied styles.  </P> <P> The first, Joe Williams, is a storyteller who gets his point across with a  rich, meaningful tone. The second, Nancy Wilson, stretches a lyric with range  and emotion. Both brought excellent supporting units, and both paid tribute to  varied musical influences.  </P> <P> Williams' set used the blues as a touchstone, but the king-size vocalist also  showed his swing chops and a sincere, soothing way with a ballad. He paid  tribute to Bessie Smith, Jimmy Rushing, Duke Ellington and his old boss, Count  Basie, with a tone as thick as espresso, and just as eye-opening.  </P> <P> While his band loped through the easy walk of Miles Davis' "All Blues,"  Williams, dressed in white on white, went right into his theme, "Everyday I  Have the Blues," throwing in a little "C.C. Rider" for good measure.  </P> <P> From the beginning, it was apparent that he was not afraid to push his voice,  regardless of the consequences. This is a guy who likes to sing.  </P> <P> Up-tempo numbers such as "Alright" brought some gravel to his voice. "I Want a  Little Girl" found him coming on with an alley cat's purr and some Basie-brand  scat. And Bernard Ighner's "Same Ol' Story," a funky number with a slightly  disguised political message, had the Mercedes-Benz set squirming in its seats.  </P> <P> Williams kept the proceedings upbeat, but he was most impressive on ballads,  where he displayed a rich tremolo. His melancholy encore, "Here's to Life,"  included a line that seems to sum up his approach: "Give it all you've got."  </P> <P> He seemed to enjoy his backup band as much as the audience did, and he gave the  group plenty of credit. Drummer Gerry King moved easily from brushes to sticks  on "Everyday," getting a roll reminiscent of Art Blakey. Bassist Bob Badgley,  who played a vertical bass, plucked out crisp tones as clear and deep as those  of the vocalist he supported.  </P> <P> Williams' longtime associate, Norman Simmons, contributed tasteful keyboard  work, putting a Basie beat in "Alright, Okay, You Win" and soloing with  Ellington-like cool on "I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)."  </P> <P> Wilson's brief opener, "I Want to Be Happy," was a jazzy, quick-paced exercise  that left her little room for stylistic tricks. This straight-ahead number may  have been her best of the night: It was strong, fast and confident.  </P> <P> The rest of her program, a mix of standards and pop-oriented numbers from  recent albums, was designed to show off her varied techniques rather than the  smooth, sweet tones of her voice.  </P> <P> Wilson likes to build excitement with throaty growls, octave jumps and repeated  slides up and down the scale, often with her hands flailing away in front of  her face. She has a great sense of dynamics, often moving from whisper to  full-blown wail in a single line.  </P> <P> Her trio moved easily from acoustic to electric numbers, with bassist Jeff  Littleton showing authority on upright and a heavy thumb on bass guitar.  Drummer Roy McCurdy matched the singer's mood, be it low or loud, and showed  pleasing skills with the brushes. Llew Matthews worked both electronic and  acoustic keyboards to advantage, using clever runs to spice the singer's  cinnamon tones on a relaxed "Getting to Know You."  </P> <P> Wilson's most moving moment was her a cappella treatment of Roy Hamilton's "Ebb  Tide," a number that demonstrated her strength and range perfectly.  </P> <P> The only drawback was the number of newer pieces that ended with loud, grand  upbeat choruses that eventually became indistinguishable from each other. It's  to Wilson's credit that she did not allow the electric cacophony to bury her  voice.  </P> <P> Earlier in the evening, Williams introduced "Embraceable You" as a number that  should be remembered "in case singing ever comes back." With voices like these  around, singing will never go away.  </P></p>

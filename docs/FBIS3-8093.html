Immediately on landing, President Lech Walesa,  his wife, and the members of the Polish Government delegation  went to the residence in Rashtrapati (presidential palace).    The official part of the visit began on Thursday [3 March]  at  0900 in the courtyard of the Rashtrapati palace, built in 1929  for the viceroy of the British Crown. The building, which has  240 rooms, is now the residence of the Indian president and  houses the chancellery and the office of the government. The  Polish delegation was greeted by President Shankar Dayal Sharma  and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao.    President Walesa announced that Polish-Indian relations need  to become more dynamic.    Next, the Polish delegation went to Radzghat, the place  where  the body of Mahatma Gandhi was cremated; Gandhi was murdered on  30 January 1948, less than a year after India proclaimed its  independence. In line with the tradition, Lech Walesa placed a  wreath on the memorial plate in the mausoleum and planted a tree  in the garden nearby.    Afterward, he met with President Sharma in the Rashtrapati  Palace. The presidents discussed, among other things,  similarities in striving for independence of Poland and India.  Sharma compared Poland's "Solidarity" period to the period when  India fought for independence. Walesa stressed that Mahatma  Gandhi was a model for Poles to follow in achieving political  aims without resorting to force.    President Walesa also met with a group of Indian Parliament  deputies, during which both parties discussed economic  development. The president also familiarized himself with the  system of legislative powers in India, which was based on the  British model, but adjusted to Indian reality.    On Thursday, talks were held also by Polish Foreign Affairs  Minister Andrzej Olechowski and his Indian counterpart, Dinesh  Siagh.    During a party given in honor of the Polish guests by the  Indian president, Lech Walesa stated that there are great  possibilities for increasing trade cooperation, which, in recent  years, has plummeted to a level that does not correspond to the  potential and interests of both states.    The visit of the president of the Polish Republic to India  aroused considerable interest in Indian business circles. The 3  March issue of THE TIMES OF INDIA, the largest Indian daily,  published a report on the situation and economic reforms in  Poland, sponsored by companies interested in trade contacts with  our country. Under the headline "Welcome His Excellency Lech  Walesa and Danuta Walesa," the companies included their offers.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS DOWN 90%  </P> <P> Surging imports pushed Japan's trade surplus down 90% in January, its sharpest  decline in five years, but the gap with the United States showed less dramatic  improvement.  </P> <P> January's customs-cleared trade surplus fell to just $340 million from $3.25  billion a year ago, the Finance Ministry reported today.  </P> <P> The decline marks the ninth straight monthly narrowing of the surplus.  </P> <P> "This is probably an exaggeration of the trend but it shows the progress Japan  is making in cutting the surplus," said Hidehiro Iwaki, economist at Nomura  Research Institute.  </P> <P> Exports shrank 3.8% -- the fourth consecutive monthly decline -- largely due to  weak domestic demand in the United States and Europe.  </P> <P> Imports climbed 13.4% mainly on the back of hefty increases in crude oil  prices.  </P> <P> The improvement in the surplus with the United States was less impressive than  the overall figure. The gap with the United States fell 25.9% to $2.20 billion  from $2.97 billion a year earlier.  </P></p>

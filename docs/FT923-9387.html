			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / LSE's County Hall bid attacked: Owner-body urges government to reject 'highly speculative' Pounds 65m offer CONTROVERSY surrounding the bid by the London School of Economics to move to County Hall grew yesterday when the London Residuary Body publicly urged the government to reject the bid out of hand. The LRB, which owns the site on behalf of the boroughs comprising the former Greater London Council, is adamant that its original decision to sell the site to Shirayama, the Japanese developer, was right. It dismissed the LSE bid as 'highly speculative and not worth serious consideration'. The LRB argues that the LSE's offer, made last week, does not even meet the university's own agreement with Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, that it would submit an 'unconditional bid'. 'The LSE offer is conditional on the completion of the sale of their present Houghton Street premises at a highly speculative value in three years' time and on receiving clearance from the Universities Funding Council,' it said. The LRB's decision to go public in such forthright terms reflects the frustration of Sir Godfrey Taylor, its chairman. The government, which has reserve powers over the sale, changed its mind after the general election to allow the LSE to bid for County Hall, although the university's desire to move to the site from its cramped campus off Aldwych had been known for months before the decision to sell to Shirayama. Shirayama's Pounds 60m contract is only for the riverside building, facing the Houses of Parliament, which it wants to develop as a hotel. The LSE is offering Pounds 65m for the whole County Hall site, less than half of which is occupied by the building. The LRB believes it could secure 'well in excess' of that sum for the entire site. Sir Godfrey is advising Mr Howard not only to reject the LSE bid, but to remove the clause in the Shirayama contract giving the government until the end of the year to withdraw from the agreement. 'We want to remove the get-out clause so that Shirayama can get on with their planning application for the hotel conversion and we can get on with finding a buyer for the rest of the site', he said. The Environment Department said Mr Howard would study the LRB's advice 'with care'. Observer, Page 13</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The imminent establishment of diplomatic relations  between Bamako and Pretoria was confirmed yesterday by President  Alpha Oumar Konare. He did this upon his return in the early  evening from South Africa, where he took part in President  Mandela's inauguration ceremony. Speaking to our special envoy,  Souleiman Kantara Cissoko, the head of state stressed, above  all, the special character of the event:    [Begin Konare recording] It was a grand and historic event.  It was the advent of a new state -- a great African state in  terms of its demographic weight, economic power, strategic  situation, and human resources.    The advent of a new, multiracial, and democratic South  African Republic is an incontestable sign of democratic progress  on our continent. I think that nothing will be as before in  Africa. I consider this a new chance offered our continent, so  as to assume its responsibilities and become more respected.  During our stay, we felt the determination of the people and  leaders of South Africa. You know that our people have always  been on the side of the South African democrats. It is normal  for us to be with them today in the construction of a new,  united, and plural Africa. You know also that this is the  choice made by Malian democrats. The government has clearly  indicated in a declaration that henceforth, nothing stands in  the way of the establishment of diplomatic relations between  Mali and South Africa. Today, we shall do everything possible  to make this a reality, especially with the accession of Mandela  to the presidency of South Africa. [end recording]</p>

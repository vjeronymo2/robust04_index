			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PLATINUM led a sharp downturn in the precious metal market yesterday. The white metal surrendered Dollars 7.25 of the Dollars 12 rise registered earlier in the week to reach Dollars 355.25 a troy ounce at the afternoon fixing. Dealers said the rally, based on reduced fears of heavy Soviet shipments and more hopeful US economic indicators, had been overdone. They also suggested that Japanese investors had sold platinum to cover equity market losses. The London bullion market GOLD price touched Dollars 339.25 an ounce before closing Dollars 3.10 down on the day at Dollars 340.90 an ounce. But traders were predicting that the market would soon be re-testing support at Dollars 339 an ounce and might then move back towards the recent six-year low. 'Gold doesn't look good and Comex has tried to push it, but if they think Europe is short they are very, very wrong,' one dealer said. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices fell back from early highs to finish little changed on the day. Dealers said the run-up in copper prices was halted by news that Zambian railway workers had called off their strike. Three months NICKEL met selling and liquidation above the Dollars 7,500 level.

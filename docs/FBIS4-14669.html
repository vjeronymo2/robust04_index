			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] A B-29 bomber, the famous American World War II  aircraft better known as the Flying Fortress, has been found in  the Ussuri tayga. It was found in dense forest by pilots of the  Russian Dalaero company. How it got there remains a mystery,  although long-time local residents recall that during the  forties there were rumors going around the Far East that an  American aircraft, crippled by Samurai [Japanese] fighters over  the Sea of Japan, had made an attempt to reach an airfield in  Maritime Kray but crashed in the tayga.    According to Vladimir Safronov, Dalaero director, the  sensational find was no coincidence. One of the spheres of  activity of the multifaceted Dalaero Scientific Production  Association [SPA] is the search for various objects abandoned or  lost in the vast tayga. During several expeditions the aviators  have found a Soviet DB-3 long-range bomber; several An-2, a  Yak-13, and a Yak-18E aircraft; a Mi-1, a Mi-2, and a Mi-8T  helicopter, and two tractors dating to the beginning of the  century. One of the tractors was built in 1903.    All of this equipment will be restored and displayed in a  museum which the Dalaero SPA enthusiasts plan to open.</p>

After </F> Nalchik Everything Is Back to the Way It Was"]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has kept his  promise: An edict was published concerning organizing the return  of Ingush refugees to four villages of Prigorodnyy Rayon of  North Ossetia. But observers are noting with alarm that this has  not brought the long-awaited peace to the Northern Caucasus.    As we know, the edict was adopted while developing the  agreements reached on 7 September in Nalchik when a declaration  was signed which envisions Ingushetia's abandoning its  territorial claims to North Ossetia, removing the thesis about  the impossibility of Ossetians and Ingush living together,  disbanding illegal armed formations, returning refugees to  densely populated places, and "sealing off" the border between  Russia and Chechnya. But as early as the next day the parliament  of North Ossetia, under pressure from a rally of many thousands  in the central square of Vladikavkaz, adopted a decree that  actually disavows the results of the meeting in Nalchik.  Justifying himself to the deputies, the head of the Supreme  Soviet of North Ossetia, Akhsarbek Galazov, admitted that he had  agreed to a partial return of the Ingush refugees under pressure  from Boris Yeltsin. He himself, as before, considers this  measure to be an illegal act that creates an impasse situation.    In turn, the president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, never  tires of saying that he signed no documents in Nalchik, that the  land from which the Ingush--citizens of North Ossetia--were  deported has been Ingush territory for centuries, and that their  return to Ingushetia is just a matter of time.    One statement after the other, the discussion among the  leaders of the two republics has returned to its former tracks,  assuming its previous tonality. For example, a couple of days  ago Ruslan Aushev again accused the Ossetians of murdering the  head of the temporary administration of the emergency region,  Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Viktor  Polyanichko. According to information from the president of  Ingushetia, on 1 August Viktor Polyanichko went to the village  of Tarskoye for negotiations with the commander of the Ossetian  home guard, Bibo Dzutsev, in order to discuss with him the  details of returning to the Russians the weapons of the Russian  special forces that were seized by the Ingush in the  Dzheyrakhskoye Ravine. Polyanichko was to have reached an  agreement with Dzutsev not to intervene in the transfer of the  weapons. This partially explains why Polyanichko did not have  the proper guard--Bibo Dzutsev is in practically complete  control of the actions of the fighting men in the region and  enjoys respect in North Ossetia. Dzutsev, incidentally, turned  up at the scene of the tragedy 10 minutes after the murder of  Polyanichko and Koretskiy. Aushev thinks that the terrorists  were urged on by the fact that on 2 August Polyanichko was to  have been working on determining four population points of  Prigorodnyy Rayon to which the Ingush would be returned.    According to a different version, Viktor Polyanichko was  going to negotiations with the Ingush field commanders who had  seized the weapons from the Russian special forces. A day before  this Ruslan Aushev had told Polyanichko that the weapons would  be returned but it would be necessary to pay 40 million rubles  for them. Aushev asserts that he was prepared to forward this  money himself and Polyanichko would then return this sum after  the weapons had been turned over. On the morning of the murder  Aushev again spoke with General Anatoliy Koretskiy and again  offered his services for immediately buying the weapons. But the  temporary administration thought that the price of the purchase  could be considerably reduced and therefore Polyanichko went to  the village of Tarskoye to negotiate the price of the purchase  with the Ingush field commanders and the head of the  Dzheyrakhskiy rural soviet, Tsurov.    In addition to this one there are several other versions of  the murder of Viktor Polyanichko and General Anatoliy Koretskiy.  The Russian investigatory group, in spite of the optimistic  statements of certain of its members and the sworn promises of  Sergey Shakhray, has still made no progress in investigating the  terrorist act against the deputy prime minister of the Russian  Federation.    The situation in South Ossetia has also unexpectedly become  much worse. Not far from Tskhinval a Niva truck was blown up by  a mine and another light vehicle following it was fired upon  with an automatic weapon. In the vehicle were Georgian peasants  from villages of the Tamarashenskiy corridor: Two were killed on  the spot and four more, according to Georgian information, are  missing. The next day this report was confirmed by the press  center of the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs, which also  announced that in Gori there was a meeting of representatives of  the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia and the Ministry of  Defense of South Ossetia at which they discussed the extremely  dangerous aggravation of the situation in the region.    Observers think that the attack on the Georgian vehicles  near  Tskhinval was organized in response to the murder of the four  Ossetians several days earlier. Recently in a number of Georgian  villages of South Ossetia, especially Tamarashen, Kekhvi,  Achabeti, Nikozi, Ergneti, and Eredvi, there has been tension,  and active military preparations have been underway. The  Ossetians are expressing concern not only about the mobilization  activity of Georgia but also the inaction of the peacekeeping  forces and military command. The Ossetians have been forced to  "fill out" their own defense in spite of the fact that recently,  as a result of internal feuds and disagreements, the political  situation in South Ossetia has been considerably weakened.</p>

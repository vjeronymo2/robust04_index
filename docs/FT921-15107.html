			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / British Gas fights to avoid inquiry: Company at odds with OFT over deal to reduce its industrial market share BRITISH Gas was last night fighting a desperate rearguard action against the threat of a far-reaching investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into its dominance of the industrial gas market. The company appeared to soften its position on an agreement it reached with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) late last month to halve its share of the industrial gas market by 1995. However the two sides remained at loggerheads after British Gas revised its conditions for accepting the deal, which includes hiving off its pipeline division. The OFT has told British Gas that the Commission will launch an inquiry into the company unless it agrees to the deal without conditions. The OFT has given the company until next Thursday to agree to the deal, which was due to be concluded yesterday. The deadline was extended because Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, is abroad. The row is rapidly becoming the most acrimonious dispute yet between a privatised utility and the regulatory and competition authorities. It has brought British Gas into sharp conflict with not just the OFT but also Ofgas, its regulator, and the government. British Gas has backed down from its earlier insistence that it would have to raise domestic prices to offset the impact of the OFT's proposals for the industrial gas market. However the company said it would only abide by the deal if the MMC arbitrated in potential disputes over pricing with Ofgas. This proposal seems certain to worsen the company's already stormy relations with Ofgas which rejected it as unacceptable. Mr Malcolm Keay, deputy director general of Ofgas, said: 'There is no legal basis for the MMC to act as final adjudicator.' British Gas is still pressing for a review of a tough new pricing formula which Ofgas is due to introduce in April. The company betrayed its deep mistrust of its regulator by calling for the MMC to arbitrate in any disputes created by such a review. British Gas said this would ensure fair play in any dispute. But the OFT is unhappy with the attachment of any conditions to its agreement with British Gas. Talks between the company and the OFT will continue next week and British Gas remains optimistic. Mr Cedric Brown, senior managing director, said: 'We are within a whisker of reaching agreement, but also within a whisker of an MMC inquiry.'</p>

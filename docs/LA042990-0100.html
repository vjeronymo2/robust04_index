			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AL DAVIS IS MASTER OF THE ROAD SHOW  </P> <P> Perhaps the best of all schemes to find a home for the Raiders of the National  Football League came recently from a Los Angeles architect, Herb McLaughlin,  who suggested that team owner Al Davis build a floating stadium and take it up  and down the Pacific Coast, collecting tribute from dozens of cities instead of  the mere three or four he has been negotiating with lately.  </P> <P> With outraged citizens having just spiked a $486 million deal to return the  team to its original home in Oakland and with officials in Sacramento, Los  Angeles (the team's current host) and other cities grumbling about the Raiders'  hard-eyed negotiating tactics, one might think the Raiders owner would be  feeling a little low. But McLaughlin, who helpfully provided a sketch of his  idea to the Los Angeles Times op-ed page, appreciates Davis's indefatigable  capacity for thinking big.  </P> <P> "The National Football League talks of expanding the game to Europe and Japan,"  the architect noted. "The stadium could motor on over to Osaka for a game or  two in August, then load up with Toyotas to be dropped off in Hawaii."  </P> <P> The image of a floating stadium -- easy to turn so Raiders receivers would  never have the sun in their eyes -- captures the spirit of Edward Everett  Hale's story of Philip Nolan in "The Man Without a Country." In the novel,  Nolan is sentenced for treason and condemned to roam the seas with no contact  with the America he discovers -- too late -- he loves. Davis's search for a  city and stadium full of adoring fans is a much less romantic tale, revealing  more about modern sports financing and civic promotion than old-fashioned  concepts such as loyalty and community, but at this bizarre juncture there are  some loose similarities.  </P> <P> Like the naval officers who came to pity and admire the traitor Nolan for his  late-blooming patriotism, the city of Oakland swallowed the pain of Davis's  1982 betrayal, when he moved the team to Los Angeles, and spent months crafting  a deal to bring him back. Davis has never asked for love and affection, only  for as much money and support as possible to provide a stadium that would  attract free-spending fans whose dollars would buy the linebackers, offensive  tackles and particularly the elusive superstar quarterback needed to win  another Super Bowl.  </P> <P> Last month, Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson thought he had arranged for the team to  return in exchange for a city and county guarantee of $660 million in ticket  sales over 15 years.  </P> <P> Then, in the midst of a difficult re-election campaign, Wilson began to hear  not just from fans, many of whom did not live in Oakland, but from voters. At  the hearing where the deal initially was approved by the city council, some  Oakland residents referred to Davis as "the embodiment of greed." Editorial  cartoons questioned the risk to taxpayer dollars at a time of huge expenses  following last year's earthquake.  </P> <P> A citizen's group collected 33,189 petition signatures for a referendum on the  deal, effectively dooming the agreement since the Raiders said they would back  out if the issue went on the ballot.  </P> <P> Wilson reversed himself and said he no longer supported the deal, even with the  reduced $486 million guarantee he had hoped would assuage the critics. But his  press secretary, Carol McArthur, said the mayor remains full of hope of a  Raiders return. He has begun to negotiate a new deal, she said, "and the  Raiders are very receptive to that and very interested in coming to Oakland  still."  </P> <P> In all such matters, one has to take the city's word for it. Davis and the  Raiders have declined all comment on their wandering affections. They will not  say what their intentions are toward the several communities they have dealt  with in the past three years. "We decided if we addressed all the details of  that," said Raiders executive assistant Al LoCasale, "we wouldn't get any work  done."  </P> <P> There have been suggestions Davis has tired once again of Oakland's cranky  inconsistencies, and is thinking more seriously about Los Angeles' latest  efforts to keep him here. "I want to ensure Los Angeles continues to have a  professional football team," said Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley last week after  a round of talks over renovation of the Coliseum. "Six weeks ago, many thought  the odds were in favor of the Raiders moving to Oakland. I said it's not over  until it's over," a lesson most who have dealt with Davis now have engraved on  their hearts.  </P> <P> One of the more pitiful stories is of the city of Irwindale, a small community  northeast of Los Angeles that thought it could turn one of its barren rock  quarries next to Interstate 210 into a stadium that would bring the Raiders,  fans, wealth and fortune. It handed Davis a $10 million non-refundable deposit  as a sign of its good faith in promising to help build the facility, then  watched in horror as the deal fell through.  </P> <P> Next came Sacramento, the booming state capital, which had a stadium under  construction as part of an ambitious effort to attract a major-league baseball  team. City planners said a football team would bring $1.3 billion in economic  growth over 20 years, so the city agreed to give the Raiders $50 million, the  first payment due after the first Sacramento home game, if the team stayed for  20 years in a privately financed stadium.  </P> <P> There was, city spokeswoman Christine Olsen explained, "what we lovingly called  a drop-dead clause in the offer." If the Raiders did not accept by March 1, the  deal was off. Davis was in feverish negotiations with Oakland by then and let  the deadline pass. Olsen said Sacramento still is interested in having a  football team, but if the Raiders reopen talks, "that will be a different  situation."  </P> <P> Spokespersons for Los Angeles, Oakland and Sacramento have had no public  complaints about Davis's behavior in this endless tag-team match of lawyers and  accountants. The owner's refusal to make public comments has probably eased his  dealings with publicity-conscious, hypersensitive mayors and council members,  and with the local business groups leading some of the negotiations.  </P> <P> But relations between cities have suffered. The potential for bitter conflict  was clear in the recent San Francisco grand-jury indictment of Sacramento  developer Gregg Luckenbill, a prime mover in the negotiations with the Raiders,  and others for alleged misdemeanor conspiracy. They are charged with  circumventing campaign-reporting laws in helping defeat an initiative for a new  San Francisco baseball stadium that might have hurt Sacramento's efforts to get  a team.  </P> <P> Oakland and Alameda County officials also spoke acidly of Rich Milner, chief of  staff for Assemblyman Mike Roos, D-Los Angeles, who was critical of the  financial deal they were offering Davis. Milner told the San Francisco Examiner  "if their 15-year scenario doesn't work out, they're going to end up in debt  after 15 years, having to pay on those bonds for another 15 years with no  guarantee that the Raiders are going to stay." Alameda County supervisor Mary  King, noting Roos's Los Angeles constituency, called the remarks "totally and  completely biased."  </P> <P> Legislators from the rest of the state have been just as quick to declare  support for a bill that would require a county vote before Los Angeles made  major alterations in the Coliseum, a significant hurdle to any effort to  persuade Davis to stay here.  </P> <P> Last week the Coliseum's private operators told Bradley that any remodeling  would maintain the famous peristyle known to viewers of the 1932 and 1984  Olympics and be "consistent with the historic and architectural significance of  the structure."  </P> <P> How this affects Davis' efforts to arrange construction of new luxury boxes and  other improvements in a lease that expires after the 1991 season remains  unclear. Alisa Spilman, spokeswoman for the Coliseum and Sports Arena, said she  cannot comment on the negotiations. Bradley said he would be in touch with  Davis, but has provided no clue to the owner's thinking.  </P> <P> The tumult in Oakland has warned eager suitors that a deal with Davis has its  political drawbacks. Those who know the Raiders owner say he is a man full of  warmth and loyalty, doing only what is best for his team, but there are many  disenchanted spectators and taxpayers along the California coast who cringe at  the thought of his floating into town and might agree with Sir Walter Scott:  </P> <P>  "High though his titles, proud his name,  </P> <P>  Boundless his wealth and wish can claim,  </P> <P>  Despite these title, power, and pelf,  </P> <P>  The wretch, concentred all in self."  </P></p>

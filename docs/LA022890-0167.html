			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> KIRK DOUGLAS IRKS HOMETOWN  </P> <P> A former mayor says he rues the day he dedicated a city park in the name of  Kirk Douglas, who described Amsterdam as a "dirty mill town" in his 1988  autobiography.  </P> <P> "I will go to my grave regretting my part in putting a park in his honor here,"  said Mario Villa, a city ward supervisor.  </P> <P> Kirk Douglas Park was dedicated in a 1985 ceremony attended by Douglas and  thousands of well-wishers, including Villa, then mayor.  </P> <P> In "The Ragman's Son," Douglas says his neighbors in the town near Albany  discriminated against him when he was growing up here because he was the son of  poor Russian Jewish immigrants. Douglas claimed that he was beaten and denied  jobs because he is Jewish.  </P> <P> Villa said the claims of discrimination were false, and he decried Douglas as  "nothing but a hollow, phony individual" with little concern for his hometown.  </P> <P> Douglas' book already had drawn criticism from residents of this town of  22,000. In a letter recently to The Recorder, the daily newspaper in Amsterdam,  Douglas refused to retract anything he wrote.  </P></p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Sihanouk to return home for election PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian leader and former monarch who has been criticised for living abroad during the implementation of a United Nations-sponsored peace plan, announced yesterday that he would return to Cambodia from his home in Beijing for the general election due to begin on Sunday. 'I will be near my beloved and respected Cambodian people,' he said in a statement. Among those who have urged him to return to Cambodia to support the election are Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, and President Francois Mitterrand of France. Prince Sihanouk's associates say he has remained in Beijing partly for medical treatment and partly because he wants to save his political ammunition for the period of confusion which is likely to follow the election. He says he will do his best to reconcile Cambodia's warring factions in a coalition government; he, his family and his staff will not vote 'because we have to show our strict neutrality'. Fighting continued in various parts of the country yesterday between the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge, which has vowed to disrupt the election after withdrawing from a 1991 peace agreement. A Cambodian working for the International Rice Research Institute was killed on the road from Phnom Penh to Kompong Cham when his vehicle was ambushed on Wednesday. There were also renewed outbreaks of political violence ahead of next week's election. The UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) said a member of the royalist party Funcinpec was allegedly shot dead in his house by government soldiers. Troops were also accused of killing two members of another political party called Molinaka. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the Untac chief, yesterday described the election campaign as a 'great success'. He said that even if the highest standards of mature democracies were not met, the voting would 'certainly be the freest and fairest elections in Cambodia's recent history'. Mr Akashi said he would declare on May 28, the last day of voting, whether he considered the conduct of the election to have been free and fair. Ballot despite the bullets, Page 20</p>

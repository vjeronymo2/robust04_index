The two sides have not reached a full agreement on access to  all seven declared nuclear facilities, they said. The tentative  agreement now is to wrap up the working-level negotiations next  month and leave the details to talks between North Korea and the  IAEA.    According to State Department spokesman David Johnson, the  talks are closing in on the goal and there will be another  contact with North Korea soon.    While Johnson reaffirmed that North Korea would have to  allow  unrestricted inspection of all seven facilities, sources said  that though Pyongyang suggested willingness to grant something  close to a full inspection it certainly did not clearly agree to  routine inspections.    One source said the situation resembles a half-filled cup:  Some will say it's half full, and others will say it's half  empty.    Washington negotiators decided that this is close enough to  an agreement for unlimited inspection and accepted the North  Korean proposal to settle the details directly with the IAEA,  according to the sources.    In their most recent contact, on Wednesday, the United  States  and North Korea discussed where North Korea and the IAEA would  meet and North Korea proposed Pyongyang.    U.S. officials opposed the idea because they would rather  see  an IAEA inspection go into North Korea after an agreement is  clearly reached, the sources said.    Washington may agree to announce another round of high-level  talks with Pyongyang and suspension of the South Korea-U.S.  annual military maneuver "Team Spirit" once an IAEA inspection  team arrives in Pyongyang and inter-Korean dialogue resumes,  they said.    A roughly drawn timetable includes more working-level talks  in early January, North Korea-IAEA negotiations in mid-January,  an IAEA team's arrival in North Korea and inter-Korean dialogue  in late January, and high-level North Korea-U.S. talks sometime  in February, the sources said.</p>

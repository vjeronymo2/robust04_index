			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ NEGOTIATIONS  </P> <P> Baker and others explain that their disagreement with former high military and  government officials about the Iraqi situation is due to those former  officials' lack of current detailed knowledge which he and a few other  Administration officials possess.  </P> <P> I suggest a straightforward way for the Administration to test this idea -- and  convince many doubting citizens that our present course is the correct one.  </P> <P> Let Baker, (Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman) Colin Powell, (Secretary of  Defense) Dick Cheney and (national security adviser) Brent Scowcroft meet  privately with these former officials and bring them up to date on the latest  information. Then the now well-informed dissenters can again go before the  congressional committees and correct their previous statements.  </P> <P> GENE BARMORE  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

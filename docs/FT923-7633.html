			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Management: More than your job's worth IF YOU could have your time again, would you choose to struggle up the same ladder? Some 40 per cent of British managers are not so sure, reckoning that the costs in terms of lost free time are so high that it is not worth it. Indeed, only 3 per cent of executives feel that on the way to the top, they have not made any sacrifices at all. The survey, carried out by Robert Half, the recruitment consultants, shows that many managers also fear that their work is having a nasty effect on their personalities: it is making them less likeable, ruining their relationships at work, and getting in the way of their friendships. Above all it is damaging their home life - one in five reckon the effect is serious. Has the problem always been this bad, the difference being that only now managers are happy to talk about it? To judge by the survey, the pressures do seem to be increasing. It seems that the move to cut out several hundred thousand middle managers in the UK has served to increase the pressure on those that remain. Many of those who took part in the survey noted that their workloads had increased, and were continuing to do so. Furthermore, almost half had felt that their jobs could be next to go. Apparently, managers realise they are not alone in their suffering. On average, they estimate that 70 per cent of executives in their organisations are also victims of stress, a problem made worse by recent waves of redundancies. The most common signs are bad temper and irritability, although the symptoms identified ranged from nervous breakdowns and heart attacks at one extreme to rattling change and clicking teeth at the other. The survey suggests that rather than tackling managers' problems through changes in work patterns, many companies are instead concentrating on treating the symptoms. Consequently, the management of stress is becoming big business. One executive said that following two nervous breakdowns among managers at his company, a special agency dealing with stress and its problems had been taken on, and executives who seemed to be bending under the stress were being sent off to private clinics for a rest cure.</p>

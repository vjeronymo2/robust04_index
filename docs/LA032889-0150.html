			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEAMS TRIM ROSTERS;  </P> <P> TIGERS  </P> <P> The Detroit Tigers reduced their roster to 28 players by asking waivers on  veteran outfielder Dwayne Murphy for the purpose of giving him his  unconditional release.  </P> <P> Murphy, 34, batted .300 (9 for 30) this spring with three home runs and five  RBIs.  </P> <P> Tigers Manager Sparky Anderson said at the start of spring training that  Murphy, who played for the Oakland A's through most of the 1980s, would be  platooned this season with Gary Pettis in center field and also possibly be the  lead-off hitter.  </P> <P> "He can still hit but he doesn't run as well as he used to nor throw as well,"  Anderson said Monday. "And we can't afford the luxury of a part-time DH and  pinch-hitter.  </P> <P> "He'll still hit 20 home runs for somebody if he hits enough."  </P> <P> Murphy, hit .250 in 49 games last year with Detroit.  </P></p>

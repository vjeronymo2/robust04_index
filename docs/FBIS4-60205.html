			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kuwait, 23 May (KUNA) -- Radio Sanaa has  reported that northern troops have managed to control Shabwah  Governorate and its districts which are rich with oil and that  they are advancing to the southern part, which declared  secession from Yemen last Saturday. Radio Sanaa, which is  received here, quoted a military source as saying that the  northern troops in the eastern Shabwah axis have captured the  military base and the central axis command headquarters in the  city of 'Ataq, the capital of the province, with all its  districts and all its military installations. These reports,  which are considered an important development that would deprive  the southern part of its important military and economic  resources, have not been confirmed. [passage omitted]    The military source said that northern troops have seized a  large quantity of weapons, ammunition, and military depots in  Shabwah Governorate. [passage omitted]    A southern military spokesman today denied reports that  'Ataq  military base, the capital of Shabwah Province, has fallen to  northern forces. Aden radio, received here, quoted the  spokesman as saying that northern troops are not in control of  Shabwah Province, and that the news announced by Sanaa is  totally unfounded.

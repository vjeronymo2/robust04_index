			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department,  has said that there is nothing called a Cairo document, a  document the Israelis demanded be a basis for resuming  negotiations. He described the Israelis as liars and said: I  know and Egypt knows that the Israelis presented forged maps  during the Taba talks.    Qaddumi noted that one of the reasons he expressed  reservations over the Declaration of Principle is his confidence  that Israel would not carry out its promises, as he put it.    Qaddumi was talking to reporters upon arrival in Cairo last  night. Qaddumi will meet with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today  and then leave for Amman tomorrow to resume coordination with  Jordan in view of King Husayn's statement in which he clearly  voiced resentment over the absence of serious coordination.    Within this context, Qaddumi regarded talk about a  Jordanian-Palestinian confederation to be premature. Discussing  this at present would complicate matters, as he put it.    It is worth mentioning that King Husayn has recently said  that he has asked Yasir 'Arafat to drop the word confederation  from his lexicon.</p>

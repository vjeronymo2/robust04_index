			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Palestinian businessmen eye opportunity While Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, struggles to secure promised aid in support of his self-rule agreement, wealthy Palestinians in the diaspora have mobilised hundreds of millions of dollars for private investment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, writes James Whittington in Amman. The vehicle for investment is the newly-established Palestine Development and Investment Company (PDI) which is registered as an off-shore holding company in Liberia and has a paid-up capital of Dollars 200m (Pounds 131.5m). The board of directors reads like a Who's Who of successful Palestinian family businesses. It includes representatives from the Shoman family, which controls the Arab Bank, the son of Mr Said Khouri, joint owner of the construction company CCC (Consolidated Contracting Company), and Mr Kamal Shair, head of Dar al Handasah, one of the world's leading consultancy firms in engineering and urban development. These businessmen, and others, have put their money behind the PLO's peace agreement with Israel in the belief that it will eventually lead to a regional peace settlement. 'We have assumed a scenario of comprehensive peace where there will be free and open trade. Jordan and the West Bank will form a common market and then a federation, and Palestinians will have self-determination,' explained Mr Shair, who is the holding company's chairman. The head office is in Amman and operating companies are soon to be established in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Feasibility studies have identified five main areas of investment which will each be managed by one of the operating companies. These are tourism, financial services and investment banking, light industry, agriculture and construction. Mr Shair said he hoped the combined capital of the operating companies, which should attract equity investment from Palestinians inside the territories, plus borrowing on international capital markets, will enable PDI to lever its Dollars 200m to up to Dollars 1bn over the next five years. Corporate strategy will focus on high quality export-oriented goods and services. 'The Palestinians have a comparative advantage in terms of low wages. Labour intensive industries such as (manufacturing) leather and household goods and agriculture will be profit-making if we aim at high quality production. We will help the people inside to market their goods not only regionally but also in Europe like the Israelis do,' Mr Shair said. In construction the operating company will seek profits by building middle/upper income housing and industrial estates and in tourism joint ventures will be sought with Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese and Egyptian tourist companies. According to current Jordanian laws in the West Bank, foreign investors are permitted a maximum 49 per cent stake in local companies. But Mr Shair explained that the PDI would insist on ultimate control of all projects which came under its wing. 'Through equity control or a management agreement we will have all strategic decisions for operating companies,' he said. The company's first mission to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, led by Mr Nabil Sarraf, who is the PDI's acting general manager and a close associate of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, returned to Amman recently after largely enthusiastic receptions in East Jerusalem, Nablus and Gaza. Mr Sarraf said that concern was expressed by some local businessmen that they would be overwhelmed by outside investors. But 'after some discussion they were nearly all convinced that we are coming to make money for everyone, not just ourselves.' The stature of the PDI's founding members will be a huge boost to Mr Arafat, who has already contacted the company for advice on Palestinian investment legislation and a stock market. With the slow disbursement of foreign aid, he is desperate for a reconstruction programme and investment to begin backing-up his peace deal.</p>

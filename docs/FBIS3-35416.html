			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Press editorials have focused on the bilateral peace  talks between the heads of Arab and Israeli delegations, noting  that these talks have so far not resulted in any moves that  would help the peace process achieve its objectives in  accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy.    In an editorial under the headline the "Vicious Circle,"  TISHRIN says: The third week of bilateral peace talks has ended  in nothing. The suspension of the talks, as requested by the  Israeli side to hold consultations with its government, has  resulted in nothing new to advance the peace process. Thus, the  Washington talks were stalemated again, just like all rounds of  talks that have been held since the Madrid conference.    TISHRIN stresses that Israel is still unwilling to establish  and make peace or to respond to the requirements of a just and  comprehensive peace. It is also trying to conceal its evasive  policies, intransigence, and rejection of the terms of peace in  an attempt to prolong the talks and undermine their objectives  and tracks. Israel considers the talks an end, rather than a  means to achieve a just, comprehensive peace. The paper says  that in all that, Israel is pursuing the policy of Yitzhaq  Shamir, who declared that the negotiations will continue for 10  years. This is in order to change the situation on the ground  so that the Arabs would have nothing to demand when Israel  controls all the occupied Arab territories through the  settlement building. In the context of the same Israeli  maneuvers, Yitzhaq Rabin made statements which do not differ in  form or content from the Shamir policy. In his statements, he  accused Syria of not being serious about the peace process.    TISHRIN stresses that by his statements, Rabin wants to  conceal Israel's objectives and intentions which have not led to  any positive move for the sake of peace. The paper adds:  Because its malicious objectives and intentions have been  exposed, Israel has failed to undermine the Madrid formula.  Therefore, it began to cast doubts about the U.S. role and its  effectiveness and to aim its poisoned arrows against the Geneva  summit. This is because the meeting of Presidents Hafiz al-Asad  and Bill Clinton has proved beyond any doubt that there will be  no peace in the region without Syria's leading role in the peace  process and without the enforcement of the resolutions of  international legitimacy.    Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN stresses that only a  decision to give up Israel's usurpation and occupation of the  Arab territories without any conditions as demanded by the  resolutions of international legitimacy is the key and basis for  the achievement of a just, comprehensive peace.    In an editorial under the headline "The Deception," the  newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: It is not enough for Shim'on Peres  to hint at the possibility of evacuating a settlement or two and  then to claim that Israel is working for peace and that it wants  to provide the appropriate atmosphere for continuing the  negotiating process. Nor can he convince anybody that the Rabin  government has abandoned expansion and settlement schemes and  that it is now ready to accept the UN Security Council  resolutions which consider the settlements illegitimate, a  violation of international law and conventions, and demand their  immediate removal. Casting doubts about the Israeli position,  the paper says: Had Israel been truly seeking to prove its  peace intentions and to push the peace process in the right  direction, it would have reconsidered its entire settlement  plans, rather than to evacuate some settlements.    The paper stresses that Israel should explicitly and clearly  declare full commitment to the principles, resolutions, and  trend of the international legitimacy. It should also accept  the principle of full withdrawal from all the occupied Arab  territories. It should also halt the policy of military  escalation in southern Lebanon and its arbitrary and terrorist  measures inside the occupied territories. The paper adds: Only  such moves will convince the Arabs and international community  of Israel's seriousness about working for a just, comprehensive  solution in the Middle East. The paper cautions that the  available peace opportunity is now being threatened by the  intransigent Israeli stands. Unless there is a fundamental  change in these stands and unless Israel stops methods of  maneuvers and deception, the opportunity will be lost, together  with many hopes for arriving at the aspired solution.    Concluding, the paper says: The Arabs have offered all they  can to maintain this opportunity, and it remains for Israel to  show enough courage to show interest in not wasting it. This  can only be achieved when it clearly and explicitly announces  its acceptance of the conditions of peace, primarily withdrawal  from all occupied Arab territories.</p>

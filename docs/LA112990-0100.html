			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN OWNERS FIRE VOLLEY AT BUREAUCRATS;  </P> <P> REGISTRATION: THEY SAY EFFORTS TO OBEY LAW ON POSSESSING SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS  WERE MET WITH RUDENESS AND LACK OF COOPERATION.  </P> <P> Owners of assault guns angrily protested Wednesday that they have tried to obey  a law that requires them to register their weapons but were prevented from  doing so by rude and uncooperative law enforcement bureaucrats.  </P> <P> A state Department of Justice official conceded that administrative foul-ups  had occurred and promised to immediately streamline the process so citizens can  more easily comply with the Dec. 31 registration deadline.  </P> <P> Robert Drake, whose Bureau of Justice Information Services handles registration  of legally acquired assault guns, said requests for registration documents can  be sent directly to his office and applications will be processed as promptly  as possible.  </P> <P> "If someone is really trying and cannot get the information, we will mail it to  them," Drake said.  </P> <P> Under California's landmark "Assault Weapons Control Act," owners of legally  obtained assault guns must register them by Dec. 31 or face a $350 fine for the  first violation and stiffer fines or jail sentences for subsequent offenses.  </P> <P> The registration provision of the 1989 law was intended to enable law-abiding  owners of legal semiautomatic military-style combat weapons to keep them even  though the law's main intent was to ban their importation, manufacture,  distribution, sale and transfer. The prohibition provisions took effect Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Only 5,150 assault weapons have been registered in California since the law was  signed in May, 1989. Although no one can be certain, the National Rifle Assn.  and the Justice Department believe there are about 300,000 such weapons in  private hands statewide.  </P> <P> A top-level official of the National Rifle Assn. suggested Tuesday that the  meager number of registrations reflected a mounting expression of civil  disobedience by California assault gun owners who believe the state law  violates their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  </P> <P> But assault gun owners throughout Southern California swamped The Times with  telephone calls on Wednesday, insisting they were not part of any civil  disobedience. They asserted that local police and sheriff's offices and the  state Department of Justice itself thwarted repeated attempts to register their  firearms.  </P> <P> In several cases, the callers said they tried to obtain the forms from police  and sheriff's stations in Los Angeles County, but were told no such materials  existed. Calls to the state Department of Justice were met by rude and  unhelpful answers, they said.  </P> <P> "We are citizens, not criminals," one caller told a reporter. "We're asking for  help. I feel like saying, 'well, stuff it. I'm not registering my weapons.' "  </P> <P> An owner of an Uzi assault carbine seeking information said he was told by an  employee answering the department's telephone that his gun couldn't possibly be  registered by Dec. 31. "That makes me illegal, doesn't it?" the caller said he  asked. "She said, 'It certainly does.' "  </P> <P> All callers to The Times asked not to be identified because they feared their  homes would be burglarized for guns. Some also said they believed they might  encounter trouble from law enforcement authorities for complaining.  </P> <P> Under the registration procedure, gun owners are told they can obtain  registration materials at local police and sheriff's offices and must provide a  thumbprint. The materials plus a $20 check for handling fees then must be sent  to the Justice Department in Sacramento, which is then supposed to send a  letter acknowledging receipt of the forms and follow up with a second letter as  "your proof of assault gun registration."  </P> <P> Drake said it was a daunting task to develop and implement the first-ever  assault gun registration program and that snafus occurred, particularly at  large police and sheriff's departments.  </P> <P> For example, he said, a crate of registration forms was sent to the  headquarters of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department last Christmas "and  just sat there until somebody realized, 'Oh, gee, we've got to get these out.'  "  </P> <P> In other cases, Drake said, local law enforcement agencies balked at performing  the extra work and some substations and precinct branches never received the  forms from their headquarters.  </P> <P> Told of the caller complaints, Drake said: "I have great sympathy and regret  it. We did the best we could do. We were working with 440 police departments  and 58 sheriff's departments."  </P> <P> Drake said if gun owners cannot obtain materials at local police and sheriff's  agencies, they can write to the Department of Justice, Automated Firearms  System, P.O. Box 903417, Sacramento, Calif. 94203-4170 or call (916) 739-2773.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REGISTRATION REQUIRED  </P> <P>  Here is a list of semiautomatic weapons requiring registration by owners  before Dec. 31:  </P> <P> RIFLES  </P> <P> All Avtomat Kalashnikov assault arms (AK-47), regardless of manufacturer  </P> <P> Armalite AR-180 carbine  </P> <P> Beretta AR-70 (SC-70)  </P> <P> Bushmaster assault rifle  </P> <P> Calico M-900 assault carbine  </P> <P> CETME G-3  </P> <P> Colt AR-15 series and CAR-15 series  </P> <P> Daewoo K-1, K-2 (also called Max 1 and Max 2)  </P> <P> Fabrique Nationale FN/FAL, FN/LAR and FNC  </P> <P> FAMAS MAS223  </P> <P> Heckler &amp; Koch HK-91, H-93, HK-94 and PSG-1  </P> <P> Mandall TAC-1 carbine  </P> <P> MAC 10 and MAC 11  </P> <P> Plainfield Machine Co. carbine  </P> <P> PJK M-68 carbine  </P> <P> SKS with detachable magazine  </P> <P> SIG AMT, 500 series and SIG PE-57  </P> <P> Springfield Armory BM-59 and SAR-48  </P> <P> Sterling MK-6 and SAR  </P> <P> Steyr AUG  </P> <P> Uzi carbine and Galil  </P> <P> Valmet M62, M71S and M78  </P> <P> Weaver Arms Nighthawk  </P> <P> HANDGUNS  </P> <P> Calico M-900  </P> <P> Encom MP-9 and MP-45  </P> <P> Intratec Tec-9  </P> <P> MAC 10 and MAC 11  </P> <P> Mitchell Arms Spectre Auto  </P> <P> Sterling MK-7  </P> <P> Uzi  </P> <P> SHOTGUNS  </P> <P> Franchi SPAS-12 and LAW-12  </P> <P> Gilbert Equipment Co.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After consideration of both comments, RSPA has revised the wording in &sect;&sect;178.337&hyph;11 and 178.338&hyph;11 to require the use of remotely controlled internal self-closing stop valves on any cargo tank motor vehicle certified after August 31, 1995, that is intended for the transportation of hazardous materials other than argon, carbon dioxide, helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, and xenon. RSPA has excepted these particular gases because they pose a lesser degree of risk to public health, safety, and the environment in the event of their release during transportation. Many of the nonflammable refrigerant gases presently transported in cargo tanks are ozone depleters; some other nonflammable gases are toxic or noxious. RSPA will address the retrofit of existing cargo tanks with remotely controlled internal self-closing stop valves in a separate rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 178.338&hyph;9 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed in the NPRM and adopted in this final rule, paragraph (c)(2) is amended by removing the definition of ``same design'' and by adding a reference to the definition of ``same design'' contained in &sect;178.320. By referencing the definition in &sect;178.320, minor design variations are allowed for MC 338 cargo tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 178.338&hyph;11 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NTSB and CGA submitted comments to this section which were similar to their comments to proposed &sect;178.337&hyph;11. As stated in the preamble discussion to &sect;178.337&hyph;11 above, RSPA has revised the wording in &sect;&sect;178.337&hyph;11 and 178.338&hyph;11 to require the use of remotely controlled internal self-closing stop valves on any MC 338 cargo tank motor vehicle certified after August 31, 1995, that is intended for the transportation of hazardous materials other than argon, carbon dioxide, helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, and xenon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 178.345&hyph;1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In paragraph (c), definitions for ``normal operating loading'' and ``extreme dynamic loading'' are added. These terms are used in revised &sect;178.345&hyph;3 in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i)(2) requires that the void space within the connecting structure of a cargo tank motor vehicle composed of multiple cargo tanks must be vented to the atmosphere by a drain of at least 1 inch in diameter. In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to remove the drain hole size restriction. RSPA also solicited information on suitable dimensional controls for these drains, how often these areas need to be inspected, the conditions revealed during such inspections, and the availability of equipment for inspecting these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters expressed diverse views on the need to inspect these areas. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) strongly supported the need for periodic inspection of the connecting structures on cargo tanks used to transport all hazardous materials. CHP related information about three separate catastrophic failures of molten sulfur trailers that occurred due to fatigue cracking in the void space. All three cargo tank motor vehicles had been insulated, thus preventing any external visual inspection for shell cracks. CHP believes that if an internal visual inspection of the void space had been performed, evidence of cracking may have been detected prior to the catastrophic failures. CHP noted that equipment, such as fiber optics, borescopes and video cameras, is readily available for inspecting closed areas and is being used for pipeline, aircraft, oil well, and boiler inspections. Also, numerous contractors offering inspection and non-destructive testing services are available throughout the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NTSB also concurred that regular and effective inspections of void spaces are essential. NTSB, however, expressed concern that HM&hyph;183C did not address the configuration of other appurtenances that could conceal corrosion that might lead to a failure of the tank wall. The NTSB recommendation H&hyph;83&hyph;30 called for periodic external visual inspection of surfaces obscured by appurtenances, structural members, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters who opposed inspecting these areas stated that double bulkheads and void spaces on MC 306 or DOT 406 cargo tanks in non-corrosive service do not experience the same degree of deterioration as MC 312 or DOT 412 cargo tanks in corrosive service. They stated that cargo tanks in non-corrosive service should not be subject to the same inspections. One commenter submitted to RSPA samples taken from bulkheads adjacent to void spaces of two scrapped MC 306 carbon steel cargo tanks used in gasoline service for 14 and 15 years. The commenter stated that neither tank showed evidence of corrosion at this location; the samples confirm this statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

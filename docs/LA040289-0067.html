			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRECIOUS PLANET  </P> <P> Alice Kahn should be branded with a scarlet letter "A" for apathetic. In her  article "Hellbent for Destruction . . . but Have a Nice Day" (March 22), she  disgusted me with her laissez-faire attitude about environmental concerns. Our  planet is a wreck, but it is a sorry fact that the majority of people will not  take action until our environment is practically unbearable, and at the rate we  are going, that shouldn't take too many more years.  </P> <P> Summing up the evasive point to her article, Kahn finally admits that the  environmentalists are right, that we need to take action, but she has no clue  as to what she can do. As concerned inhabitants of this planet, there is plenty  we can do. For starters, support the environmentalist groups that work for  hardly any pay at all to keep the planet healthy.  </P> <P> There is Greenpeace, Sane/Freeze, Peta, Save the Bay, and the list goes on.  Keep informed on current events. Attend lectures, demonstrations, marches and  rallies. Read. Don't use household products that contain dangerous chemicals.  </P> <P> There are natural alternatives.  </P> <P> Write letters to politicians. Let your voice be heard. Give your attention to  at least one cause that moves you and you can make a difference. There is no  time left to just sit there and let others take care of the environment; after  all, it belongs to all of us. It's everyone's problem.  </P> <P> JENNIFER LAPIERRE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

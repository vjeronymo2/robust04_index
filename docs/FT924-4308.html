			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Kandinsky sketch realises Pounds 5.5m: Saleroom KANDINSKY'S 'Sketch I for Composition VII', one of the most important works by the artist to appear on the market for 30 years, sold on target for Pounds 5.5m at Sotheby's in London on Tuesday evening. 'Sketch I' is the most resolved of six oil studies for the artist's innovative abstract 'Composition VII', now in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. This turbulent composition of volatile forms and searing reds and sour yellows was executed nine months before the outbreak of the First World War. The sketch was given by Kandinsky to the artist Paul Klee and consigned to auction by his grandson. Other works by the artist also fared well. 'Arrow Toward the Circle' went to a Swiss buyer for Pounds 506,000 and an early, untitled watercolour exceeded its upper estimate by selling for Pounds 290,000. This is now a predominantly private market, and Sotheby's was encouraged by the active bidding on many of the lots. The sale totalled almost Pounds 12.5m, with 81.8 per cent sold, by value. Yesterday's part II sale made Pounds 1.9m, with 38.9 per cent by value bought in. At Christie's yesterday Mr David Tunick, a New York dealer, paid Pounds 660,000 for a series of 100 etchings and aquatints by Picasso dating 1930-37, known as 'La Suite Vollard'. The last Vollard suite of Picasso prints to appear at auction, at Sotheby's in New York in 1982, realised a quarter of the price.</p>

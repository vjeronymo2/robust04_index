			<p>CSO     [Text] Paris--The National Center for Space Studies (CNES)  and the Israeli Space Agency (ISA) signed a three-year, tacitly  renewable collaboration agreement on 11 April in Tel-Aviv. The  accord was signed by the general director of the French space  agency, Jean-Daniel Levi, and his ISA counterpart Marcel Klajn.  It had been discussed during the visit of French foreign affairs  minister, Alain Juppe, to Israel in February.    Israel and France have already collaborated in the past,  since the Amos satellite was built by Israeli Aeronautics  Industries, Alcatel (France), and Dornier (Germany). It is  slated to be launched next year by an Ariane rocket.    The two agencies will work together "to use space for  peaceful ends and for economic and scientific development," in  accordance with the terms of this "arrangement defining a  framework for collaboration in space."    The accord should also stimulate joint space projects  between  the two countries and their industries. It will cover space  research in the fields of astronomy, solar system exploration,  Earth sciences, biology, space medicine, and microgravity  physics.    It will also involve applications in Earth and environmental  observation, weather forecasting, systems for collecting and  localizing environmental data, communications, and the  positioning of satellites. The two agencies will work together  on space techniques relative to robotics, small satellites,  space technology, and quality-reliability problems. A mixed  committee bolstered by expert working groups will coordinate  their work.</p>

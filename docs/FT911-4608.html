			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Travel levy rejected THE government has rejected a call from the Association of British Travel Agents for a consumer levy on all package holidays this year to provide a safety net for tour companies that go bankrupt. Abta had asked Mr Edward Leigh, consumer affairs minister, to support a levy of 1 per cent or 2 per cent on all package holidays sold this year to create a reserve fund to cover the debts of holiday companies that cease trading but are not covered by existing consumer protection arrangements.</p>

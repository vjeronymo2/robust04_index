			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT DECISION REINSTATING LIBRARY BOARD  </P> <P> The Friends of the Library of Monterey Park are justifiably elated with the  state Court of Appeal's decision to reinstate the Board of Library Trustees  which was abolished by the Monterey Park City Council in violation of the state  Education Code (Metro, June 28). This is not only a victory for the Friends and  the people of Monterey Park with its tradition dating back to 1929 of a  management board, but a precedential case as well. There has never before been  a California court ruling for libraries to be overseen by an independent board  and that city officials cannot legally disband the board. This decision affects  libraries throughout the state of California and is also of nationwide  interest.  </P> <P> Having been forewarned by the Friends and many other concerned residents, the  majority of the council, the late Cam Briglio, Pat Reichenberger and Barry  Hatch, voted to abolish the board in violation of the state Education Code.  While they considered the funding requirements of the Library Municipal Act  "archaic," the facts are that council members exercise final budget approval  and they even have the much coveted line-item veto. How much more control does  the council need? So all we can conclude is that they wanted absolute control  and such control from a political body politicizes the library to the detriment  of the community. Even George Washington feared the absolute control of kings!  </P> <P> We acknowledge and thank the Asian Pacific Legal Center for filing the suit and  representing us so successfully in Superior Court. Following that court  decision, the Friends again urged the city council to reinstate the board and  to not appeal, but council members Hatch, Reichenberger, Chris Houseman and  Betty Couch voted to appeal, incurring legal expenses which ultimately totaled  $40,000 at a time when the city faced a $1.2 million deficit.  </P> <P> Additionally, our gratitude to the attorneys for O'Melveny and Myers, the  People for the American Way and state superintendent of schools, Bill Honig,  for their participation and efforts on our behalf. We believe the council has  wisely chosen not to appeal to the state Supreme Court and now it is time for  the Board of Library Trustees to resume its responsibilities in managing the  library and for the Friends to return to its primary focus of supporting the  library and its programs.  </P> <P> The Friends are committed to preserving the library as a center to supplement  the formal system of free public education and as a source of information and  inspiration to persons of all ages, cultural backgrounds and economic status.  </P> <P> TISA LEVINE  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Friends of the Library  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

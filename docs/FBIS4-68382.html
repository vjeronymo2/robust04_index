			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Cherevko: "`Universal'--for 16,000, </F> Free--for 5,000"]    [Text] It looks like the city transportation  structures decided to establish a "good" tradition of monthly  increases in transportation rates.    Yesterday, fares on the St. Petersburg subway increased by  50  percent. Now one ride in the subway will cost R150. Streetcar,  trolley bus, and bus fares now will be R150. Transporting  luggage will cost the same. The fare will be accepted by  punching a R2 or R5 coupon, which will now be assigned a face  value of R150.    The most impressive price hikes will occur with respect to  monthly fare cards, however. From now on the cost of an  unlimited monthly fare card for one type of ground  transportation will be R7,500; for two, R11,200; and for three,  R13,500. A universal fare card will cost R16,000.    Students, as well as vocational and regular school pupils,  will not fare any better. For instance, a "student" fare card  for one type of ground transportation will now cost R3,700, and  a "pupil" one--R2,500. A fare card for two types of ground  transportation will cost these categories of riders R5,600 and  R3,700, respectively, and the "universal" will cost R8,000 and  R5,300, respectively.    At the same time, the fine for riding without a ticket or  not  paying for luggage will remain the same. As before, it is R5,000.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average surges to a new high for the year THE NIKKEI average surged to a new high for the year on hopes of a cut in the official discount rate this week, and additional fiscal measures to support the economy, to be announced on Thursday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 330.13, or 1.6 per cent, at 21,148.11, its first rise for six trading days. The index opened at the day's low of 20,850.09 and rose to the session's high of 21,164.12 in the afternoon. Volume fell to 270m shares from Friday's 569m, which was largely due to trading linked to September futures and options settlements. Advances outnumbered declines by 773 to 259, with 150 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 17.01 to 1,694.51, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.13 firmer at 1,300.20. Weekend reports that Y5,000bn worth of measures to boost the economy would be implemented, including tax cuts for housing reform, helped to lift investor confidence. Investment trusts and tokkin funds were seen buying after the Nikkei reached the 21,000 level, while dealers also bought for their own accounts. Foreign investors were purchasers of large-capital issues. Steel shares, which had fallen back last week on announcements of downward earnings revisions, were bought. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y14 to Y347, NKK Y7 to Y289 and Kobe Steel Y14 to Y304. Housing-related issues were supported by the reports of the economic stimulus package. Daiwa House climbed Y30 to Y1,800, while Takara Standard, a kitchen and bathroom facilities maker, rose Y30 to Y1,470. High-technology stocks were firm, Hitachi adding Y16 at Y885 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 at Y1,470. However, Pioneer Electronic fell Y110 to Y2,750 on reports that a leading karaoke machine retailer had decided to switch to Sony machines from Pioneer karaoke equipment. Sanyo Securities, which was suspended last Friday on reports that the company had sought financial assistance from its main creditors, declined by its daily limit of Y100 to Y575. Sanyo and Ministry of Finance officials last week denied the reports, but investors remained pessimistic over Sanyo's financial position. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shed Y3,000 to Y919,000 as investors who had bought the issue on margin in April liquidated positions. Some market participants were also discouraged by the absence of public telecommunication infrastructure investments in the government's emergency package, as had been hoped. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 217.56 up at 22,998.55 in volume of 53.9m shares. Roundup HONG KONG weakened yesterday, while Manila remained strong.

SINGAPORE made headway on strong buying of Malaysian OTC shares as the Straits Times Industrial index rose 10.72 to 2,009.51. Advances led falls by 165 to 124 after turnover of SDollars 721.6m. In KUALA LUMPUR itself prices were mixed, but a spate of rumours helped several speculative shares make big gains in hectic trading. The composite index was barely changed, off 0.38 at 820.36. Volume was about 800m shares, compared with Friday's 536m. MANILA remained in record territory, the composite index adding 59.59 at 1,978.81. Turnover was 1.4bn pesos.

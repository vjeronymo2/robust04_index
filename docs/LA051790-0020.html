			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THANKS IN TIME OF TRIAL  </P> <P> We, the parents of David Dufau, whose capsized catamaran was found April 27 off  the coast of Anacapa Island, have a heartfelt need to say thank you.  </P> <P> We know that the Harbor Patrol and the Coast Guard conducted an enormous search  with the utmost professional expertise.  </P> <P> We know there were numberless friends, acquaintances and others who had never  met David, who generously used their boats and their time to join in the  search. All of you seemed to realize that "the only gift is a portion of  thyself."  </P> <P> You gave! We thank all of you for that gift.  </P> <P> The members of the press have been particularly thoughtful and considerate of  our family.  </P> <P> We appreciate sincerely all that has been done.  </P> <P> FABIEN and JEAN DUFAU  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

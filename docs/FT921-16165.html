			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Hauled down the merger aisle: The Krupp-Hoesch wedding is no love match The unsuspecting bride-to-be needed a sharp kick to get her through the church door. She thought her friend had brought her somewhere quiet to talk about their future. Marriage was not in the forefront of her mind. But the groom had other ideas. Thus, with an armlock on his intended, Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive of Krupp, hauled Mr Kajo Neukirchen, head of Hoesch, down the aisle to endure the formalities of what has become popularly known as 'the elephants' wedding'. Two of the oldest and proudest names in German steel and engineering are to be joined, provided the high priests of competition policy in Brussels and the Berlin cartel office give their blessing. It is not a love match. 'Unfriendly,' said Mr Neukirchen, on receiving his first forceful prompting - news out of the blue in October that Krupp had scooped up 24.9 per cent of Hoesch stock. But the negotiations on co-operation, which had been continuing on and off since the 1970s, carried on uninterrupted. The balance, however, had shifted, and most of the pressure to co-operate was on Hoesch. Apart from its purchases, Krupp had won the support of banks and institutions holding 55 per cent of its target's stock. Forceful rather than hostile, a takeover by arrangement - no formal bid has been tabled - rather than a negotiated merger of convenience, Krupp's move against its Dortmund neighbour differs from other recent intra-German link-ups mainly in the measure of blatant coercion and apparent guile brought to bear by Mr Cromme. Covert stock purchases on such a scale are untypical of German mergers, and Krupp's claim that it bought its initial stake because of 'rumours about a takeover of Hoesch from abroad' smacks more of pandering to xenophobia than a reflection of the realities of life in the incestuous German takeover market. A leading candidate, the rumour-mill said, was British Steel. Its chairman, Sir Robert Scholey, pleads not guilty. Krupp's plan was 'a clever chess move', he said in a recent German interview. But as for British Steel's bidding for Hoesch: 'That was a rumour put about to hide the truth.' Personalities have also played an unusually large role. Both company leaders are relatively young men by German business standards, out to make their mark in flagship companies. Mr Cromme, 52, the former head of Krupp's steel business, who can be best characterised as a tactician with teeth, has so far won the public relations battle with carefully placed statements and interviews. He flatly rejects suggestions that he is making an opportunistic bid, taking advantage of newcomer Mr Neukirchen, 49, who had been at Hoesch for only three months when Krupp pounced. Mr Neukirchen, who made his reputation reshaping the Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz engineering group, may understandably have wanted time to attempt the same at Hoesch. The hurried publication in November of a wholesale restructuring strategy entitled Hoesch 2000, outlined his ambitious proposals for the development of nine strategic divisions. But Mr Cromme, looking outwards to the threatening crisis in the international steel industry, and the impending opening of the single European market, feels more radical and urgent action is required. 'In the long run, neither of us has a real chance of survival alone,' he said recently. He has otherwise adhered faithfully to the indigenous merger formula. He has, for example, dutifully made his case in all the necessary political, financial and social circles. There are deep-seated traditional rivalries between companies and the workforces who identify closely with them - Dortmund is Hoeschianer territory and Essen belongs to the Kruppianers - and they are regarded with the utmost respect. Local pride demands as much consideration in Germany as shareholder sensitivities in Britain. Politicians also often wield considerable power through state holdings in regional banks and institutions which tend to have large stakes in local companies. Early in the tussle, Mr Johannes Rau, prime minister of North Rhine Westphalia, home state to both companies, declared diplomatically that the state government had no role to play in the decision. He added, however, that nothing would happen to the 12 per cent of Hoesch held by the local WestLB bank until an overall strategic plan for the new 'partnership' had been presented. Even though he was clearly shaken by the initial Krupp stake, Mr Neukirchen and his board carried forward the negotiations about the benefits and possibility of achieving a 'merger", and there have been no more public protests since then. There was not a murmur when Krupp applied the stick again just before Christmas with the announcement that it had taken its holding to 51 per cent and claimed the deal would be completed by this summer. Tossing a carrot to other shareholders, it added that talks had revealed synergies from the combination of the groups which would show savings of 'several hundred million D-Marks'. The full merger proposal, agreed between the two companies, was sent off to the competition authorities in Brussels and Berlin over Christmas, with Krupp as confident as ever that no objections were expected. Details are also understood to have been made known to the WestLB bank and others among the holders of the 45 per cent of stock not already owned by or pledged to persuasive Krupp. The aim is to avoid any need for overt aggression which might in the last resort have to be used to overturn Hoesch's anti-takeover voting limits. Clear-cut hostility still has no place in the German takeover code. To date, Mr Cromme has demonstrated an ability to apply just the right amount of persuasive force at the right time. He has been careful not to break the mould of corporate courtship in Germany, but has shown that a good shaking can work wonders.</p>

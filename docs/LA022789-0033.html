			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLEW CITY SLEW WINS FEATURE RACE AT GULFSTREAM PARK  </P> <P> Slew City Slew led every step of the way to win the $300,000 Gulfstream Park  Handicap Sunday, beating Bold Midway by 1 1/4 lengths.  </P> <P> Cryptoclearance, the odds-on favorite, came from last but never threatened as  he finished third, 1 1/2 lengths behind Bold Midway. Intensive Command was  fourth in the field of six going 1 1/4 miles.  </P> <P> Ridden by Angel Cordero Jr., Slew City Slew was timed in 2:03 1/5. He was  coupled in the betting with Dynaformer and the entry paid $5.20, $3.40 and  $2.10. Bold Midway paid $6.20 and $2.10. Cryptoclearance returned $2.10.  </P> <P> Slew City Slew opened a two-length lead and increased it to three lengths while  turning for home. Slew City Slew led by four lengths at the eighth pole and  held off Bold Midway's charge.  </P> <P> "It was perfect," Cordero said. "Nobody tried to run with us. I was on an easy  lead and we had plenty left when we turned for home. This is a real tough  horse, especially when he can set his own pace."  </P> <P> Owned by Joe Allen and the Tayhill Stable, Slew City Slew is a 5-year-old son  of Seattle Slew. He won six of 18 starts and finished in the money 13 times  last year, earning $465,150. Sunday he earned $180,000.  </P> <P> In his previous start, he gave way to Cryptoclearance in the late stages of the  Donn Handicap, finishing second.  </P></p>

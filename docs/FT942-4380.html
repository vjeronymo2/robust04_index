			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Keating 'tried to influence Fairfax press' An Australian parliamentary inquiry has found Mr Paul Keating, the country's prime minister, attempted 'improperly to influence the political coverage of Fairfax newspapers' by offering Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon, 'the prospect of increased investment in Fairfax in return for balanced coverage'. It also put forward some strong recommendations regarding the country's Foreign Investment Review Board, which decides whether foreign investment is contrary to the national interest, and the guidelines to which FIRB works. In particular, it has accused FIRB of being 'excessively secretive' and unaccountable, and recommended it be replaced by a new statutory authority, responsible for administering foreign investment policies in 'non-key' industry sectors. In sectors such as the media, the responsibility would fall directly to the Treasurer, who would make decisions on 'national interest' grounds, but be required to publish the reasoning for each decision. The Senate committee was set up last year, to study circumstances surrounding Mr Black's acquisition of Fairfax in 1991. Fairfax publishes three of Australia's top daily papers: the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age and Financial Review. The company had gone into receivership, triggering a battle for its ownership. This was won by Mr Black's Tourang consortium, though his British-based Telegraph group's holding was initially pegged at 15 per cent. This was lifted to 25 per cent after the 1993 election, which Mr Keating's Labor Party won. The trigger-points for the inquiry were a disclosure in Mr Black's autobiography that, before the election, Mr Keating said an increase in the Telegraph's holding would be entertained if Fairfax's coverage was 'balanced'; the prime minister's own admission that he told Mr Black that if he 'barracked for the (opposition) coalition ..then there's no way you would qualify as the kind of owner we would like'; and long-running dissatisfaction with FIRB procedures. The inquiry's conclusions on the Black-Keating affair was based on a majority opinion, written by five opposition and minor party senators on the nine-person committee. The four Labor Party members of the inquiry dissented, saying the investigation had been a blatant political exercise. Yesterday, Mr Michael Lavarch, Australia's attorney-general, and one of the small number of senior government figures not overseas at present, also claimed that its conclusions were flawed. 'The finding against the prime minister appears to be based on a jaundiced view of one remark,' he said. Mr Keating had declined to appear before the committee. The majority and minority reports suggested changes to foreign investment decisions, to make the process more open, though the latter favoured retaining FIRB. The findings are unlikely to have direct political consequences for Mr Keating.</p>

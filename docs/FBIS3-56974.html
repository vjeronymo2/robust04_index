We will continue to adhere to  all deadlines and conditions for the repayment of our foreign  debt, which were agreed with the IMF, the World Bank, and other  financial organizations, he stressed. Russia's policies toward  individual foreign countries will also remain unchanged. The  president is the guarantee of this, Chernomyrdin noted. The  prime minister does not feel that renewal in the country depends  all that greatly on the role of individual personalities.  Cabinet changes are a natural process. Russia cannot be  deflected from the path of reform. But the main task is to  carry out these reforms with the least possible harm to each  member of society, the head of the Russian Government believes.</p>

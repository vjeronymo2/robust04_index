			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS IN SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> She talks of meals distributed to the homeless. I would like to tell about my  meal in an emergency ward recently at Los Angeles County Medical Center.  </P> <P> It was symbolic, for I had no money or insurance to pay the bills. I was  accepted for surgery and in line with other casualties of living.  </P> <P> This is the precious processing of poor patients by dedicated professionals,  using their skills to stitch and mend our broken bodies. Nurses would brighten  up blank stares, then take on a surge of questions that the doctor would  scratch his head over. So much activity! Computers say input, output and  processed patient; but my God, so many hundreds of people moving to enrich  life.  </P> <P> JOHN WARREN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

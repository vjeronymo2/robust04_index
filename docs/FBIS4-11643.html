			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Majid al-Khudari and Ra'id al-Najjar] </F>   [Text] The International Tourism Fair was held in Berlin  last month. In its noon newscast on Monday, 7 March 1994,  Israel radio said Jordanian Tourism Minister Muhammad al-'Adwan  visited the Israeli pavilion and made a statement in which he  said: I hope Jordan and Israel will overcome their extremists  so the desired peace between the two countries will be realized  soon. I also hope that after signing a peace agreement between  the two countries, it will become possible to carry out joint  tourist projects to attract foreign tourists to Israel and  Jordan. He said Jordanian businessmen and investors are ready  to cooperate with their Israeli counterparts on setting up joint  ventures that serve bilateral economic and tourist interests.    Israel radio attributed this statement to al-'Adwan during a  surprise visit to the Israeli pavilion, as the radio claimed.  The radio said the Jordanian minister arrived in the pavilion  unexpectedly, and that the director general of the Israeli  Ministry of Tourism was quickly called in to receive the  unexpected guest.    Sources at the Israeli pavilion expressed a belief that the  political relaxation in Middle East relations have a direct  impact on the change in the Arab world and the visits to various  Israeli fairs by Arab officials. The Israeli side proposed  tourist deals to their Arab visitors.    Israeli tourists toured Arab pavilions. The director general  of the Israeli airlines company visited the Yemen pavilion and  met with Yemeni businessmen.    Ahmad al-Ma'ni, director general of a tourist company in  Dubai, told Israeli press representatives who visited the Dubai  pavilion that what happened in Hebron turned things upside down.    Ibrahim Yasin, a ranking Syrian Tourism Ministry official  said several Syrian officials are impatiently waiting for the  time when they will be allowed to visit Israel.    In an exclusive statement to AL-SABIL, Dr. Muhammad  al-'Adwan, Jordanian minister of tourism and antiquities, said  this report is baseless. He said: I did not visit the Israeli  pavilion, nor did any member of the Jordanian delegation. No  one made a statement to the Israeli media. This report is  totally untrue, he said.    He said the objective of Israel radio is to stir up a clamor  and to try to harm the firm Jordanian position by diverting  attention from the ugly massacre committed by Israeli settlers.    Al-'Adwan welcomed cooperation between AL-SABIL and the  Ministry of Tourism in the service of the public interest.</p>

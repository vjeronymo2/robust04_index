			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ru Feng (1172 6912): "In the Advent of the Tide </F> of Reentry Into GATT, Township Enterprises Must Be Tide Riders"]    [Text] The recent successful conclusion of the Uruguay  Round of talks has added to the urgency of China's reentry into  the GATT.    As a full participant in the Uruguay Round, China must  restore its status as a GATT contracting party as soon as  possible so as to sign the final act of the Uruguay Round and  perform the obligations specified in the act. On the one hand,  the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round has provided a  more open external environment for us to further export-oriented  economic development. On the other hand, a more open market  means keener competition--a new challenge to the makeup and  quality of our exports.    Town and township enterprises are the main subject of this  challenge. Generally speaking, township enterprises are faced  with the following internal and external problems: First, we  have a large number of township enterprises, but their  operations are small-scale. Now, there are more than 10 million  township enterprises, employing 110 million people. On average,  each enterprise has less than 10 employees, and cannot take  advantage of large-scale operations. There are only a few dozen  enterprise groups. This makes macro-management and guidance a  very difficult task. Second, township enterprises lack technical  personnel, and their technology and equipment are backward. Most  staff members and workers of township enterprises come from the  countryside. Their education and training cannot meet the needs  of industrialized production. Most of their equipment is  backward, and most needs to be replaced. Third, products are not  technology-intensive. Most of them are common, low-grade  products, which cannot compete with imported goods. Fourth, the  products are of poor quality. Many products are manufactured in  a careless way, and some are fake or shoddy products. How can  such products compete with their foreign counterparts? Fifth,  this year the world economy will move out of difficulty and  enter a steady-growth stage. Competition in the international  market will be keen. In particular, our neighboring areas, such  as Southeast Asia, are regions in the world noted for their  relatively fast economic growth. Their economic growth rate is  expected to surpass the European and U.S. countries by 4  percentage points. The "threat" of competition from these  regions will be severe. Six, China can no longer rely on such  methods as high tariffs to protect domestic products.    After our "re-entry into GATT," our products will be  directly  subject to the impact of international market prices and world  economic situations. The GATT's primary function is to set the  international trade behavior of its contracting parties, and the  contracting parties must implement a market economic system and  enforce unified trade and tariff rules as required. How will  township enterprises meet this challenge? This is a serious  question before us.    The correct answer is: They should create brand-name  products  to welcome "re-entry into GATT." When the tide of "re-entry into  GATT" comes, they should be "tide riders"!    1. They should launch a vigorous publicity and education  campaign aimed at fostering and strengthening the determination  to improve product quality. It is imperative to increase the  leaders' and employees' sense of urgency, crisis, and  responsibility. They should foster the intention of "improving  their product quality with the ultimate goal of revitalizing the  country" and reinforce their concept that "quality is the  lifeblood of township enterprises."    2. They should use the strategy of creating brand-name  products to increase the popularity and competitiveness of their  products both at home and abroad. Authorities at all levels in  charge of township enterprises should formulate a "brand-name  products" strategy and put it into practice step by step. The  state should establish a policy to give preferential treatment  to quality products turned out by township enterprises.    3. They should painstakingly "improve themselves." They  should go all out to conduct technical transformation, readjust  the product mix, understand high technology, and develop  high-tech products.    4. They should catch up with the tide of nationwide  economic reform this year. Positive efforts should be exerted to  implement and perfect the cooperative shareholding system,  promote various kinds of lateral economic and technological  alliances and cooperation, and encourage the formation of  superior industries, manufacturers of brand-name products, or  backbone enterprises based on the principle of voluntary  participation. Small and mini enterprises and those operating at  a deficit should be merged, leased out, or sold by auction.  Township enterprises should transform their operational  mechanism in line with the modern international enterprise  system with a view to approaching the standard of regular  modernized enterprises in the world.</p>

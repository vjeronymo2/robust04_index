			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Windsor Safari Park calls in receivers THEMES INTERNATIONAL, the pri-vate leisure group which owns Windsor Safari Park, became the latest casualty of the recession yesterday when it applied to go into administrative receivership. The decision, which came as figures were published by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick showing that more than 4,000 companies went into receivership last year, was made after several weeks of talks between the group and its main banker, Royal Bank of Scotland. The group, which employs about 1,200 people, has also held talks with possible buyers for its operations. As well as the 148-acre Windsor Safari Park, one of the UK's most famous theme parks, the group also owns Hollywood Bowl, which runs 13 bowling alleys in the UK, the Liberty Street restaurant chain and the Heights night club group. Its other interests include Bygone Times, the largest antiques market in Europe, a string of pubs, a paddle steamer in Rotterdam and other leisure operations in Spain and the US. The group encountered difficulties in the past two years as its income declined and it became steadily dependent on borrowing. In 1990 it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.17m on turnover of Pounds 42.75m. Cork Gully, the insolvency pract-itioner arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, have been appointed joint administrative receivers. Mr Chris Barlow and Mr Ian Bond of Cork Gully will be the receivers responsible for the parent company and Windsor Safari Park, while Mr Barlow and Mr Mike Moore are responsible for Leisure Times, the subsidiary which owns the bowling alleys, restaurants and night clubs. Mr Barlow said he was certain that buyers for the two core business, the safari park and the bowling alleys, would be found eventually even if the process took several months. 'Windsor Safari Park is a unique asset because of its location and we are not in a hurry to sell it,' Mr Barlow said. He added that Mr Ernest Potter, Themes International chairman, and the other directors were co-operating fully with the receivers. Royal Bank declined to indicate the size of its lending to Themes International, but said it was determined to keep Windsor Safari Park open. 'Customers are not going to be turning up at the park to find either that it is closed or that the facilities offered are reduced during the period a buyer is being sought,' the bank said.

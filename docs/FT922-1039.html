			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Good recovery but volume still thin BETTER performances from both Tokyo and Wall Street found a warm response in London yesterday, although the recovery in share prices was checked briefly when the disclosure of continued high money supply in Germany undermined prospects for interest rate cuts. Trading volume in UK equities was disappointing, however, and a 10-point rally in the FT-SE Index leaned heavily on strong performances among the pharmaceutical stocks. London was clearly pleased by the closing tone to the previous session on Wall Street, where an initial loss of 30 on the Dow Average was reduced to 4.55, and also by the 185-point rally in the Nikkei Average. However, the opening gain in London proved to be little more than a marking-up operation by marketmakers, buttressed by a small trading programme. The advance in share prices was soon trimmed. There was some disappointment at the absence of follow-through support from the institutions, and at the further selling of Lasmo on nervousness regarding the impending sale of shares in the Ultramar interests in the US. The news on German money supply unsettled London early in the session and shares soon turned downwards. An initial rally of 13.7 on the Footsie had been converted into a net decline of 10.7 by mid-morning. The more heartening tone on Wall Street then began to show through in London in the shape of gains in the blue chip international stocks. Pharmaceuticals were to the fore, both Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham recovering some of their recent losses. ICI also came in for support as some investors took the view that the setback which followed last week's meeting with analysts had been somewhat overdone. The strength of the blue chips helped market indices to move forward, and sentiment was further encouraged by a firm opening to the new session on Wall Street, where the Dow showed a gain of 12 1/2 points in UK trading hours. Although buyers were said to be cautious and willing to take only small packets of stocks, the market extended its second upturn through most of the afternoon. At its final reading of 2,560.6, the FT-SE Index was 10.3 ahead on the day. The nervousness provoked by withdrawal of the GPA share issue appeared to settle. There were favourable reports on the underwriting of the planned Telegraph share issue. Wellcome, also preparing to sell shares in the market, gained ground. Those market strategists who have maintained that the UK stock market is attractive on valuation grounds at a Footsie level of around 2,550 expressed further confidence following yesterday's performance. Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon commented that the Footsie might reach new highs, 'but not until Wall Street can lend a hand'. The weak factor in the market remained the lack of genuine investment business. Seaq-reported volume was an unexciting 368.7m shares, compared with 371.8m on Monday. Retail, or customer, business in equities has stayed below the Pounds 1bn mark in recent sessions.</p>

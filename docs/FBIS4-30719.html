			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of armed groups in the jungles, who have  come to realize their wrongdoings and who have accepted the work  being undertaken by the State Law and Order Restoration Council  [SLORC] and its genuine goodwill, have been giving up their  armed struggle and continuously surrendering with their arms and  ammunition at various military camps.    From 23 to 26 May, 35 terrorist insurgents -- from the ABSDF  [All Burma Students Democratic Front] armed group in the  Southeast Military Command Region, and from the Karenni armed  group in the Eastern Military Command Region -- returned to the  legal fold and were warmly welcomed by responsible personnel  concerned at the respective camps.</p>

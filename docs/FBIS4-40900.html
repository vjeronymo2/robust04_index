			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Davidyuk report: "Better a Hard Shipping Season </F> Than a `Nightmare' Winter -- Obstacles on the `Lifeline' for the  Far North Garrisons"]    [Text] Spring was late arriving in Tiksi. And this means  that in the remaining six to eight weeks every necessity, from  tacks to fuel, will have to be brought to the northern garrisons  of the Transbaykal Military District. The lion's share of  freight for the "God-forsaken" polar region is conveyed by ship  along the Lena river. The waterway is virtually the only route  into these regions. At the very least, it is the cheapest.    "A great deal of work rests on the servicemen's shoulders.  We will have to ship around 55,000 tonnes of fuel and  lubricants, over 2,000 tonnes of food, personal equipment,  medicines, and much much more. In all, this represents 60,000  tonnes of cargo," Colonel General Valeriy Tretyakov, commander  of the Transbaykal Military District, told me in conversation.  "On top of all that, the river workers have sprung an  unpleasant `surprise' -- prices for conveying cargoes have shot  up."    But although they have managed somehow to cope with the  transportation payments -- Moscow allocated some money -- the  fact is that everyday welfare problems are somewhat more  pressing. It is no secret to anybody that Northerners are  abandoning their local areas and moving away. They are moving  to the former Union republics and to the richer cities. Their  actions are understandable. The wage, for instance, of a  kindergarten teacher stands at 150,000 rubles. Officers' and  ensigns' pay is just 50,000 rubles more than for their  colleagues in other regions. Priority provision of consumer  goods is a thing of the past. Food products and fruit and  vegetables are two or three times more expensive than "on the  mainland." Add to this the climatic conditions....    There is a dire shortage of experienced specialists and  highly skilled workers readying the garrisons of the Far North  for the long winter. A similar picture can be seen in the troop  collectives. Things are particularly difficult when it comes to  filling jobs for enlisted men and NCO's. Every draftee tries by  hook or by crook to serve just that bit closer to home. The  soldiers who remain are those from among the handful of Arctic  peoples. But they are too few in number to "plug the gaps" in  personnel numbers.    The conditions being generated by the military leadership  should also be mentioned. Among the most important is the  reduction in the number of small garrisons lost in the tundra or  deep in the taiga. An agreement has been reached with welders  and workers in other trades from Belorussia [Belarus]. They  will be traveling to Yakutia soon to help prepare the military  camps for the winter. Officers from all the district rear  services in the okrug and the people responsible for shipping  military freight along the "lifeline" route are out working on  the spot.    ...The shipping season looks set to be difficult. But it is  better for the shipping to season to be hard than the  forthcoming winter.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Swedish Elections: Social Democrats' lead narrows as poll looms Sweden's Social Democratic Party appeared yesterday to be heading for a narrow win in tomorrow's general election, but a victory that once seemed assured has been thrown into some doubt by a steady fall in its opinion poll ratings in the past two weeks. Yesterday, a clutch of polls indicated the balance between the opposition Social Democrats, the country's largest single party, and prime minister Carl Bildt's four-party right-centre coalition was finely poised. SWEDISH ELECTIONS One poll showed the government parties leading the Social Democrats by 43.9 per cent to 40.4 per cent. Although the coalition trailed by up to five points in three other polls, the results were enough to give Mr Bildt some hope of defying the months-long predictions of a Social Democratic victory. With pollsters reporting as many as 16 per cent of voters still undecided, much was thought to depend on the outcome last night of a marathon three-hour television debate involving the leaders of all eight parties contesting the election. However, a tough obstacle facing Mr Bildt in his push for a last-minute victory was the near certain return to the Riksdag of the Environment party, which failed to get elected in 1991. If, as seems likely, the former communist Left party also holds its place in parliament, the present coalition would be far short of a parliamentary majority even if it outstrips the Social Democrats. That makes Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Social Democratic leader, the continued favourite to form the next government, despite a lacklustre campaign in which he has appeared alternately complacent, tired and afraid. He is likely to seek an alliance with the Liberal party, at present part of Mr Bildt's coalition, to avoid being dependent on the left and the greens for a majority. The Social Democrats held an opinion poll rating of more than 50 per cent as little as three weeks ago, but have been slipping since they unveiled a SKr61bn package of tax increases and spending cuts to tackle the country's big budget deficit and fast-growing government debt. They have lost votes heavily to the Left party and to the Environment party, apparently among public sector workers anxious about the party's commitment to cut some welfare spending. But they have also begun to lose some votes to government parties both over their plans to raise income taxes and a specific proposal to cut some benefits to parents taking time off work to look after sick children.

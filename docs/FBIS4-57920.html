			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 19 May (PL) -- Today, Colombian Ambassador  to Cuba Ricardo Santamaria talked about the existing dynamics in  the development of the relations between the two countries, and  he predicted even better relations in the immediate future.    Santamaria granted an interview to PRENSA LATINA, during  which he noted that important events had taken place in the past  few hours regarding relations between the two Latin American  countries.    Camilo Penaloza, Colombian deputy economic development  minister, ended a visit to Cuba yesterday. He was leading a  delegation of businessmen interested in investing in the island.  The Colombian Navy training vessel Arc Gloria docked in Havana  Port, bringing a message of friendship to the Cuban people.    Moreover, the civil aeronautics directors of Colombia and  Cuba signed an agreement that will soon lead to the  establishment of regular flights by their airlines to link the  capitals and other cities of both countries.    As for the visit paid by the businessmen, Santamaria  explained it represents a specific step forward in the area of  possible joint business ventures by means of direct meetings  with the people who are able to invest in Cuba.    He also said the business delegation identified specific  points of cooperation and a new meeting was scheduled with  high-ranking Colombian and Cuban officials with the goal of  signing specific agreements. The meeting will soon be held in  Santa Fe de Bogota as bilateral talks move into their next round.    The visitors, he said, held meetings in which they were  informed of the Cuban economic outlook and the country's future,  as well as being informed of new types of foreign investments  approved by the Cuban state.    The diplomat said there is going to be continuity in these  types of visits, which are aimed at providing Colombian  companies with direct knowledge of existing opportunities in  Cuba for the establishment of enterprises that benefit both  sides.    Santamaria talked with great enthusiasm about the  aeronautics  agreement that has just been signed. He described the agreement  as the primary goal of the diplomatic mission in view of its  economic importance.    The agreement was based on the existence of actual market  needs because clear possibilities already exist for having  several weekly flights between the capitals and cities of Cuba  and Colombia, as is shown by the increase in the number of  tourist flights during the current year, he said.    The ambassador said the increase in the number of flights  between the two countries, not only for tourists but also for  businessmen and government officials, contributes to the  dynamics of bilateral relations.    It is an important agreement that was signed thanks to the  constructive position of Cuba, which can expect from us all the  loyalty one can expect from a brother country, he said.    In addition, Santamaria talked about the status of the  negotiations for expanding the partial agreement, which will  also allow, in the area of trade, a significant increase in  bilateral relations.    To this effect, the Colombian Government is currently  conducting consultations with the private sector regarding  tariffs that will affect more than 800 products included in the  expansion, which were the object of previous agreements in the  last meeting held in Havana.    We hope that in June or July of this year, the Colombian and  Cuban foreign trade ministers will sign the corresponding  document based on the work already done and the technical  meetings that have already been held, the ambassador said.</p>

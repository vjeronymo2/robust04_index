			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Peru challenges Gatt criticisms over economy Peru has abandoned its long-standing import substitution policy and put decades of state intervention into reverse, but the private sector has been slow to respond, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade secretariat says in a report which it published yesterday The report blames high interest and tax rates, competition from the informal sector (which is estimated to account for almost 40 per cent of gross domestic product), inadequate infrastructure, an overvalued exchange rate, and terrorism. However, this view was challenged as outdated by Peruvian officials when the Gatt council met this week to discuss the report, originally compiled in spring 1993. The latest figures showed nearly 7 per cent GDP growth for 1993, with a further 5 per cent growth expected this year, officials said. Inflation had been brought down from a peak of 7,650 per cent in 1990 to 40 per cent in 1993, with the aim of reaching single digits in 1995. The struggle against terrorism was being won and the informal sector was being steadily integrated into the formal economy, partly as a result of tax reforms. Peru's efforts since 1990 to liberalise trade and increase domestic competition, in the context of a comprehensive economic stabilisation programme, generally win Gatt's praise. The report notes that average tariff levels have been slashed from 66 per cent in 1989 to 16 per cent in June 1993; the government is aiming at a 15 per cent uniform tariff by January 1995. Price controls, subsidies, quotas and foreign exchange restrictions have been scrapped and there has been a thoroughgoing privatisation programme. The reforms and recent legislative changes have helped restore the confidence of foreign investors, the report says. Though Peru accounts for just 0.11 per cent of world trade, it is the world's largest producer of fishmeal and cochineal, the second largest silver and zinc concentrates producer, the third largest lead concentrates producer and the fifth largest copper producer. Peru is also the world's largest producer of coca leaves and the rapidly growing illicit trade in coca-cocaine products is now estimated to equal one-third to one-half of recorded merchandise exports.</p>

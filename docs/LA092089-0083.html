			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> COLOMBIA SEEKS 2 ISRAELIS  </P> <P> Colombia has issued arrest warrants for two Israelis accused of training hit  squads for the drug cartels waging war on the government, an official said.  Acting on a request by the Department of Administrative Security, Colombia's  equivalent of the FBI, a judge issued the warrants for a former Israeli army  colonel, Yair Klein, and businessman Arik Acek. "They are wanted for violating  laws against conspiring, teaching and enlisting civilians in military  operations without the approval of the Defense Ministry," a department  spokeswoman said. Klein, now home in Tel Aviv, has said he trained Colombian  farmers to protect themselves against leftist guerrillas. Israel does not have  an extradition treaty with Colombia.  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Aspin quits as US defence secretary Mr Les Aspin last night abruptly ended an often controversial tenure as US defence secretary by submitting his resignation to President Bill Clinton. Appearing with the president at the White House, Mr Aspin, citing 'personal reasons', said it was 'time to take a break and undertake a new line of work'. Mr Clinton, who apparently did not seek the resignation, was lavish in his praises of the 55-year-old Mr Aspin, the first member of his cabinet to depart. His resignation takes effect on January 20, by when a replacement, who is subject to Senate confirmation, is expected to be named. Names which may be considered include Mr James Woolsey, head of the CIA, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Congressman Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma and Admiral William Crowe, a close Clinton adviser and due to be the next US ambassador to London. The president commended the 'comprehensive review' of US military structure Mr Aspin completed in September and which is designed to meet the needs of the post-Cold War era. Mr Aspin's health has been a source of concern all year. He underwent heart bypass surgery this year and although he has claimed to have made a full recovery his very heavy workload may have exacted a further toll. He has also come under fire, along with Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, and Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, for failing effectively to articulate US foreign policy. More specific criticism has been directed at his refusal to approve a request for more heavily armed equipment for US troops in Somalia, prior to the disastrous Mogadishu firefight in early October which cost the lives of 18 US servicemen. Mr Aspin also bore the brunt of implementing Mr Clinton's controversial policy of ending the military's ban on homosexuals. This rendered him unpopular with many senior serving officers, as did his restructuring of the military's overall mission, which entails a substantial reduction in real terms in defence spending over the next five years. Two weeks ago Mr Aspin implied that defence cuts might have been too deep, prompting budget director Mr Leon Panetta to doubt that additional funding could be made available. There is, however, no hard evidence that this intra-administration fight was a factor in his decision to leave.</p>

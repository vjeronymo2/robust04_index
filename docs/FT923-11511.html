			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: A fight to the bitter end - Greene King's battle for Morland GREENE KING needs about 700,000 shares, a stake of just over 4 per cent, this morning to clinch its Pounds 104m hostile bid for Morland, the Thames Valley brewer. Yet Morland's chances of retaining its independence still seem good. The Suffolk-based brewer launched its bid in May with all the cards apparently in its favour. It bought a 28.5 per cent stake in Morland from the Whitbread Investment Company, which also pledged a further 14.9 per cent if no other bidder emerged. For Morland, there was a bitter irony about the sudden move that threatened its survival. Whitbread had been forced to dispose of its shareholding by the government's beer orders. Those were based on a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report that sought to safeguard the independence of regional brewers. With 43.4 per cent of Morland in its grasp, Greene King confidently made its first, and final, offer for the rest of the shares - 484p in convertibles or 450p cash. But after a hard-fought nine-week campaign, Greene King succeeded in gaining control of less than another 3 per cent. Against the background of a falling stock market - generally considered to favour the bid - several shareholders who accepted the offer have had second thoughts in the last few days and withdrawn. Royal Insurance, with a 7.7 per cent stake, rejected the bid from the outset, saying 'it considerably undervalues the future prospects of the company.' Other institutions with significant stakes - Prudential (7 per cent), Britannic (5.9 per cent), CIN (3.8 per cent) and Refuge (3.1 per cent) - have shown no signs of defecting. Morland's record and its prospects in a fast-changing brewing industry have been the main battleground. Mr Simon Redman, Greene King's chairman, opened hostilities by claiming that a takeover made commercial and financial sense. 'Regional brewers require both critical mass and strong brands in order to compete effectively in the new environment.' Morland had neither - and it faced serious strategic difficulties as a small independent brewer, Mr Redman claimed. Its 300 pubs, and the limited penetration of the free trade by its Old Speckled Hen ale, were not enough to justify the continued operations of its brewery. Greene King's IPA and Abbot ales had a strong market position, with more than 55 per cent of sales outside the brewer's own 825 pubs. High utilisation of its brewery capacity gave it low-cost production. Merging the adjacent pub estates and closing Morland's Abingdon brewery would bring cost savings and improved margins that would boost trading profits by an initial Pounds 2.5m a year, Mr Redman claimed. Greene King's offer - a multiple of 21 times Morland's 1991 earnings and a premium of 51 per cent on the company's share price when abortive merger talks began in February - was generous, he said. Sir Humphrey Prideaux, Morland's chairman, dismissed it as 'an opportunistic attempt to acquire the company on the cheap.' Morland based its defence on its record of the past five years: annual earnings growth of 17 per cent, dividend growth of 16.6 per cent, gearing of only 8.1 per cent and cash deposits of Pounds 9m. The company had achieved the best earnings per share growth in the sector and substantially outperformed Greene King, it said, taunting the predator with its refusal to reveal its 1991-92 profits. Greene King was later forbidden from publishing its results by the Takeover Panel but described Morland's forecast of a 28 per cent rise in profits this year as 'feeble and lacklustre.' Morland's past record was no guide to future prospects in a more competitive industry, it said. But the Oxfordshire brewer was shoring up its defences against such charges. It announced a deal with Courage covering the sale of a minimum 5,000 barrels a year of Old Speckled Hen, and the brewing of 20,000 barrels of Courage beers a year at Abingdon. The deal would generate initial annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 800,000, it was claimed. Morland followed up with the Pounds 16.9m purchase of 72 pubs from Inntrepreneur Estates, increasing its tied estate by nearly 25 per cent. The pubs, it forecast, would make a substantial and growing contribution to profits. There has been some angry skirmishing around these main lines of attack and counter-attack: over Morland's net asset value and Greene King's unsuccessful forays into leisure businesses, for example. When the dust settles today, however, it would be no surprise to see Morland emerge, after Devenish and Invergordon, as the third UK drinks company in little more than a year to defy the odds against its survival.</p>

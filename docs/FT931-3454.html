			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Leading Article: German pain postponed WITH BROAD smiles and much fraternal back-slapping, Germany's political establishment has demonstrated that its famed consensual model lives on. Many observers feared that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's solidarity talks were an excuse for inaction in addressing Germany's mounting fiscal problems. But this weekend's package confounds them by raising income tax 7.5 per cent, through a reintroduced solidarity surcharge from January 1 1995, and by increasing public borrowing for east Germany by some DM60bn. Yet these actions do not solve Germany's problem. For while the agreement brings some clarity to the fiscal muddle, it does so mainly by illuminating the fact that Germany's structural budget deficit is here to stay. The solidarity pact must be judged first in political terms. The minds of both main political parties have been concentrated by the large falls in their combined vote in the recent Hesse municipal elections. On these terms, the cross-party deal, finalised in 2 1/2 days of fraught negotiations, was an admirable success. Mutual compromises have enabled the government to squeeze from western Germany's federal and state budgets the extra DM110bn it needed to finance transfers to the eastern states in 1995. It also rebalances the division of tax revenues between the federal and lander governments. Economic fudge Yet it is unlikely that the Bundesbank's medium-term fiscal fears will be allayed by Mr Kohl's agreement, even if the bank is convinced that falling output and moderating western wage demands justify faster rate cuts now and is therefore prepared to bow to increased political pressure to accelerate the slow easing of short-term interest rates that has been under way since last September. Good politics the pact may be, but in economic terms it bears all the hallmarks of an unsatisfactory and misconceived fudge. Judged as a solution to the problem of sharing the burden of transfers to the east, it is unbalanced, vague and almost certainly insufficient. Almost all of the extra financing will come from higher taxes and increased borrowing, while Germany's fat welfare budget will remain untouched. Half of the modest DM9.2bn in spending cuts comes from concealed tax increases achieved by cutting tax allowances; another DM1.8bn is dubiously expected to come from reduced welfare fraud; and at least DM1bn in spending cuts will come from sources as yet unspecified. The package is expected to reduce the federal budget deficit to DM63.8bn in 1995, DM7.8bn higher than previously forecast. But the projections are based on the overly optimistic assumption that output will grow by 3 per cent in both 1994 and 1995, despite the higher taxes and long-term interest rates that the package is likely to inflict on west German industry. If the economy recovers at a more realistic 2 per cent a year, then the total 1995 deficit, forecast at 4 1/2 per cent of GDP, looks decidedly structural. Deeper problem The structural deficit is evidence of a deeper problem. Domestic demand in the east now exceeds eastern production by 87 per cent. But rather than trying to close that gap, the pact merely finds a less-than-satisfactory means of financing it. Productivity in east German manufacturing industry is 70 per cent below that in west Germany and engineering wages already stand at 70 per cent of those in the west. But rather than trying to close the gap between eastern wage costs and productivity, the pact merely finds ways to continue subsidising east Germany's 'core' but unprofitable industries. The sad fact is that German-style consensus, while adept at tinkering with the symptoms, is still failing to solve the underlying problem that is undermining the east German economy - the rapid pace of convergence of wages between the eastern and western lander. And while the government celebrates its success, IG Metall, the engineering union, continues to plan a series of strikes next month in support of a 26 per cent pay rise for those of its eastern members who still have a job. Unless this process is arrested, and the threatened strikes are averted, then Germany's solidarity pact could quickly unravel.</p>

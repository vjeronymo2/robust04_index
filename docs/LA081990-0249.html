			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S UP, HE'S DOWN, HE'S UP AGAIN;  </P> <P> AFTER A ROCKY YEAR, CHRISTIAN SLATER REGAINS HIS FOOTING WITH THE NEW TEEN  ANGST TALE, "PUMP UP THE VOLUME"  </P> <P> "I'm going do-o-o-o-o-wn in a blaze of glory!" Christian Slater was wobbly  crooning at the top of his lungs, "Take me n-o-o-o-o-w, but know the truth. . .  ."  </P> <P> Sitting in a Westwood cappuccino cafe, sipping black coffee and chain-smoking  Marlboros, the likable young actor couldn't resist singing along to the Jon Bon  Jovi hit from "Young Guns II," which was blaring over the cafe sound system.  After all, Slater is one of the stars of the current brat-pack Western.  </P> <P> But what really has Slater revved up is his other new film, "Pump Up the  Volume," a bold celebration of adolescent Angst which casts Slater as the  fiendish wizard behind a rabble-rousing pirate radio station. Following in the  footsteps of such teen-anarchy classics as "Rebel Without a Cause," "Over the  Edge" and last year's "Heathers," (which also starred Slater) "Pump" is one of  those rare Hollywood films which captures kids' wildly jumbled emotions without  dismissing them as sex-crazed maniacs.  </P> <P> "That's what I loved about the script -- the writing was so real," says Slater,  an affable 20-year-old with a handsome, open face and a self-deprecating sense  of humor. "It was a fascinating character to play, because I was really acting  like Superman. I was meek and mild on the outside, but a hero on the inside."  </P> <P> It's no wonder Slater had a soft spot for a heroic role. In real life, he's  been singing the blues so much he'd easily swap all his rock-star dreams for a  session with Frank Sinatra.  </P> <P> "I really love his song, 'That's Life,' " says Slater, firing up a fresh  cigarette. "If I had a theme song, that would be it. It's perfect -- at least  it's the perfect song for me."  </P> <P> Remember the lyrics? The guy who's sky-high in April, shot down in May? Each  time he finds himself flat on his face, he picks himself up and gets back in  the race?  </P> <P> If you want to talk about falling flat, just ask Christian Slater. By the time  he turned 20, he had won praise acting opposite Sean Connery in "The Name of  the Rose," Jeff Bridges in "Tucker" and Winona Ryder in "Heathers."  </P> <P> But away from the set, his life was spiraling out of control.  </P> <P> Last December he was arrested after leading sheriff's deputies on a wee-hours  chase that ended with Slater's car crashing into two telephone poles. Slater  was sentenced to 10 days in jail and placed on five years probation after  pleading no contest to his second drunken driving charge in two years.  </P> <P> People who worked with Slater doing publicity for "Heathers" say he was  constantly chaperoned because "we never knew what he would do next." Allan  Moyle, who directed Slater in "Pump Up the Volume," added: "Christian drank a  lot every night, but hey -- he was 19 years old. He never drank on the set --  he was not a problem for us at all."  </P> <P> Still, by the time he landed in jail on his second drunken driving offense,  Slater knew he was in trouble. "It was a horrible experience," he says quietly,  staring at his coffee. "You look at yourself and say, 'Why am I being so  self-destructive?' My values had really gotten a little messed up.  </P> <P> "I was cruel to my friends. I did all sorts of unproductive things. Who knows  -- I could've gone down that road even further, to real self-destruction. I  could've wound up dead."  </P> <P> Slater says he sought treatment for alcohol abuse and now wryly announces: "I'm  retired from drinking.  </P> <P> "I just looked at the people I'd hurt or neglected and all that stuff piles up  until you finally say, 'Whoa!' Drinking is a disease. It's a degrading way of  life -- and it took me to hit emotional bottom to overcome it."  </P> <P> Slater knows he has a rocky road ahead. But he's relishing the praise he's  receiving for "Pump Up the Volume," a daring film about a shy teen outsider who  uses a pirate radio station to inspire his schoolmates and overwhelm an  oppressive high-school principal.  </P> <P> "It's been nice to hear good things about the movie," he said, regaining his  good cheer. "And it's good to be able to enjoy it. I could have everything in  the world and it wouldn't mean anything if I wasn't able to be happy. Now that  I care about myself, I can care a lot for other people too.  </P> <P> "I guess you could say I'm working on my self-esteem and my courage and on how  to learn from situations." He smiled wanly. "And that can keep you pretty  </P> <P> busy."  </P> <P> Allan Moyle's phone rings constantly and a string of messengers keep knocking  at his door. Moyle keeps busy these days too. Wandering around his house, he's  still a little punchy after flying back from Atlanta, where he pulled an  all-nighter doing script revisions on "Love Crimes," a Sean Young and Patrick  Bergin film being directed by his old friend, Lizzie Borden.  </P> <P> But the amiable 42-year-old filmmaker is happy to talk about "Pump Up the  Volume," a movie clearly close to his heart -- and a picture that could revive  his career. A Canadian writer-director who got his start acting in Off-Broadway  plays and low-budget films, Moyle arrived in New York just as the cultural  turbulence of the late-'60s was reaching its peak.  </P> <P> "I came from a very small town in Canada and suddenly being in New York was  like being in Rio at carnival time," he said, savoring the memory. "It was very  intense." For a time, Moyle worked in a psychiatric hospital "where I blended  right in with the general population." After moving back to Canada, he began  making docudramas and low-budget features, influenced by maverick filmmakers  like John Cassavetes and Andy Warhol.  </P> <P> In 1980, Moyle got his big shot -- and flopped. He was hired to direct the  much-ballyhooed "Times Square," a bungled, implausible portrayal of teen  runaways on the lam in New York, adorned with a noisy, uninspired rock sound  track.  </P> <P> "I had a rotten time," he acknowledged. "And I just figured I wasn't combative  enough to be a director." In fact, after he'd finished writing "Pump," Moyle  needed some persuading to climb back into the director's chair. "I just needed  to feel comfortable and happily my producers were eager to help. Best of all,  we reached an agreement -- a pretty radical one -- that if we couldn't find a  dynamite kid, we wouldn't make the movie."  </P> <P> Because "Pump Up the Volume's" pivotal scenes feature its hero, alone in his  darkened basement, preaching to the teen faithful on his pirate radio station,  Moyle knew he needed a genuine actor -- someone blessed with both stamina and  charisma. "I was really worried about spending nine weeks with some kid I  couldn't stand," Moyle said. "I won't name names. But pick a lousy teen comedy  actor and imagine what could've happened."  </P> <P> Enter Christian Slater. "I had lunch with him and he was so witty and sexy and  mysterious that I knew right away we could stop looking," said Moyle. "He's a  natural. He's not into all that deep method-acting stuff. He brought a lot of  humor and freshness to the part."  </P> <P> The character Slater plays is a tongue-tied loner who finds solace -- and  ultimately finds himself -- in the cloistral world of his pirate radio  broadcasts. His raffish monologues, which mock authority, offer spiritual  advice and eloquently ponder the mysteries of sex, were inspired by a pair of  Moyle's early heroes.  </P> <P> "I wanted a marriage between two of my favorite outsiders -- Lenny Bruce and  Holden Caulfield," Moyle explained. "I learned more from one Lenny Bruce album  than any course I ever had at university.  </P> <P> "I wanted to make a movie that had an edge to it. I like all those John Hughes  movies, but I always thought they were a little too -- well -- pink. They  could've been tougher. When we were doing 'Pump,' I kept pleading with my  producer, 'Please, can't we just offend 10 or 15% of the audience?' "  </P> <P> Moyle chuckled impishly: "I have to admit I'd be secretly gratified if some  people get upset and say, 'I'm not gonna let my kid see that movie!' "  </P> <P> It's refreshing to see that for all his hard-earned maturity, Christian Slater  can still act like a kid. Roaming around Westwood, he spied the "Young Guns II"  theater marquee and immediately dragged his visitor in the opposite direction,  convinced it would be hopelessly square to be seen near the theater.  </P> <P> Earlier that afternoon, while being interviewed, his mouth suddenly dropped  open. "Whoa!" he said, fumbling with a fresh cigarette. It quickly became clear  what had happened -- he'd spotted a pretty girl walking down the street.  </P> <P> Slater's reputation as a budding ladies man was cemented by no less an  authority than his mother, who told Rolling Stone last year: "I think girls are  Christian's major hobby."  </P> <P> If you believe what you read in his publicity files, Slater's been romantically  involved with Winona Ryder (his co-star in "Heathers"), Kim Walker (a star of  TV's "The Outsiders") and Samantha Mathis, his co-star in "Pump Up the Volume."  </P> <P> Slater insists his amorous activities have been exaggerated. "I'm a pretty  faithful guy," he insisted. "If I have a girlfriend, as I do now, I stay away  from other girls. That doesn't mean I'm not going to observe the beauty around  me -- I mean, I wouldn't be human. But I'm just not capable of cheating."  </P> <P> Perhaps worried that this pronouncement sounded wildly old-fashioned, Slater  hurriedly added: "Now if I don't have a girlfriend, then things are different.  Anything goes!"  </P> <P> Despite reports that Slater and Mathis were inseparable during the making of  "Pump," Slater downplayed talk of romance. "What we really did was go back to  her trailer and read together. It was new for me, 'cause I've never been much  of a reader. But it was really fun. We'd sit around and read books like Ann  Rice's 'Interview With a Vampire' together."  </P> <P> Slater also laughed off reports that visitors to the "Pump" set were instructed  not to speak to him -- or look him in the eye for fear of ruining his  concentration. "Nah," he says. "That's a lot of malarkey. I don't go crazy  doing these parts. I'm not gonna rape some 13-year-old girl 'cause that's what  my character does in some script.  </P> <P> "I've gotten to the point where I know it's only a movie, so I try to keep  things in perspective. I don't beat myself up. In fact, I have the most fun  when the camera starts rolling, 'cause I just try myself and enjoy doing my  job. I figure I'm lucky being able to do something that I love."  </P> <P> Still, he admits he was intimidated having to work -- at age 15 -- opposite the  incomparable Sean Connery in "The Name of the Rose."  </P> <P> "Oh, geez, it was the worst," he says, gulping down some coffee. "I love that  movie, but it was just hell making it. All I remember is that I was freezing,  feeling incredibly scared and insecure, and standing next to Sean Connery  thinking, 'How in the world did I get here?' "  </P> <P> Slater wagged his head. "The first night I met Sean I was trying to act so  relaxed and I immediately knocked this huge glass of red wine right into the  man's lap."  </P> <P> Slater rolled his eyes. "I think from that moment on my body just went into  shock for the rest of the movie."  </P> <P> Even though Slater has starred in a few clinkers along the way, like "Gleaming  the Cube," his sweet disposition has won him a loyal fan club.  </P> <P> "He's just a doll," says Denise DiNovi, who produced "Heathers" and now heads  director Tim Burton's production company. "He doesn't have that arrogance that  a lot of teen actors get. He's very humble, incredibly professional and very  sensitive to other people. A lot of actors have charisma or great looks, but  Christian has an incredible intensity level that separates him from everybody  else."  </P> <P> He even has a sturdy sense of humor. When reminded of how critics poked fun at  his Jack Nicholson-impression in "Heathers," Slater took the ribbing in stride.  "You'd think after all the press I got that I would've at least heard from the  guy," he said with a laugh. "But no-o-o-o-o. Not even a friggin' phone call.  What's he -- too busy to call?"  </P> <P> If there's one aspect of moviemaking Slater hasn't learned to handle, it's the  geeky outfits his characters -- especially the kid in "Pump" -- have to wear.  "Geez, my clothes were just awful," he groaned. "My tank top was so loose it  was hanging below my nipples half the time. And those bowling shirts -- ughhh!  Were they ugly!"  </P> <P> So wouldn't you know it that Slater's next film, "Prince of Thieves," casts him  as Will Scarlett, one of Robin Hood's band of merry men. Slater is excited  about the part. There's just one tiny deal breaker -- those 12th-Century  Sherwood Forest duds.  </P> <P> "I definitely want to stress that. I am not wearing any tights! Make sure you  put it in the story so I get the message across. You read it here -- no  tights!"  </P> <P> Slater flashed a lopsided grin. "No kidding. If you see anyone wearing tights  in that film, it ain't me!"  </P></p>

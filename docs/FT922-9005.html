			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Business phone lines may use grid NATIONAL Grid Company plans to use the electricity network of England and Wales to supply large companies with an alternative telephone network. The company, which owns and operates the electricity grid in England and Wales, said yesterday it would set up a subsidiary called Telecom Electric to develop this business. National Grid is the latest company to apply for a telecommunications licence, following the government's decision last year to open the market to competition. Until then BT, the UK's largest telecommunications group, and Mercury Communications, its smaller rival, had exclusive rights to provide basic telephone services. Telecom Electric would lay telecommunication cables alongside its existing electricity cables, but does not have any plans to supply domestic consumers. 'We are only looking at a particular sector of the market,' National Grid stressed. 'We would supply major organisations that already have their own networks, for example between their different sites.' The company said the project was quite distinct from its earlier plans, in conjunction with the regional electricity companies of England and Wales, to invest about Pounds 400m in a complete telecommunications network. 'That was a year ago; this is much smaller,' the company said. Last month the two Scottish electricity companies became the first in the sector to apply for telecommunications licences. Earlier this month Yorkshire Electric, a supply company, took a minority stake in Ionica, a private group which has been awarded a licence to provide a telecommunications service using radio links. Two other utilities, British Rail and British Waterways, have also applied for licences.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Portillo hopes for future tax cut: Treasury secretary stresses government's need to establish sound finances MR MICHAEL PORTILLO, the chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday said the government planned to go into the next general election holding out the prospect of tax cuts. But this could only be achieved by cutting the existing level of government borrowing and establishing sound finances. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Portillo did not rule out tax increases in the November 30 Budget as part of a strategy to bring the state's finances into order. With tax and spending policy an increasingly contentious issue within the Tory party, the chief secretary cautioned against optimism that this year's public sector borrowing requirement would be less than the Pounds 50bn forecast in the March Budget. Rightwing Tory MPs have been warning the government against tax increases in the Budget and urging spending cuts. But yesterday Mr Portillo, who is one of the remaining rightwing members of the cabinet, underlined that it would be extremely difficult to keep public expenditure within the limits already fixed. He said it was 'essential for the Conservative government to go into the next election with a reputation for sound public finance and in a position where it can explain that it has the public finances in a state where it can plausibly show the path to a low-tax economy'. 'To put ourselves in the best position either to cut taxes or to hold out the prospect of cutting taxes, we need to make sure that borrowing is reducing at a fast enough rate,' he said. The government might have done enough already to achieve this, but it would have to review the situation in the autumn. Its fundamental principle had to be the maintainance of sound public finances and its 'first port of call' in achieving this must be public spending constraint. Sound finances would flow from 'a combination of recovery, public spending restraint and some amount of revenue-raising'. Mr Portillo stressed the difficulties facing the government in holding down public spending. He also warned that the Treasury had already 'factored in' economic recovery into its estimates of the PSBR during the years ahead. 'If the recovery is stronger than we anticipated, then public borrowing will come down a little bit faster,' he said. 'But on any scenario, we are going to be borrowing rather large sums of money for rather a long period of time. I'm looking at an increase of our debt service burden of about Pounds 10bn over the next four years. And that is money that cannot be spent on programmes.' Mr Portillo was concerned that critics inside the Conservative party underestimated the government's task of aiming to hold to the 'control totals' of Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.3bn that it set a year ago for public spending in 1994-95 and 1995-95 respectively. Mr Portillo said the government could not take comfort from Britain's better-than-expected inflation performance. 'For the time being, we would expect inflation in the years ahead to be a little higher than we expected in July 1992 (when the control totals were set) because of the loss of value in the currency' since the departure of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Nor was he lulled into complacency by last month's better than expected public sector borrowing figures which have prompted many City analysts to pitch their expectations of the PSBR below the Pounds 50bn envisaged by the government for this financial year and the Pounds 44bn forecast for 1994-95.

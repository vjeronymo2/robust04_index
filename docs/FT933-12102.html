			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sun rises on a new financial era in Tokyo - Robert Thomson examines moves by three Japanese banks in the securities business WHEN LTCB Securities opens the door on a new financial era in Japan today, employees will be wearing uniforms distinctively different from that of their parent institution, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. 'The uniforms have to be not only a different colour, but a different style,' explained Mr Shigeaki Katagiri, president of LTCB Securities. 'This is part of the firewall between the bank and the securities subsidiary. We also cannot call on a client together with a bank official. It has to be separate.' Three Japanese banks open securities subsidiaries for business today. But, as the finance ministry's strict dress code suggests, they will be limited in their operations out of deference to a broking industry still badly bruised by the collapse of the Tokyo stock market. But Mr Katagiri is enthusiastic about the opportunities created by financial deregulation, as are his counterparts at IBJ Securities, a subsidiary of the Industrial Bank of Japan, and Norinchukin Securities, owned by the central agriculture bank. All three operations have found new offices down the street or across the road from their parent bank. Before the stock market crash, these banks were to be allowed to house their securities subsidiaries at head office, but by the time the Financial System Reform Act became effective in April this year, the guidelines had been changed, and tougher controls were imposed on dealings between broker and bank. In return for the banks' entry into broking, existing brokers are allowed to establish trust bank subsidiaries, though they will not be allowed immediate access to special large-lot securities trusts and special loan trusts in which public funds are invested, protecting the territory of the trust banks. The guiding principle of financial reform in Japan is to maintain a balance between new opportunities and the old players. As a result, only two long-term credit institutions and the agricultural bank will open securities subsidiaries today, while other commercial banks may have to wait another year or two. These new broking companies are not permitted to deal in stocks, but can trade in straight bonds, and underwrite, though not trade in, convertible bonds and warrant bonds. The finance ministry has promised a gradual easing of restrictions, with timing determined by the general health of securities markets. Mr Astuyoshi Yatsunami, president of IBJ Securities, is 'not optimistic' about profits for the next two to three years, but 'in due course' expects earnings to improve. For IBJ, the opening of a securities subsidiary is heavy with history, as it underwrote the first batch of Manchurian Railway bonds in 1907 and has always seen itself as more than a bank. IBJ's close links to leading Japanese companies had prompted concern among brokers, who thought it had an unfair advantage and wanted the firewalls to be as thick as possible. One limitation is that IBJ Securities cannot lead manage a bond issue for smaller companies for whom IBJ is also the lead commissioned bank. 'We hope that after two to three years, some of the conditions will be eased,' Mr Yatsunami said. 'The global tendency is to have more deregulation in financial markets. We hope this will be gradually realised in Japan.' The emergence of the three institutions comes against the background of banks having worked in the past to limit the growth of the domestic corporate bond market, seen as a threat to their role as companies' main source of funds. Restrictions were imposed on the type of instrument and length of maturity to protect the traditional markets of the three differing banks, the long-term credit, trust and commercial. Financial reform has changed the terms of that relationship and reshuffled banks' vested interests, as Mr Katagiri explained. He said Japanese companies have more choice in fund raising, and banks are aware of the shift towards tapping the capital markets. He expects the new companies will profit from the expansion of the domestic corporate bond market, particularly the secondary market, while LTCB Securities will use expertise gained from the Euromarkets to introduce new products in Japan. However, the finance ministry has been slow to accept new products, and LTCB may have to push hard for the approval of innovation. US and European brokers complain that, in other markets, an action is allowed unless specifically prohibited, but, in Japan, an action is forbidden unless specifically permitted by the powerful ministry. 'Compared to the new issue market, the secondary bond market is almost non-existent in Japan. Developing the secondary market is a priority for the development of the new issue market. Compared to the size of the economy, the new issue market is very small,' he said. Employees at the new companies have been drawn from the international securities operations of the banks, as well as from the medium-sized brokers with which they have close ties. For example, IBJ has close ties to Wako Securities, New Japan Securities, and Okasan Securities. IBJ Securities has 140 employees, LTCB Securities 85, and Norinchukin Securities 42. Norinchukin plans to take advantage of its rural roots to offer underwriting services 'mainly with the agriculture and marine-related industries', but intends to provide a similar range of services to the other two houses.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT THE BANK BROKING UNITS CAN DO  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Primary       Secondary                             market          market  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Straight bonds                 Yes             Yes Convertible bonds              Yes              No Warrant bonds                  Yes              No Stocks                          No              No Stock index                     No              No  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CORPORATE BOND ISSUES IN JAPAN  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Issues          Amount  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989                            28          Y749bn 1990                            21          Y729bn 1991                            52        Y2,066bn 1992                            63        Y2,427bn 1993                           106        Y3,820bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bond Underwriters' Association of Japan.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Personal View: No Teflon for Bush George Bush must be asking himself what went wrong. Why are voters so angry? Can the problem be fixed? Or must he face the ignominy of becoming only the second elected incumbent to lose the presidency in 60 years? The answer to the first question is the economy. Polls reveal a widespread belief that the economy performed poorly under Mr Bush's stewardship. The White House, somewhat peevishly, argues that conclusion is unfair and inaccurate. The evidence provides some comfort for the president's defenders. When Mr Ronald Reagan was running for re-election in 1984, the unemployment rate average was 7.6 per cent and inflation was 4.6 per cent. The sum of the two rates, the famous misery index, was 12.3. During the first eight months of 1992, the jobless rate was 7.4 per cent and inflation 2.9 per cent, a more modest misery index of 10.3. Moreover, federal debt nearly tripled in the Reagan years, three separate tax increases were enacted and the federal budget was in a chronic state of confrontation, stalemate and missed deadlines. Today, however, the White House has lost the Reagan magic, because it has no favourable answer to Mr Reagan's central campaign question of 1980: are you better off than you were five years ago? It was Reagan's genius to understand the political power of that question. To gauge public satisfaction with the economy, I have constructed a measure of 'feel-good' consumption (see table). This somewhat arbitrary measure subtracts from per capita consumption those categories that contribute little to consumer satisfaction: outlays for household utilities, some transport costs (including commuting expenses and car repair), medical costs (including insurance premiums), legal fees and private education. The Reagan years are instructive. The high unemployment, tax increases, poor productivity, collapsing trade balance, breakdown in fiscal responsibility and even the occasional nap at a cabinet meeting did not matter much when feel-good consumption was rising so fast. It was the key ingredient in Mr Reagan's celebrated Teflon. By contrast, with falling feel-good consumption during Bush's presidency, it matters less to be the hero of Kuwait and to have presided over the end of the cold war. Mr Bush must manage his presidency without Teflon. His problem of lagging living standards is not amenable to quick fixes such as easier credit. In the 1980s, sharp increases in the federal deficit, in the trade deficit and in foreign borrowing helped feel-good consumption return to robust growth rates. In effect, the US was propping up its living standards with a flood of imports and a mountain of debt. That game cannot be played indefinitely. Consumption growth faster than total output growth is inherently temporary. Foreign debts must be serviced and the trade deterioration reversed. The process is symmetrical. To make room for the accelerated growth in exports and the slowdown in imports, consumption growth must lag the overall economy. The correction process has already begun. Since 1988, feel-good consumption has declined while real exports have risen at a strong 7 per cent annual rate. Without increases in domestic and foreign debt to support consumption growth, gains in living standards will again be governed by productivity growth, which has lagged badly in the past 20 years. US economic policy, therefore, is at a fork in the road. One direction continues high public deficits, low private saving and investment, poor productivity growth, and slow gains in living standards. The other involves reducing the public deficit, higher private saving and investment, rising productivity growth, and (with a lag) accelerating increases in living standards. The political key to the apparently attractive second option is the lag between higher saving and higher consumption. It could be eight years or more before higher saving and investment would result in more robust growth in feel-good consumption; in the meantime, living standards would be even lower than in the first option. As a result, no matter what national economic policy is adopted, feel-good consumption will fall short of public expectations in the 1990s. And it will be even tougher in 1996 to run for president representing the incumbent party. As former secretary of state Mr George Shultz once observed: 'An economist's lag may be a politician's catastrophe.' The author is chief economist at First National Bank of Chicago.  ------------------------------------------      GROWTH IN FEEL-GOOD CONSUMPTION      (inflation adjusted; per capita)  ------------------------------------------ Term              President         %  ------------------------------------------ Jan 61-Nov 64   Kennedy/Johnson   9.5 Jan 65-Nov 68       Johnson      14.6 Jan 69-Nov 72        Nixon       10.0 Jan 73-Nov 76     Nixon/Ford      2.9 Jan 77-Nov 80       Carter        3.5 Jan 81-Nov 84       Reagan       10.1 Jan 85-Nov 88       Reagan        9.3 Jan 89-Aug 92        Bush        -2.3  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Parties rely on traditional voters in local elections THE THREE main political parties sought to portray themselves as efficient providers of services yesterday as the local-election campaign entered its final stretch. At the end of a low-key election campaign, marked by the parties' determination to get their supporters to vote, rather than to make mass converts, each re-emphasised its traditional areas of appeal. Mr John Redwood, the local-government minister, illustrated the Tories' central message, that Conservative councils cost less, with figures showing that most of the Labour and Liberal Democrat-controlled councils up for election were spending above standard spending assessments (SSAs)  - government estimates of what councils need to spend to provide services  - while most of the Tory ones were budgeting below SSAs. Labour countered by highlighting the provision in areas such as personal social services by Labour-controlled authorities, and warning that some Tory councils chose not to provide a service in, for example, nursery education. Both opposition parties insist that the political complexion of councils still matters because they can act as 'buffers' against the decisions of central government. In a signal that ministers intend to maintain their tight controls on local-government spending, Mr Redwood also emphasised the importance of local authorities' discretion in deciding how to allocate the funds within the total spent. The parties also clashed over the defection to the Conservatives of Mr Alan Winmill, leader of the Labour group on Wiltshire County Council. Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, welcomed Mr Winmill's decision, but Mr John Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, dismissed him as 'a somewhat obscure Labour councillor', and said his decision was of little consequence. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, spoke of 'restrained optimism' as the party repeated its claims of low morale among Labour workers. The Liberal Democrats predict, however, that they will make more gains from the Tories, as they hold more of the seats being contested this time. Mr Cunningham referred to potential demoralisation among Liberal Democrats, saying that the party 'spent the (general election) campaign boasting about how well it was going to do, and actually lost ground significantly'. Mr Jim Wallace, MP for Orkney and Shetland, is to become leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, it was announced yesterday. Mr Wallace takes over from Mr Malcolm Bruce, MP for Gordon.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / The city that 'makes the money Beijing spends': Andrew Gowers and Tony Walker on Shanghai, a laboratory of social and economic change Mr Xu Kuangdi has a neat way of summing up the relationship between his sprawling port city and China's central government. 'In Shanghai we make money: in Beijing they spend it,' he says. Mr Xu, Shanghai's first vice mayor in charge of the economy and an exemplar of the new breed of modernising official, might also trumpet his city's role as something of a laboratory of economic and social change. In China's latest growth phase, Shanghai, under an innovative municipal leadership, has emerged as a place where the authorities have made greater progress than other cities in formulating new housing and welfare policies. With state industries undergoing painful rationalisation, and unemployment rising in China's cities, there is scarcely a more pressing issue than the provision of a rudimentary social security net. Mr Xu, a 56-year-old former professor in metallurgy and a man tipped for higher office, would be the first to admit there is still a long way to go; but he believes that the municipal government is making progress in its efforts to build a rudimentary social security system. Shanghai's workers are now required to pay 5 per cent of their monthly salaries - matched by a 7 per cent contribution from the enterprises themselves - into an unemployment fund administered by the local Bureau of Social Security. Separate funds have been established for health, housing and pensions, with their assets to be invested in infrastructure and utility projects both in Shanghai and beyond - thus playing their part in the much-needed effort to improve the city's power generation and transport facilities. Many of those laid off are sent for retraining so they can transfer to growing sectors of the local economy such as service industries. Older workers - men over 50 and women over 45 - are pensioned off and transferred to the care of their local communities, which provide a living allowance: already 30,000 pensioners have been dealt with in this way. Shanghai modelled its new social security arrangement on Singapore's compulsory savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund, and from studying social security systems in Japan, France, Germany, the UK and Canada. But though proud of Shanghai's 'pioneering' efforts, Mr Xu is wary of the suggestion that the experiment could readily be extended to other Chinese provinces which are, in any case, developing their own schemes. 'China is so big and its development is so uneven. Also economic structures and living standards are quite different. So making a national scheme would be difficult,' he says. 'Finally, in 30 or 40 years when we've all developed, we ought to be able to find a common system. But in the meantime there are dangers in the poor provinces always looking to the rich provinces for help. They have to work hard to improve themselves . . .' In any case, Mr Xu insists that Shanghai - with one of the highest per capita annual incomes in China - has long paid more than its dues to assist the centre in evening out regional imbalances. In the early 1980s, it was providing more than 89 per cent of locally collected taxes to Beijing, a burden that contributed to Shanghai's stunted development during those years. Now, under a new 'tax treaty' between the centre and the provinces, the figure is down to a more tolerable 60 per cent. Mr Xu and his colleagues are also evolving a neat if unsentimental way of dealing with their most troublesome state industries, namely those in the textile sector which, starved of investment, have fallen on hard times. Shanghai is restructuring the industry by moving labour-intensive tasks such as primary cotton-processing to inland provinces such as Sichuan and retaining the higher-value added business of manufacturing the final product in Shanghai. Does this not mean exploiting China's growing regional inequalities and taking advantage of cheap labour? Mr Xu, whose father was a factory boss before the 1949 revolution, grins and nods enthusiastically.  ------------------------------------           INCOME IN CHINA        Average per capita, 1992  ------------------------------------                              Yuan  ------------------------------------ Guangzhou                   3,183 Shanghai                    2,842 Beijing                     2,364 Tianjin                     2,080 National average            1,826  ------------------------------------ Source: State Statistical Bureau  ------------------------------------</p>

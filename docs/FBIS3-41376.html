Commission spokesman Mr Mukutulu Sinyani said in Lusaka  yesterday that officers pounced on Salim Ally Bakari on his  arrival from Bombay, India.    Bakari was on his way to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and was to  board a connecting flight tomorrow.    Mr Sinyani said Bakari had swallowed the drugs in a bid to  evade detection but the officers arrested him after a tip-off  from international sources.    The pellets of heroin with a street value of K24m were  released in a lavatory after Bakari swallowed medicine he was  induced to take.    Mr Sinyani said among the people who had been arrested for  trafficking by swallowing heroin, Bakari had swallowed most.    Bakari was a courier who had been sent by a well-known drug  baron in Tanzania and was promised a $2,000 reward.</p>

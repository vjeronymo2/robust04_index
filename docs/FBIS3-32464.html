The entire  huge network of influence, established when the USSR was one of  the world superpowers, continues to undoubtedly collapse, little  by little.    The 19 years of boycott harmed the postwar atmosphere and  only nourished the Cold War, contradicting the destiny of the  countries that, ultimately, live to coexist and not to nourish  the causes of misunderstandings. Almost two decades after the  day the United States withdrew from Vietnam, with the misfortune  of 58,000 deaths (compared to 1.3 million Vietnamese in the  north) and trauma that still prevails, the united Vietnam still  continues to be one of the poorest countries in the world, while  around it noncommunist countries in Southeastern Asia are  experiencing almost sustained development.    The commercial rapprochement between the United States and  Vietnam represents a major historic step toward their  reconciliation. Talks the past few years have always been  filled with passion. War veterans groups were the first to  repudiate Clinton's initiative due to doubts still surrounding  the fate of servicemen missing in action (the MIA's). According  to the war veterans, there are still 2,200 U.S. soldiers missing  in war whose fate, according to them, the Vietnamese Government  has done nothing to clarify. The discord will continue to exist  but efforts for an understanding have been strengthened.    Since late 1986, when the Vietnamese government renewed its  leadership, retiring old war heroes -- favorite disciples of  Uncle Ho, Secretary General Nguyen Van Linh has made  self-criticisms: "The leadership's task today has changed. The  style is also changing," he said as he proposed changes that  entailed dismantling the centralized bureaucracy, "based on  state subsidies that only brought suffering to the people." It  was quite common to find youths in Vietnam, thousands of them --  mathematicians, computer experts, engineers or specialized  workers -- in other brother socialist countries who, having  returned, could not find a job or were being employed to do  simple jobs. Moreover, the economic crisis, also aggravated by  the war against the Khmer Rouge, forced thousands of Vietnamese  to seek work abroad. The rice planted in the Mekong River is  not enough to supply the entire south. Vietnam survived thanks  to the constant aid granted by communist countries, until the  Soviet empire collapsed.    Early last year the government launched a campaign against  corruption, excessive red tape, the theft of government assets,  ineptitude, and the lack of democracy. Since then the  Vietnamese leadership has been seeking to adopt market economy  principles without giving up its single party system. The U.S.  embargo gradually was being lifted as envoys have held talks  with Vietnamese leaders since the Bush administration. It is a  good thing that President Clinton, who during his youth  protested against the Vietnamese war and did not enlist to  participate in it, has taken the decisive step to lift the  resentment that has existed since 1975.</p>

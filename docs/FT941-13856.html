			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Executive pay rises three times faster than inflation Britain's executives won average pay and fringe benefit increases worth 5.7 per cent last year, compared with an average increase of 3 per cent for the workforce as a whole. The executives' pre-tax pay boost is nearly four times the increase gained by public sector workers in 1993 under the government's 1.5 per cent pay policy. The scale of executive pay rises, disclosed in a survey of more than 400 companies, could spark political controversy. It comes as ministers are trying to impose a three year freeze on the public sector's pay bill, and as retail price increases run at less than 2 per cent annually. Despite calls by ministers and employer bodies for executives to set an example by tightening their belts, executives do not appear to have taken much notice, suggests the survey carried out for the Financial Times. The pay increases are disclosed in the latest quarterly executive pay index produced by the Sedgwick Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries. The index covers 5,200 executives in 411 companies. Total annual earnings of all managers up to chief executive level rose by 38.6 per cent over the past four years. Average annual executive income is now Pounds 85,188 compared with Pounds 80,577 a year ago, the survey shows. The average annual basic executive salary stands at Pounds 60,840 compared with Pounds 57,488 at the end of 1992. Executive benefits on top of basic salaries averaged Pounds 14,348 last year, or 27 per cent of their total remuneration. Performance related bonus payments, often linked to profits, rose by 16.7 per cent to an average value in December of Pounds 9,865. The largest pay rises last year, of 6.1 per cent, went to directors below the chief executive level in large companies with annual turnovers of over Pounds 600m. Their average total remuneration rose to Pounds 164,129 a year from Pounds 154,624, with their basic salary increasing to Pounds 117,461 from Pounds 111,450. Top staff beat RPI, Page 6</p>

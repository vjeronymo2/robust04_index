			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P places Citicorp paper under review STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, yesterday placed some of Citicorp's mortgage-backed securities under review for a possible downgrade because losses on the pool of loans secured by the securities have been worse than expected. Although about Dollars 1.3bn of Citicorp certificates are affected by the move, the banking group said yesterday that S&amp;P's decision to consider downgrading the securities reflected the performance of mortgages originated under old Citicorp mortgage programmes that were discontinued in 1991. Since then, the bank claims, the performance of its mortgage portfolio has improved. Earlier this year, Citicorp announced a Dollars 1bn non-recourse commitment with the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which was seen as a vote of confidence by Fannie Mae in Citicorp's mortgage business.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: American Airlines plans 900 temporary lay-offs AMERICAN Airlines, one of the big three US carriers, is planning to lay off temporarily 500 pilots and 400 maintainance workers by the year-end. This is the second announcement of pilot furloughs - that is, temporary lay-offs - this week from the nation's leading airlines, and underlines the gloom in the troubled sector in spite of signs of recovery in the US economy. On Monday, Delta Air Lines, the large Atlanta-based carrier, said it planned to cut 600 pilot jobs. News of the American cutbacks came from Mr Bob Crandall, the airline company's chairman. The carrier added that it planned to start implementing the job cuts in 'the next several months', and to have them completed by the year-end. Like Delta, American claims that the job reductions are necessitated by plans to scale down its domestic flight capacity - a response to the sluggish travel demand and lack of profitability on some routes. The Dallas-based airline announced recently it intended to ground 28 wide-body jets, and said yesterday that by 1994 there should a net reduction in its fleet (after taking account of new aircraft deliveries) of 14 aircraft from current levels. It is less clear what the implications of the reduction will be for American's flight attendants. The company operates a scheme whereby these employees can voluntarily take extended leaves of absence, and said it hoped this plan would reduce the number of lay-offs on the flight attendants' side. Earlier this year, American Airlines announced it was implementing a transition plan to reduce the domestic flights operations and take the airline out of particularly unprofitable markets, while building up non-airline revenue sources, such as management services.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALSE FALLS  </P> <P> This is to advise that the June 4 Travel Section ("Michigan's Picturesque Rock  Pile is a Boulder Place for a Nature Vacation") contained an erroneous caption  to the picture of Kakabeka Falls. The falls are not in the state of Michigan,  but rather in Ontario, Canada. They are about 20 miles due west of the area  known as Thunder Bay, just north of the Minnesota-Canada border.  </P> <P> NANCY G. MATHISEN  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

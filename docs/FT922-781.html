			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (7): Where the big numbers are - Market research into consumer spending OVER THE past 10 years, newspapers and magazines in India have given enormous publicity to what has been called the 'middle class boom'. But Marg, India's largest market research organisation, believes that the real boom in consumer spending will spring from the rural areas. 'Here are the really big numbers and the big bucks for companies,' says Mr Titoo Ahluwalia, the chairman of Marg. He says that once the problems of distribution and communication have been solved, rising household incomes and product brand awareness will produce a 'cluster of booms' in different parts of rural India. India has a population of 850m and in the past consumer spending was concentrated in the urban areas. But Marg is not alone in finding soaring demand from rural and semi-rural areas. Detergent producers like Hindustan Lever and biscuit manufacturers such as Britannia are experiencing far stronger sales growth outside urban India. Mr Ahluwalia believes the strong growth in sales will occur in products such as agricultural inputs (implements, fertilisers, pesticides), soft products (soaps, toothpaste and detergents), consumer durables (audios, kitchen gadgets, refrigerators, two wheelers) and pharmaceuticals. Of over-the-counter medicines, he says: 'Our studies repeatedly show big numbers in this sector.' Part of the growth stems from villagers abandoning traditional herbal medicines. Rural incomes have grown substantially in the past few years because of four good monsoons, debt relief measures for farmers and increasing government procurement prices. This year - depending on how widespread or bad the drought is - the growth will slow down or could fall. But over the longer period, substantial increases in agricultural productivity together with brand awareness should further boost both incomes and consumer spending. Marg sees the rapid penetration of television into the rural areas as being the major factor behind greater product awareness. Mr Ahluwalia cites a personal anecdote of a village in Goa of 87 households. Two years ago there were only two TV sets. Now there are 17. 'Young kids are asking about brands and products', he says. 'That is where the big boom is going to come from.' Market research presents unusual problems in a country of India's size and diversity. A typical project involves interviewing in four languages and a nationwide survey would require 18 languages. Marg, which does public opinion polling as well as market surveys, blew its own trumpet loudly when it forecast correctly the number of seats that Congress would win in the last general election. For market research purposes Marg classifies 'middle class' in India on different criteria from those used elsewhere. On a conventional western definition of 'middle class' as a household with a car, buying a house on a mortgage and taking a holiday by the sea, the Indian middle class is tiny. But on the basis of the segment of the population that purchases branded fast-moving consumer goods, it is very large. Marg warns that the Indian market has pitfalls of which the foreign investor is not immediately aware. General Foods discovered this in the mid-1980s when it launched Tang as a breakfast drink. It failed in India where milk is traditionally drunk in the early morning and people do not like mixing citrus with it. Indians equally have shown no interests in deodorants. They bathe once a day, and, says Marg, do not believe that 'natural fluids should be suppressed.' Mr Ahluwalia believes that British companies are failing to exploit British brand names which are deeply embedded in the past of rural India. 'British companies are sitting on some pretty powerful properties which they are being sluggish to exploit.' He says that British companies have shown a surprising lack of interest in exploring the Indian market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATED NUMBER OF USERS/BUYERS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Toilet soap                             540-580m Tooth paste/powder                      260-290m Purchases a year Cars                   200,000 Scooters, motor-cycles                      2-3m Bicycles                                    7-8m TV sets                                     4-5m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Marg  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lome, 2 Apr (AFP) -- The two opposition parties  forming a parliamentary majority after the February legislative  elections in Togo today decided to suspend "the participation of  their parliamentarians in the deliberations of the National  Assembly," in protest against the Supreme Court's invalidation  of the election of three of their deputies.    In a communique to AFP, the two parties stated that their  parliamentary boycott would last until "the situation is  clarified."    The opposition coalition, comprising the Action Committee  for  Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], had  won 43 (36 for the CAR and 7 for the UTD) out of 81  parliamentary seats. Currently the coalition has only 40 (34  for the CAR and 6 for the UTD) out of the 78 declared seats, but  it still retains a parliamentary majority.    The Constitution makes it binding on President Gnassingbe  Eyadema to appoint the future prime minister from within the  parliamentary majority. Consultations have been continuing in  this direction between President Eyadema and the opposition  leaders since 15 March, but so far have not progressed.    The CAR's Yaovi Agboyibor and the UTD's Edem Kodjo stated in  their communique that one of the election annulments by the  Supreme Court was "in flagrant violation" of the Electoral Law,  while the reasons put forward to justify the two other  annulments are, according to them, "poorly founded and devoid of  any weight."    In the first case, the court observed that the substitute  for  the elected parliamentarian was not eligible. In the other two  cases it was of the view that "disturbances" had "undermined the  sincerity of the polls."    According to the opposition, these incidents were "fomented"  by the pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally [RPT] and that "it is  inadmissible for the court to use this as a pretext for  questioning the validity of the polls."    Agboyigbor and Kodjo also deplored the fact that the  "consultative mechanism put in place before the elections to  ensure the "amicable" settlement of disputes had not been  "operational."    Finally, the UTD and the CAR "questioned" the "motives  behind  these maneuvers and the RPT's preparedness to play the  democratic game."    The appointment of a prime minister from the ranks of the  opposition would compel General Eyadema, who has been in power  since 1967, and who was reelected last August during an election  boycotted by the opposition, to accept a new arrangement for  cohabitation with the opposition in the governance of the  country.</p>

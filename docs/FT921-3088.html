			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (15): 'We would like to retain our dominant role' - Dr Thomas John, head of Nigeria's National Petroleum Corporation, talks to Edward Balls Edward Balls: What progress has been made in restructuring and commercialising the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation? Dr John: After many years of operating as a government agency, it cannot be easy suddenly to change into a commercialised institution - certainly not merely by government declaration. A lot of work has to go into changing the attitude of the management staff in the first instance and then all the way down to the shop-floor worker. We believe we have made substantial progress. Does NNPC intend to retain its dominant position in the oil sector? I believe that so long as we contribute 60 per cent to the funding of the joint venture companies, we will continue to play a dominant role. We have a Joint Operating Agreement (JoA) which recognises the rights of both parties and enables us to operate in a manner which does not subjugate the interests of either party to the other. We have a dominant role in the industry and we would like to retain it. The new JoA, which allows NNPC to take full control of its existing fields if it wishes, suggests NNPC wants more control. But at the same time you are negotiating production sharing contracts for the newly-allocated oil fields. Does this mean a less active role for NNPC in the future? No. It has all to do with how we use the limited resources at our disposal. For the next 30 to 40 years, we shall still be working on existing fields and operating the existing contracts guided by the JoA. If we can successfully take over a great portion of the existing fields, and there are many still undeveloped, then we will have made satisfactory progress. With the production sharing contract arrangement we do not have to invest money up-front. We leave that to the major oil companies, who will invest 100 per cent of the money required for exploration, appraisal and development. The terms, of course, will be made in such a way that it is attractive to them to take this front-end risk. How can you assure the foreign participants, who are considering signing these contracts, that you are not going to let them spend the money to find the oil and then take it all for NNPC? How can I assure anybody of anything in this life? It will not be this managing director or this government which comes up with a new idea about how the industry should be operated. A future government cannot be denied its freedom of action. What you are asking me is that I should make a commitment on their behalf. I will say I don't have the power. How successful has NNPC been in encouraging the development of indigenous, private sector Nigerian oil companies? Very successful. Two of these indigenous oil companies have made discoveries and are poised to move on to appraise the oil fields they have discovered. We believe that in the next three years they should be in production. Others have brought in foreign partners. I would say about 60 per cent of those allocated acreages are actively working on them. The record suggests that managing the oil refineries is a weak spot in NNPC's activities. What is being done to rectify matters? The problems in the management of the refineries arose out of the shortage of foreign exchange with which to procure the spare parts necessary to maintain them, and the very rapid development of the refining sector in the country. Within a period of eight years, we built three refineries and three petrochemical plants. But we were not able to train staff as quickly as we built the refineries. In the last three years we have not built any new plant and we have had the opportunity to train personnel. And we now have access to the foreign exchange we require to bring in spare parts quickly. Our operation of our refineries has improved considerably. Have you considered foreign participation in the refining industry? Has NNPC given up its aspirations to participate in the downstream refining of its crude oil in Europe or North America? For some time now we have nursed the idea of a joint Nigerian-foreign owned export refinery to provide jobs for our people and refined products for our sub-region. We are anxiously looking for partners who are willing to invest. We still have open the idea of investing in a foreign refinery, to secure a guaranteed outlets for our crude oil and also to share in the profits obtainable at the pump station. That adds value to our crude oil. We are still searching for the right buyer. You have been looking for some time now? Yes. We have been searching for some time now, and let's say we have not been lucky enough to find what we want. How successful has NNPC been in exploiting Nigeria's gas reserves? We have several plans for gas development. The only limitation we have is the financial resources to execute all the projects we have identified. The liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is one major project. We also plan to produce methanol, MTBE and NGL. These are being looked at by our joint venture partners, namely Shell, Chevron and Mobil. Locally we now supply gas to some of our thermal electric plants and there are several projects to bring gas to the Lagos industrial area. In another two to three years, we should have several industries supplied with gas from the Escravos-Lagos trunk line. The gas price that suppliers receive is set by the government at a very low level. Is liberalising the domestic gas price a necessary step in nurturing a flourishing domestic gas industry? At present, those companies which supply gas to the grid do so from non-associated gas sources. I don't think they have complained yet about the return on their investments. They supply it because they are making money. They are not missionaries. But we do not believe we should go ahead with exploiting non-associated gas while we flare associated gas. So the policy now is preferentially to exploit associated gas which costs a lot more to produce. To enable these companies to provide gas from associated gas sources, the government is seriously considering fiscal incentives which would make it profitable for them to do so, without increasing significantly the price of gas the government has fixed. Does Opec matter as much to Nigeria as it once did? Nigeria is committed to Opec - what else can I say when a Nigerian is president? It is still a useful organisation and there are times, I think, when consumers also value the assistance of Opec. After all who else would be there to make the sacrifices if Opec were not there? So Opec are being missionaries, are they? Well, that's what it would look like. The only true missionaries]</p>

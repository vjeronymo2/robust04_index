			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Appointments: Virani brothers leave Control Securities Nazmu, Zul, and Silu Virani are leaving the board of Control Securities, the property and leisure group which they rescued from the brink of liquidation in 1985. Although the brothers still own about 11 per cent of the company, it announced yesterday that they would step down as directors and executives. Trading in the company's shares has been suspended since October, when the Serious Fraud Office - investigating the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International - led a raid on the homes of the Virani brothers and Control's offices. Nazmu has been charged with involvement in a false accounting conspiracy. Nazmu has often been cited as the force behind the Virani success, but colleagues say the younger, lower-profile brothers have also been vital. They, like Nazmu, fled Idi Amin's Uganda in fear of their lives 20 years ago, having left behind a land-based wealth worth millions. Starting with a supermarket in Dulwich, London, the family business rapidly grew to become a property and leisure empire comprising 24 hotels, a brewery and 800 pubs. The Virani family is now worth more than Pounds 80m and Nazmu alone ranks among the wealthiest 100 people in the UK. However, the family's involvement in the pub business has raised some controversy within the Islam community - the brothers are all devout Ismaili Muslims - as drinking alcoholic beverages is strictly forbidden. Nazmu dismisses such concerns, saying his religion does not forbid him to make money. Zul, a small stocky man, held the post of managing director of the leisure division. This became the powerhouse of Control's growth following the collapse of the property market. Lean and lanky, Silu was the man behind Control's property successes in the heady days of the 1980s. Their resignations, along with Nazmu's, appear to have been the price which Control must pay to achieve a relisting. The Stock Exchange says this now depends on information regarding their successors. ***** Barbara Manfrey, formerly joint md of EM Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co International, has been appointed a director of APAX PARTNERS &amp; CO VENTURES. ***** John Bennett has been appointed head of compliance for Hill Samuel and a director of HILL SAMUEL BANK; he moves from Citibank. ***** KLEINWORT BENSON SECURITIES has appointed as directors Richard Allan, Yashwant Bajaj, Julian Brown, Edward Cumming-Bruce, Andrew Edmond, Albert Edwards, Maxwell Elvidge, Simon Fine, Robert Fowlds, Martin Graham, Peter Isard, Simon Mould, Darren Smith, Mark Stokes, and Simon Toller.

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUGHES ADMITS FAILURE OF PART CITED IN ENGINEER'S SUIT;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: THE DEFENSE FIRM SAID A TEST TORPEDO MALFUNCTIONED. THE FORMER  EMPLOYEE SUING THE FIRM SAID HE HAS BEEN THREATENED.  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft Co. conceded Wednesday that defective microchips caused the  failure of at least one test torpedo that was part of a system scheduled to be  installed in Navy submarines next year.  </P> <P> The admission came after a former staff engineer at Hughes' Ground Systems  Group in Fullerton, who has filed a $9.6-billion whistle-blower lawsuit against  the defense giant, released an internal company memo that supports his  contention that Hughes used millions of defective chips that could endanger the  nation's defense system.  </P> <P> Michael Denlinger filed suit in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana in June,  alleging that Hughes covered up flaws in 4.75 million microchips installed in  defense systems. The former senior staff engineer's lawsuit was unsealed  Tuesday.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Hughes characterized his allegations as erroneous. The company said  it was unaware of any system failures that had occurred as a result of  defective chips described by Denlinger.  </P> <P> But on Wednesday, Denlinger held a 90-minute news conference to outline his  five-year battle with Hughes. He released an inch-thick stack of documents  backing up his case. Among the documents was a Hughes memo dated Sept. 28,  1988, saying that an advanced capability torpedo had failed during a test  because of a cracked chip.  </P> <P> Hughes confirmed the contents of the memo. The company said it had been unable  to thoroughly check Denlinger's claim of a torpedo failure on Tuesday because  of a companywide holiday. Hughes continues to deny charges that it covered up  flaws in microchips.  </P> <P> Denlinger said at his news conference that he has been in hiding in Northern  California since he resigned from Hughes in January because of what he said  were repeated threats against his life. On hand were two Orange County  sheriff's deputies and a private armed guard.  </P> <P> "Our weapons systems have to be 100% reliable," Denlinger said. "If they fail  at any critical moment, disaster can happen. Lives can be lost. That is why I  persisted."  </P> <P> Denlinger alleges that Hughes took a shortcut in its soldering methods during a  five-year period in the middle and late 1980s, causing cracks in chips that  were supposed to be airtight in order to prevent corrosion.  </P> <P> Essentially, the chips were allegedly dipped almost whole into vats of solder  -- what Hughes calls its tinning process. The process can cause the chips to  crack if they are exposed to cleaning solvents or cold solutions immediately  afterward.  </P> <P> "You can take a glass and put it in an oven at 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and then  you throw it in a sink of cold water and it cracks," Denlinger said.  </P> <P> Hughes has said that its soldering procedures conformed with government  specifications but that it was aware of an industrywide problem of microchip  cracking. The company established two committees -- one in 1985 and another in  1987 -- to study the issue.  </P> <P> But Denlinger says in his suit that the committees' reports "contained certain  gross inaccuracies known to be false by defendant Hughes." Executives there had  "full knowledge that defective products would still be sold to the United  States government," the suit adds.  </P> <P> Among the documents released Wednesday was an internal memo dated Jan. 5, 1988,  that says Hughes' inventory contained a "significant number" of defective  chips. The report's authors concluded that "product reliability may be  affected." They recommended that the tinning process be suspended.  </P> <P> The documents released Wednesday by Denlinger's attorneys also show that  General Dynamics Corp. issued an industrywide alert in 1986, warning of  "catastrophic electrical failures" caused by microchips that were put through  the tinning process.  </P> <P> Denlinger claims he made every effort to change what he thought was a flawed  system at Hughes before deciding to sue the company under the federal False  Claims Act, a 1986 law that divides any spoils between the complainant and the  U.S. government.  </P> <P> "There was a conflict between my own code of professional ethics and the  conduct of Hughes management," Denlinger said. He made comparisons to the space  shuttle Challenger disaster, which resulted from a flawed part.  </P> <P> Denlinger said his repeated warnings, including written reports, were mostly  ignored by management. "They swatted me away like a fly," Denlinger said. "I  was a nuisance to them."  </P> <P> Hughes spokesman Dan Reeder said Denlinger's opinion was simply different from  his colleagues'.  </P> <P> Denlinger said he went into seclusion early this year because he didn't want  Hughes officials to be able to find him. He claims someone shot at him in early  June when he was wading in a tide pool in Morro Bay.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, his attorneys sent a telegram to the Justice Department seeking  protection for their client.  </P></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo debate The long-running debate in the market whether Lasmo will maintain or cut its dividend when it announces its preliminary figures tomorrow, moved strongly in favour of those suggesting the payment will be held. At the close Lasmo shares were 4 higher at 187p on reasonably good turnover of 1.1m shares. Lasmo shares came under substantial pressure last year as concern about gearing, resulting from the acquisition of Ultramar, saw the stock price fall to 117p. Bank shares fell along with the market, Barclays slipping 15 to 410p, NatWest 14 to 431p and Lloyds 12 to 518p. Merchant banks, on the other hand, drew comfort from the highly encouraging results published by Morgan Grenfell, now controlled by Deutsche Bank, which followed on from excellent numbers from Schroders. Hambros edged up 3 to 348p, while Schroders jumped 22 more to 1975p. Britannic Assurance fell 40 to 1303p amid mild disappointment with the figures. Prudential, due to announce preliminary numbers this morning, gave up 8 to 326p. Of the composites Sun Alliance dropped 9 to 352p with a block of 2m shares traded at 356p. BT fell 12 to 411p, with investors worried by the prospect of a price war in the mobile phone market, triggered by Mercury's new PCN network. Securicor 'A', BT's partner in the Cellnet cellular phone business, fell 6 to 612p. Vodafone were also affected, sliding 9 to 390p. The dividend reduction hit P-E International which dropped 8 to 50p. Figures from Argos were in line with expectations, but the market was encouraged by a positive trading statement. The upgrades that followed fell into the range of Pounds 76-83m for the coming year, although one analysts view of the stock as 'worthy but dull,' was echoed by a number of others. The shares gained 10 to 315p in turnover of 1.1m. Newspaper vendors continued to be buoyed by the decision by the chancellor of the exchequer not to impose VAT on newspapers. WH Smith 'A' was steady at 434p and J Menzies added 2 to 476p. A rash of research on the food retail business, largely concentrated on the impact of discount stores, produced further cautious sentiment in the sector. Goldman Sachs suggested that while the majors were likely to continue their expansion, competitive pressure would increase as the discount chains fought for market share. However, the house likes Argyll Group because of its exposure to the discount sector through its Lo-Cost chain of stores. Only Iceland Frozen Foods, which reports results today, managed to buck the trend, the shares climbing 4 to 735p. The group signalled its expectations - profits of at least Pounds 55m and a full-year dividend of 10p - when it bought 48 stores from Littlewoods recently. Elsewhere, Argyll Group declined 6 1/2 to 353p, Kwik Save 9 to 815p, J Sainsbury 10 to 515p and Tesco 3 1/2 to 240p. In a more perky food manufacturers sector, Booker rose 2 to 441p ahead of results on Thursday. Cadbury Schweppes was steady at 479p and Northern Foods added 3 to 275p. Both stocks have been left behind recently. Unilever, off 10 at 1203p, was upset by talk of an unofficial DTI inquiry into the ice cream business. Worries about the company's accountancy practices from several brokers continued to exact a toll on engineering group Siebe. The shares fell another 17 to 455p, with turnover reaching 1.3m. One broker however suggested that the recent fall may have been overdone. Negative press comment at TI Group saw the shares give up 7to 311p. In motors, Pendragon shed 8 to 276p, after announcing an expected Pounds 16.6m rights issue. A recommendation from NatWest Securities however lifted Perry Group 6 higher at 154p. A cautious results statement from conglomerate Suter saw the shares give up 10 to 144p. Market watchers say Suter may soon launch a bid for engineering group James Wilkes in which it raised its stake to more than 10 per cent last week. Shares in Wilkes hardened 5 to 70p. Among transport stocks, the collapse of talks between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic led to weakness in the British flag carrier. The shares fell 8 to 279p. The profits warning issued by the company after the close of trading on the market last Friday, saw Vibroplant shares plunge 223 1/2 to 42 1/2 p. Sharpe &amp; Fisher, on the other hand, jumped 12 to 95p after the better than expected preliminary figures.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS RECOVER JUST IN TIME TO WIN, 23-20  </P> <P> The Rams, who limped and sputtered through two exhibition games with makeshift  lineups and few memories to speak of, had a coming out of sorts Monday night.  </P> <P> The Phoenix Cardinals appeared ready to win until rookie Jeff Carlson's pass to  Flipper Anderson went 45 yards for a touchdown with 20 seconds to play, giving  the Rams a 23-20 victory. The Cardinals had previously taken a 20-17 lead on a  37-yard field goal by Al Del Greco with 14:50 left in front of 39,666 fans at  Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Despite the rally, the Rams' first team, as it turns out, will not go the  entire season without scoring a touchdown, ending a developing drama late in  the first quarter on a one-yard run by Robert Delpino.  </P> <P> At times both offense and defense sizzled. Sometimes both burned. But there was  finally signs of life, most notably from a set of aging wheels belonging to  LeRoy Irvin, a 31-year-old cornerback in search of a comeback.  </P> <P> Irvin, who didn't have his best season in 1988 and is talking about retirement  after this one, was suddenly young again. He finished a short night's work with  two first-half interceptions. With 8:54 left in the first quarter, he stepped  in front of a Gary Hogeboom pass and returned it five yards to the Phoenix  26-yard line, setting up Delpino's scoring run.  </P> <P> Irvin picked off another Hogeboom pass late in the half and returned it nine  yards. Other first-half stories included:  </P> <P>  -- Robert Delpino. The fifth-round pick of a year ago got his first real shot  at the tailback spot with starter Greg Bell out of camp and Gaston Green  hurting. Delpino, not the hometown bonus baby, figures he's going to have to  turn some heads to win the job outright, and did his best to do just that.  Delpino worked the first half and gained 44 yards in 10 carries.  </P> <P>  -- Jim Everett. His numbers weren't the greatest, six completions in 16  attempts, but he threw for 112 yards and a touchdown in his half of work.  Everett started fast, connecting with Anderson for 46 yards on his first pass.  </P> <P>  -- Frank Stams. The rookie linebacker from Notre Dame made his first big  impression, blocking a first-half punt that led to a Rams' touchdown  </P> <P> The news wasn't all good, though.  </P> <P> The Rams got a big scare with 10:07 left in the third quarter when backup  quarterback Mark Herrmann was blindsided on a safety blitz by Phoenix safety  Tim McDonald. The hit jarred the ball from Herrmann, and it bounded to former  UCLA standout Jim Wahler, who raced 40 yards to the 10 before being dragged  down by Richard Calvin.  </P> <P> Herrmann remained on his back for several minutes after the play but left the  field under his own power. He was taken by cart to the locker room, where it  was determined Herrmann had a fractured rib on his left side. He's expected to  be sidelined three to four weeks, which puts some heat on Carlson, who worked  the rest of the game in relief.  </P> <P> "Obviously, that's a big blow for us," Ram Coach John Robinson said about  Herrmann's injury. "That's part of this game. You're never to the point where  you have enough depth. He's had a good preseason, but his preseason's over  now."  </P> <P> But it's just beginning for the rookie Carlson, who threw the game-winning pass  to Anderson.  </P> <P> "He's a prospect," Robinson said. "He kind of goes out there and wings it. But  there's prospect and NFL quarterback, and there's a lot of distance between the  two."  </P> <P> The Cardinals wasted little time taking advantage of the hit on Herrmann,  scoring on the first down after the big play, when Lydell Carr ran 10 yards to  tie the game, at 17-17.  </P> <P> The Rams scored first with 5:42 left in the first quarter on a one-yard run by  Delpino, capping a 26-yard drive after Irvin's first interception.  </P> <P> The Cardinals drove from their 35-yard line to the Rams' four on their next  possession after key passes of 22 and 14 yards from Hogeboom to the veteran Roy  Green.  </P> <P> But the drive was abruptly stopped by linebacker Kevin Greene, who sacked  Hogeboom for an eight-yard loss on third and four at the Rams' four. The  Cardinals settled for Del Greco's 29-yard field goal to cut the lead to 7-3  with 13:50 left in the half.  </P> <P> The Rams, led by Delpino and Everett, charged back. On first down, Everett's  pass to Ellard worked for 26 yards to the Phoenix 39. Everett later completed a  pass to Thomas Henley for 12 yards, but the drive stalled at the 22 and the  Rams settled for a 39-yard Mike Lansford field goal to make it 10-3.  </P> <P> Then, the special teams stepped in. Rookie Stams, the second-round pick from  Notre Dame, broke through the line and blocked Rich Camarillo's punt at the 20,  the ball rolling toward the end zone. Rams Clifford Hicks and George Bethune  fought for control, with Bethune finally falling on the ball and rolling into  the end zone for a touchdown with 9:43 left. That put the Rams ahead, 17-3.  </P> <P> The Cardinals cut the lead to 17-10 with 1:12 left in the half on a one-yard  run by Tony Jordan, capping a 65-yard drive that took only five plays, thanks  to a 46-yard pass from Hogeboom to Robert Awalt on first down from the Phoenix  35.  </P> <P> Hogeboom, who signed with Phoenix as a Plan B free agent in the off-season,  rebounded strongly after a weak performance in the Cardinals' exhibition opener  against Seattle last week. In that game, Hogeboom threw three interceptions in  the first half. Monday night, he completed nine of 14 passes for 150 yards in  the first half, although he did give up the two interceptions to Irvin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The agent for Ram holdouts Greg Bell, Robert Cox and Duval Love last spoke to  Rams' management on Saturday and reported no progress in negotiations. "The  Rams indicated to me that with my players out, they've had time to look at  other players and were very pleased," Steve Feldman said Monday. Feldman added  that it was never his intention to take advantage of his holdouts and the new  80-player roster limit, which has made training camp even more difficult for  the Rams. "The last thing any of the players wants to do is distract training  camp in any manner."  </P> <P> Kicker Mike Lansford, who signed a temporary one-year contract to get to camp  on time, has been closely monitoring the negotiations of other kickers in the  league. Detroit's Eddie Murray recently signed a three-year deal for $1.1  million. New Orleans kicker Morten Andersen, who figures to set the standard  for kickers, signed a four-year deal Monday. Though terms were not revealed,  Andersen's deal reportedly could average about $500,000 per year with signing  bonus and incentives. Lansford earned $195,000 last season. . . . Navy  Tuiasasopo started at left guard for the Rams. He replaced eighth-round pick  Warren Wheat (injured neck), who was filling in for starter Tom Newberry  (hamstring). . . . Rookie Vernon Kirk, the team's ninth-round pick, started at  tight end.  </P> <P> The Rams play host to the Minnesota Vikings next Saturday night in the 44th  annual Times/Rams Charity game at Anaheim Stadium. . . . Linebacker Mel Owens  pinched a nerve in his neck in the first quarter but later returned. . . .  Tailback Gaston Green, who is recovering from a bruised left thigh, was not in  uniform Monday night. . . . Phoenix tight end Robert Awalt had injured ribs  after taking a vicious hit from safety Jerry Gray after a 46-yard reception  late in the first half. X-rays were negative, but Awalt did not return for the  second half.  </P></p>

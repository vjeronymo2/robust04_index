			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Soros comments act as catalyst for French advance FRENCH government bonds responded rapidly yesterday to positive comments by Mr George Soros, the financial speculator. His support for French bonds in favour of their German counterparts prompted a sharp rise in the French bond futures contract. September futures picked up half a point at one stage before profit-takers moved in and sold them. The contract closed 0.18 higher at 118.02. Mr Soros said: 'France is gaining in competitiveness against Germany. It has a significantly lower inflation rate and its industry has been more adept at adjusting its cost structure than its German counterparts.' Most economists said Mr Soros's remarks contained nothing new but acted as a catalyst. Mr George Magnus, a senior economist at SG Warburg Securities said: 'I think the Soros factor has been instrumental if only to the extent that he singled out the French market as his particular favourite.' The comments followed remarks by Bundesbank council members signalling that French interest rates have further to fall. Traders said the market was overbought but new investors were still visible at the long end of the yield curve yesterday with few sellers prepared to match their orders. IN Germany, the Bundesbank failed to fulfil hopes of easier money and left its repo rate unchanged at 7.6 per cent. However, government bond futures performed strongly on a mix of factors. September bund futures opened at 94.33 and rose to a high of 94.68 before settling at about 94.52. Dealers said the market was recovering from an oversold position. Ms Alison Cottrell, an economist with Midland Global Markets, argued that unforeseen currency weakness, prompted by Mr Soros's comments, had prevented an easing in the repo rate but the signals were encouraging for a shaving next week. THE UK government bond market was the strongest performer with long-dated gilts gaining half a point at best. However, short-dated gilts were held back by heavy supply in the Eurosterling sector. Much of the business was futures driven with long gilt futures breaking through a resistance level at 104.00 and triggering some stop-loss buying. The September contract opened up at 103.27 and closed at 104.16, its high of the day. Interest in short-dated issues was diverted by Pounds 700m of fixed rate Eurosterling deals, including a Pounds 500m five-year issue by Gefco, the UK export finance agency. THE combination of a firm lira and a strong tone in the other European government bond markets provided momentum for the Italian government bond market. The Liffe futures contract, which broke through the psychologically important 100.00 level on Tuesday, opened at 100.15 yesterday and reached a high of 100.48. But the contract ended the day at 100.20 as investors took profits. LONG-DATED Spanish government bonds made further gains yesterday, continuing to benefit from the socialists' election victory on Sunday. The yield on the 10-year bond, which was at 10.88 per cent on Friday, fell to 10.68 per cent from 10.72 per cent yesterday. However, some analysts pointed out that the rally may be running out of steam. The long end of the Spanish government bond market has outperformed the short end this week, leading to a flattening of the yield curve and reflecting expectations that cuts in interest rates will take place more gradually under the socialists than they would have done had the People's Party won the election. US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the market yesterday as trading remained subdued ahead of tomorrow's inflation report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/2 at 103 1/8 , yielding 6.873 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  1/16 firmer at 99 23/32 , to yield 4.258 per cent. Traders reported retail and speculative interest throughout the day, although some of the early gains were a follow through from reports of buying by Middle East investors overnight.</p>

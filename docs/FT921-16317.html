			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Now is the time to top up your TESSA HAPPY BIRTHDAY to TESSA. Anyone who opened a Tax Exempt Special Savings Account in January last year can this month pay in their second year's instalment, up to a maximum of Pounds 1,800. Given the high rates on offer in 1991 - the average rate was around 12.9 per cent - TESSA holders should be able to have more than Pounds 5,000 in their accounts earning tax-free interest in 1992. If one assumes an average interest rate of 9 per cent for the next four years, and that an investor puts in the maximums in each year (Pounds 1,800 in both 1993 and 1994, and then Pounds 600 in 1995), the total value of a TESSA on maturity should be about Pounds 12,500. Since many people have yet to open TESSAs, it is worth repeating the advantages of the account. Interest is paid tax-free, provided the capital is left in the account for five years. An investor can withdraw net interest during that period, but not the tax-free element. The five year time scale has probably deterred most people from opening a TESSA. But this is not a good reason for them to hold back. Most people will simply be putting money in a TESSA which previously was held in a building society account. If they withdraw their capital before the five years are up, all that happens is that they will not get the benefit of tax-free interest - in other words, they will be in the same position as if they had left the money in the normal building society account. The only real disadvantage of TESSAs is that many institutions impose transfer penalties. But these tend to be fairly small and their effect will be outweighed by the fact that the interest rates on many TESSAs are more attractive than those offered on normal accounts. So, if you have not opened a TESSA to date, open one now. And if you already have one, pay your second instalment. The table (a shortened version of the one we published on December 14) shows the ten best and worst performing Tessas of 1991. It is based on a lump sum of Pounds 3,000 invested on launch date, and assumes that rates prevailing in mid-December continue until the anniversary. Those looking for the most attractive rates of the moment should consult the Best Rates for Your Money table on Page IV. One building society complained that, in our December 14 table, we did not include bonuses which would be credited at the end of year five (although we did include bonuses credited at the end of year one). We did this for the simple reason that we wanted to show the actual value of a TESSA at the end of year one - only that value will accrue compound interest. A bonus paid at the end of year five is obviously not worth as much as a bonus paid now. A fair comparison would have involved discounting that bonus back to a present value - a calculation which would have required us to establish a subjective discount rate. One further point. In year one of TESSAs, some institutions offered high interest rates and no bonuses; others offered high bonuses and low rates. It may be that those institutions which offer high bonuses at the end of year five will pay lower interest rates towards the end of the TESSA.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Worst TESSAs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Value      Rate        Transfer                             (Pounds)   today (%)   penalty  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hinckley &amp; Rugby BS         3319.82     9.0        N Caledonian Bank             3335.47    10.0        N Gartmore Mon Man (Prime)    3341.01     9.8        N Newbury BS                  3341.49    10.1        Y Newcastle BS                3342.56    11.4        Y Staffordshire BS            3347.66    10.5        N Swansea BS                  3348.82    10.1        Y Tyndall &amp; Co                3349.76     9.9        N Municipal Mutual            3350.30    10.5        Y Chorley &amp; District BS       3355.29    11.0        Y  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Best TESSAs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Value      Rate        Transfer                             (Pounds)   today (%)   penalty  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- North of England BS         3435.84    12.5        Y National Counties BS        3435.48    13.1        Y Julian Hodge Bank           3432.17    13.0        Y Nationwide BS (Flex)*       3429.25    11.5        Y Exeter Bank                 3425.52    12.0        Y Marsden Bank                3425.49    12.0        Y Melton Mowbray BS           3420.00    14.0        Y Chelt &amp; Gloucs (Maxi)*      3417.67    12.0        N Coventry BS                 3415.00    11.6        N Kent Reliance BS            3414.74    12.5        Y  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Accounts marked * have been replaced or withdrawn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

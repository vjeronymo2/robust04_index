			<p>BFN     [Text] THE Army again warned Cambodian government troops  fighting the Khmer Rouge near the border yesterday that Thailand  will respond "in a tough manner" if stray artillery shells  continue to land on Thai soil.    Army spokesman Phalangkun Klahan said the shells could have  "intentionally'' been aimed against Thai territory.    "The artillery shells which have fallen on our soil lately  are becoming increasingly suspect," the spokesman said. " We  are analyzing possibilities to determine whether they (Cambodian  troops) had some motive and intended to fire directly into  Thailand.    "We are preparing to respond in a tough manner" to ensure  Thailand's sovereignty, said Phalangkun.    The warning came amidst heightened tension between Thailand  and Cambodia over Phnom Penh's allegation that the Thai military  is still supporting the outlawed Khmer Rouge. Cambodian leaders  have blamed Thailand for the Khmer Rouge's success in retaking  the strategic and gem-rich western town of Pailin, an accusation  Bangkok described as a sore loser's attempt to find a scapegoat.    Phnom Penh accused some units of the Thai military of having  business interests with the Khmer Rouge in Pailin, which were  seized by the Cambodian army a month before the Khmer Rouge  recaptured it about a week ago.    Supreme Command spokesman Anuson Kritsanaserani last week  complained about artillery shells fired by Cambodian troops  landing in Thailand.    The military has also pointed out that while Phnom Penh has  been "smearing" Thailand's image, Thais living along the border  have had to bear the brunt of the military spillover from the  Cambodian civil war as well as the burden of never-ending  refugee problems.    "Thai soldiers are taking care of Khmer refugees at the  border. This shows we are not siding with anybody," Phalangkun  said.    Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit has been at the  forefront of the diplomatic row between-Thailand and Cambodia.  He last week threatened to cut humanitarian assistance to the  war-torn country if it continued its verbal attacks on the  government here.    Wimon yesterday said he wanted to see peace in Cambodia as  soon as possible and an end to the refugee problem.</p>

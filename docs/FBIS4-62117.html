			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian leadership continues a policy of  blockade and isolation against the Chechen republic, a statement  of the Chechen Foreign Ministry transferred to Interfax on  Wednesday says.    "For us the fact of forming a delegation led by Vice-Premier  Sergey Shakhray for talks with the Chechen republic by  resolution of the Russian government dated May 3 is just another  step of such a policy," the statement says.    "However in reality this delegation of the Russian  Federation  turned out to be formed for talks with the leadership of the  Chechen opposition who have already arrived in Moscow," the  Chechen Foreign Ministry notes. "The will of the Chechen people  and efforts of its legitimate president aimed at the settlement  of relations with the Russian Federation are ignored once again."    The Chechen Foreign ministry urged all international  organizations and the press "to condemn actions by the Russian  leadership running contrary to the norms and principles of  international law."</p>

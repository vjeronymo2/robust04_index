			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Lib Dems face split on racism The Liberal Democrat party was facing an ugly split over racism last night after an internal inquiry recommended the expulsion of three members in the London borough of Tower Hamlets. Mr Jeremy Shaw, one of three members accused of circulating racist leaflets, said local members were 'very likely' to set up a splinter group. A substantial breakaway could deprive the Liberal Democrats of its eight-seat majority on Tower Hamlets council, which the party won from Labour in 1986. The inquiry, chaired by Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat peer, was set up after controversial leaflets were published during a council by-election won by the British National Party. The report is a damning indictment of campaigning tactics in the Tower Hamlets party during the past three years, which continued after the inquiry was established. In addition to recommending three expulsions, it urges the national party to appoint a campaigns officer to monitor Tower Hamlets until after next year's local elections in May. The three members, who deny racism, have the right to appeal to an independent panel to be set up by the party. The report says the members involved did not intend to stir up racial prejudice. But their populist approach pandered to resentment and anxiety among local white voters. Lord Lester accuses the Tower Hamlets Labour party of adopting 'misguided and dishonourable' policies during the by-election which contributed to the BNP campaign. The report's most damaging section asserts that the national Liberal Democrat party knew what was happening in Tower Hamlets three years ago, but took 'no effective concerted action'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, moved quickly last night to limit electoral damage to the party by making clear that it would act firmly to end racism. Mr Graham Tope, president of the Liberal Democrat London region, said the exposure of racism in Tower Hamlets was unlikely to affect the party's prospects in the elections. 'Where people comment at all, they recognise that this party has not tried to sweep it under the carpet. Far from hurting us next May, I think it is going to help us,' he said. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said the report was a 'whitewash'.</p>

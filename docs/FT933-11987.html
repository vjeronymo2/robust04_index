			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Arts: What's in a name? - Theatre If a family is called Jinx, I suppose you should expect misfortunes. And if the play is called The Devil's Only Sleeping, it is likely that they will not be entirely man-made. Nick Stafford's piece at the Cockpit contains almost everything that a rational person will dislike: transvestism, violence, a heavy touch of the supernatural and an overriding note of obscurity. At times it seems like a mixture of 'The Archers' and Thomas Hardy, though it appears to be set on a small farm in Scotland. Do not be put off by the background, however: this is a tersely written play. The main reservation is whether it belongs more properly to television. There has been a killing in the Jinx family nearly 20 years ago. Barton Jinx, who was convicted of the crime, emerges from prison to visit Myra, wife of his twin brother. It was her father who was killed. The husband is also dead, and buried above the farmstead. There remains a son, Billy, whose fatherhood is in doubt. Barton begins to settle down alongside Myra in place of his brother. What happens in the play is not always clear, nor is it meant to be. An old Mini is parked on stage throughout. It was driven through Dead Man's Wood at 60 mph on the night that the killing occurred. It is driven through the same wood now - at 63 mph - by Billy and his girl-friend, Alex. None of the relationships are normal. Billy gets on well enough with Alex, but is happiest when dressed as a woman. Alex seems to come from a more conventional background, but suggests that even her family is under stress, if not quite jinxed. It is when the surrogate father starts beating Billy for his transvestism that the Jinx environment falls apart. It sounds bizarre, but is compelling. Of the cast of four, Sheridan MacDonald excels as Myra, the woman who always wears trousers, and Billy McColl as Barton looks as is he is literally carrying the jinx on his shoulders. Jon Morrison directs with the tightest control. The Cockpit, the new home of the Soho Theatre Company, looks as if it has already made its mark on the London fringe. Cockpit Theatre, NW 8, until August 14. 071-402 5081</p>

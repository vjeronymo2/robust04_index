			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Nationwide denies split with GRE NATIONWIDE, the second largest building society, yesterday denied that it was about to sever a two and a half year old agreement to sell Guardian Royal Exchange life assurance policies because of the poor performance of GRE with-profits endowment policies. The tie is not due to end until late 1994. 'There is no change in prospect,' the society said yesterday. 'We are not conducting any urgent review of our tie with GRE, though like any other business we do keep a general watch our business relationships,' Nationwide said. He declined to comment on reports that top level management changes may be on the way soon at the society. Nationwide's results for 1991-92 are due to be announced early next month. Analysts are forecasting a sharp drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 285m last year, though sources close to the society say that its performance may turn out to be better than generally expected.</p>

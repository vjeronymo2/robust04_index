			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Alcohol retailers lobby for halving of duty Beer drinker Kenneth Clarke will today meet a delegation from the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association, representing brewers and pub operators. The delegation will ask the chancellor for a 50 per cent cut in beer duty in November's Budget, Neil Buckley writes. Brewers argue that only a cut of this size will solve the problem of cross-Channel beer imports, now running at about 1m pints a day. The UK has the second-highest duty regime in the European Union. The delegation, led by Mr Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass, and Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux Group, will argue that a 50 per cent cut would not only lead to a recovery in the beer market but would stimulate other associated revenues from the industry - including other drinks duty, licence duty, value added tax and corporation tax. This would lead, they say, to a Pounds 300m increase in government revenues by 1997.</p>

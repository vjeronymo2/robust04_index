			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc The French government's proposal to enfranchise non-voting Rhone-Poulenc shareholders is unsatisfactory as it stands. Holders of non-voting stock are being offered a straight one-for-one swap for voting shares, but the public sector is left holding the majority of votes. In return for this minority position, holders of non-voting stock will give up strong preferential dividend rights. The deal only makes sense if the rationalisation of Rhone-Poulenc's capital structure paves the way for full privatisation. Equally, the planned sale of 6m government-owned voting shares looks like an opportunistic move while Rhone-Poulenc is near its peak relative to the French market. Partial privatisations which absorb cash but leave the public sector in control are the worst of all possible worlds for equities generally. There is always a chance, though, that the government will surrender its majority by allowing Rhone-Poulenc to make a rights issue. With gearing running above 80 per cent, the company could certainly use an injection of new equity. With a strengthened balance sheet, a simplified capital structure and free of the threat of state interference, the company could enjoy a rating more appropriate to the healthcare sector. But while the government holds the whip-hand the market is right to remain sceptical.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Reed Executive Pounds 2.8m in black A 22 per cent rise in turnover helped Reed Executive, the recruitment agency, move from pre-tax losses of Pounds 177,000 to profits of Pounds 2.78m in the 26 weeks to July 3. Mr Alec Reed, chairman, said the high fixed costs of the business meant 'even a small fluctuation in turnover means large movement in the bottom line': interim sales rose from Pounds 43.2m to Pounds 52.8m. 'The state of the economy has now recovered to the level where we are experiencing candidate shortages', said Mr Reed. He added that margins were improving as a result. Earnings per share were 3.3p compared with losses of 0.9p, while an interim dividend of 1p (nil) is declared.</p>

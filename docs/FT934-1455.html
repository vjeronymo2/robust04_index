			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs on triple-witching day Wall Street US stocks posted solid gains yesterday in a rally fuelled by a more optimistic outlook on interest rates and heavy trading related to the 'triple-witching' expiration of options and futures contracts, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 25.43 higher at 3,751.57, and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 3.04 at 466.38. In the secondary markets, the American FE composite was 2.76 ahead at 464.20, while the Nasdaq composite was 3.70 higher at 759.23. The triple-witching activity - triggered by the quarterly unwinding of options and future contracts on stock indices and options on individual stocks - lifted NYSE volume to 358m shares. Advances led declines by 1,467 to 649. The market's direction, which is often erratic under such circumstances, was set by a reassuring article on Federal Reserve policy in The Washington Post. It quoted unnamed senior Fed officials as dismissing the fears of Wall Street analysts that the central bank would boost short-term interest rates before unambiguous signs of inflation surfaced. Their comments appeared to have had a calming effect on the bond market, which reacted with equanimity to more bullish news on the economy. In late trading, the inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond was  7/16 firmer at 99 19/32 , aided by a further decline in crude oil prices. The latest evidence suggesting strong fourth-quarter growth came from the Commerce Department, which said November housing starts had risen by 3.9 per cent in November to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.43m, the highest level since February 1990. The strong report, coupled with diminished concerns over the Fed's intentions, led to a broad trend of moderate gains in equities. Allied Signel gained Dollars 2 at Dollars 77 1/4 , International Paper Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 67 7/8 , Eastman Kodak Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55 1/4 and Roadway Services Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 63. But Coca-Cola shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 5/8 . Banking issues were given a particular boost from expiration-related trading. Citicorp was up Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 , Banc One Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 39, Wachovia Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 and SunTrust Banks Dollars 1 to Dollars 45 7/8 . Among individual stocks, IBM was marked up Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59 3/4 after Merrill Lynch lifted its estimate of the company's 1993 performance. General Electric climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 105 1/8 after announcing a dividend increase. Canada TORONTO stocks recorded a small gain in moderate trading. The 300 composite index was up 7.41, or 0.18 per cent, to 4223.58, for a loss on the week of about 57 points. Advances led declines 449 to 367, volume of 59,436,000 shares was little changed from yesterday's 58.8m shares, and trading value was CDollars 628.8m compared with CDollars 673m.</p>

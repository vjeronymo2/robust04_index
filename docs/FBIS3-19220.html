			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- In January, the money  supply grew even more strongly than assumed: The monetary stock  grew at an annual rate of 21.2 percent. By announcing this, the  Bundesbank revised upward the preliminary value of 20.6 percent,  which it had published at the beginning of March.    For 1994 the Bundesbank is aiming for a money supply growth  between 4 and 6 percent. In particular the strong expansion of  loans as well as some "special factors" contributed to the  unusually strong expansion of M3 -- this includes cash in  circulation, sight deposits, time deposits with maturities of  less than four years, and savings deposits -- in January.</p>

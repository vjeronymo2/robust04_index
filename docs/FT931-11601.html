			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Partnerships in the local economy - In A Nutshell A business partnership combining the efforts of local companies, business support groups and public sector organisations has been formed in Hertfordshire to boost the local economy. More than 100 business people and representatives of business organisations attended the first meeting of the Hertfordshire Business Forum last month. The main instigators of the initiative are the county's Training and Enterprise Council, the county council and its development organisation, which was set up to attract investment. Traditionally prosperous Hertfordshire has been spurred into action by the loss of some 13,000 jobs in defence-related companies such as Rolls Royce and British Aerospace.

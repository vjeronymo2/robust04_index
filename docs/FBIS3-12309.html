			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman, 26 Feb (PETRA)--The Senate has vehemently  condemned the heinous crime carried out by Zionist extremists.  Hundreds of innocent martyrs and wounded people among Hebron's  citizens fell victims to this crime at dawn yesterday.    The Senate met in an extraordinary session this morning,  attended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and other  ministers. The session was devoted to discussing the dimensions  of this crime.    Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi said the terrible crime  perpetrated by fanatic Israeli settlers at the holy Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron at dawn yesterday -- in which hundreds of  innocent martyrs and wounded people fell as victims -- makes it  necessary to draw lessons and explore the results this terrible  event implies and the dangers and challenges it poses.    Al-Lawzi said the extraordinary session is a contribution by  the Senate to the efforts of his majesty, the homeland's leader  and the faithful one Jordanian family. This session will allow  brother senators to exchange views and consultations. They will  contribute to enhancing Jordan's honest march and national unity  in view of this barbaric crime, and to consolidating Jordan's  pan-Arab responsibilities. Jordan has never failed to assume  these, in terms of supporting the Palestine question and the  Palestinian people's struggle to regain their rights and achieve  self-determination on their national soil and secure the  implementation of international legitimacy in order to realize a  just and comprehensive peace that ends occupation and removes  the settlements.    The Senate later observed one minute of silence for the  martyrs. The senators read the opening chapter of the Holy Koran  for the martyrs' chaste souls.</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Arts: The Distant Sound - Grand Theatre, Leeds Franz Schreker's Der ferne Klang, titled The Distant Sound in a new translation by the conductor Paul Daniel, receives its first British production from that boldest of British companies, Opera North. This is an event of some importance, for the work itself is a milestone of German opera during the first decades of the century. A first opera (Frankfurt, 1912) by a previously little-known 34-year Viennese Jew who was also his own librettist, it had a smash-hit success, which Schreker then capped with those of Die Gezeichneten (1918) and Der Schatzgraber (1920). Thereafter the tide of fashion changed, and the advent of the Nazis completed the rout of Schreker's reputation with brutal finality: in the early 1930s he was deprived of his high-profile Berlin teaching post, and died of a stroke. In recent years the re-examination of his music has proceeded apace. Der ferne Klang has already turned up in several European cities and two recordings; other Schreker rediscoveries have also been undertaken, which chimes with the growing European interest in the major musical figures of the Austro-German musical culture - not just Strauss and Schoenberg ' in what may loosely be termed the Weimar years. On the evidence of Tuesday's Leeds first night, I have to say that the case for the Schreker revival seems not at all proved, let alone won. The most prized feature of the opera was, and remains, its instrumental sound-world - the shimmering, deliquescent, ravishingly blended woodwind-harp-and-celesta sonorities welling up out of the orchestra pit whenever the opera's central male figure, the composer Fritz, is depicted in obsessive search for the 'distant sound' that represents his artistic inspiration. Wherever this recurs, particularly in the opera's opening and closing stages, the aura of late-Romantic rapture proves enduringly potent: Schreker seems to fuse the worlds of Debussy and Strauss. Elsewhere, I fear, we are left with little more than a pre-Hollywood penny dreadful. Fritz abandons his village sweetheart Grete, who sinks into prostitution; in Act 2 she's the top attraction of the Casa di Maschere, a Venetian brothel - Fritz encounters her there, for reasons never made clear, and spurns her. In Act 3 she turns up, now a shabby street-walker, for the premiere of his unsuccessful new opera, The Harp, and they are reconciled - mortally ill, he dies still searching for the proper completion of his opera, rather like Zivny in Janacek's roughly contemporaneous Osud. Though these and other scenes are built up with recourse to original and sophisticated effects - clearly the use of onstage band and piled-up simultaneities was to work a strong influence on the writing of Wozzeck - the gap between technical complexity and plot slenderness, not to say banality, grows unbridgeably wide. The roles are symbolic mouthpieces, not characters; in this respect I find it instructive that all Schreker's creative individuality appears to have been spent on the orchestra, leaving the voice parts to sing out in a kind of post-Wagnerian autopilot. I said earlier, 'on first-night Leeds evidence'. It is a crucial proviso. The Grand pit proves too small for Schreker's orchestra; additional instruments have to be housed on the stage itself, in tiers around a raised acting-area, with the disastrous consequences for Schreker's subtly blended scoring, which most of the time separates out in thin strands - and which, in full cry, drowns the voices. Mr Daniel, obviously a Schreker believer, pilots the opera with sympathy and tenderness, but the Klang produced by the orchestral configuration defeats his best efforts. Then, alas, there is the matter of the production - a British debut in this field by the much-loved mezzo Brigitte Fassbaender, using the sets and costumes (utilitarian and hideous) of Ultz. A moment or two in the unfolding of the central relationship suggest that she worked closely and well with the singers, Kim Begley and Virginia Kerr; but Miss Fassbaender's control of the opera's larger forces is of a stiffness and, indeed, ineptitude that defy description. The Act 2 brothel-scene comes complete with female revenants from the J. Arthur Rank Charm School and some incredibly genteel drag queens; one would guess that the producer's purpose was send-up, except that there's no hint of wit or deftness in her handling. In spite of the orchestral barrage, there is some impressive singing. Mr Begley and Miss Kerr both reveal 'youthful heroic' voices of exactly the right sturdily appealing kind (I hope she will press no harder for volume); other performers notably involved include Fiona Kimm, William Dazeley, Peter Sidhom and John Hall. In sum, though, and to be cruelly and regretfully frank, Opera North appear for once to have vastly overreached themselves.</p>

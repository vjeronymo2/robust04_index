			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Leading Article: The hard part THIS IS not the moment to be grudging. Governor Bill Clinton has been elected president of the US squarely and fairly. That is, the unfairness in the campaign was directed more at him than by him. President George Bush, with all the supposed advantages of incumbency, resorted to undignified muck-raking in his attempts to blacken Mr Clinton's character. Mr Ross Perot had much more money to spend. Mr Clinton won by making himself the unchallenged leader of the main opposition party, by imposing on that party a new direction and a new image, and by becoming the most credible spokesman of what is clearly a deeply felt, nationwide desire for change. His campaign was in itself an impressive feat of leadership and organisation. As Vice-President Dan Quayle said, if he can run his presidency as well as he ran the campaign he will be a highly successful president. That is, and was intended to be, a big 'if'. Mr Clinton has shown himself a thoroughly professional politician. But that means, in essence, a person skilled in being all things to all men, and dodging difficult choices. Governing on the other hand involves making choices. On many points Mr Clinton will, once in office, have to clarify his position; and in the process he will not be able to avoid disappointing, perhaps even infuriating, many of those who voted for him on Tuesday. That will be true especially in the area which he rightly made the main focus of his campaign: 'the economy, stupid'. Mr Clinton, unlike Mr Bush, believes that government has a role to play in galvanising the economy, notably through spending on education and infrastructure. He is deluding himself if he thinks these plans can be financed by taxing only the 'top 2 per cent' of the population. He will have to choose whether to increase the already yawning budget deficit or to raise revenue through broader, presumably indirect, taxation. If he wants to make good his environmental claims, he should in any case raise taxes on gasoline. Similarly, Mr Clinton will not be able to implement his proposed healthcare reforms unless he is prepared for a head-on battle with the American Medical Association and the pharmaceutical industry; and he will not be able to make good his reputation as a free trader without facing down powerful lobbies within his own party, including notably the trade unions and some environmentalists. Foreign policy is clearly not his main interest, and the voters have shown they do not mind that. But foreign policy too will present awkward and unavoidable choices. Mr Clinton will have to choose between conflicting interests, and to allocate resources for honouring US commitments and furthering US objectives. The ends of the president-elect, so far as he has defined them, are mainly good. The more difficult part, which he must now set about, is finding the means.</p>

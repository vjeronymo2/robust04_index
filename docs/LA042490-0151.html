			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> YOUTH EVENT BENEFITS CITY HOMELESS  </P> <P> Holly Reed could have been mistaken for a department store salesgirl as she  held up a sweater and enthusiastically explained to a skeptical woman how  flattering the color would look on her.  </P> <P> But Reed, a junior at Kennedy High School in La Palma, was not working at a  women's apparel counter. She was one of 15 students at the Civic Center Plaza  on Monday handing out sack lunches, toothbrushes, new socks and used clothing  to about 175 homeless people.  </P> <P> The event was sponsored by the Youth Volunteer Council of Orange County and the  United Way Youth Organization, whose members are high school students  interested in community service. The students held a car wash last month and  raised $500 to buy food and other items for the giveaway.  </P> <P> "It's a good feeling to be able to give a helping hand to people. It's  important," said Reed, 17, as she cheerfully handed out clothes.  </P> <P> Organizer Sean Todd said the occasion was meant to coincide with National Youth  Service Day this Friday.  </P> <P> "Events like this put them more in touch with the community," Todd said.  "Education is not just sitting in the classroom, it's being out here, seeing  what's going on, and trying to help out."  </P> <P> The lesson was not lost on Lydia Puente, a 16-year-old junior from Saddleback  High School in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "I feel like they need our help," Puente said. "People ignore the homeless and  don't pay attention to them except for on Christmas and Thanksgiving. They are  homeless all year."  </P> <P> Yeon Ko, a junior at University High School in Irvine, was busy placing ham and  cheese sandwiches inside paper bags and said it felt great to be helping out.  </P> <P> "I'm sure that what we're doing today won't make a big difference but maybe  it'll encourage other kids to get involved on a regular basis, then we could  really help a lot," said Ko, 17.  </P> <P> For many of the homeless people who waited in line under a slight drizzle, the  goods came as a welcome surprise.  </P> <P> George Ellithorpe, 61, is known as "Grandpa" on the streets, where he has lived  for six years. He said he was impressed by the students' effort.  </P> <P> "This is one of the biggest events we've had out here in quite some time,"  Ellithorpe said as he held a sack lunch in one hand and a new pair of socks in  the other. "It looks like the young people are finally getting wise to what's  going on. It all helps, believe me. Everyone who is on the street needs help  and we all appreciate these young people. Things like this help us to survive."  GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

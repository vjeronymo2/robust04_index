			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Bolivia fails to meet some terms of IMF agreement BOLIVIA has failed to meet some terms of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, government officials have confirmed. The development could delay a rescheduling of the country's debt to the Paris Club of creditor nations. The main sticking point is understood to be the country's public sector deficit. Mr Pablo Zegarra, minister of finance, said the IMF had been insisting on a public sector deficit figure of 3.2 per cent this year, which the government was unlikely to meet. The deficit reached 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1991.</p>

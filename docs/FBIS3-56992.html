			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Jan -- What is important now is to focus  attention on the main thing, namely to complete the process of a  political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Otherwise the world  will continue watching the tragedy unfold, said Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin.    In an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent  upon his return earlier tonight from Geneva, where another round  of talks between the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict was  held, Churkin said that with every unsuccessful round it is  becoming more difficult to hope for success at the talks on a  settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It was at the previous round of talks in Brussels last  December that another opportunity to achieve accord was missed,  Vitaliy Churkin added. At that moment the international  community lacks determination to bring the matter to a logical  end, and now it is lacking even more.    Vitaliy Churkin said the next round is scheduled to take  place in Geneva on 10 February. That meeting will aim to  achieve more modest tasks, and it will be attended by fewer  participants. Representatives of the sides will gather only to  discuss confidence measures, so it will be a meeting with  limited goals.</p>

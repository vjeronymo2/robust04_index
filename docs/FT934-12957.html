			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Sailing: Maxis feel the heat in Whitbread tussle - A look at the lessons of the first leg SAILING'S great debate is over. Since the first of the new W60 class was launched two years ago, yachtsmen have argued about whether these light, water-ballasted sloops could beat the 85ft maxi-ketches in the Whitbread round the world race. With the Southampton-Uruguay leg just finished it is clear they can - and will. 'On the next leg, I think the W60s will be far away over the horizon,' said Pierre Fehlmann, a skipper in five Whitbreads whose maxi, Merit Cup, finished third into Punta del Este, 8hr 22min behind the leg winner, New Zealand Endeavour. Tokio, skippered by young New Zealander Chris Dickson, was the first W60 into harbour, three hours behind NZ Endeavour. With maxis taking first and third places, why does this make the W60s look so hot? According to theory, only on the first and fifth legs, with a good deal of close reaching and upwind sailing in light airs, could the bigger yachts exploit their greater displacement and massive sail area. Weather conditions matched predictions almost exactly on the 5,900-mile route down through the Atlantic. Maxis like Merit Cup and NZ Endeavour should have arrived in Punta days in front of the smaller boats. Tokio, Galicia Pescanova, Yamaha, Winston and Intrum Justitia were the first five W60s to arrive, in that order and separated by 12 hours from first to last. All are from the board of Maryland-based designer, Bruce Farr. Their skippers agree there is nothing between them in performance, with crewing and tactics being the difference. Physically, the leg was easy, said helmsman Gordon Maguire from Winston, but mentally it was gruelling. 'We've just sailed 24 incredibly competitive day races back-to-back,' he added. 'Most of the time, we were within sight of Yamaha. At night, we'd plot them on the radar.' The two yachts seemed tied by an invisible string. A constant stream of satellite data put the other items in the matrix together. This race through the wildest corners of the world's oceans is being fought below decks around the computer and the weather fax. 'It is like a chess game,' said Dickson, who led the fleet out of the the Solent on September 25. 'We would receive the reports. Then, Andrew Cape, the navigator, and I would go over all the available weather patterns and try to find the best tactical course in relation to what the opposition were doing. 'Each session took two to three hours of analysis and discussion. So, with new reports coming in every six hours, you could never relax and snatch more than a couple of hours of sleep. It was like match racing 24 hours a day, but you couldn't go home at night.' Grant Dalton, skipper of NZ Endeavour, found the reports addictive. If the scheduled transmission was even a few minutes late, he and navigator Mike Quilter would find themselves staring impatiently at the computer waiting for the data print-out. 'Whoever sends those things out, tell them not to be late,' joked Dalton when he stepped ashore. 'It's fantastic to know straight away whether you're heading into a gain or a loss.' One of his crew, Glenn Sowry, likened the arrival of the transmission to waiting for school exam results. According to one or two crew aboard Endeavour, though, there was almost more interest in how the finely-balanced W60s were faring than in their own boat's stately leadership of the fleet. 'I feel sorry for those guys in the maxis,' said a watch leader from one of the W60s. 'Only two of them are really in the race and it obvious now that Merit is slow and Endeavour's going to win.' This, a remarkable comment for so competitive a sportsman, came from Fehlmann as soon as he stepped ashore when he admitted that Merit Cup had a speed problem. 'Down-wind when it's blowing hard, NZ Endeavour is a bit faster than us, maybe 0.2 or 0.3 of a knot. It's nothing,' he added. With due respect to the hugely-experienced Fehlman, 0.3 of a knot disadvantage over the next 7,500-mile leg to Australia (all down-wind and nothing much below force 6) will put him into port nearly a day behind the opposition. Almost all the W60s are looking to add an extra crew member for the Southern Ocean legs, taking them up to 11. Gorillas and winch-grinders need not apply. It says everything about this Whitbread that the skippers are looking for more brain-power rather than extra muscle.</p>

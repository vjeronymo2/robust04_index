			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway snubs Opec Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer, has rejected an Opec request to help lift crude prices, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Norway produces an average 2.3m barrels a day but last month hit a record 2.44m b/d. It has repeatedly said it will not reduce output. Last Wednesday, Mr Jens Stoltenberg, industry and energy minister, received a letter from Opec Secretary General Subroto who asked 'if there is any possibility for Norway to contribute to the efforts being made by Opec members to strengthen the very, very weak oil prices?' Norway last co-operated with Opec to help underpin oil prices from 1986, when they fell below Dollars 10 a barrel, till 1990. Companies were ordered to pump 7.5 per cent below capacity.</p>

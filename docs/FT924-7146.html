			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Vauxhall to cut output of cars VAUXHALL, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is being forced to cut its car output for the first time during the recession in the face of weakening demand from export markets. It is planning a cut of two shifts a week for four weeks in January at its assembly plant at Luton, Bedfordshire, with a total production cut of 2,880 cars. Vauxhall's second plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, will not be affected by the cut. Vauxhall's output this year is expected to reach a record of 300,000 vehicles.</p>

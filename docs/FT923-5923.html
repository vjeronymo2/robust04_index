			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Recession and price war holds Cathay Pacific to rise of 13% CATHAY Pacific Airlines, the international airline subsidiary of Hong Kong's Swire Pacific group, unveiled a 13 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 1.26bn (USDollars 163.6m) in the six months to June 1992. The results were below analysts' expectations, emphasising the impact of the recession in major destinations, such as the UK, and the price war among rival Asian airlines. The corresponding figures for 1991 had been hit by the Gulf war. A spokesman, defending the figures, said: 'The airline industry worldwide is in economic disarray.' The yield per passenger kilometre fell by 2.3 per cent, indi-cating downward pressure on ticket prices. The company was confident it could achieve improved results for the full year, but earnings growth is expected to be single digit, since passenger yields are unlikely to improve in the near-term. Inflation also remains a problem, although the focus on boosting productivity has helped keep unit costs stable. Net finance charges were up sharply in the six months to June, due to the purchase of new aircraft, and declining interest income from surplus funds. Turnover rose 11.5 per cent at the interim stage, to HKDollars 10.98bn. Earnings per share rose by 5.1 cents to 43.9 cents, and Cathay held its interim dividend at 10.5 cents.</p>

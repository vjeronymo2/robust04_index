			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / SEC seeks boost in powers The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is calling for legislation that substantially increases the watchdog agency's power to oversee mutual fund activities. In a report to be presented to Congress today the SEC requests improved access to information 'to monitor adequately mutual fund investments, including investments in derivatives'. It is recommended that funds use a 'quantitative risk measure' of derivatives in fund filings and that the SEC re-examine leverage restrictions put on funds by mutual fund oversight laws. The agency also requests that mutual funds keep additional records to 'enable the inspection staff, among other things, to analyse a fund's derivatives instruments'. The agency asks that it be given power to require funds file information with the agency electronically and on a more frequent basis. Along with additional legislative powers, the SEC said it needed more money and more staff. The SEC report was requested by Rep Edward Markey, chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON, ASHLAND POST BIG GAINS; ARCO PROFIT DIPS  </P> <P> Oil giant Exxon Corp. said Monday that its second-quarter profit soared nearly  seven-fold from a year ago, when it set aside a special provision to handle the  massive cleanup from the oil spill in Valdez, Alaska.  </P> <P> Another big oil company, Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., reported  that earnings fell 16%, while independent producer Ashland Oil Co. said its  earnings more than doubled in the quarter.  </P> <P> New York-based Exxon earned $1.1 billion in the three months ended June 30,  compared to $140 million in the 1989 quarter. Revenue totaled $26.08 billion,  up 10% from $23.61 billion a year ago.  </P> <P> Last year's results included an $850-million provision for the Valdez spill.  Without that, Exxon said, it would have earned $990 million in the 1989  quarter.  </P> <P> Arco's second-quarter earnings fell to $391 million from $467 million in 1989.  Sales of the Los Angeles company fell 7% to $4 billion from $4.3 billion.  </P> <P> Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky., reported record net income of $100 million for  the quarter ended June 30, 1990. The amount was more than double the $44  million in 1989. Sales were $2.2 billion, the same as in last year's quarter.  </P> <P> Exxon Chairman L. G. Rawl said earnings from petroleum and natural gas  operations increased $205 million, or 22%, despite lower crude prices. He said  that helped offset a $115-million drop in chemical earnings.  </P> <P> Earnings from U.S. exploration and production activities were $81 million, down  from $289 million in 1989. But earnings from foreign exploration and production  operations rose $75 million to $464 million.  </P> <P> From coal and minerals operations, Exxon earned $12 million, compared to $22  million last year.  </P> <P> For the first half of 1990, Exxon earned $2.38 billion, up 22% from $1.95  billion in 1989. Revenue rose 15% to $52 billion.  </P> <P> The 1989 results included an $880-million provision related to the Valdez  accident and a $535-million cumulative accounting gain following adoption of  new income tax accounting standards.  </P> <P> Exxon said it would have earned $2.29 billion in the 1989 half year excluding  the provision and special gain.  </P> <P> Arco said lower crude oil prices, less production in Alaska and higher  international exploration expenses more than offset a sharp rise in profits  from refining and marketing operations.  </P></p>

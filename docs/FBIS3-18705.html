So far there's been only talk  of prosecuting low-ranking army officials for such war crimes.    Some members of Dutch parliament claim that the worst  criminals in former Yugoslavia are not those wearing uniforms  but those who put on suits to attend peace negotiations. The  special tribunal at the International Court of Justice in The  Hague is to start conducting its first trials this year.</p>

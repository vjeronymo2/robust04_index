			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: LEARNING THE LANGUAGE OF CUSTOMS;  </P> <P> MANNERS: WHEN ABROAD, IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR TRAVELERS TO KNOW THE LANGUAGE OF A  PARTICULAR COUNTRY. ONE SHOULD ALSO KNOW ITS CUSTOMS AND RULES OF ETIQUETTE.  </P> <P> Not long ago I was in a business meeting with a government official in the  Middle East. I sat on a chair. My associate sat on a low couch facing our host.  Everything went fine until my friend, uncomfortable with his position on the  couch, crossed his legs.  </P> <P> The official grew agitated, appeared nervous and soon ended the meeting. As we  walked outside, our interpreter explained what had happened. When my friend  crossed his legs, his feet were raised and seemed to point directly at the  official. It was considered an insult. Not having been forewarned, we had acted  inappropriately.  </P> <P> Slowly but surely, Americans traveling abroad are discovering that it's not  enough simply to know the language. To avoid making some small -- and some  not-so-small -- social blunders in foreign countries, it pays to know a few of  their more important customs and manners.  </P> <P> Obviously, you can't be expected to know every obscure or bizarre custom or law  of countries you visit. But it does help to know certain essential rules of  etiquette.  </P> <P> In Brazil, never wear green and yellow, the colors of the flag. People will  laugh at you. Don't give the thumbs-up sign in Iran, Ghana or the Soviet Union  -- it's considered obscene. Waving your hand back and forth might seem like the  appropriate gesture for "hello" in the United States, but in Greece it's a rude  gesture called the moutza.  </P> <P> Whatever you do, don't give the "A-OK" sign with your hand in Tunisia. Forming  a circle with your thumb and forefinger essentially means "I'll kill you" in  that country. If you make the same symbol in Japan, people will think you're  begging for money.  </P> <P> If you lay your chopsticks down on the table in Korea, it's a signal that you  have ended your meal. If you lay them down in Japan, be sure they're not  pointed in the direction of any other guest at the table. That's a taboo.  </P> <P> Then there's the problem of body language. In Thailand, tradition dictates that  the "eyes are the windows of the heart." Eye contact is a large part of the  Thai culture. As long as you look into a person's eyes, your look probably will  be returned with a smile. But don't stare.  </P> <P> And don't wink at anyone in Hong Kong. It's considered quite impolite. Also, be  aware of body linguistics. Watch what you do with your hands and feet in  countries such as India and Thailand. A friendly slap on the back to a Thai  could get you into trouble. Finger pointing is rude, and while sitting, never  point your feet in the direction of another person -- that is a serious insult.  </P> <P> In Chile, holding your hand with the palm up and the fingers separated means  stupid. And a right fist raised to the level of the head might have been hip in  1972, but not these days. (It's the Communist sign). Then there's this  longstanding bizarre rule: In Albania, federal law prohibits singing in public.  </P> <P> As for keeping your distance, a good rule to follow is that when introduced to  someone in a foreign country, keep things relatively formal until you fully  understand the customs.  </P> <P> Recently an American businessman visiting Malaysia did not follow this advice.  He went to the country to close a deal on a lucrative contract. At a ceremony  to celebrate the beginning of negotiations, he was introduced to someone he  thought was called "Roger." Trying to be more familiar, he called the man  "Rog." One small problem. The man to whom he was talking was a rajah.  </P> <P> There are a number of good books that can guide you through the subtle but  important differences (and expectations) in foreign customs and manners. Nancy  Braganti and Elizabeth Devine have written both "The Travelers' Guide to Asian  Customs and Manners" (St. Martin's Press, $9.95) and "The Travelers' Guide to  Latin American Customs and Manners" (St. Martin's Press, $10.95).  </P> <P> The guides deal with variations in behavior, dress, legal matters, tipping and  how to avoid major gaffes in language and general conversation. Some of the  advice is excellent: "If you're changing money at a bank in Chile, be prepared  to stand in long lines, since people pay their bills there."  </P> <P> Some of it is more or less universal: "When you ask Argentines for directions  on the street, they will give you very detailed instructions, even if they have  no idea where your destination is. It's a matter of pride for Argentines to act  as if they know the correct response." (From my experience, the same advice  applies equally in New York, Tanzania and Canton, Ohio.)  </P> <P> Then there's something called "Culturgrams," four-page leaflets packed with  etiquette and customs information on 90 countries. The series is produced by  the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies at Brigham Young  University. Write to BYU, KCIS Publication Services, 280 HRVB, Provo, Utah  84602, for prices.  </P> <P> You don't have to leave home to benefit from "Foreignisms" by Tad Duleja  (Macmillan, $18.95). The book calls itself a "dictionary of foreign expressions  commonly (and not so uncommonly) used in English."  </P> <P> It explains, in entertaining detail, the meaning and origins of phrases and  terms ranging from oy vey to gringo, to a full glossary of French ballet  terminology. After all, you never know when you'll be called on to explain the  difference between a glissade and a sissonne.  </P> <P> Two other books deal with an approach to foreign language that can only  described as definitely not Berlitz. "Wicked French" and "Wicked Italian," both  by Howard Tomb (Workman Publishing, $3.95 each), will not help you become  fluent in these languages, but will help you develop the appropriate hip  attitude with French or Italian.  </P> <P> For example, under the "Words of Love" section the author helps American  tourists with such phrases as "vous etes une super nana" (you are one fabulous  babe).  </P> <P> Other selections include "Entuyons nous ensemble sur mon yacht, mon petit chou"  (Come away with me on my yacht, my little cabbage).  </P> <P> The "Wicked Italian" book offers even more practical phrases. The chapter  "Shouting in Traffic" gives six suggestions, ranging from "Che pezzo di  stupido!" (What a jerk!) to the more colorful "Speriamo che all'inferno le  insegneranno a guidare" (Maybe they will teach you to drive in hell).  </P></p>

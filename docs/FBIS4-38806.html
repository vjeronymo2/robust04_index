			<p>BFN     [Text] A curfew has been introduced throughout the Chechen  Republic from today by presidential decree. Groznyy says that  the reason for this decision is that Russia has extended the  state of emergency zone in Ingushetia and North Osetia to cover  regions which are directly adjacent to Chechnya.    Russia has not yet officially proposed holding summit talks  with the Chechen Republic. The only knowledge we have of a  possible meeting between Boris Yeltin and Dzhokar Dudayev is  what we have read in the press. This was stated to our radio  station by Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Mayrabek Mugadayev.  He stressed that Groznyy does not even know who precisely in  Moscow is engaged in preparing the summit talks. And any other  talks, at government or Foreign Ministry level, will not do any  good, Mugadayev considers. The Russian prime minister also  agrees with this point of view.    [Begin Mugadayev recording] Viktor Stepanovich  [Chernomyrdin]  told me straight: He said he approved all seven points or  questions which we put forward and the draft agreement which I  showed him. It is necessary for Presidents Yeltsin and Dudayev  to resolve the political aspect of the question. One can regard  the government-level talks as having been completed since the  governments have no complaints against each other. [end  recording]    [Announcer] And here is another report from Groznyy. Dzhokar  Dudayev today stated that the Russian special services are  preparing a plan to organize a local nuclear explosion in  Chechnya. Representatives of Russia's foreign intellignece  service have denied this report.</p>

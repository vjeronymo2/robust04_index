			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Fritz Wirth: "Change Through Success"] </F>   [Text] The time of political miracles, which began to  change the world so dramatically five years ago, is changing  into a time of astonishment. Hardly anybody is contributing  more to this postmiraculous world than the man who made change  his political trademark -- Bill Clinton. This was emphasized  and proved by his appearance in Congress yesterday.    In the middle of an international landscape of political  crises, disenchantment on the part of the voters, and  superannuated governments, one could see one of the last and  rare political winners. The man who a year ago in the same  place complained about the economic crisis, which he allegedly  inherited, has now presented himself as its triumphant master  and winner. This is all the more astonishing since right at the  beginning, Congress took away from him that instrument -- a  $30-billion program for the stimulation of the U.S. economy --  with which he wanted to overcome the crisis. Nevertheless, the  economy recovered, probably by following different laws than  those that Clinton had in mind. However, yesterday he did not  hesitate for one minute in presenting himself as the man who  saved the nation from the crisis.    It is irrelevant to ask whether this bold claim of Clinton  is  legitimate. The only thing that counts is that the great  majority of citizens, who like to personify political movements,  accept Clinton in this role. This has also resulted in a  remarkable change of the political climate in the United States.  No longer troubled by the recession, the citizens are more  receptive and cooperative than before.    The shocking and warning words of the early Clinton days --  "It's the economy, you idiots" -- are no longer up to date. The  citizens are turning to other problems. They are no longer so  interested in wealth, profit, and those priorities that  characterized the 1980's. Priority is now being given to  questions of personal security and the renewal of disappearing  family values. In a nutshell: The citizens no longer expect  the state so much to provide benefits and jobs as to act as a  defender against the violence in the streets of the United  States, which is getting out of hand and is breaking social  structures.    Nobody has realized that faster than the populist Bill  Clinton, who keeps in closer contact with the citizens than any  other U.S. president has in the past three decades. Proof of  that lies in the program that he presented yesterday. It no  longer focuses on economic acronyms such as NAFTA [North  American Free Trade Agreement] and GATT, but the concern about  the health and security of the citizens. The reform of the  health sector, and his law to contain the crime rate will be the  crucial issues for the next few months.    Popular as they may be -- they will not be a comfortable  free  ticket to success, such as Clinton had in the way he dealt with  the economic crisis last year. The reason is that Americans  will be going to the polls again this year. Congress, which will  be reelected in the autumn, will be a significantly more  reserved and difficult partner. The Republicans, who were still  important and willing partners for Clinton in his struggle for  NAFTA, have already assumed an aggressive posture. They have  criticized Clinton's reform of the health system as "socialized  medicine" and will not let him get away with taking from them  their reputation as the "law-and-order" party with his "crime  bill."    Clinton understands his initiatives as a new partnership  with  the citizens for social peace. His critics have made out an  excessive degree of state intervention in this partnership.  Thus, the old ideological fronts between the Democrats and the  Republicans, which seemed to have vanished in the past few  months, will reappear.    In view of these internal priorities, yesterday nobody  expected Clinton to come up with a profound foreign policy  program. Therefore, it was all the more astonishing that he did  not degrade the issue to a mere footnote. His statement of the  "responsibility for leadership" was hardly part of his foreign  policy concept last year, when he was permanently concentrating  on looking for the emergency exits in international crises.  Since his last visit to Europe at the latest, he felt that this  escape route is now only open to a limited degree. The  developments in the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union,  and North Korea will, with great probability, require action in  the near future. The promise he made yesterday, namely to stop  the cuts in the U.S armed forces, which he had so far vehemently  proposed and implemented, is a first sign for a U.S. security  policy that is no longer exclusively based on lofty words or the  action transit to the United Nations.    Nevertheless, one must warn against too high expectations  for  change in this sphere from the so-called president of change.  His appearance yesterday has emphasized that quite clearly:  Bill Clinton is a brilliant political "salesman," who can still  handle words better than power. Yet, apart from that -- as  could be seen in the recent scandal stories -- he is still a man  for unpredictable things. Before this president will really go  down in history, he will first have to settle the stories that  still accompany his career. Until then there is still much time  for astonishment.</p>

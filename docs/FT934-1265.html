			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / UK Company News: LWT condemns Granada bid London Weekend Television yesterday condemned as 'inadequate and opportunistic' the hostile offer from Granada worth more than Pounds 600m, and urged shareholders to reject it. Sir Christopher Bland, the LWT chairman, said in a letter to shareholders that the offer from Granada, the rental, leisure and television group, requires them to exchange their holdings in 'a highly regarded television company for shares in a conglomerate earning half its profits in a low growth sector'. The LWT chairman also said the cash alternative of 528p a share was too low, and acceptance of the share offer would result in a fall in dividend income for LWT shareholders. In what is clearly the first salvo in a long campaign, LWT concentrated on its own track record and future prospects. It emphasised that since December 1989 only four companies of the 811 in the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index had increased the value of their shares more than LWT. 'By contrast Granada was the 247th best performer in the index in this period'. The document points out that Pounds 100 invested in both companies' shares on December 15 1989 would have returned, including dividend, Pounds 755 from LWT and Pounds 176 from Granada. LWT was now the third largest ITV company in terms of share of net advertising revenue, whereas Granada fell from third to fifth place between 1982 to 1992. 'Granada may need LWT to make sense of its television business but LWT doesn't need Granada,' said Sir Christopher. The LWT chairman also promised shareholders a profit estimate and recommended dividend for 1993 in the new year. Analysts are suggesting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 36m compared with Pounds 30.6m last time. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, said yesterday the LWT board seemed to be confused: it admitted that scale was necessary in television, yet rejected the only logical combination in terms of advertising revenue, audience size, financial strength and licence payments. 'In the meantime Granada is offering a generous multiple of 32 times historic earnings or 27 times market estimates for the current year which reflects the high opinion that Granada has of LWT's business.' Mr Robinson said.</p>

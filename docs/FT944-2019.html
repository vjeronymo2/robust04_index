			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / The monks' empty glass cabinet: The missing Codex Sinaiticus sits in London. But should it be returned to its original home? This is a tale of two libraries. They are thousands of miles apart, but united in their respect for scholarship and reverence for the written word. They both, in their own way, contain awesome collections of manuscripts and richly repay the effort of a visit. I have seen both in the past week and, in the course of my travels, heard for the first time the sad story of the Codex Sinaiticus. The first visit was to the library of the Greek Orthodox monks of St Catharine's monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai. The location is, as promised in the ever-thickening piles of tourist brochures, spectacular, the 6th century church radiant with early Byzantine splendour. The library, said our guide from the monastery, was laden with riches from the early years of Christianity; but the jewel of their collection was missing. He pointed to a glass case in the corner containing a few sheets of parchment with Greek writing on them. A poorly-taken photograph was stuck on the cabinet with Sellotape. It showed what should have been inside: the Codex Sinaiticus, a 4th century bible regarded as one of the three most important early versions of the holy book in existence. Our guide, more in sorrow than in anger, told us the monks' side of the story. The Codex was borrowed by a 19th century German scholar, Constantine Tischendorf, who promised he would bring it back to its proper home. The letter in which he made his pledge hangs on one of the church walls. Instead, the Codex ended up in the hands of the Russian Tsar in St Petersburg. There it remained until the Soviet government, which unsurprisingly had little use for the tome, sold it to the British Museum in 1933, reputedly to help pay for the restoration of its embassy in London. The monks' glass cabinet, in the meantime, has remained empty. And so, a few days later, I visited my second library; not, strictly speaking, a library at all, but room 30 of the British Museum in London, which contains a staggeringly valuable collection of original documents and volumes: Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the Slavonic Gospels, Haydn's Drum-Roll symphony; even a letter from John Lennon, bless him, to his old mucker Stuart Sutcliffe. And there, in an unobtrusive corner, the Codex Sinaiticus, next to the Codex Alexandrinus, not too far from Nelson's Memorandum and a germ's leap away from the culture plate on which Fleming discovered penicillin  - odd bed-fellows to be sure, but part of the eclectic charm of the place, I suppose. I ranted to myself (and to a startled shop assistant) about the evils of cultural imperialism and suddenly hated this cultured corner of Bloomsbury which has caused so much distress round the world. But I instinctively felt on dodgy ground. And so it proved. The British Museum side of the story, as expressed in one of its books, soon clears away the smokescreen of sentiment. Tischendorf, according to their sources, actually rescued the pages of the Codex from being incinerated by the monks for winter fuel. He then persuaded them to present the book to the Tsar in appreciation of the protection of Holy Russia, in order to safeguard it. The guide in the monastery had heard the argument, and duly rubbished it ('How, then, did we manage to keep it in perfect condition for 15 centuries?'). But I spoke to a couple of authorities in the field who confirmed my worst fears. The monks of St Catharine's at that time, it seems, cared as much for their treasures as for a sack of coal. Their attitude to antiquity, one of them told me, showed 'an irresponsibility that beggars description'. But that is not the end of the story; for today's monks are very aware indeed of the value of their collection, and assure us that they know exactly how to look after it. The rules of the game are different. Tourists are beginning to flock to Sinai as they have traditionally flocked to Bloomsbury, they listen to the monks' plight, they curse Europe's cynical plunderers. The British Museum is finding it more and more difficult to play the straight bat of rightful ownership; and rightly so. For possession is only nine-tenths, after all, and when did the law ever capture hearts and change minds anyway?</p>

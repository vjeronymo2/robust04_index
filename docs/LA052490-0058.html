			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READER CITES EVIL OF MILLS COLLEGE PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Observing the behavior of Mills College students ("Quiet Riot," May 16) fills  me with despair and disgust. Despair when I think of those thousands of brave  and caring women around the world who regularly put their lives on the line in  the battle for freedom and also who regularly fight against overwhelming odds  such cruel social ills as rampant hunger, lack of medical care, and  overwhelming poverty.  </P> <P> The real evil here is the scandalous cost of higher education in the United  States -- $21,000 a year for tuition, board, and room is too high to pay to any  institution. If we really cared about young people in this country, college and  university educations would be wholly subsidized and made available to women  and men on the basis of merit.  </P> <P> EDMONDE A.

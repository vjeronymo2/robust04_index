			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Gatt chief hails trade deal ratification Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday hailed the US Senate vote to ratify the Uruguay Round world trade accords as showing US commitment to multilateralism and a good sign for the new World Trade Organisation. 'This is a day for particular celebration,' he said in Geneva. US ratification was also significant in ensuring a WTO starting date of January 1, due to be endorsed by an implementation conference on December 8. Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton said yesterday that he hoped he could 'continue the spirit of co-operation with the new Congress that we've seen on Gatt this week.' The final margin of victory was much wider in both houses of Congress than earlier wrangling had suggested. The Gatt bill passed in the House of Representatives on Tuesday by 288 votes to 146, and in the Senate on Thursday by 76 votes to 24. Gatt opponents did only slightly better on a crucial Senate procedural vote, falling nine votes short of blocking the measure by raising a technical budget point. Mr Clinton was yesterday afternoon due to meet Senator Robert Dole and Congressman Newt Gingrich, who will lead the majority Republicans when the new Congress convenes in January. Although Mr Dole and Mr Gingrich voiced reservations about Gatt before throwing their support behind it, conservative analysts say traditional Republican free trade views will prove stronger than the temptation to obstruct Mr Clinton. 'I believe that certainly Newt Gingrich has turned the corner on free trade, and I hope that Bob Dole has as well,' said Mr Kim Holmes, who heads the foreign policy team at the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think-tank. One of the first trade issues to face the new Congress will be the issue of giving the president a free hand under fast track procedures to negotiate the admission of Chile to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which links the US with Canada and Mexico. Dismissing some fears about loss of US sovereignty to the WTO as 'arrant nonsense', Mr Sutherland said he was confident that the WTO's disputes procedures would be 'unimpeachable'. This was a reference to the judicial review panel insisted on by Mr Dole in return for his endorsement of the Uruguay Round deal. Mr Sutherland also welcomed the 'good news from Japan' whose lower parliamentary chamber - the decisive voice on ratification - approved the pact just hours after the Senate vote. This leaves the EU and Canada among the Quad group of leading traders which have still to ratify. Both have said they are confident of doing so by the end of the year. The great majority of Gatt's 124 members are now expected swiftly to follow the US lead. Over 40 nations had ratified by yesterday and Mr Sutherland said the target was 'at least 100' by December 30. Only Switzerland, Poland, Liechtenstein and Cyprus foresee a delay into 1995.</p>

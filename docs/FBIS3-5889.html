			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Legislators and party  representatives Friday [11 March] called the arrest of former  Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura during the Diet session  "regrettable," but urged fellow lawmakers to restore political  morale to regain public trust.    House of Representatives member Nakamura was arrested on  suspicion of bribery after the lower house for the first time in  26 years approved a relevant petition filed by the Tokyo  District Court.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who also heads the Japan  New Party, said the arrest of a legislator while the Diet was in  session is "really regrettable," but did not elaborate.    Japanese legislators cannot be arrested during a Diet  session  without a go-ahead from parliament.    Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono said "as a  legislator" he regretted "that things have come so far." Out of  respect for the Diet's ethical standards, legislators have to  make sure to clear themselves from any suspicion, he said.    Kono's party, which is at the center of the current  corruption scandal highlighting ties between the construction  industry and politicians, must make further efforts to "break  with corruption," Kono said.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest force within  the ruling coalition, said the Diet's lifting of Nakamura's  immunity demonstrates parliament's determination to combat  political corruption.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference his  party "honors" the Diet decision and urged the prosecution to  clarify suspicions against Nakamura as soon as possible.    Nakamura quit the main opposition LDP on Wednesday. He is  suspected of having accepted a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima  Corp., a leading construction firm.    Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party), another key coalition member, told reporters the  Diet's cooperation with prosecutors is important in restoring  public trust in politics.    "We politicians must try to shape up so we can win back  public trust in politics," he said.    House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi, while noting  the  need to honor parliamentarians' rights, said that legislators on  the other hand have the duty to safeguard the credibility of the  Diet.    Health and Welfare Minister Keizo Ouchi, leader of the minor  coalition Democratic Socialist Party, said it is "really  regrettable" that the construction bribery scandal has spread as  far as to an incumbent legislator.    He said that for the sake of public trust, the Diet had to  lift Nakamura's immunity.    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, of the SDP, said  Nakamura's arrest is "extremely bitter" for his ministry as it  has further undermined voter's trust.    Kazuo Shii, chief of the Secretariat of the minor opposition  Japanese Communist Party (JCP), said Nakamura's arrest is "a  matter of course" and his case only the tip of the iceberg.    He said his party will demand that Shinseito co-leader  Ichiro  Ozawa be questioned in connection with a series of bribery  scandals involving major contractors.    With bribes having been disbursed to win public works  contracts, Hosokawa and his government bear responsibility for  full clarification of the scandal, Shii said.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OPERA  </P> <P> Pop Star Pavarotti: Luciano Pavarotti is the new kid on the block of the  British pop charts.  </P> <P> His rendition of "Nessun dorma" from Puccini's opera "Turandot" has jumped to  No. 3 on the singles chart, due in large part to the daily play it receives as  the theme for the BBC's World Cup soccer coverage. The single's popularity  propelled Pavarotti's album, "The Essential Pavarotti," to the top of the pop  album list. Decca Records officials said this is the first time a classical  album has hit No. 1 on the pop album chart. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

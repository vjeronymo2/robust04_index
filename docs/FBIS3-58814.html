A total of 5,000  people participated in the procession. [passage omitted]    In St. Stephen's Square, the number of participants  increased  to 10,000. During the final rally, writer Johannes Mario Simmel  warned against newly developing right-wing extremism. He said:  "The Nazis are on the advance like never before since 1945." He  said the letter-bomb attacks in Austria are only a "preliminary  culmination point." [passage omitted].</p>

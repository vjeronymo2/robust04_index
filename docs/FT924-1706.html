			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Birmingham council cuts 3,000 jobs BIRMINGHAM City Council, England's largest local authority, yesterday announced 3,000 redundancies in a package of cuts needed to keep within government capping limits for next year. The redundancies, which come on top of 1,000 jobs lost through natural wastage in the last year, affect 6 per cent of the council's workforce. Redundancies will be compulsory if insufficient volunteers come forward. Sir Richard Knowles, Birmingham Labour leader, said the council's 'horrendous financial position' brought about by the government's 'unfair' assessment of the city's spending needs made the redundancies unavoidable. 'The government's action strikes at the heart of the Birmingham economy, which has already suffered disproportionately as a result of the government-inspired recession,' he added. Birmingham's present spending is capped at Pounds 879m for 1993-94. The council claims it is being allowed to spend only 0.73 per cent more than last year because the government has overestimated by Pounds 15m the amount it actually spends on further education - which is being taken over by central government. Other city authorities also claim to have been penalised by overestimates of current spending on further education. Since most are already spending at their capping levels, the implications are serious for next year's budgets. Sheffield has announced 800 redundancies and Coventry indicated yesterday that it would have to shed about 1,000 posts to keep within capping limits. Birmingham faced the unpalatable choice of cutting services or slashing its extensive capital programme. Last year capital financing costs absorbed Pounds 264m, or 17 per cent, of the city council's revenue spending of Pounds 1.56bn. The main capital projects throughout the 1980s were the National Exhibition Centre, the International Convention Centre and the National Indoor Arena. The Trades Union Congress yesterday urged the government to tackle rising unemployment, Lisa Wood writes. The call came as the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development forecast that the UK would have the biggest increase in unemployment among leading industrial nations in the first half of the 1990s. The official unemployment total for November will be published today.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Credit loses appeal as joblessness rises CONSUMERS have become far more sophisticated in managing personal finances since the credit-financed consumer boom of the 1980s, according to a report published today. The report by Verdict Research, a retail consultancy, says: 'Credit has for the time being lost some of its attraction.' Greater uncertainty about the future and rising unemployment have encouraged consumers to reduce debt. New non-mortgage credit advanced in 1991 amounted to Pounds 52.1bn - a 3.6 per cent reduction in real terms compared to 1990. Loans outstanding at the end of 1991 amounted to Pounds 51.9bn - 4.8 per cent lower in real terms. Yet those levels were the same, in constant prices, as in 1988. The report suggests: 'This resilience in difficult times bodes well for an expansion of consumer credit boosting retail spending as the economic recovery gathers pace.' Consumers were increasingly using different forms of payment to avoid a build-up of debt. More were paying off credit-card balances in full monthly and debit-card use had risen sevenfold since 1989 to 330m transactions a year. Bank credit cards more than doubled to nearly 30m during the 1980s, and annual transactions rose from 160m to 650m. An estimated 3m cardholders  - mainly infrequent users - had abandoned their cards on the introduction of annual fees. Card fraud cost Pounds 166m last year - 35 per cent more than in 1990.

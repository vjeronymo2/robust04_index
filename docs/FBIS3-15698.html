That's what  Estonian political parties archive chief Valdur Ohmann would  like to know. Ohmann says the Estonian parties' archive houses  close to 60,000 of the remaining records: less than a quarter  of the estimated total, he says.    The files in the archive attest to Stalinist repressions:  the mass deportations of Estonian citizens in 1941 and 1949,  the persecution of clergy, and charges against people involved  in Estonia's pre-Soviet government. More recent files consist  primarily of criminal records and "tourism" records, which trace  every person who traveled abroad.    Administrative records, including correspondance, accounts,  and personnel files are missing, Ohmann says.    The KGB files' disappearance may be traced back to the  dramatic events of August 1991, when the Estonian Kodukaitse  (home guard), took control of the KGB building at Pagari Street  in Tallinn. Hardo Aasmae, Tallinn's major at the time,  personally sealed the door to the KGB archives. Witnesses  remember seeing clouds of smoke over the KGB building and heard  rumors that trucks loaded with documents were pulling out from  behind the building.    Soon after, the government rebuffed the archive department's  attempt to join a commission created to take over the KGB  documents.    In October 1991, the archive building was opened and the  records handed over to the police department, essentially to the  body that cooperated with the KGB.    By giving the KGB files to the police, "former Estonian  Prime  Minister Edgar Savisaar's government violated its own rules,"  says Peep Pillak, state archive department director. A law  passed August 16, 1990 states that the archives of all  liquidated organizations must be transferred to the archive  department.    "Or was the police department considered the legal successor  to the KGB?" Pillak asks.    A year-and-a-half passed before Prime Minister Mart Laar  ordered the police department on April 19, 1993 to transfer  immediately the KGB records to the archive department. The  records now occupy the archive for Estonian Political Parties,  formerly the Estonian Communist Party archives.    The so-called Savisaar-Bakatin agreement, made at the end of  1991, promised the return to Estonia of all KGB records that had  been carried to Russia. On December 4, 1991, 500 kilos of the  estimated 5 tons of records were returned, Estonian news agency  ETA reported.    The KGB also housed records in other Estonian towns, but the  archive department has not received them, Pillak comments.    Pillak suspects that part of the KGB archives were destroyed  or hidden during the year-and-a-half before Laar ordered the  records to go to the archive department. The rest may still be  in Russia, he says.</p>

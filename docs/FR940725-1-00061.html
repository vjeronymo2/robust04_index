			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.161(e) would ensure that excessive forces are not encountered in commuter category airplanes during extended climbs at V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the takeoff configuration, when climb above 400 feet is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 23.175&blank;Demonstration of Static Longitudinal Stability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal would make changes to &sect;23.175 power, configurations, and speeds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.175(a)(1) would change the flap position from the climb position to the flaps retracted position. This is a clarifying change since virtually all part 23 airplanes use flaps retracted for climb. Also, this proposed change would align the part 23 and part 25 climb static longitudinal stability requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.175(a)(3) would delete the option for the applicant to select some power other than maximum continuous power as an operating limitation. As noted in the proposed change to &sect;23.155, this would eliminate a power specification that is unnecessary and simplify normal operations for the pilot. Proposed &sect;23.175(a)(4) would make the trim speed consistent with the enroute all-engine climb speed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to &sect;23.175(b) would rearrange the section with no change in requirements. The definition of V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> FC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contained in &sect;23.175(b)(2) is proposed to be moved to part 1, to harmonize with JAR 1. (See the proposed change to &sect;1.1.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current &sect;23.175(c), which requires the test for gear down cruise static longitudinal stability, would be deleted. This test is considered superfluous to the land configuration static longitudinal stability test and does not represent a likely operating scenario. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.175(c) would be current &sect;23.175(d) with only a change to use V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> REF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as the trim speed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 23.177&blank;Static Directional and Lateral Stability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed revisions to &sect;23.177 would delete the requirements for two-control airplanes, make minor clarifying changes, and specify an exclusion for acrobatic category airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.177 would delete the introductory phrase concerning three-control airplanes, which is consistent with the deletion of the requirements for two-control airplanes in current paragraph (b). The two-control airplane regulations were introduced in 1945 but no two-control airplanes have been certificated for several decades and no need is foreseen for these regulations. If an applicant proposes a two-control airplane, the FAA would issue special conditions. After deleting the introductory portion of &sect;23.177(a), paragraph (a)(1) would be redesignated as (a). In the first sentence, the proposed change replaces ``skid'' with ``wings level sideslip'' to clarify the intended maneuver. Also, the proposed change increases the power requirement for demonstration of directional stability in the landing configuration. The current requirement specifies power necessary to maintain a three degree angle of decent. Maximum continuous power is considered appropriate since directional stability should be maintained during a balked landing, particularly since directional instability is an undesirable characteristic at any point in the flight envelope. Also, V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> A <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is replaced by V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to be consistent with &sect;23.1507. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.177(b), currently (a)(2), replaces ``any'' with ``all'' in the first sentence to clarify that all landing gear and flap positions must be addressed. Also, the proposed paragraph would specify a minimum speed at which static lateral stability may not be negative, as 1.3 V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> S <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , for all configurations except takeoff. This is consistent with the other speeds specified in &sect;23.177(b) and relieves the requirement for other than takeoff speeds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.177(c) would provide an exclusion for the dihedral effect for acrobatic category airplanes approved for inverted flight. The proposed change recognizes that, in fully acrobatic airplanes, the dihedral effect is not a desired characteristic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of proposed &sect;23.147(c), which ensures lateral control capability without the use of the primary lateral control system, compensates for the relieving nature of proposed &sect;23.177(b) and the exception from the requirements of &sect;23.177(b) for acrobatic category airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present &sect;23.177(a)(3) is redesignated as &sect;23.177(d). The proposed &sect;23.177(d) deletes the next to the last sentence, concerning bank angle and heading, because the current requirement is not a necessary test condition and a constant heading during the sideslip may be impossible in some airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Insurance profits fear hits CU shares FEARS ABOUT the impact of Saturday's City bomb damage on the profits of Commercial Union, one of the UK's leading insurers, hit the company's share price yesterday. Initial indications are, however, that the rest of the UK insurance industry will lose less from the attack than it did in the explosions of April 1992. Commercial Union, which leads coverage on the NatWest Tower, said it was 'unlikely to lose less' than the Pounds 15m paid out last year. Its shares fell 15p yesterday to close at 593p. Other companies expect to be less badly hit. Sun Alliance said total net losses were unlikely to exceed Pounds 15m, compared to Pounds 39m last year. General Accident is forecasting a loss of less than Pounds 7m. Guardian Royal Exchange and Royal Insurance are expecting to lose less than Pounds 5m. Differences in reinsurance arrangements explain the contrasting outlook. The main exposures of the companies stem from policies underwritten in 1992, before terrorism was excluded from standard commercial policies. Both Royal Insurance and Guardian Royal Exchange bought reinsurance policies from Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company set up to handle terrorism risk earlier this year. Sun Alliance and General Accident bought extra reinsurance from alternative sources in the commercial market. Commercial Union has less comprehensive reinsurance arrangements. The figures indicate that the government and reinsurance companies will bear the brunt of the bill, estimated by the Association of British Insurers, the industry trade association, between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. The companies are stressing, however, that their loss estimates are preliminary.</p>

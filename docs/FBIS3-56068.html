He informed Kazakh and foreign  journalists about state of developments in political and  military ties between Kazakhstan and Russia. Zhukeyev noted in  particular that last year the two countries signed at various  levels a package of key documents on broadening military  cooperation. Touching upon the use of Baykonur, the state  advisor stressed that this important strategic object after the  forthcoming summit talks would be likely to be let to the  Russian military department [defense ministry].    All work connected with the exploration of space will be  conducted in future in the interests of Kazakhstan and Russia.  A research space company is intended to be set up in future to  work for the benefit of both states. A first step has been  taken in restructuring the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing site,  which has some unique equipment. In addition, the idea of  organizing a national nuclear center in Kazakhstan was discussed.    Zhukeyev said that between Kazakhstan and Russia a complete  mutual understanding has been reached concerning building of  military and political ties. This once more vividly shows that  our two countries do not have a single problem which it were not  possible to tackle on the basis of good will.</p>

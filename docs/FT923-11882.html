			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Branson sets out timetable for rail service VIRGIN GROUP, the airline company headed by Mr Richard Branson, has worked out detailed plans for running five trains a day each way between London and the north from next summer. The company aims to take advantage of the privatisation of British Rail by setting up a network of inter-city services using trains leased from BR. Mr Branson, accompanied by Electra Private Equity Partners and Steer Davies Gleave, the transport consultants, outlined his plans to Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, yesterday. He hopes to lease four InterCity 125 diesel trains from BR, then heavily refurbish them to airliner standards before putting them into service on London-Scotland routes. Service on board would be similar to that provided on Virgin's aircraft. Mr Branson plans to run five trains daily from London to Newcastle, with four continuing to Edinburgh or Glasgow. Other intermediate stops would be chosen from Middlesbrough, York or Durham. The service would be called the Virgin Flyer. It would form the prototype for a network of other inter-city services serving up to 30 destinations through the country. Mr Branson said the services would operate in addition to BR's, not in place of them, and fares would be the same or less. BR privately questions whether Virgin could make them pay. BR also said that it did not have trains for Mr Branson to lease and added that little space was available on its congested tracks.</p>

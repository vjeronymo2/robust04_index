			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases in an otherwise strong region EQUITIES ended only marginally lower in spite of the yen's continued advance against the dollar, as investors waited patiently for fresh incentives, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 8.94 to 20,843.69, up 1.4 per cent on the week, after reaching a session high of 20,939.66 and a low of 20,746.61. The Topix index of all first section issues rose 1.11 to 1,654.82 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.19 to 1260.22. Volume was 550m shares compared to Thursday's 757m. Advances led declines 628 to 434 with 127 issues unchanged. Brokers said that investors lacked the energy and the interest to lift equity prices, with arbitrageurs and individual investors dominating dealing for most of the session. Market participants kept to the same strategy of focusing on individual issues with above-average results, or shares backed by strong incentives, an analyst at a Japanese brokerage said. Non-ferrous issues rose in tandem with gold prices overseas: Mitsui Mining and Smelting Y13 to Y564, Sumitomo Metal and Mining Y10 to Y1,090 and Dowa Mining Y3 to Y656. Isuzu Motors, the day's most active issue, advanced Y16 to Y530 on reports that it will develop a ceramic engine. But profit-taking put pressure on financials, after two consecutive sessions of sharp gains. Mitsubishi Bank retreated Y20 to Y2,760, Daiichi Kangyo Bank Y10 to Y2,030 and Daiwa Bank Y20 to Y1,170. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 31.88 higher at 23,112.76, in volume of 36.0m shares. Roundup A STRONG end to the week's trading was recorded by several of the region's markets yesterday. SINGAPORE broke through the 1,900 barrier to close at its second successive year's high helped by strong overseas interest. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 19.18 higher at 1,905.34 in volume of 311.5m shares, a gain of 2.4 per cent on the week. Sembawang Shipyard was among the actives, the shares rising 70 cents to SDollars 13.70 and the warrants 80 cents to SDollars 8.05. TAIWAN saw a strong technical rebound after recent losses: the weighted index closed up 146.15 at 4,356.10, a week's advance of 1.3 per cent. Turnover was TDollars 27.3bn, up from TDollars 17.9bn. The financial sector led the advance, gaining some 6 per cent, with the important banks and Cathay Life rising by their daily limits. AUSTRALIA remained firm as the price of gold continued to rise. The All Ordinaries index ended up 11.3 at 1,760.4 and up 3.8 per cent on the week. The gold index put on 80.1 or 4.2 per cent to 1,998.9, its highest since July 22 1988, with Placer Pacific up 17 cents to ADollars 3.34 and Poseidon Gold gaining 32 cents to ADollars 3.42. HONG KONG, however, lost some momentum as confirmation of the reopening of airport talks between China and Britain and the likely renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation status by the US triggered profit-taking. The Hang Seng index shed 49.33 to 7,397.91, a gain of 3.2 per cent on the week. Property groups were affected, with Cheung Kong and Sun Hung Kai Properties falling 50 cents each to HKDollars 28 and HKDollars 39.50 respectively. NEW ZEALAND closed at another record high although turnover dropped to NZDollars 27m from Thursday's NZDollars 33m. The NZSE-40 index rose 7.72 to 1,650.16, up 2 per cent on the week. Brokers said that the rally had been driven by Fletcher Challenge, up 3 cents at NZDollars 2.77. MANILA fell sharply as many foreign investors took profits. The composite index shed 11.58 to 1,597.45 but remained 1.6 per cent ahead on the week. Turnover was 382m pesos. BOMBAY fell for the fifth consecutive session, the BSE index closing down 50.38 at 2,165.58.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Antich: "Duran Lleida Asserts That CiU Is </F> Tired of Receiving `Bad Checks'"]    [Text] Barcelona -- "Convergence and Union [CiU] is rather  tired of paying cash down and receiving (from the government)  bad drafts or checks. This is finished. Governability yes, but  not at any price." With this emphatic remark, Democratic Union  Steering Committee Chairman Josep Antoni Duran Lleida yesterday  explained to several thousand of his party's supporters filling  the Blaugrana Palace in Barcelona the Catalan nationalists'  concern at the scant response, in his opinion, to the Catalan  nationalists' autonomy demands.    The Catalan Christian Democrats yesterday tightened the  screws on the Socialist government and placed autonomy matters  to the fore in their demands for the next few months. Before an  audience that during the two-day ninth UDC [Democratic Union of  Catalonia] festival has helped make it clear that the veteran  party is also a broadly based party -- over 14,000 people at a  meal at the Barcelona Soccer Club premises yesterday, and tens  of thousands during Saturday's [28 May] and Sunday's events --  Duran Lleida asserted that the CiU coalition will have to have  more than one quid pro quo before continuing to support the PSOE  [Spanish Socialist Workers Party].  <H5>  Discomfort </H5>   "First deeds (namely, transfers of powers), then the  confidence that they must earn day by day," he stated  graphically. "Nobody can criticize us for demanding what, as  Catalan nationalists, we are entitled to demand from the  national viewpoint," he added.    The same idea was driven home by Jordi Pujol from Amposta in  Tarragona. The Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government]  president, who was speaking for the first time in the European  election campaign, pointed out that improving autonomy is not a  secondary matter for the nationalists "but a priority, and  Catalonia is entitled to achieve it."    But Duran Lleida did not content himself with airing what,  in  his opinion, are breaches of promises by the government. He  also spoke of the discomfort that he has often felt when they  have had to give the PSOE their support in votes in parliament.    "I also feel uncomfortable supporting the Socialist  government -- the whole Union leadership feels uncomfortable --  but life is full of discomforts, and the important thing is that  there is a government that is carrying out an economic policy  and an autonomy policy," the Union top leader stated.    The Christian Democratic politician asserted that the  nationalists would have given People's Party Chairman Jose Maria  Aznar the same support that they have given Felipe Gonzalez, if  the results of the 6 June general election had enabled him to  govern. He harshly criticized the conservatives' and United  Left's conduct as opposition parties, of whom he said that "they  are interested not in Spain but in destroying the PSOE  government and attaining power by whatever means." He  criticized the People's Party for its policy on Catalonia,  called them destabilizers, and accused them of "jeopardizing  coexistence in Catalonia" by their attacks on the linguistic  normalization policy.    However, he called on those present to distrust the  "prudent"  line practiced by the PSOE when referring to Catalonia, and  asserted that it is simply electoral strategy. "In the case of  the PSOE and the People's Party, it is all the same; when the  PSOE did not need us, Alfonso Guerra also came to Barcelona and  said things against Catalonia similar to those the People's  Party is saying today," he asserted.</p>

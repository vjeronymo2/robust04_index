			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 20 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Japanese  investors must speed up the process of transferring technology  or face the risk of losing their market share in Malaysia,  Minister of Science, Technology and Environment, Law Hieng Ding,  said Monday.    He said that if they did not transfer the technology, they  would lose their market niche to European countries and the  United States, not only in Malaysia but in the region too.    The Japanese, however, now realise the negative consequences  of not transferring technology and are moving fast towards this  goal, he told reporters after launching the Finger-Lock System  of Polytron Resources Sdn Bhd [Private Limited] here.    The security system uses finger print instead of a key or a  card to gain access into a building or home.    Law said the rapid development in the Asia-Pacific would  entail Japan to change its policy in respect of technology  transfer.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Brittan seeks bigger world trade accord - Tokyo deal on tariff cuts just 'down payment' THE four-way tariff-cutting deal struck at the Tokyo summit last week was merely a 'down payment' on a much larger prospective trade liberalisation accord, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said yesterday. Sir Leon, in Geneva to brief trading partners on the outcome of the summit, told a news conference the European Community and the other Quad countries - the US, Japan and Canada - were prepared to go further if other nations in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks responded with new market access concessions of their own. 'We have more to offer if others have more to offer,' he said, singling out as EC targets bigger cuts in US textiles tariffs and better access to financial services markets in east Asian economies. The agreement by the Quad countries to eliminate tariffs in eight sectors, cut other duties by up to 50 per cent and push for liberalisation of financial and other services markets will form the basis for intensive bilateral and multilateral negotiations on market-opening measures between Uruguay Round participants over the next three to four weeks. These talks will be launched formally tomorrow morning when the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee, chaired by Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, meets to agree a work programme to conclude the 116-nation talks by December 15. Negotiations will restart in Geneva in September on the remaining outstanding issues in the round. These include disagreements over anti-dumping and subsidies rules, dispute settlement and the creation of a Multilateral Trade Organisation. Sir Leon said yesterday the draft rules package should be subject to limited changes only, and reaffirmed EC backing for an MTO which would curb use of unilateral trade measures to solve disputes. Yesterday evening, Sir Leon was due to host a dinner for members of Eurofer, the European steelmakers' association, and his fellow commissioners, Mr Karel Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann. EC officials said the object was an 'exchange of views' on the planned restructuring of the European steel industry, competition from eastern European steel producers, and the stalemate in negotiations on a Multilateral Steel Agreement. Nancy Dunne in Washington adds: Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said yesterday he would meet Mr Sutherland in Washington next Monday as part of the drive to 'multilaterise' the tariff cut deals reached by the industrialised countries in Tokyo. Last week's agreement had created an atmosphere of confidence among the negotiators of leading industrialised countries, he said, but there would still be tough negotiations ahead. There are agreements in 18 products areas and these 'may or may not change' depending on the offers of the other Gatt members. For example, the US may not be willing to cut its textile tariffs further than agreed. Not only has it moved back from a proposal for 50 per cent cuts on all tariffs above 15 per cent, but it also is insisting on taking 10 years for the tariff cuts, rather than the earlier proposal for six years. US movement on both textile tariffs and quotas will depend on the willingness of the large developing countries to open their markets to US textiles. Meanwhile, the US and Japan have cleared the way for intensive Gatt negotiations by agreeing to delay negotiations on bilateral trade pacts for at least six months. Under their new trade 'framework' they are to negotiate market access arrangements on government procurement, the insurance market, automotive industries and other high priority sectors, by the time the heads of government first meet in 1994 or within the next six months.</p>

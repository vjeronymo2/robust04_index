			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LINK BETWEEN TANKER SPILL, TAR DOUBTED  </P> <P> The Coast Guard said Thursday that thousands of bad-smelling tar balls that  washed up along the beach at Camp Pendleton and Oceanside probably didn't come  from the Feb. 7 oil tanker spill off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The oily globs were discovered earlier this week, and new deposits were found  Thursday in La Jolla and on Coronado's Silver Strand, according to Lt. Pat  Keane of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in San Diego.  </P> <P> Although samples haven't been tested yet, Keane said the dark, hard substance  found along beaches in San Diego County is different from the tan material that  washed ashore in Orange County when 394,000 gallons of oil spilled from the  American Trader.  </P> <P> Keane doubted that the tar in San Diego County came from the tanker accident.  "It's unlikely -- not impossible -- it came from the spill. It doesn't appear  to be the same type of product," he said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, lifeguards noticed tar along 3 miles of Oceanside beach, and  smaller deposits of tar were scattered on sections of Camp Pendleton's 17-mile  beach.  </P> <P> By Thursday, no more tar had arrived at the Marine Corps base, said Staff Sgt.  John Midgette. It was the same in Oceanside, where city spokesman Larry Bauman  said crews were operating two cleanup machines to collect the tar.  </P> <P> "We've had episodes of tar before, but never of this magnitude," Bauman said.  "Even though it's not a disaster, it was still considerably heavier than  anybody here remembers."  </P> <P> There have been no reports anywhere of injury to wildlife, and Bauman said, "We  do not consider it a health hazard."  </P> <P> Thursday's sightings of beach tar, according to Keane, included one chunk at  the beach near Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla and "little bits  here and there" on the Silver Strand in Coronado.  </P></p>

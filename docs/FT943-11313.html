			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Worthless certificates I own 200 shares in Norton Group plc, which crashed last year with debts of Pounds 7.5m. I understand that a Canadian entrepreneur has bought the old Shenstone factory at a knock-down price. Is my share certificate worth anything or should I frame it? Your share certificate is almost certainly worthless. Unless it is particularly artistic, framing would merely be throwing good money after bad. (Murray Johnstone). I hold shares in Ferranti which are obviously a total write-off. As I am unable to dispose of these shares in the market: 1. By what procedure am I able to realise the losses for CGT purposes? 2. Could this be done on the last day of the present tax year to maximise indexation benefit? To qualify for maximum indexation and to minimise the risk of forfeiting all indexation (by failing to get the claim into the inspector's hands by the end of the tax year), you should, on Saturday, April 1 1995, write to your tax office along the following lines: 'In accordance with section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, I claim that the value of my holding of (state number) shares in Ferranti International plc has become negligible, namely . . . , and that I should therefore be treated as if I had sold that holding for that sum today, April 1 1995, and had immediately reacquired it for that same sum, in circumstances falling outside section 105(1) of the Act.' If by chance you reach the Pounds 10,000 limit for indexation losses (between November 30 1993 and April 5 1995, inclusive) as a result of actual disposals etc, then the timing of your negligible-value claim will not matter. Some years ago I bought some shares in a company called Equity &amp; General which went bankrupt and I have found out that the Inland Revenue declared shares in this company to be of negligible value from 14 September 1990. I have not previously entered the loss on my tax returns but now need to do so. How do I do this? I would like to use part of the loss in the tax year 92/93 and part in the tax year 93/94. Is this possible and to what date should I index the loss in each case. The revised version of extrastatutory concession D28 (which permits retrospective negligible-value claims) was published at the end of May. It is too long to quote, so you should ask your tax office for a copy; if you have any difficulty, write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Office, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB. The new version of concession D28 appears to have been written in a hurry so we shall not be surprised if you find it difficult to understand. Please come back to us after reading it, with the full background facts, figures and dates (including a note of what elections you have made - rebasing, pooling etc.). Without precise data, we cannot say whether it is possible for you to make a negligible-value claim for only part of the shareholding: there is no universal answer, but the most common one is NO. If the company no longer exists (if it has been struck off, for example), you will automatically be deemed to have disposed of your shareholding on the day on which it ceased to exist, by virtue of section 24(1) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

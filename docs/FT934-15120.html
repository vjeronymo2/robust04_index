			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Poor prices hit Alcan Aluminium POOR ingot and fabricated product prices, worsened by the European and Japanese recessions, outweighed Alcan Aluminium's cost-cutting efforts in the third quarter. The company reported a loss of USDollars 13m, or 8 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 12m, or 7 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of Dollars 1.82bn, against Dollars 1.97bn. For the first nine months, Alcan's loss was Dollars 68m, or 37 cents a share, against Dollars 56m, or 31 cents, on revenues of Dollars 5.45bn, against Dollars 5.8bn. LME spot prices for ingot have languished below the equivalent of 50 cents a pound for many weeks, partly because of reports of increasing exports by smelters in the former Soviet Union. Alcan's ingot shipments in the third quarter were 225,000 tonnes against 213,000 tonnes a year earlier, and of fabricated products 393,000 tonnes against 349,000 tonnes. The trend was similar in the nine months, although average price realisations were lower. The company did not make any forecast for the final quarter but said no early upturn in prices was expected.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Efforts to hire more ethnic minority professors by the San Diego Community  College District have gained the district a special award from the statewide  community college Board of Governors.  </P> <P> The "Outstanding Achievement Award" results from 30 of 63 new faculty for  1989-90 school year being from under-represented minorities.  </P> <P> District Chancellor J. William Wenrich made it his goal to fill half of the  vacant faculty positions with ethnic minorities.  </P> <P> In comments to the Times last summer, Wenrich said his commitment "is to ensure  that the staff more closely reflects the student population and the community  served."  </P> <P> Among other actions, the district sent recruitment teams across the nation,  advertised widely in national publications and trade journals, set up a  toll-free number for potential applications, and encouraged its own faculty to  make recommendations and talk to colleagues at other institutions.  </P> <P> The district also established an internship under which promising applicants  without sufficient teaching experience can work alongside full-time faculty.  </P> <P> Wenrich said his 50% goal remains during the recruiting drive to fill 80  positions for the 1990-91 academic year.  </P></p>

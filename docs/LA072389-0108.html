			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR'S ARREST  </P> <P> The citizens of Fountain Valley should not be represented by an elected  official who willfully and knowingly violates the law while holding public  office.  </P> <P> The arrest and conviction of Mayor Fred Voss has cast a shadow on the entire  community. If we allow this issue to be glossed over, it raises the very  serious question of potential problems that may arise in the future. What  eventually becomes an acceptable standard of conduct?  </P> <P> In 1969, the Fountain Valley City Council adopted Resolution No. 5081, which  reads in part: "Public officials and employees are bound to observe in their  official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the  duties of their offices regardless of personal consideration, recognizing that  the public interests must be their primary concern, that conduct in both their  official and private affairs should be above reproach."  </P> <P> At the present time, we seem to have a "code of silence" prevailing in our City  Council chambers rather than an observation or acknowledgement of a code of  ethics.  </P> <P> If, in fact, our elected officials have the power to make all of the decisions  affecting what does or does not occur or become law in our city, why are they  powerless (silent) on this issue?  </P> <P> BEVERLY BURNETT  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Growth in sales slows at Wellcome Shares in Wellcome tumbled 8 per cent yesterday after the drug company reported slower than expected first-half sales growth and revealed that it was dropping the development of a new anti-herpes compound. The company also plans to cut its UK staff of 5,400 by around 350 over the next 12 months. Similar cuts in the US workforce of 4,000 are thought likely. Interim pre-tax profits, which rose 10 per cent to Pounds 358.1m, were above market expectations, but the shares fell 52p to a three-year low of 549p. Sales rose 5 per cent to Pounds 1.08bn, against analysts' forecasts of around 8 per cent, with volume growth of only 3.5 per cent. Operating margins rose from 30.5 per cent to 32.9 per cent. Mr John Robb, chairman and chief executive, admitted that the dropping of the new herpes drug, netivudine, was a disappointment but expressed surprise at the market's reaction to the sales figures. 'Given the three factors which depressed our sales, two of which will be non-recurring, the growth was respectable.' The biggest impact on sales was caused by preliminary conclusions of a study which cast doubt on the efficacy of Wellcome's Aids drug Retrovir. Retrovir sales fell 16 per cent to Pounds 110m in the six months to February. Group sales were also squeezed by pricing pressure in Europe and by the introduction in Japan of a rival to Wellcome's herpes treatment Zovirax. This was subsequently withdrawn after 15 patients died. However, sales of Zovirax rose from Pounds 369m to Pounds 418m, with underlying growth recovering to 10 per cent. After 15 years, Zovirax now faces competition from SmithKline's Famvir, recently introduced into the UK. Famvir has some advantages over Zovirax and Wellcome's own successor, Valtrex, is a year behind. Earnings per share excluding exceptional items rose 11 per cent to 25.7p but the interim dividend jumped from 4.8p to 8.6p. Mr Robb said this stemmed partly from a decision to reduce dividend cover, and to compensate shareholders for the plan to change its financial year-end to December. A second interim dividend of 5.8p will be paid in October and a final in May-June 1995. Lex, Page 20</p>

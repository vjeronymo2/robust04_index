			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 2 June TASS -- A Ukrainian parliamentary  delegation left today for the Crimea in a bid to settle the  dispute with this semi-autonomous republic over its latest  decrees, which are regarded by Kiev as the first step towards  secession.    "In any case, our delegation must spare no efforts in order  to put an end to all the current negative processes in the  Crimea. We will do our best to settle all the problems in a  civilized manner," delegation head Vladimir Butkevich told TASS  before departure.    According to the lawmaker, the delegation has received  "broad  powers to conduct negotiations on the whole range of disputed  problems, including economic and juridical ones, as well as  problems of security."    Butkevich stressed that the delegation will act in  compliance  with a parliamentary resolution stipulating that the Crimea's  decision to reinstate the 1992 constitution was illegal and  contradicted the laws of Ukraine.    The parliament asked President Kravchuk to draw up before 6  June a list of measures which state power bodies could use  against the Crimea in case the republic violate's the country's  Constitution.</p>

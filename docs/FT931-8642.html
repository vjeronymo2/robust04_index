			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: Road tolls - financial penalty and social costs understated (1) Sir, Richard Tomkins makes an excellent try at balancing the pros and cons of motorway tolls, ('For whom the road tolls', February 13). However, suggesting that motorists might be paying Pounds 3.9bn less than motoring's true price, thanks to the 'cost of capital' element of Pounds 7.2bn, ignores the financial penalty that we would face if no motorway network had been built. The Confederation of British Industry puts the cost of congestion at Pounds 15bn (at 1988 prices). Without motorways, delays would be taking an economically crippling toll. Therefore the capital element has no legitimate place in the balance sheet, leaving UK motorists more than Pounds 3bn in credit. The key question is, will the Treasury allow us to have a motorway network to meet our economic and social needs? The answer is that it will not, and direct charging for the use of motorways appears likely. The AA opposes motorway charging unless (a) all income raised from motorway charging is used for improvement, maintenance and management of the motorway network; and (b) motorway charges must be matched by a corresponding reduction in motoring taxation. For Britain's road-based economy the government's total spend on roads is Pounds 5.5bn against a tax take from motorists of Pounds 14.7bn (excluding VAT). British motorists won't give the government a blank cheque, but they will demand that their money is used to provide a quality road system.

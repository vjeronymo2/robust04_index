			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Kohl warns of firmer line on EU budget funding Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday warned that Germany had reached the limit of its financial contributions to the European Union, and called for budget payments to be linked more closely to per-capita incomes. In the stormiest debate so far in Germany's European election campaign, Mr Kohl sought to counter a rising tide of criticism of the country's contributions to the EU budget. He was facing an accusation from Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), that the government was guilty of 'gross negligence' in fixing its budget contributions without proper regard for the soaring costs of German unification. In a formal government declaration on European policy, Mr Kohl told the German parliament that those member states with income levels comparable to Germany's should assume greater financial responsibility. At the same time Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said the government would refuse to approve any new EU programme which was financed according to the 'old key'. Finance Ministry officials were unable to clarify his statement last night, but it suggests that he will be seeking an adjustment of Germany's budget contributions before approving any new spending areas beyond those already included in EU budget headings. Mr Waigel pointed out that Germany had sunk from second to sixth place in the prosperity ranking for EU member states, although it remained by far the largest net contributor to the Brussels budget. He added that Bonn would reject any attempt to finance the budget with greater use of borrowing. The harsh line on EU financing from Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel comes in response to a wave of criticism in Germany over the country's net contributions to the EU budget, which reached Ecu9bn (Pounds 6.9bn) in 1992. The question has become a big issue in the current European election campaign. Mr Scharping accused the government of agreeing to a German budget contribution fixed up to 1999, without taking any account of the loss of German per-capita income since unification.</p>

The delegation from  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  continues to be absent. Our correspondent Joao Ligio reports.    The government and UNITA have not yet resumed discussions on  national reconciliation. To overcome the obstacle which is  preventing its resumption, the mediator, Alioune Blondin Beye,  set a meeting for this afternoon, but UNITA did not appear. The  Black Cockerel's men said they cannot do anything without the  remaining part of the delegation, which according to reports,  will only return to Lusaka on 15 February. In the face of this  obstinacy, Chief Beye had no alternative but to wait.    Meanwhile, work is progressing rapidly on the government  side. The government delegation has already expressed its stand  on the general principles for national reconciliation and today  went to Mulungushi Center to present its reaction to the UN  proposal on the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission --  the UN role in controlling and monitoring approved principles on  the cease-fire, the conclusion of the army, and the national  army.    Also present in Lusaka are the presidents of three national  political parties -- namely, the (?Liberal Democratic Party),  [name indistinct], and the Angolan Democratic Party. The three  went to the Mulungushi Conference Center without warning and  wanted to have access to the documents being studied but had the  same fortune as journalists -- they left the center without  gaining extra knowledge.</p>

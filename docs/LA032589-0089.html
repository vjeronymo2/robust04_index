			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER SLAIN IN AMBUSH AT HOME;  </P> <P> FORMER STUDENT QUESTIONED, RELEASED; NOT A SUSPECT, POLICE SAY  </P> <P> A well-liked veteran teacher at Grant High School in Van Nuys was ambushed and  shot to death as he left his Sherman Oaks home for school early Friday, Los  Angeles police said.  </P> <P> A former student at the school was questioned about the attack for about six  hours Friday but police released him and said they had no suspects in the case.  </P> <P> Hal Arthur, 60, who was senior class adviser and had taught government and  history classes at the school since 1962, was hit in the back with at least  three bullets moments after he opened the door of his car parked in front of  his home in the 13900 block of Milbank Street, police said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attacks on Teachers  </P> <P> The shooting was the latest in a wave of recent attacks on teachers, who have  been increasingly concerned about their safety and school violence.  </P> <P> Arthur was following his daily practice of leaving for the nearby school at 6  a.m., police said. He had placed a bag containing school books and homework he  had graded the night before in the car and was about to step into it when an  assailant with a .22-caliber semi-automatic weapon fired on him from across the  street and behind.  </P> <P> "It certainly does not appear to be a random shooting," said Lt. Warren  Knowles, commander of the Van Nuys Division detective bureau. "Someone was more  than likely waiting."  </P> <P> At least six shots were fired before the gunman sped away in a dark-colored  sedan, police said. Arthur's wife, Virginia, and son, Jason, a senior at Grant  High, ran from the house to where the victim was laying in the street. Several  neighbors, who also heard the shots, ran to the scene.  </P> <P> Arthur was taken by paramedics to nearby Sherman Oaks Community Hospital where  he was pronounced dead.  </P> <P> Police said there was no evidence indicating a motive or suspect in the  killing. Robbery was ruled out because the gunman did not approach the victim,  police said.  </P> <P> At first, the investigation focused on a 16-year-old Van Nuys boy who had  attended Grant High until February when he was transferred to North Hollywood  High School because of disciplinary problems stemming from a campus fight.  </P> <P> Knowles said investigators decided to question the boy because 10 to 12 Grant  students had given his name and said they believed he had access to guns and  may have held a grudge against Arthur.  </P> <P> The boy, who had not attended school at North Hollywood High since Tuesday, was  taken into custody at his home about 2:30 p.m. and taken to the police station  for questioning. He was released about 9 p.m.  </P> <P> "There is no evidence to connect the kid to this case," said Detective Mel  Arnold. "We are looking elsewhere. We are looking at all avenues. We need  people who may have information to come forward.  </P> <P> " We have found no reason why anybody would have a grudge against this guy,"  said Arnold. Arthur was described by his fellow teachers, former and current  students, and neighbors as a well-liked and respected teacher who had a good  sense of humor, was outgoing and helped plan the senior prom each year. As a  sidelight, Arthur organized Hal Arthur Tours for the last six years, taking  students from all over the Valley on a 36-day trip to Europe.  </P> <P> Grant Principal Bob Collins called Arthur the "pied piper" of the senior class.  </P> <P> </P> <P> He 'Was an Institution'  </P> <P> "Hal was an institution," Collins said. "He was the type of individual who  really gained the confidence and enthusiasm of the senior class."  </P> <P> Dan Gruenberg, dean of students at Grant High, who knew Arthur for 25 years,  said his longtime friend was a gourmet and a lover of traveling, books and  classical music.  </P> <P> He said Arthur was easy-going and rarely sent students to him because of  disciplinary problems. But Arthur could be tough, too, said Gruenberg,  explaining how the two first met when Gruenberg was trying to stop a student  from scaling a fence. The student punched Gruenberg in the face and broke his  nose, "but Hal grabbed him and tackled him . . . he always backed his friends."  </P> <P> Students described Arthur as a friend and confidant. He secretly helped those  who couldn't afford to go to proms or rent coats and ties for graduation -- he  even helped wallflowers find dates for a prom.  </P> <P> Students at the school were shocked and many cried when Arthur's death was  announced over the public address system during first period.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seniors to Honor Him  </P> <P> Seniors said they plan to dedicate their graduation and their yearbook to  Arthur.  </P> <P> "He was a special man," said senior Alon Elbaz-Deckel, student body historian  who planned to go with Arthur to Europe this summer. "Always doing something  for somebody else. . . . The students always came first."  </P> <P> Barbara Halpern, who was a student of Arthur's before graduating from Grant in  1966 and is now a teacher at the school, said that two years ago when Arthur  heard that one of her students couldn't afford to go to the prom, he arranged a  free prom ticket and a gown from a local dress shop. He also "got boys jackets  and ties for graduation if they could not afford them," she said. But Halpern  said Arthur also was humble about such acts and "no one ever knew."  </P> <P> On Friday flags were at half-staff at the school where 3,100 students attend.  </P> <P> The walls of Arthur's room, Bungalow 18, were papered with clippings about  Grant sports, jazz music and food reviews and postcards from around the world.  In one corner was a poster with a caricature of his face and signed by the  Class of '88.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Psychologists Offer Aid  </P> <P> A group of 12 school district psychologists came to the school Friday and  planned to return Monday to speak with students and faculty. On Friday they  talked to about 20 students, district officials said.  </P> <P> Arthur's death follows other incidents of violence against Los Angeles-area  teachers. On March 6, a 15-year-old boy at Olive Vista Junior High School in  Sylmar stabbed his teacher in the back while she was writing him up for  misbehavior. In February, a teacher at Rosemont Junior High School in La  Crescenta disarmed a 13-year-old boy who brandished a loaded .357 magnum in a  classroom.  </P> <P> The attacks have heightened concerns generally about school violence. According  to United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson, assaults on teachers  that require medical treatment average one a day in the district. Statistics  provided by the Los Angeles Unified School District show that while campus  assaults overall have not risen, reports of incidents involving firearms have  tripled and the number involving knives has doubled over the last three years.  </P> <P> Although no student is considered a suspect, Arthur's death has raised concerns  about teacher safety, Halpern said.  </P> <P> "What do you do?" she said. "You never fail a kid? Never discipline them?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Memorial Services Set  </P> <P> Memorial services for Arthur will be held early next week at Grant High, said  Rabbi Jim Kaufman, of Temple Beth Hillel in North Hollywood where Arthur and  his family were active members.  </P> <P> "I've known him since he was 12 years old -- he was a superb human being,"  Kaufman said of Arthur. "It was a real tragedy."  </P> <P> Throughout the day Friday several students from Grant High drove slowly by  Arthur's home or stopped nearby. Neighbors also stood by until long after the  police had left the scene.  </P> <P> Arthur lived next door to a woman who was his student at Grant in the late '60s  and whose daughter was currently in his government class. She asked that their  names not be published.  </P> <P> "I knew him as a teacher and a neighbor," the mother said at her home Friday.  "He was a perfect neighbor and a well-liked teacher. This is so hard to  believe. Why him? Of course, why would anyone do this to anybody? But I can't  believe someone would want to harm him."  </P> <P> The daughter said that one of Arthur's last assignments to his students in the  senior government class was an essay on gun control which followed class  discussions about drive-by shootings, gang violence and other recent crimes  involving guns.  </P> <P> The daughter brought her essay home Thursday. On it, Arthur had written, "Very  Good" and drawn a happy face.  </P> <P> Staff writers Tracey Kaplan, Elaine Woo and Amy Pyle contributed to this story.  </P></p>

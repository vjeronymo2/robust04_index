			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Jobless numbers up fastest in south-east UNEMPLOYMENT increased in all parts of the UK in May but rose fastest in London and the south-east. Since May last year, the number of unemployed people in that region has risen by 2.4 per cent, with one in 10 now out of work. According to the Unemployment Unit, the research group, the number of jobless in the region is the highest since the Second World War. Other regions where un-employment rose faster than average included the east Midlands, the west Midlands and the south-west. The lowest rate of increase was in Scotland, where unemployment was only 0.6 per cent higher than a year ago. The unemployment rate for men was 12.9 per cent, significantly higher than the rate for women, which was 5.2 per cent in May. The stock of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres fell by 5,000 last month. That puts the average decrease in vacancies over the three months to May at 3,200. The Department of Employment believes that with last month's increase of 21,300 in the total numbers of jobless, the monthly trend is now running between 25,000 and 30,000 with no sign of any let-up over the next few months. According to measures used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the UK unemployment rate is 10.4 per cent, above both the OECD average of 7.2 per cent and the EC average of 9.4 per cent. In the EC, only Ireland and Spain have higher unemployment rates than the UK, according to the OECD standardised rates.</p>

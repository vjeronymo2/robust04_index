The source suggested that it was most likely that the trial  of the Poles, which begins next Monday [31 January] in the  Ukrainian capital Kiev, is intended to act as a counter to the  trial in Warsaw on spying charges of Ukrainian security service  officer Anatoliy Lysenko, which started in Warsaw on January 19.    Neither the Polish Foreign Ministry, nor the State  Protection  Office (UOP), was prepared to confirm a statement on Tuesday [25  January] from the press bureau of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry  that Polish-Ukrainian discussions on the Lysenko affair were  held on January 24.</p>

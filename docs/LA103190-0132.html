			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER CHARGE FILED IN NURSE'S STABBING  DEATH  </P> <P> A murder charge that carries a possible death sentence was filed Tuesday  against a construction worker accused of fatally stabbing an emergency-room  nurse in her Beverlywood home.  </P> <P> Jose Francisco Guerra, 31, was awaiting arraignment in West Los Angeles  Municipal Court. The district attorney's office charged him with a single  murder count plus a special-circumstance allegation -- lying in wait -- that  would qualify him for a possible death sentence if convicted.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Guerra fatally stabbed Kathleen Powell, a nurse at the Beverly  Hills Medical Center, in her house last Thursday. Guerra, who was doing  renovation work on the house next to Powell's, was arrested Friday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By a special correspondent in Shijiazhuang: "Accompanied </F> by Public Security Personnel, Chen Ziming Is Recuperating in  Shijiazhuang"]    [Text] Mainland dissident Chen Ziming, who was "granted  parole for medical treatment" by Beijing authorities, is now  "resting" and taking necessary treatment in Hebei's  Shijiazhuang. However, all Chen's moves are carried out in the  presence of public security personnel.    "Escorted" by the relevant departments, a source here said,  Chen Ziming and his wife arrived in Shijiazhuang last week for a  "short recuperation." Chen Ziming and his wife have stayed in  an ordinary guest house over the past few days. He was told  that after a period of recuperation here, he can return to  Beijing in early June.    As everyone knows, the source said that Chen Ziming has been  sent to another locality to recuperate because of the upcoming  fifth anniversary of the "4 June incident." Many foreign  reporters are now in Beijing awaiting an opportunity to  interview the pro-democracy figures of 1989. The authorities do  not want Chen Ziming to be interviewed by foreign reporters at  this time. The departments concerned do not know what Chen  would say and what viewpoints he would express in interviews and  they are worried that the results would be disadvantageous to  China's bid for the most favored nation trading status.    Before his release, it is said that Chen promised the  authorities that he would be away from Beijing for a period of  time after he is granted "parole for medical treatment."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Editorial: "We Welcome the Russian </F> Initiative"]    [Text] We greatly welcome the visit by Russian President  Yeltsin's envoy and any step or initiative designed to enhance  bilateral relations and activate the peace process, especially  since Russia, along with the United States, is cosponsoring the  peace process on all tracks.    Now that friendly Russia, which is a permanent member of the  UN Security Council, is eager to activate the peace process, we  hope it will take into account Jordan's bitter suffering as a  result of the U.S. siege imposed on al-'Aqabah. This siege has  inflicted grave losses on the Jordanian economy and trade.    Friendly Russia knows better than others the extent of  Jordan's eagerness to achieve peace, security, and stability in  this vital region of the world. At the same time, Russia knows  that Jordan has recently linked the resumption of its role in  the peace process to addressing this unfair siege.    We thus hope that this friendly big power will give serious  attention to this siege of the port of al-'Aqabah and work to  lift it. What draws attention is that while President Yeltsin's  envoy was visiting Jordan, the U.S. forces twice searched a ship  carrying Jordan-bound merchandise and turned it back to Suez.  Such a position does not serve the peace process in any way  whatsoever.    Jordan experienced much suffering and many economic and  trade  difficulties during the Gulf crisis and the second Gulf war. It  is still suffering as a result of this siege which is imposed  unfairly and without any convincing justification. Jordan  complied with the Security Council resolutions, and the U.S.  Administration itself acknowledged this compliance. This  administration, however, insists on harming our national economy.    It is known that Jordan is not the only neighbor of Iraq.  Washington, however, did not impose a similar blockade on Turkey  and Iran, which are also neighbors of Iraq. At any rate, we  hope that the guest Russian envoy will brief President Yeltsin  on Jordan's suffering as a result of the unfair siege in order  to address this issue.    It is inconceivable to activate the peace process in order  to  achieve peace, security, and stability in a region where some  countries are suffering from an unfair siege at the hands of  peace advocates.</p>

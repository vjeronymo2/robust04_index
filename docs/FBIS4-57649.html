			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the latest poll done by the Imasen  company, President Alberto Fujimori might be reelected because  he can defeat his closest contender, Javier Perez de Cuellar, in  the first and second electoral rounds.    According to Imasen, Fujimori could win the first round with  39 percent of the votes, followed by Perez de Cuellar with 31.3  percent, Ricardo Belmont with 12.5 percent, Fernando Belaunde  with 1.8 percent, and Alfonso Barrantes with 1.6 percent.    Compared with the previous Imasen poll on the first round,  Fujimori's percentage rose 3 points, while Perez de Cuellar's  dropped 1.5 points and Belmont's rose 1.4 points.    The following question was posed to the people who were  polled: "If the presidential elections were held tomorrow, and  if Alberto Fujimori and Javier Perez de Cuellar were the only  contenders, for whom would you vote?" This situation would be  similar to a second electoral round. The voters' answer favored  Alberto Fujimori by 46.6 percent, while 43.6 percent supported  Perez de Cuellar. Imasen said "support for the ex-United  Nations secretary general has dropped since our last poll (last  month), when he obtained 45.7 percent and Fujimori 44.1 percent."    If second round contenders were Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont  and the current president, the margin in favor of Fujimori would  be larger, as he would obtain 54.1 percent while Belmont  obtained 28.6 percent. According to Imasen, compared with the  last poll the president improved his position from 51.6 to 54.1  percent, while Belmont rose from 26.1 to 28.6 percent.    A hypothetical runoff between architect Fernando Belaunde  and  Fujimori showed a big difference: The former president obtained  13.4 percent of the votes, while Fujimori obtained 63.8 percent.</p>

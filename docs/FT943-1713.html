			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Exit polls indicate greatest gains for Danish Liberals Liberal party leader Uffe Elleman-Jensen jokes with an election official before casting his vote yesterday in the Danish general election. Exit polls on Danish television indicated his party would achieve the greatest gains, taking its representation up from 29 seats to about 40, to become the second biggest party after the Social Democrats. Despite the strong performance by the rightwing Liberals the Social Democratic-led government of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was set to remain in office even though it looked likely from the exit polls it would need the backing of the leftwing Socialist People's party to remain in power.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bridgetown, 6 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel  Castro and Barbadian Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford agreed  today to express their mutual desire for integrtation in the  Caribbean as a requirement for the development of small islands.    During a private bilateral talk, Sandiford told Castro  Barbados is willing to work hard inside and outside the  Anglo-American community to guarantee Cuba's full integration  into the inter-American system.    Sandiford and Castro met briefly during a recess of the  final  sessions of the first World Conference on the Sustainable  Development of Small Island States. The Cuban and Barbadian  foreign ministers also attended this meeting.    Sandiford said Cuba has a pivotal role to play in developing  the Antillean region and the hemisphere. He added Barbados  would help facilitate Cuba's full integration into the community.    Castro replied the independent position Barbados has  historically assumed regarding the Cuban cause impressed him  very much. Castro also expressed his confidence bilateral  relations will become closer, particularly in the context of the  future Association of Caribbean States, which will be  established in Bridgetown next July.    Sandiford thanked Castro for the Cuban delegation's  participation in the conference. The conference concludes today  in Barbados.    Cuba attended the high-level conference with the largest  delegation among members of the Alliance of Small Insular  States. Members of the Cuban delegation included Fidel Castro,  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, National Assembly President  Ricardo Alarcon, and Environment, Science and Technology  Minister Rosa Elena Simeon, among others.</p>

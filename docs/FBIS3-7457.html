Their hearts are filled with the death-defying resolution to  dedicate their lives without hesitation to the party and the  leader, the motherland and the people. A graphic example of  this is the iron will and faith of the young people who rose up  like a mountain last year to defend the nation's sovereignty and  the country's supreme interest.    In March last year when a touch-and-go crisis in which a war  might break out any moment was created due to the anti-DPRK  campaign of the enemy, the world watched the Korean peninsula.    A semi-war state was declared to the whole nation, entire  people and the whole army and a statement of the DPRK Government  on the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)  was published.    The young men and women who always accept the determination  of the Workers' Party of Korea as their will turned out as one  man to defend the motherland, the place for their living.    Young people numbering 1,500,000 volunteered to the Korean  People's Army in a few days.    We do not want war but not beg for peace. [sentence as  received] If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets  light the fuse of a new war indiscreetly, the five million young  men and women will become rifles and bombs and strike an  annihilating blow at the enemy. This was the determination of  the Korean young people and it remains unchanged. The people  are convinced of all victories, looking at their features.    In the proud chronicle of the Korean revolution that has  advanced towards victory through a bloody road there are many  known and unknown young heroes who devoted their lives for the  party and the leader, the motherland and the people.    Kim Hyok who composed and disseminated the first  revolutionary song of praise "Star of Korea", Kim Chin, the  first one in the world who silenced the enemy's pillbox with his  body in the 1930s, and Yi Su-pok, Kang Ho-yong, An Yong-ae and  Cho Sun-ok who laid down their lives in defending the soil of  the fatherland in the grim fatherland liberation war were all  youths in their teens and twenties.    The socialist cause of Korea which was pioneered and  faithfully inherited by the first and second generations of the  revolution is now being unswervingly carried forward today by  the young men and women of the third and fourth generations.    The young people deeply conscious of their duty for the  times  are registering remarkable achievements in the construction of a  socialist independent national economy. In recent years, they  have splendidly completed scores of large-scale construction  projects such as the Pyongyang-Kaesong express highway, the 800  km-long waterways on the west coast, streetcar rails in  Pyongyang and dwelling houses for 30,000 families.    The construction of the world's leading West Sea barrage  with  three locks and 36 sluices cutting across an 8 km section of the  wild sea, the vast construction and electrification of railways  including the Hyesan-Manpo Youth line and the Wiyon-Motka line,  the construction of the modern may day stadium and a number of  public buildings in the capital were projects of monumental  edifices undertaken by young people.    Korea remains unshaken in any roar of thunder because it has  the young men and women who burn with love for the motherland  and hatred for the enemy bent on encroaching upon the nation's  sovereignty.</p>

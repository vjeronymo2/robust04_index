			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Observer: If the chips are down Hong Kong's political class being long of lawyers and terribly short of characters, Chim Pui Chung, the local legislature's representative for the financial and insurance industry, easily steals the limelight in the latter category. When Chim, a noted stock market punter and big-time gambler, was elected to the legislature in 1991, he bought himself a gold Rolls- Royce - just to show that he was not entering politics to get rich but already was. Yesterday Chim took out half a page in the business press to give an 'advance appraisal' of Governor Chris Patten's state-of-the-colony speech due later in the day, expounding on favourite themes such as the need for the UK and China to resolve their differences over the colony's future. More original was a suggestion to unblock the political impasse surrounding Hong Kong's HKDollars 165bn airport project. Funding for the project could be raised by leasing outlying islands for casinos, says Chim, who is presumably tiring of the long ride to Las Vegas.</p>

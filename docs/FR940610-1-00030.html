			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Under Section 175A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing approval of the State of West Virginia maintenance plan for the Parkersburg, West Virginia area because EPA finds that West Virginia's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A of the Act. If EPA determines after notice and comment that it should give final approval to the maintenance plan, the Parkersburg, West Virginia nonattainment area will have a fully approved maintenance plan in accordance with section 175A of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 175A of the Act sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after the area is redesignated. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures, with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5.A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 13, 1992, the State of West Virginia submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC and NOx emissions from area, stationary, and mobile using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 VOC inventory is considered most representative of attainment conditions because no violations occurred in 1990 and it reflects the typical inventory for the three-year period demonstrating attainment of the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of West Virginia submittal contains detailed inventory data and summaries by source categories. The State of West Virginia submittal also contains information related to how it comported with EPA's guidance, which model and emission factors were used (note MOBILE 5.0a was used), how Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) data was generated, what RVP was considered in the base year, and other technical information verifying the validity of the Parkersburg, West Virginia emission inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of West Virginia submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by source category. This inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year inventories are shown in the following six tables. The TSD which has been prepared for this action contains more in-depth details regarding the base year for the Parkersburg area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

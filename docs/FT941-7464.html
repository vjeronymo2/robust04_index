			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fairview weighs up debt plan options Cadillac Fairview, Canada's biggest regional shopping centre owner, has submitted a debt restructuring plan to its bankers and shareholders. It proposes asset sales and possibly a public stock offer. Fairview, once controlled by the Montreal Bronfmans, owns the country's three leading downtown shopping malls, including the Eaton Centre in Toronto. It has suffered from plunging property values since 1990, and has long-term debt of about CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn), including CDollars 860m due to its banking group in 1997. Fairview was acquired by Chicago's JMB Realty in 1987 for CDollars 2.9bn, and taken private. About 41 institutions, including many big North American pension funds, injected CDollars 700m cash last year. Mr Graham Eadie, president of Fairview, said the company had to consider restructuring because of the drastic fall in property values. While there was no urgent deadline, the options were selling assets or bringing in new equity through a public offering. Several Canadian property firms, such as Markborough and Cambridge Shopping Centres, have raised well over CDollars 500m with stock and convertible debenture issues in the past few months. Mr Frank Mayer, analyst with BBN James Capel, said: 'The perception is that shares of companies such as Fairview can only improve. There is a lot of room for Canadian investment if an interesting deal is put together.'</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Observer: Lea makes way Why is it that otherwise sensible economists are seduced by the bright lights of the media? It can't be the cash, since the best ones are already paid a handsome whack. It must be the chance of fame and glory. Ruth Lea, currently chief UK economist at Lehman Brothers, is joining the UK's Independent Television News as economics editor, taking on the difficult task of explaining to a mass audience the intricacies of M0 in 50-second sound bites. Lea is thus going to be ITN's answer to Peter Jay, the BBC's economics guru. Jay declines to tone down his highbrow style and complex sentences - refined since his days as presenter of Weekend World in the 1970s - and thus has an avid following of at least three - the governor of the Bank of England, the programme producer, and Jay himself. Lea has a more crisp, down-to-earth style, no doubt honed by 16 years in the civil service. She will need it in the increasingly tabloid-style ITN.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rafiq al-Zayn in Beirut] </F>   [Text] As the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations falter, and  as the PLO enters a hectic race between peace and war, the 10  Palestinian factions decided to take the offensive, and worked  out a scheme to wreck the peace process in cooperation with  Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. They began to form a "Palestinian  Revolutionary Army," which will be based in Tehran. What are  the details of this scheme, and what are the chances of the  opposition Palestinian alliance's success in light of Iranian  efforts to push Hamas as the leader of this alliance?    A high-ranking Palestinian delegation representing the 10  Palestinian factions opposed to the Gaza-Jericho agreement  arrived in the Libyan capital a few days ago.    What was officially announced about the visit was that the  Palestinian delegation conferred for a long time with Colonel  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi on developments in the occupied  Palestinian territories following the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre  and the political situation in the Arab and international arenas.    Information obtained by Arab and Western security forces,  which have been showing special interest in and closely watching  the movements of the opposition Palestinian factions -- known as  the Palestinian Alliance -- dubbed the visit one of the "very  dangerous" activities the opposition has begun to carry out.  This visit comes in tandem with other secret visits by  political and security officials to "suspicious" Middle Eastern  capitals such as Baghdad, Tehran, and Khartoum, as well as  Tripoli.    These security services noted that prominent leaders of the  Palestinian opposition have been eager to visit countries on a  common axis; that is, countries that are internationally  isolated and subjected to siege, countries that want to torpedo  the peace process, countries that support international  terrorism and religious extremism, and countries that extend  assistance to all political and military factions and  organizations whose objective is to obstruct and abort the peace  negotiations.    In fact, the moves by these Palestinian parties toward  countries opposed to the peace process--whether their positions  are based on hostility to the United States and the West or a  desire to avenge the siege to which Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan  are subjected--are not really new.    During the past few months, Iran has received officials from  the Palestinian Jihad, Hamas, and the Lebanese Hizballah, and  tried to form a military front in order to exacerbate the  security situation in face of the peace process. Iran has also  increased its financial support and arms supplies to these  parties.    Baghdad has also contacted Palestinian opposition officials  who were living in Iraq or who are frequent visitors of Baghdad.  Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] has recently visited Baghdad.    As for Sudan, it opened its camps, run by the Iranian  Revolutionary Guard, to train fundamentalist opposition  Palestinian group. It also increased its assistance to the  opposition Palestinian forces in the country before al-Qadhdhafi  openly invited Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna] and Ahmad Jibril  [secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine--General Command, PFLP--GC] to visit Tripoli.    A few weeks ago, Arab and Western security circles noted a  qualitative shift in the opposition to the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, represented in a new scheme that takes into  consideration the political and security changes that have taken  place on the ground and the new psychological atmosphere that is  leading toward escalation.    The factions of the opposition Palestinian alliance are of  the opinion that many of the recent developments make it  possible for them to move to the offensive, or at least prepare  for it, instead of maintaining a wait-and-see attitude.    A number of developments have taken place on various fronts:    First: The opposition factions are of the opinion that at  last they have managed to overcome their differences and to  agree on a basic level of understanding for joint action.  Available information indicates that after lengthy meetings,  the opposition Palestinian factions have developed a unified  political approach and emerged with agreements and joint  political objectives. The information also indicates that the  alliance has agreed on the following tasks:    A. The alliance will set up a central command that will  specify the political objectives and orientation of the alliance  of Palestinian forces.    B. The alliance will hold monthly meetings. Exceptional  meetings will be held at the request of at least four factions.  The chairmanship of the meetings will rotate. Decisions will  be made by consensus.    C. Each faction has two representatives. A secretariat will  be set up, made up of a representative from each faction. The  secretariat will hold weekly meetings. It will a have permanent  headquarters.    D. The tasks of the alliance on the national level:    --To abide by the Palestine National Charter.    --To adhere to the Palestinian people's inalienable  civilian rights.    --To hold the Palestine question an Arab and Islamic  issue. Liberating Palestine is the responsibility of the Arab  and Islamic nation, especially the Palestinian people.    --To adhere to armed struggle and jihad as the main tool  of struggle for the liberation of Palestine.    --To adhere to the unity of the Palestinian people in the  occupied homeland and the diaspora.    --To hold the PLO as a national accomplishment that must  be maintained. Its institutions must be reconstructed on  democratic bases.    --To recognize that the current PLO leadership does not  represent the Palestinian people.    --To begin action against the 'Arafat-Rabin recognition  document, which amounts to national treason and which is unfit  for the Palestinian people.    --To adhere to Palestine as the irreplaceable historical  homeland of the Palestinian people and to resist all alternative  schemes.    --To boycott the institutions and organizations  responsible for implementing self-rule.    --To sever ties with all institutions led or joined by  'Arafat.    --To firmly adhere to the escalation of armed struggle.    E. The tasks of the alliance on the Arab-Islamic level:    --To emphasize that the Palestine question is the core of  the Arab-Zionist conflict.    --To ensure the responsibility of the Palestinian people  and the Arab and Islamic masses to counter destructive  conspiracies.    --To work to promote joint Arab and Islamic militant  relations to resist the hegemony schemes.    --To stress the Palestinian people's right to exercise  their militant responsibilities toward liberation, repatriation,  and self- determination.    F. The tasks of the alliance on the international level:    --To recognize that U.S. support for the Zionist entity  constitutes naked aggression against the Palestinian people.    --To bolster cooperation with Islamic, African, and Asian  states that support the Palestinian struggle.    --To form alliances with all forces of liberation and  progress in the world rejecting U.S. and imperialist hegemony  and Zionist invasion.    --To make known all that pertains to the Palestine  question and the national struggle in order to win the support  of world public opinion.    Second: The opposition factions believe that it can benefit  from the very important change that has taken place in the  atmosphere among Palestinians in the occupied territory and in  the diaspora. The current support for the Gaza-Jericho accord  cannot be compared with the enthusiasm that prevailed on 13  September. In fact, enthusiasm has turned into general  Palestinian frustration. These factions have realized that the  stand of the Palestinian people, following the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, is not even close to the stand before the massacre.  The evidence of this is in the calls to halt the talks and in  the lack of hope that 'Arafat will still be able to save face  under the Israeli policy of intransigence and the bloody  repression practiced by the occupation forces each day in which  many Palestinians are being killed. The fact is, international  analysts, who support the accord, believe that the peace process  is now facing the danger of ultimate failure. They also believe  that the peace process has become a hostage to Palestinian and  Jewish extremists, who can repeat operations similar to the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. If this happens, it will be difficult  to save the peace agreement. Which means that the opposition  must feel that now is the time to deal a deadly blow to the  peace process.    Third: The opposition Palestinian alliance has discovered  that it is a particularly suitable time to exploit the hostility  and tension between the United States on one hand and the states  that are being exposed to blockades and American and Western  pressure, such as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Libya, on the other.  It seems that these countries have lost hope in peaceful  normalization with America and Western countries and the lifting  of the embargoes imposed upon them. Thus, these countries are  now ready for confrontation through supporting international  terrorism or exerting pressure by obstructing the peace process  and undermining, in fact, torpedoing U.S. plans.    Confirmed reports indicate that the opposition Palestinian  alliance has decided to enter the feverish race of war and peace  using all their potential and on all levels. This alliance has  recently laid out plans to execute its objectives. These plans  call for escalating the confrontation in Gaza and the West Bank  and intensifying military operations against the Israeli  occupation forces and Jewish settlers to avenge the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre and to torpedo the peace process. This  escalation will not be confined to the occupied Palestinian  territory, southern Lebanon will also witness an escalation and  the national and Palestinian resistance will intensify its  operations.    Information indicates that the scheme of the Palestinian  opposition includes reorganizing the armed factions to  reactivate fedayeen operations. These operations will include  infiltrations into occupied Palestine and other fedayeen  operations against the occupation forces. The scheme also  stresses a return to operations abroad, such as striking at  Israeli and Western institutions and hostage-taking.    Observers think that the fact that the agreement of the  alliance stresses the "importance of forming alliances with all  forces of liberation and progress worldwide that reject U.S. and  imperialist hegemony" should be taken seriously. This is  especially important considering the information about secret  meetings held in Tehran between extremist Palestinian factions  and international leftist and terrorist groups and  organizations. Add to this reports by Western security agencies  about the arrival of secret groups in their countries and the  intensive coordination under way between extremist  fundamentalist movements, particularly from Hizballah, the  Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the Islamic Jihad and international  terrorist groups linked to Palestinian and international  organizations. These organizations include the Japanese Red  Army, the Italian Red Brigades, the Armenian Secret Army, the  Irish Republican Army, and the German Red Army. Western  agencies found out a few days ago that these groups have held a  secret meeting in Larnaca, Cyprus, in the presence of officials  from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. These groups outlined a  scheme to carry out terrorist operations worldwide.    Within the framework of the new scheme of the Palestinian  opposition, AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that these  Palestinian opposition factions have embarked on a plan to form  an entity similar to the former "Palestine Liberation Army,"  which was deployed in several Arab states. Information  indicates that the Alliance of Palestinian Forces is now  assembling military cadres and elements. Each one of the 10  factions will contribute the largest possible number of its  elements to recruit and organize them within a new liberation  army that will be called the "Palestinian Revolutionary Army."  The command of this army will be based in an Arab capital and  in Tehran.    Information indicates that 'Imad al-'Alami, the official in  charge of the Hamas office in the Iranian capital, has held  several meetings with Iranian officials at the University of  Strategic Sciences that belongs to the Iranian Army, including  Major General Reza Ma'iri and Lieutenant General Sayfillahi  [name as transliterated], commander of the internal security  forces. Al- 'Alami discussed with the Iranian officials the  possibility of Iran supporting this military plan of the  alliance and extending funds and weapons to it. It has been  decided that an expanded meeting will be held in Tehran to be  attended by Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the PFLP-GC;  Salah Salah, representing the PFLP; Nayif Hawatimah, secretary  general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [DFLP], as well as other Palestinian officials from the  Palestinian al-Biqa' region and certain camps.    It has been observed in some Lebanese regions, particularly  around the al-Biqa' region, that Palestinian organizations have  started to train cadres to form part of the Palestinian  Revolutionary Army under the supervision of Palestinian officers  from certain Arab and Islamic states.    But will the opposition Palestinian alliance succeed in its  new move, or is this move really the creation of transient  political and military circumstances that will vanish with the  end of these circumstances?    Neutral Palestinian sources told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that at  first, the Palestinian opposition's wagers seem to be logical  and based on a realistic assessment of the situation, but it is  shortsighted. These sources believe that the danger of the  talks being torpedoing will exist as long as Israel, backed by  the United States, ignores the importance of time factor in the  negotiations, and refuses to make concessions; something which  increases frustration among the Palestinians as well as calls  for military escalation. These sources added: The opposition  factions have not taken into consideration several basic  factors. Among these factors is the fact that the failure of  the peace process will jeopardize the entire region and not only  the occupied territories. Based on this, there is an  international determination to achieve peace and to prevent the  obstruction of negotiations. This was clearly manifested in the  positions of the other Arab negotiators following the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre. This will restrict the margin of maneuvering  for the opposition alliance and suggests that the regional  circumstances will change, and consequently, this will limit  their movement. However, counting and wagering on states such  as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Libya is not a guarantee, especially  since these states will seek to use the alliance, not because  they like them or out of support for their scheme, but as a  means to pressure America and to expedite normalization with it.    Before this, though, one should wait to make sure of how  strong the opposition Palestinian alliance is. Information  confirms that the recent agreement has come following several  attempts by Hamas to dominate the Palestinian opposition's  decisionmaking. This agreement is considered to be a compromise  solution between the Hamas plan on the one hand, and the rest of  factions on the other. It seems that the recent meetings have  witnessed heated discussion due to Hamas' insistence on  obtaining 40 percent of the seats of proposed executive  committee. Differences over some side's insistence to form a  new PLO, and some other sides' proposals to reconstruct the  current PLO and its charter, have not yet been settled.  Differences have begun to resurface among the factions,  particularly between Hamas and the DFLP. It was noticed that  each of them claim operations against Israel in different ways,  and publish slanderous statements in the press.    Information received by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI indicates that  differences within the opposition Palestinian alliance will  erupt in the coming stage. This is in light of the information  that Iran is currently setting a plan in accordance with which  Hamas will dominate the alliance politically and militarily,  taking into consideration that Hamas has opposed the idea that  George Habash lead the alliance because he is closer the Marxist  ideology. Information also indicates that Hamas began to act as  if it were the alliance. It has been observed that its cadres  and elements have begun to spread in the Palestinian camps in  southern Lebanon and al- Biqa', and also to spread their  fundamentalist calls to the effect that the liberation of  Palestine can only take place through holy jihad.</p>

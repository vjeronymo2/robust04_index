			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Hurd brokers cabinet referendum deal Senior ministers believe the cabinet is moving towards a consensus on Mr John Major's commitment to hold a referendum on further European integration only if significant constitutional issues are at stake. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, is understood to have established broad backing for the prime minister's formula - set out in a Financial Times interview on Tuesday - after contacting the entire cabinet. The emerging consensus reflects increasing confidence among ministers that the European Union's 1996 intergovernmental conference is unlikely to produce the drama of the last conference at Maastricht in 1991. There is also agreement that there is no need for a firm commitment to hold a referendum on the prospect of a single European currency because a decision to go ahead is unlikely before 1999. Mr Major's formula stops short of committing the government to a referendum  -meeting the concerns of pro-European cabinet ministers, led by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. It also has the support of leading Eurosceptics such as Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, who fear a firm commitment would reduce the pressure on Mr Major to veto any unexpected proposals for constitutional change at the 1996 conference. The Eurosceptics believe an undertaking to hold a referendum on a single currency would be counter-productive because it would increase the chances of a decision to go ahead. The broad support for Mr Major's approach to the referendum issue makes it unlikely that he will decide to offer a clearer commitment to a referendum on either the intergovernmental conference issue or the single currency in the new year, as has been widely suggested. The prime minister may, however, restate his approach more clearly, probably linking the role of referendums on European questions to the constitutional implications of Labour's plans to reform the House of Lords and set up Scottish and Welsh parliaments. The cabinet's defence and overseas policy committee, chaired by Mr Major, will start preparing a detailed case early next year calling on the 1996 meeting to limit itself to changes to improve the Maastricht treaty. Mr Hurd is expected to take the lead in staking out an approach to the conference negotiations on which the broad mass of the Conservative parliamentary party can stand. Mr Michael Howard, the moderately Eurosceptic home secretary, is seen as a central figure in crafting an approach acceptable to all but the most extreme Tory critics of the EU. Senior ministers loyal to Mr Major are dismissive of the nine backbenchers who lost or gave up the Conservative whip last month after a rebellion against higher UK contributions to the union. There is concern, however, about the mood of party workers.</p>

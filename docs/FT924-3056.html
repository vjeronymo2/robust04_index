			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / (CORRECTED) Customs queries up as EC change nears Correction (published 11th December 1992) appended to this article. THE Customs and Excise Department has reported a big increase in inquiries and questions from businesses trading with other EC states before the abolition of customs frontiers at the beginning of next year. The tariff and statistical office, which will process a new statistical form called Intrastat, received more than 3,700 letters and telephone calls during October and November according to internal estimates. Nearly three quarters of the responses - about 2 per cent of all EC traders  -appear not to have been correctly categorised according to the level of trade that they conduct with other EC states. All those with EC imports or exports which are valued above Pounds 135,000 a year must complete two new forms. The contacts have been prompted by letters sent in October to all 160,000 companies that trade with other EC member states. The letters explained the procedures for completing the Intrastat form and the EC sales list, a second form being introduced from the start of the year. Officials remain confident that they can cope with the administrative systems required to accompany the creation of the single European market on January 1. But the responses suggest widespread ignorance among companies of the administrative procedures that they must comply with, and a number of technical hitches in the classification of some of them. Twelve per cent of respondents were not aware of what Intrastat or the sales list were, and 43 per cent objected in principle to the idea behind them. CORRECTION THE FT of December 9 stated that 43 per cent of a sample of 3,700 traders contacting the tariff and statistical office of HM Customs &amp; Excise had objected to Intrastat, the new trade statistics system. This should have said 43 businesses.</p>

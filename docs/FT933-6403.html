			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Consumer credit boost for Cattle's CONTINUING strong demand for consumer credit lifted interim profits at Cattle's Holdings. The pre-tax outcome amounted to Pounds 6.9m, compared with Pounds 6.66m. However, under FRS 3, last year's figure was restated from the originally reported Pounds 5.2m before an exceptional gain of Pounds 1.4m from profits on the flotation of a 55 per cent stake in Roseby's, the curtain and linen stores group. Turnover from continuing operations rose to Pounds 98.7m, up from Pounds 94.8m. Turnover for the consumer credit division, led by Shopacheck, the door-to-door weekly credit business, rose to Pounds 77.8m from Pounds 72.4m. Profits rose 32 per cent from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 6.8m. Mr Eddie Cran, chief executive, described the consumer credit division's performance as exceptionally good. He attributed the profit rise to control of bad debt, containment of costs, interest rate cuts and an increased customer base. The corporate services sector, with turnover of Pounds 7.05m (Pounds 8.12m), reduced losses from Pounds 265,000 to Pounds 19,000. Mr Cran predicted that the problems caused by recession were coming to an end, and that the division would return to the black by the end of the year. The insurance services division reported a steep fall in profit to Pounds 182,000 (Pounds 330,000) on turnover of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 10.9m). Mr Cran said the division had lost clients to direct line insurers. While the group was confident of winning clients back, it forecast the results of this division to be below expectations for the year as a whole. Earnings per share were 4.25p, compared with a revised 4.26p under FRS 3. Last time's earnings were originally 3.16p. The interim dividend goes up to 1.9p (1.6p).</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Vladykina: "Monopolists Are Told to </F> Restructure; Program for Demonopolization of the Economy Adopted  in Central Urals"]    [Text] The list of monopolist enterprises of Sverdlovsk  Oblast includes around 300 names, and continues to be  replentished with new enterprises in those spheres of economics  and business to which the Sverdlovsk territorial administration  of the State Committee on Anti-Monopoly Policy and Support of  New Economic Structures has cast its glance. The railroad,  electrical power production and communications occupy the  leading and strongest place in this register. The oblast  anti-monopoly administration has recently filed four claims in  court against just the Sverdlovsk Railroad and its sections.    The program of demonopolization adopted at the meeting of  the  Sverdlovsk Oblast government is called upon to stop unfair  competition, limit monopolistic activity, and protect consumer  rights. It is intended for a period of two years. But, as the  chief of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Anti-Monopoly Administration,  Nikolay Uzhegov, noted, demonopolization, judging by all, will  be a more prolonged process.    Such criteria as scientific and legal justification,  socio-economic effectiveness of enterprises and their  controllability and manageability were selected as basis of the  program. Democracy, openness and a consideration of public  opinion were proclaimed as the principles for the program's  realization.    The program on demonopolization of the economy of Sverdlovsk  Oblast includes numerous measures, which are grouped into nine  blocks. Particular attention is focused on developing  competition on the commodity markets in the sphere of  scientific-technical progress, in trade, public catering, and  consumer services. The program also defines its  priorities--provision for the development of commodity markets  in the sector, support of small and medium-sized enterprise,  control and regulation of state monopolies, prevention of the  emergence of various subjects which occupy a dominant position  in the economy, as well as the deconsolidation of such  monopolist enterprises, if this is economically justified and  expedient.    Aside from the territorial administration, a special  commission has been formed in Yekaterinburg in order to  implement control over the realization of the program on  demonopolization of the economy. It will include various  representatives of the administrative agencies, entrepreneurial  structures, scientists and specialists. The commission will not  have authoritative powers and authorities. Its activity must  have an advisory character.</p>

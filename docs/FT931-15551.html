			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: GFSA to sell assets of lossmaking gold mine GOLD Fields of South Africa (GFSA), one of the country's largest mining houses, yesterday announced that it planned to sell the assets of the lossmaking Doornfontein gold mine, which is likely to cease production within the year. Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said that in spite of the mine's improved performance during the December quarter, production was insufficient to cover working costs at the current gold price. Doornfontein reduced its loss to R5.87m (Dollars 1.9m) during the quarter, from R17.34m during the previous three months. The announcement was not unexpected, and forms part of a trend in the industry to close marginal mines whose profitability has been squeezed by the combination of rising costs and a stagnant gold price. The weaker rand during the fourth quarter helped group profits, with GFSA's four gold producers lifting after-tax profits to R270.2m from R226.8m during the September quarter. A 2.3 per cent fall in production to 30,661kg from 31,375kg, was more than offset by a 3.6 per cent increase in the average gold price received. This rose to R31,988 per kg from R30,865 per kg. The lower production was largely attributable to disruption caused by underground fires at the Kloof, Driefontein and Deelkraal mines. Although working costs were virtually flat at R679.9m, compared with R676.4m, working costs per kg gold produced rose by 3 per cent to R22,175 from R21,558, on account of the lower production. The average yield was 9 grams per tonne of ore milled against 9.1 grams. After-tax profits at Driefontein, the group's largest producer, rose to R137.4m from R115.7m. Profits also rose at Kloof, the other large mine, to R125.2m from R115.3m.</p>

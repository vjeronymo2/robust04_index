			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FYI: LOOONNNG EARRINGS  </P> <P> They look like they should be hanging from the ceiling, but in reality, they  are the newest accessory for ears. They're earrings shaped like chandeliers.  </P> <P> Made of crystal, gold, silver, pearls and semi precious stones, most of them  are long enough to brush the shoulders -- at least.  </P> <P> Los Angeles jewelry designer Deanna Hamro was on top of the trend two years  ago, but it was just recently that the demand caught up with her vision.  </P> <P> Her 24-karat gold door-knockers with gold chains and lavender Austrian pave  crystals for $405 (pictured here) are available at Buffalo in Tarzana.  </P> <P> Pamela McGivern, a San Francisco jewelry designer, calls her line of  Victorian-looking gold filigree and pearl earrings Chandel Ears. Priced from  $185 to $265, they are available at Fred Hayman Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> You can have your earrings as long as you please by ordering gold or silver  pearls by the inch at Faux Body Ornaments.  </P> <P> Designed by Hillary Ellison, a pair measuring up to seven inches run $98.  </P> <P> At Madeleine Gallay, an incredibly long pair of earrings designed by Eric  Beamon go for $210. They are made of Austrian crystals, pearls and beads.  JOANNA DENDEL  </P></p>

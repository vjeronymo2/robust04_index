			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Poseidon Gold buys 40% stake in mine Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, is to buy a 40 per cent interest in the Boddington gold mine from Reynolds Metals Australia, part of the US minerals group. Reynolds, battered by the slump in aluminium prices, has been looking for buyers for its gold operations for some time. It is retaining the Mount Gibson and Yilgarn mines in Australia that last year contributed 210,000 ounces to Reynolds' total and will continue its gold project in Australia's Northern Territories. PosGold, which is currently in the throes of a hostile bid battle for Aztec Mining, will pay Dollars 116m for the stake and undertake to deliver 30,000 ounces of gold over seven years. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals, will make PosGold the largest stakeholder in the mine, which is located about 120km south-east of Perth. Other partners in the project include Newcrest Mining, with a 20 per cent interest and Billiton Australia Gold, with 30 per cent.</p>

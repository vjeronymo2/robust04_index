			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter" from Pak Yong-nam, director of the DPRK Atomic </F> Energy General Department to Hans Blix, director general of the  International Atomic Energy Agency -- date not given]    [Text] Pak Yong-nam, director of the DPRK Atomic Energy  General Department, sent the following letter to Hans Blix,  director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA], responding to the hurriedly made conclusion that it is  impossible to confirm if nuclear material has been diverted  [haengmulchil yuyongul tambohalsu omnundusi sodullo kyollonul  naeringotkwa kwallyonhaeso], insisting as if the technical  possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods [nosim yollyo]  at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant has been  lost. [machi sangsildoengot chorom chujang hamyonso].    I regret very much [maeu yugamsuropke saenggak handa] that  you hurriedly made the conclusion that it is impossible to  confirm if nuclear material has been diverted, insisting as if  the technical possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods  at our five- megawatt experimental nuclear power plant has been  lost.    We have recently asked the agency to give us a scientific  and  technological response to the method for later measurement of  fuel rods that we proposed, while agreeing to the agency's  deputy director-general's proposal for negotiations by telex on  the core refueling. However, you, with no intention to respond  to our proposal, picked a quarrel with us, acting as if we had  made no answer, and even submitted to the UN Security Council an  absurd report that distorted facts [sasirul chondohan  tangchiannun pogo].    What we cannot help but call in question is that you ignored  our special status following the temporary suspension of the  effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Our special status was created  by the United States and the IAEA. Based on their  acknowledgement of our special status, the United States and the  agency agreed on the inspection to guarantee the continuity of  safeguards, and the agency has carried out inspections to  guarantee the continuity of safeguards, not routine and ad hoc  inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi sachari anira] under the  safeguards accord.    The fuel rods replacement at the five-megawatt experimental  nuclear power plant is being carried out in the presence of  inspectors from the agency and under the agency's supervision  [kamsi] and surveillance [pongswae] in accordance with this  principle. Inspectors of the agency who are observing the  replacement of the fuel rods admit there is no diversion of  nuclear materials.    Problems on the verification of the history of the fuel rods  [nosim yollyoui kyongnyok komjung munje] raised by the agency  will automatically [chayonhi] be solved when our special status  is resolved [haeso].    We are now doing the refueling operations in such a manner  to  guarantee fully the technical possibility for later measurement  of fuel rods, anticipating a dissolution of our special status.  The fuel rods are being replaced channel by channel and area by  area in due sequence, and all the fuel rods from four channels  are discharged into one basket.    All the refueling operations, including recording the  identification numbers of baskets and fuel rod channels in the  baskets and positions of baskets in the tub, are being correctly  recorded in accounting and operating books and are confirmed by  the inspectors of the agency daily. This plainly shows that the  procedure fully guarantees the possibility of repeating  [chaeyon] the sequence of fuel channels and fuel rods in  channels, if necessary.    Our method of guaranteeing the technical possibility,  which we notified the agency by letter, is not only  theoretically possible, but also has fully been proven  experimentally. This is the only rational [hamnijogin] method  suitable to our special status. All the facts show that when  our special status is resolved, the agency can scientifically  verify there has been no diversion of nuclear materials in the  past.    Nevertheless, it was referred in your reports to the UN  Security Council and the IAEA Board of Governors that any future  measurement of that fuel would have no practical value because  it would not be possible to reconstruct the configuration of  fuel rods and because the measurement would have to be based on  operators' records, which are unverifiable. This shows that you  seem to have no interest in a fair solution to our nuclear  problem, in keeping with your preconceived prejudiced political  view.    Our practical experience from the past inspections shows  that  the more we accepted the agency inspections with our maximum  goodwill and generosity, the more artificial obstacles the  agency made to the solution of the problem, leading the  situation to a graver phase by attaching unreasonable conditions  every time.    We made it clear during the Board of Governors meeting in  February 1993 that the inconsistencies could be clarified by a  verification of the fuel rods during the core refueling  operation. At that time, however, the agency Secretariat  objected to our proposal, saying that the inconsistencies could  not be clarified in such a manner, and made the Board of  Governors adopt the resolution on special inspections for two  military sites.    After completing the activities sufficient to guarantee the  continuity of safeguards last March, the agency referred to the  UN Security Council the issue of additional inspections, saying  that it is necessary to carry out the smear-taking from the  glove boxes and gamma mapping in the building No. 3 at the  radiochemical laboratory in order to verify nondiversion of  nuclear materials.    When we allowed the agency to conduct additional inspections  as a special exception, it then said that it is necessary to  measure the fuel rods from the core, which was a matter already  denied by the agency in the past. On the one hand, the agency  inspection team removed the archive samples for clarification of  the inconsistencies during the past inspection, and on the other  hand, the agency says that it is necessary for the agency to  make special inspections of two military sites to verify  nondiversion of nuclear materials. This shows that the agency  Secretariat continues to join the U.S. hostile policy toward the  DPRK to make our military sites open one by one under the  pretext of the inspection.    The development of current situation regarding the core  refueling operations bears resemblance to the IAEA's pressure  commotion at the beginning of 1993 when the agency cooked up the  nonexistent inconsistencies on the basis of the false  intelligence information provided by a third country and imposed  on us the so-called special inspection of two military sites on  the basis of the inconsistencies.    I think such unreasonable acts of the IAEA are unprecedented  events in the history of safeguards. I would like to remind you  that, for these reasons, we could not help but withdraw from the  NPT last year.    In light of the facts described above, we cannot help but  doubt if our nuclear issue can indeed be resolved through  further consultations with the agency Secretariat.    Recently, the agency Secretariat has laid obstacles to our  normal nuclear activities concerning the refueling operation at  the beginning of the campaign by intentionally avoiding the  presence of its inspection team. On the other hand, it is now  preventing a smooth solution of the nuclear problem by making a  hasty conclusion that it could not verify the nondiversion of  nuclear materials. This is very irresponsible and hasty behavior  that misrepresents the objective reality.    Accordingly, the agency Secretariat will have to be entirely  held responsible for all the consequence arising from this wrong  conclusion. If the agency Secretariat takes our nuclear issue  to the United Nations and continues to adhere to only pressure  on the basis of a hasty conclusion that the technical  possibility for later measurement of the fuel rods has been  broken, widening its unfairness, we will no longer feel the need  to be subject to the unreasonable binding of the agency  Secretariat and will have no choice but to proceed to the next  step of our peaceful nuclear activities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Dublin] </F>   [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds tonight urged  Sinn Fein to spell out exactly what was meant by its latest  demand for clarification from Britain of the Downing Street  Declaration.    As he left Dublin airport for London on the first leg of an  Easter trip to Cyprus, Mr Reynolds said Sinn Fein had a  responsibility to explain itself.    Responding to a statement issued by Sinn Fein's president,  Gerry Adams, the Irish premier said he was unsure what points  the hard-line Republican party needed clarifying.    He said London and Dublin had always been at one on their  approach to the Declaration and added: "If one studies their  (Sinn Fein's) latest statement, it is difficult to know what  they mean."    The Irish premier, whose aides have stressed his  close-to-anger disappointment with the IRA's limited ceasefire,  also made clear once more that he did not think 72 hours was an  adequate period to prompt developments toward peace.    "There is a momentum for peace and three days is not  sufficient, in my view, to allow something significant to  happen. I would like to see the momentum continue so that the  three days could be extended and something beneficial take place.    ``Let's hope this small step of a three-day ceasefire can be  the forerunner of many other steps that will ultimately lead to  a cessation of violence,'' he said.    "That is what both communities in Northern Ireland and the  vast majority of Irish and British people want. The sooner we  get clarification from Sinn Fein the better."    Mr Reynolds' words were seen in Dublin as his sharpest  criticism yet at Sinn Fein's handling of the position thrown up  by the Declaration.    But it was also learned tonight that Irish concern over Sinn  Fein delays in responding to the joint statement of December 15  was relayed through intermediaries well ahead of last night's  IRA ceasefire announcement.    Mr Reynolds will be away from Dublin for a week but  officials  said he will be kept in constant touch with all developments  surrounding the Anglo-Irish peace initiative and the IRA  ceasefire.</p>

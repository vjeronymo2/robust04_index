			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies propose to take account of the risks posed by nontraditional activities by ensuring that, as members of the industry begin to engage in, or significantly expand their participation in, a nontraditional activity, the risks of that activity are promptly analyzed and the activity is given appropriate capital treatment. Moreover, the agencies recognize that an institution's ability to adequately manage the risks posed by nontraditional activities affects its risk exposure. Therefore, the agencies also propose to amend their risk-based capital standards to explicitly identify the management of nontraditional activities as an important factor to consider in assessing an institution's overall capital adequacy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> D. Biennial Review of Risk-Based Capital Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 305(a) of FDICIA requires the agencies to review their capital standards biennially to determine whether those standards are sufficient to facilitate prompt corrective action under section 38 of FDICIA, 12 U.S.C. 1831o. As part of any such review, the agencies expect that they will consider the asset coverage of the risk-based capital standards, including in particular the coverage of concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities. The agencies, though, do not intend to wait until the next biennial review should a nontraditional activity evolve rapidly in the industry; rather, such products will be promptly reviewed for proper treatment under risk-based capital. Similarly, as new developments in identifying and measuring concentration of credit risk emerge, potential refinements to risk-based capital standards will be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, to the extent appropriate, the agencies will issue examination guidelines on new developments in nontraditional activities or concentrations of credit to ensure that adequate account is taken of the risks of these activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) are contained in this notice. Consequently, no information has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> F. Regulatory Flexibility Act Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each agency has concluded after reviewing the proposed regulation that the regulation, if adopted, will not impose a significant economic hardship on small institutions. The proposal does not necessitate the development of sophisticated recordkeeping or reporting systems by small institutions nor will small institutions need to seek out the expertise of specialized accountants, lawyers, or managers in order to comply with the regulation. Each agency therefore hereby certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) that the proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> G. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OCC and the OTS have determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action.'' This proposed rule will amend the risk-based capital guidelines to clarify that the agencies may impose additional capital requirements above the minimum capital leverage and risk-based capital requirements where an institution has significant concentration of credit risk or risks from nontraditional activities. This proposed rule is consistent with the current practice and policies of the agencies and is required by section 305 of FDICIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> H. Proposed Regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, the OCC, the Board, the FDIC and the OTS hereby propose to amend title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations by amending their respective parts as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

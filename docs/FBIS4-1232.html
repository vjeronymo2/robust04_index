			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified Pretoria correspondent] </F>   [Text] The National Inauguration Committee (NIC) has  devised a ticket system to control the hordes of people expected  to attend the May 10 presidential inauguration ceremony in  Pretoria. A spokesman for the NIC said only 150,000 people  would be allowed on to the lawns of the Union Buildings, and it  was hoped that strict crowd control would prevent a spillover of  people into residential areas.    The spokesman said separate events were planned for venues  outside Pretoria to prevent a huge influx of people. An  international soccer match was planned for the FNB [First  National Bank] Stadium near Johannesburg. It was hoped the new  president would be able to address people at other venues later  in the day, the spokesman said.    Security arrangements for the inauguration, which would be  attended by at least 50 heads of state or their representatives,  had been going well. Heavy security force deployment around the  Union Buildings would contain the crowd to the lawn below the  amphitheatre, where the ceremony would take place, the spokesman  said. Various assembly points would be set up in Pretoria where  people would receive security screening before being given  tickets to attend the inauguration. They would be bussed from  the assembly points to the Union Buildings. The Arcadia suburb  would be closed off to traffic.    Sources on the security planning committee of the NIC  however, were less optimistic about crowd numbers. A source  said an unprecedented number of security force members would  roll into Pretoria to prevent the ceremony from turning into  bloody chaos. He said a contingency plan was going ahead for up  to 1 million people expected to converge on Pretoria.    A source on the Joint Security Committee said several  thousand security force members would be deployed around the  Union Buildings, but they would not be able to prevent carnage  if things went wrong. In an effort to dilute the crowd at the  Union Buildings, talks were also under way to install huge  television screens at several stadiums where people could follow  the inauguration. These included Loftus Versfeld, Centurion  Park, Ellis Park and the FNB Stadium. The security plans  included:     -  Security forces, both uniformed and plainclothed, would be  brought in from other regions to control the crowd.    -  VIPs would be housed in only a few hotels to ease security  and  travel arrangements.    -  Permanent and roving roadblocks would be set up on access  routes to check for weapons.    -  Random checks on individuals for firearms would be done  throughout the day.    -  The police and defence force would establish a joint  operation  centre from which security would be co-ordinated.</p>

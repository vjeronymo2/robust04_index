			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / French attack US policy on Bosnia: Row highlights drifting apart of US and its European allies France yesterday stepped up its criticism of US policy in Bosnia, amid a further cooling of transatlantic relations because of differences over the war in former Yugoslavia. At a Nato meeting in Brussels, the US failed to convince its European allies to take immediate action over the Bosnian enclave of Bihac, where Serb forces were closing in. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said the US withdrawal from enforcing the arms embargo against Bosnia amounted to favouring those who wanted war against those who wanted peace. Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, threatened to withdraw French troops from Bosnia in the event of 'one more step' in the wrong direction. Mr Juppe will tomorrow host a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his counterparts from the UK and Russia, with the Bosnian crisis - and their common disappointment with US policy - high on the agenda. Officials from several European countries said they were concerned by reports of covert US military aid to Bosnian Moslems and Croats, aimed at helping them to fight together against the Serbs. This aid is reported to include training and the construction of small airfields. However, the battered five-nation contact group on Bosnia - US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - has scheduled a ministerial meeting for December 2, in a sign that efforts to harmonise policy will continue. Transatlantic differences over Bosnia and other issues have already prompted some public soul-searching by policy-makers and scholars on how the US-European relationship can be shored up. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, has suggested that increased exchanges between civil servants, businessmen and scholars could help maintain an 'Atlantic community' based on shared values. A report reflecting the views of businessmen and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic called this week for a new US-European treaty. It says the Europeans underestimate the degree to which US and European foreign policy interests diverge in the absence of a Soviet threat. The report sees a risk of cleavage as Americans tilt away from Europe to the fast-growing economies in Latin America and the Pacific, and as both allies become preoccupied with internal renewal and economic competition. Though not in any immediate peril, 'the transatlantic relationship founded primarily on the (Nato) alliance is adrift,' concludes the study by Transatlantic Policy Network. The report recommends three steps: The transformation of the present Transatlantic Declaration into an economic and political treaty between the EU and US aimed at creating a 'North Atlantic Free Trade Area'. Reforming Nato around a partnership between the US and a European defence pillar. Though the authors suggest further integrating defence and military procurement in Europe, they found 'no firm foundation' for a coherent European approach on security matters. Uniting the annual Nato summit and the biennial US-EU meetings. The aim is to exploit the Clinton administration's shift toward strengthening the European defence pillar within Nato.

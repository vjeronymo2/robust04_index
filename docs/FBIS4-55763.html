			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 16 (CTK) -- If the elections were held  today, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS, the major government  coalition party) would get 26 percent of the vote, according to  a May survey conducted by the Institute for the Public Opinion  Research (IVVM) among 788 respondents. The Czech Social  Democratic Party (CSSD, an opposition party) would get 11  percent, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA, a member of the  government coalition) 10 percent, and the Communist Party of  Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM, opposition) and the Christian  Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL, a member  of the government coalition) each five percent of the vote.    Support for the ODS has continued to fall, reaching an  all-time low for the second time this year, whereas more people  would vote smaller parties. The number of people who would vote  the CSSD, ODA and KSCM generally remains stable.    The ODS tends to attract university-educated people (41  percent), entrepreneurs (30 percent) and other employees (33  percent), and it would obtain most support from towns with  between 5,000 to 20,000 residents (34 percent) and the East  Bohemian region (34 percent).

Fourteen percent of people from villages with up to  500 inhabitants would vote this party.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Japanese people are  denouncing the authorities' suppression of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon).    Hiromi Takahashi, representative member of the Edokawa Ward  People's Society in Tokyo, Japan, for supporting the independent  and peaceful reunification of Korea, charged that Japan has  defined the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as "the  enemy," fostering tension under the pretext of its "nuclear  issue" and suppressing Chongnyon.    He urged the Japanese Government to take steps to prevent  outrages against Koreans in Japan. Lawyer Takayuki Yoshida  denounced the search of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of  Chongnyon by the Japanese police and called for pooling strength  in the struggle against "an emergency system" sought by the  Japanese reactionary forces.    Takayoshi Yamanaka, vice-chairman of the All-Japan  Federation  of Peasants Unions, said though Japan must ask pardon of the  Korean people for the issues of "comfort women for the Army" and  forcible drafting, it is increasing tension in league with the  United States and South Korea.    Warning that the suppression of Chongnyon today will reach  the Japanese people tomorrow, he called for checking such  fascist suppression.</p>

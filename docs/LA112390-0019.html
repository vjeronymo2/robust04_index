			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAN THIS RECIPE?  </P> <P> I would like you to know that I was really offended by a recipe for "Better  Than Sex Cake" (Culinary SOS, Oct. 11).  </P> <P> The cake sounded good, but I won't try it because each time I did I'd have to  confront my feeling of distaste. To my mind, giving a cake this name showed a  lack of fitness and was out of place. Can't sex be kept out of the kitchen?  It's everywhere else.  </P> <P>  -- DOROTHY R.

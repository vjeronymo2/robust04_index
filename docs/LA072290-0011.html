			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: CALLING DR. BEATTY  </P> <P> Some critics took shots at Warren Beatty's performance as straight-laced cop  "Dick Tracy," complaining that he paled alongside the big-budget, effects-laden  picture's colorful villains.  </P> <P> For his follow-up film, Beatty may have a prescription for those critical  ailings: He trades in his machine gun for a stethoscope to star in "The  Doctor," which a Disney spokeswoman calls "an intimate, character-driven  drama."  </P> <P> Scheduled to begin shooting in the fall on a "moderate budget" for Disney's  Touchstone Pictures, "The Doctor" has Beatty as a successful doctor and family  man who is himself hospitalized, getting a patient's-eye view of his  profession, and reassessing his own bedside manner.  </P> <P> Randa Haines directs for producer Laura Ziskin, with screenwriter Robert  Caswell adapting a nonfiction book, "A Taste of His Own Medicine," by Dr. Ed  Rosenbaum.

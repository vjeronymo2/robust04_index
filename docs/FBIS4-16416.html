			<p>BFN     [Text] Disagreements on ways of settling the Karabakh  conflict foiled talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani  presidents last week, within the framework of the CIS summit,  Armenian Foreign Minister Vagan Papazyan told journalists on  Saturday.    He said the two presidents were not planning to hold talks  in  the near future. He also announced that initially there had  been plans to hold a quadripartite meeting on Russia's  initiative, involving the Russian, Armenian and Azerbaijani  presidents, and Chairman of Karabakh's State Committee for  Defense Robert Kocharyan, who was also in Moscow during the  summit.    "If Azerbaijan had given its general agreement to the  Russian  peace plan, which envisaged the use of peacekeeping forces and  was supported by Yerevan and Stepanakert, the talks would have  been held by all means," stated Papazyan.    "Only Russia is ready to send its troops to the conflict  zone. The UN cannot do so at the moment," he said. He noted,  however, that the participation of other CIS countries or  Eastern European states, would be desirable for Russia.    "I'm sure this would be desirable for Azerbaijan, as well,"  he said.    Commenting on Aliyev's statement that Armenia was carrying  out aggression against Azerbaijan, Papazyan said that "Armenian  has been entangled into the conflict, but it is not a warring  side." He pointed out, at the same time, that if the population  of Karabakh came under the threat of deportation or genocide,  Armenia would get involved in fighting "in earnest." Now  Yerevan is trying to abstain from active participation in the  conflict to avoid its escalation.</p>

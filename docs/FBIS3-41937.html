			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] There have long been rumors that the "air raid  shelter" in Libya is being modified so that it can serve as a  large nuclear and chemical weapons production plant, weapons  that could virtually destroy the human race. Thus, this tunnel  is very troubling to the people of the world.    These rumors got started in the West, particularly in the  United States, the enemy of Libya's leader, Qadhdhafi. There  have also been reports that Thai engineers designed this nuclear  weapons plant. And there are more than 60 Thai laborers working  on this tunnel. [passage omitted]    Police Major General Luan Panarotsathip, the commander of  the  Suppression Division, ordered Police Colonel Chaloemchat  Sittanon, the deputy commander, and Police Colonel Chumphon  Manmai, the superintendent of Precinct 2, to coordinate things  with the Labor Skills Development Department in order to conduct  an investigation.    A few days later, police officials checked the people at  that  company. It was suspected that this was an engineering company  that was involved in sending Thai laborers to work in Libya. The  police detained four officials at the Suppression Division and  seized a number of documents. [passage omitted]    On the morning of 14 October, Police Colonel Chumphon and a  team of officials raided a condominium located at 13/1  Nimmanmoen, Lane 12, Suthep Subdistrict, Chiang Mai City. The  offices of the W and M Company Ltd. were located there. When the  police rushed in so early in the morning, Mr. Wirot  Sakunmuthita, the owner of the company, looked very bewildered,  and the more than ten workers there all wondered what was  happening.    "What the hell is going on," said Mr. Wirot looking at the  police officials. Focusing on Chumphon Manmai, who had entered  the office ahead of the other police officials, he asked, "Do  you have a search warrant?"    "We have both a search warrant and a warrant for your  arrest," said Police Col. Chumphon, taking out the warrants for  him to see. Mr. Wirot's attitude softened, and he tried to ask  what was going on. He asked why the police wanted to search his  company. When informed that officials believe that this company  is sending workers to work abroad without authorization, Mr.  Wirot angrily said that "this is clearly a political matter."    But even though Mr. Wirot made a scene, the police began  searching the offices, which were filled with modern equipment.  They were particularly interested in the ten computers and  computer disks. Wirot just stood there complaining, saying that  "the United States probably put pressure on you to do this."    In the end, the Suppression Division officials seized three  computer disks and a number of documents concerning the  operations of this company. After that, the police escorted Mr.  Wirot to his house at 65/7 Sirorot Road, Lane 1, Suthep  Subdistrict, and found 158 disks containing information on  sending laborers from the north to work in Libya. They also  found receipts and expenditures journals.    The police charged Mr. Wirot with hiring Thai laborers and  sending them to work abroad without authorization. Mr. Wirot  admitted that he was the owner of the W and M Company Ltd., and  said that he was the engineer who had designed that tunnel in  Libya.    Libya awarded the contract to build this tunnel to the  M.N.C.  Company Ltd. Construction got underway two years ago. It is  thought that construction will be completed within another year.  This tunnel is about 17 meters wide and about 110 meters long.  Wirot was paid 25 million baht to draw up the plans and oversee  the construction. The Libyan government has invested  approximately 700-800 million baht in building this tunnel.    And they plan to build several more tunnels!    Mr. Wirot denied knowing anything about this. And he said  that he isn't interested in what Libya plans to do with the  tunnels once they are completed. He said that he doesn't know if  they will use them as air raid shelters or sites for nuclear and  chemical weapons plants. But Wirot has to fly to Libya about  twice a month.    A report from an intelligence unit stated that the situation  concerning the construction of chemical and nuclear weapons  production plants in Libya is expanding, particularly in Lotta  and Banghazi, which are located about 10 hours away from  Tripoli, the capital. Those plants are located in valleys with  an area of more than 1,000 rai and in underground tunnels. There  are at least nine such plants.    Most of the chemicals are sent directly from Germany. It's  said that if these chemicals come in contact with the air, they  will immediately burst into flames. If applied to steel, this  chemical can quickly melt the steel. They now have about 120  tanks of this chemical, with each tank weighing 40 tons. Because  of its great concern about this, the United States is closely  monitoring the construction of these tunnels in Libya.    Police officials are very suspicious about the role played  by  Mr. Wirot. They wonder who he is exactly and how he managed to  gain a monopoly on the construction of these tunnels.    Another question that the police must answer concerns the  relationship between the engineer who drew up the plans, that  is, Wirot, and a Thai engineer who studied in Germany and who is  an expert on chemicals. The police wonder how important he is in  the construction of these tunnels.    The United States has charged that these tunnels are being  modified so that they can serve as plants for producing nuclear  and chemical weapons, mankind's most destructive weapons.</p>

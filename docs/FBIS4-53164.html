			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Helen Meredith] </F>   [Text] The Australian subsidiary of Japanese company NEC  will supply satellite earth stations for the Defence  Department's Jindalee Operational Radar Network [JORN] as part  of a $4 million contract.    The deal involves four new earth stations to be constructed  at JORN transmitter-receiver sites in Queensland and Western  Australia and the JORN Co-ordination Centre in Adelaide.    As well, NEC will help expand existing earth stations at  other Defence Department facilities to improve communications.    The new stations will be used to carry signals between JORN  sites, via a transponder leased by the Defence Department on one  of the Optus B-series satellites.    NEC will be required to integrate the new facilities with  the  management system for the overall Defence Satellite Network  under the terms of the contract.    Overall control of the network will rest with the Commander  Defence Communications Group in Canberra through the Satellite  Facilities Control Centre in Melbourne.    Known as the JORNSATCOM contract, the work carried out by  NEC  is essentially a turn-key project and will be carried out by a  local team skilled in such work.    NEC Australia's managing director, Mr Ben Okamoto,  commenting  on the use of commercial communications equipment by the Defence  Department, said the JORN project represented another step  forward in this process.    The Director General Joint Project Management in Defence  Material, Brigadier Neil Horn, said Defence had a strong  commitment to the electronics industry in Australia.    "The contract with NEC exemplifies the positive benefits of  having resident high-technology companies," he said.</p>

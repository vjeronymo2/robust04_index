			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / VW aims to double its market share THE Volkswagen group, the largest European carmaker, is developing plans to more than double the share of the VW and Audi makes in the UK market for new cars by the late 1990s. VW acquired VAG United Kingdom, the distributor of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles in Britain, from Lonrho in December for Pounds 124m. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman of the VW volume car division, outlined aggressive plans for the development of the two makes in the UK, which has been one of the German carmaker's weaker markets in Europe. He said that the VW brand would be aiming to gain a share of 7 per cent to 9 per cent by 1996-97, compared with a share last year of only 4.1 per cent. The Audi make would aim for 4 per cent to 5 per cent of UK new car sales compared with only 1.2 per cent in 1992. Volkswagen faces a predicted sharp fall in sales in Germany, its most important market, in the next two years and the UK is one of the few markets expected to grow this year, albeit from a very low level. Competition is set to intensify in the UK market as the three Japanese carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda, build up production in Britain. Volkswagen's ambitions will pose a serious challenge to the established UK market leaders Ford, Vauxhall (General Motors) and Rover. Mr Goeudevert said: 'There is no reason why we should not reach in the UK the average level we have in the rest of Europe.' Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of west European new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent in the UK. VW working practices, Page 21</p>

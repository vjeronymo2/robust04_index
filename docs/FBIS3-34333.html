Speaking about the details of these exercises in an  interview  with our correspondent in Islamabad, Commodore Shamkhani said:    [Begin Shamkhani recording] As you know, as an extension of  our own joint domestic exercises -- by the naval forces of the  IRGC and the navy -- we felt it necessary to carry out joint  exercises with some of our neighboring countries. Toward this  aim, we will have our first joint exercises with another country  since the victory of the revolution in the form of joint naval  exercises with Pakistan. These exercises will take place in the  high seas and with the participation of the warships of Iran and  Pakistan. Four warships will take part from Iran, and the  exercises will last four days. The planning, training, and  preparatory stages of these exercises have been completed, and  the exercises themselves will take place in the near future, God  willing. [end recording]</p>

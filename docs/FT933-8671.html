			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Major backs Swedish bid Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, yesterday gave political impetus to Sweden's bid to join the European Community by saying that the target accession date of January 1 1995 was 'realistic,' reports Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. His words, at the end of a three-day visit to Sweden, will have been welcomed by his Swedish counterpart, Mr Carl Bildt, following suggestions that EC membership negotiations involving Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria are falling behind schedule.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Sharp rise in US trade gap threatens tension with Japan FEARS of increased trade tension between the US and Japan rose yesterday after an unexpectedly sharp rise in the US trade deficit to Dollars 10.2bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in March, the biggest shortfall for nearly four years. More than half the deficit was with Japan. The overall deficit was up nearly 30 per cent from the shortfall of Dollars 7.9bn in February, mainly reflecting a surge in imports. The deterioration is likely to prompt a sharp downward revision of growth in the first quarter to an annual rate of 1.0 per cent to 1.5 per cent, compared with an initial estimate of 1.8 per cent. The bilateral deficit with Japan rose to Dollars 5.3bn before seasonal adjustment. The next-largest imbalance was a Dollars 1.5bn deficit with China. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the poor figures showed the importance of pursuing 'expanded markets for our exports on all fronts'. The US would press for 'prompt fiscal stimulus in Japan, market-driven exchange rate corrections, and negotiations that remove the structural barriers to improved trade between our nations.' On Tuesday, Mr Lawrence Summers, Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, urged Japan to do more to stimulate its economy. The trade figures were the latest in a series of economic setbacks for the Clinton administration. Reports last week of a jump in consumer and wholesale prices rekindled fears of higher inflation. Speculation this week that the Federal Reserve might soon begin to tighten monetary policy sent long bond yields back above 7 per cent. Imports rose 9.7 per cent between February and March to Dollars 49.2bn, a record in cash terms. For the first three months, imports were 11 per cent higher than in the same period last year. As consumer demand was weaker than expected in the first quarter, many of the imports were stockpiled by companies. Mr Brown said that indicated import growth would probably decelerate in the current quarter. But the underlying trends are not encouraging. Exports did better than expected in March, rising 5.6 per cent to Dollars 39bn. But in the first quarter exports rose only 2.4 per cent relative to the same period last year. Most analysts expect the trade deficit to widen this year, reflecting faster growth in the US than elsewhere. In last month's budget, the trade deficit was projected to rise to Dollars 110bn-Dollars 140bn next fiscal year, against Dollars 84bn in calendar 1992. Mr Brown's remarks prompted speculation that the US was again seeking to curb the deficit by talking the yen up against the dollar. By close of trading in New York the dollar had fallen to Y110.6 from the previous day's close of Y111.47.</p>

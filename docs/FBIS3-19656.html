But the Moscovites themselves are also fighting  against a strange phenomenon these days: There is not only the  familiar ruble hyperinflation, but also soaring dollar prices.  This means that there is much more money than goods, and that  the Russian economic reform has only liberated one part of the  market: demand, but not supply. Supply is still governed by  the old monopolies, and even non-Marxists know that monopolies  always lower output, not prices.    Boris Yeltsin's fate will be decided in this field, and not  even the most considerate Westerner can help him there, neither  with money, nor with words. Only the Russians themselves can  impose a functioning market economy on their country; but to do  this they would need a "strong efficient state machinery, which  no longer exists," says political scientist Andrej Kortunov.  But: (Mainly self-made) obstacles are also piling up for  Yeltsin in his relations with the West: Russian interests are  meanwhile being defined more comprehensive, "the tone has become  harsher," says Vladimir Lukov, an adviser to Foreign Minister  Kozyrev. What are the Russian interests?    This question was dealt with at a symposium held in Moscow  by  the Friedrich-Naumann and the Konrad-Adenauer Foundations. The  deputy minister for federal affairs said that the Russians have  never learned how to conduct realpolitik; like the Germans, they  have a rather "metaphysical" approach. For him, the definition  is quite simple: economic solutions. He wants fair export  prices for fuel and gas and a continuing presence in the arms  markets: "Messianism and expansion are over." Even in the  Balkans, Russia is "conservative," what counts there is the  "balance of power."    Kozyrev adviser Kusnetsov said much the same thing: The old  imperialism is out; he is not interested in Pan-Slavism and  state interests, but in the "rights and interests of the  citizens." This is the real revolution that has happened since  1991. If only it were as simple as that. Igor Artjonov, head  of the National Patriotic Party, on the other hand said: "The  Russian Federation is not the last stage. The future lies with  an Eastern Slav Alliance with Belarus and Ukraine."    "Reintegration of neighboring countries," has meanwhile  become the magic formula; and even for Alexeiy Pushkov, deputy  chief of the liberal Moscow News, this includes Kazakhstan  beside Kiev and Minsk, and "nobody will be able to prevent  Moscow from reintegrating them." The Russians simply cannot  accept that their country is no longer a superpower. May the  Baltic states remain outside? There, Kozyrev adviser Lukov says,  the only issue is the protection of the Russian minority. Yet:  "We are now taking a harder line with Estonia and Latvia."    Sergei Rogov from the U.S. Institute found bitter, sarcastic  words for the new policy: "The Kozyrevs are becoming more  radical than the Zhirinovskiys, and what is behind this is not  strategy but sheer opportunism." Yeltsin has spoiled the  economic reform and lost the confidence placed in him. Now the  only thing he wants is to remain in power, and to achieve this,  Yeltsin would collaborate with anybody. At the moment, the army  is his main support, which saved him during the coup. And now  he has to prove to the generals that he "is not selling [Russia  off] to the Zionist-Imperialist world conspiracy."    This belief has just been proved: While Yeltsin is at the  Black Sea, Defense Minister Grachev is standing in for him in  Moscow. Yet, the biggest danger are not the ultrarightists, but  "the Zhirinovskiy within Yeltsin." What the West can do? "Not  much, except for massive investments in the private sector.  Russia must be saved in Russia."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Question and answer session during a joint news conference </F> by President Leonid Kravchuk and U.S. President Bill Clinton  with domestic and foreign correspondents at the Borispol airport  near Kiev -- live; Clinton speaks in English with  passage-by-passage translation into Ukrainian; processed from  the English]    [Excerpts] [Kravchuk] Mr. President, I will allow myself to  play the role of press secretary. I give the floor--an  opportunity to ask a question--to our guests, to journalists  from the United States of America.    [Correspondent, in English] (?Walt Lister) of CNN. What  exactly must your parliament now do to ratify this agreement,  and exactly how long will it take for Ukraine to become a  non-nuclear nation?    [Kravchuk] Philosophers say everything is changing in this  world. Life is changing. One cannot even step twice in the  same place in a river. This is why our parliament, as life goes  on, is becoming wiser. Our parliament, as life goes on, sees  the realities. I am convinced that it will understand the  essence of the great problem that is facing the world today, the  essence of our relations. With the mutual desire of the three  states--the United States of America, Ukraine, and Russia--we  will fulfill our obligations, and the parliament will support us.    Now, a question from the Ukrainian side, please. [passage  omitted]    [Kravchuk] On the American side, please. A lady there.    [Correspondent, in English] Thank you, and happy birthday,  President Kravchuk! [passage omitted]    [Kravchuk] Thank you for your congratulations, and I would  like to express my satisfaction with the gentlemanliness of our  correspondent here, who mentioned Mrs. Clinton. Of course, I  would be glad if she were here, and we all could see her.    Now, again I give an opportunity to a lady. Maybe I will  receive yet another greeting from her.    [Correspondent] I echo the previous greeting, and I would  like to ask this question: There is a shortage at times of  those who are supposed to fulfill programs. In other words,  they are unwilling to go to Ukraine because of the uncertain  situation there. Where are the guarantees that the agreements  that were achieved today will be implemented?    [Kravchuk] If I were to answer this question, I would say  that the guarantees are here in Ukraine. We will receive the  attitude that we deserve according to the results of our work.  Abstract guarantees do not exist.    [Clinton] If I might add just one point: Sometimes in  discussions with nations, some actual guarantees do not  materialize because they are dependent on decisions made by  other parties--usually the World Bank or the International  Monetary Fund. In this case, every part of our agreement  depends only upon the three presidents and their governments to  keep their word. And I told-- the first thing I said  to--President Kravchuk tonight is that I would do everything I  could to make sure that all three of us did exactly what was in  the agreement, and I am confident that we will.    [Kravchuk] I have the greatest responsibility. I feel it as  a press secretary--that there is a protocol. However, this is  the last question, and I must allow you to ask it.    [Correspondent, in English] Mr. President. Mr. President  Clinton. You mentioned the PFP--the Partnership for Peace--and  there are some people who say that Russia has been using a type  of passive imperialism in order to keep countries of Eastern  Europe and Central Europe out of NATO for the time being by  threatening destabilization. Do you agree with that? And I  would be very interested in what President Kravchuk has to say.    [Clinton] No, I don't. I think.... [interrupted by  interpreter who translates question into Ukrainian] The short  answer to the question is that I do not agree with that,  although President Yeltsin himself has expressed reservations  about NATO membership for other countries if Russia is excluded.  He, you know, he has expressed an interest in being a member  himself. The leaders of NATO concluded that they should not  offer membership at this time to any country because they  weren't sure any country was ready to assume the  responsibilities of membership and because they did not want to  exclude anyone else. [passage omitted]    [Kravchuk] Mr. Clinton came to my help, and I give the right  to the Ukrainian side to ask one more question.    [Correspondent] Which security guarantees will be provided  by the United States and Russia to Ukraine after it acquires a  non-nuclear status? [passage omitted]    [Kravchuk] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen. I would like to  use yet another opportunity to say that we will compensate for  our brief meeting with additional meetings, where we will begin  to fulfill our obligations. You will contribute to this with  unbiased coverage of the events in Ukraine and Ukraine's role in  Europe and in the world. It would be best now to wish President  Clinton a good journey. Good-bye.

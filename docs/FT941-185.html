			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Hurd walks Euro tightrope The Conservatives will campaign for the European elections on a platform which stresses both the importance of the European parliament and the party's commitment to national sovereignty, it emerged yesterday. In a letter to all Conservative MPs and MEPs, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, urged the party to raise its sights from the debacle over enlargement of the European Union. Mr Hurd, the Conservative campaign manager for the election, distributed a six-page statement of election themes, approved by Mr John Major, the prime minister. The document sets out to bridge the deep divisions between the party's federalist wing, which is strongest among MEPs, and the rebellious minority of Euro-sceptics at Westminster. Party strategists believe the document is sufficiently broadly based to quell murmurs of revolt from both wings that have threatened to destabilise the Tory campaign. However, senior ministers remain fearful that the Conservatives will perform badly in the June 9 elections. A full-scale manifesto is expected to be published after local government elections on May 5. Mr Hurd told the MPs and MEPs in his letter: 'A contrast has to be made clear between our vision of a decentralised, free-trading Europe built on the nation states, and the centralised, interventionist, bureaucratic superstate after which Labour and the Liberal Democrats hanker. I believe we can unite behind an approach of this kind,' he said. 'We have the opportunity over the next few years, in particular at the intergovernmental conference of 1996, to shape a European Union in which we can feel comfortable. Our job now is to get that across.' The campaign document answers complaints from MEPs that the campaign for the last election in 1989 was too negative by acknowledging that the European parliament has 'powers and influence'. It accuses the parliament's socialist majority of obstructing the European single market, and claims that Labour MEPs are committed to creating 'a socialist superstate'. However, the guide aims to please Euro-sceptics by drawing a clear distinction between Westminster and the Union. It says the European parliament 'is not a sovereign parliament like ours in Britain'. It also emphasises Conservative opposition to the transfer of further powers from London to the Union, and stresses British support for subsidiarity - the principle of minimum interference in national affairs. 'The nation state is here to stay. That has been the clear message of British Conservative governments,' the guide says. 'We don't want a Europe which interferes in every detail of national life. Conservatives are opposed to the creation of a federal European state.' The document appeals to the party to 'set out the case for a more flexible, decentralised Europe which respects national feeling and the nation state'.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / National Audit Office qualifies Department of Health accounts THE National Audit Office has qualified the accounts of the Department of Health over payments to health authorities. The main reason is the failure of the National Health Service management executive to staunch losses at the troubled South Birmingham health authority, John Willman writes. The authority inherited losses of Pounds 10.5m when it was created in 1991 but there will be an accumulated deficit of Pounds 25m by April next year. The authority's finances have continued to deteriorate, according to the watchdog, in spite of a Pounds 16m package of support and close monitoring by the West Midlands regional health authority. In addition, the watchdog has qualified the accounts over an unauthorised payment of Pounds 78,000 made by Wessex regional health authority to a former director of information on leaving office. The health authority is considering whether it can recover part or all of the money.</p>

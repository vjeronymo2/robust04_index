			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Rail boss who may bury the hatchet: Bob Horton says he is still a hard man. But, as he tells Charles Batchelor, he is not a Beeching Observers may be wondering if Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, has gone native. His appointment to the state-owned company set up to manage British Rail's track, signalling and stations after privatisation was confirmation to many that privatisation meant dismemberment and decline. But Mr Horton, who left British Petroleum two years ago with the reputation of being 'Horton the Hatchet', enthuses: 'We have this absolutely priceless national asset which we have jolly well got to make good use of. What we are witnessing is not a little short of miraculous. An industry which is 150 years old is being made fit for the 21st century.' Mr Horton is in charge of only one part of a railway which will soon comprise 60 independent companies. But as the monopoly supplier of track and signalling, Railtrack has an important part to play. The approach adopted by Mr Horton and Mr John Edmonds, chief executive of Railtrack and a lifelong railwayman, will play an important part in determining rail's future. Mr Horton is adamant that he has not changed, but he does not see his role as that of Dr Beeching, who slashed rail services in the 1960s. Mr Horton said: 'It would be difficult to imagine why I would want to take on this job unless I was 'native' already. Twelve months ago people said I was mad, but I felt this was a job which really had to be done. But I made no secret about my management style, and there may be a few bruised feelings around the place.' He is keen to be tough on inefficiency and waste within the organisation so as to be kind to customers and the level of train services. 'In three years' time we will have a railway operating more reliably, more efficiently and providing more capacity.' One of the first tasks of Railtrack was to calculate the true cost of running a railway service. Under BR, the train operating companies had not been charged the full cost of replacing track and signalling. Railtrack's calculations led to a doubling of charges and to howls of protest from BR managers, many of whom hope to stage buy-outs over the next two to three years. Mr Horton said he was prepared to fine-tune his charges, but argued that the principle of identifying the true cost of all activities is a sound one. 'For the first time we have transparency rather than the fudge and cross-subsidy which used to take place.' Replacing BR's internal procedures with contracts negotiated between independent companies should also improve efficiency. He said BR's internal arrangements had the virtue of simplicity, but sometimes led to cosy relationships which were not necessarily the most efficient. 'It is mind-boggling that nearly Pounds 2bn of annual procurement could have existed without contractual relations being established.' The main attack on costs will be on the annual maintenance bill for the 10,000 miles of track, 90,000 bridges and 2,500 stations for which Railtrack is responsible. But Mr Horton believes Railtrack can also make savings by managing its own affairs better. It has recruited specialists from outside the industry to improve its record of project management. It has Pounds 500m to spend on 5,000 improvement schemes this year. But making an impact on a network which has suffered from decades of neglect will take time. A backlog of track maintenance means speed restrictions are common while many stations are in need of urgent repair. Mr Horton said that going live on April 1 meant Railtrack could start to address these problems instead of sitting through endless meetings with civil servants. 'But the problems ahead are at least as great as those we have overcome. It will be a long and stony road.'</p>

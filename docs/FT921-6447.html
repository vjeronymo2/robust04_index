			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Bitter battle at the Carnival - Rival Brazilian brewers' plans to get ahead When a thousand drummers start beating out the samba rhythm on Sunday, opening Rio's Carnival parade, there will be more at stake than the usual struggle for supremacy between samba schools in choreography, costume and song. This year's Carnival has become the glitter-clad battleground for a marketing war between Brazil's two largest beer producers. Brazil's 6bn litre annual beer market is hotly contested by two companies - Antarctica and Brahma - each of which claims to produce the best-selling brand. Brahma, Brazil's largest brewer, is currently ahead with 35.4 per cent of the market for its main seller, Brahma Chopp, but Antarctica's Blue Label is hot on its heels with 33 per cent. Both companies are gearing up to take advantage of the five days of extravaganza in which economic woes are forgotten, men dress up as women and women wear very little indeed. Brahma was the first to spot the potential of Carnival. One of its factories lies alongside the Sambadrome where the official parades take place. When the stadium was built in 1984, the company was given one of the best boxes in exchange for part of its land. Last year its marketing director decided to exploit this, inviting personalities and ensuring that the box - and of course the brand name  - was the focus of attention of the television cameras beaming the scene live to 40m viewers. 'Carnival means happiness and parties, when everyone forgets recession and misery and has a good time. That's what we want our beer to be associated with,' explains Inga Ostrovsky, Brahma's marketing director. But the idea proved such a success that Antarctica is copying it. Nizan Guanaes from the company's advertising agency says: 'We've gone for the Japanese philosophy - copy it and improve it'. He heads a team hard at work in a flat in Ipanema, plotting how best to capitalise on the five days in which the whole of Brazil lets its hair down. Over the next two weeks the two companies will spend nearly Dollars 1m (Pounds 575,000) sponsoring rival samba schools, street bands and Carnival balls. They have also rented boxes in the Sambadrome to which they have invited international stars to watch the 50,000 people parading. Brazil's beer industry had traditionally kept a fairly low profile attracting little investment until a year ago. Then, after a takeover by Banco Garantia, Brahma announced investment plans to increase production to 4.3bn litres a year by 1993 and launched an aggressive marketing campaign. Brahma is now one of Brazil's biggest spenders on advertising with an annual budget of Dollars 25m, recruiting leading singer-songwriter Tom Jobim and splashing its slogan 'Number One Beer' across buses, billboards and magazines. Not to be outdone, Antarctica is increasing production by 48 per cent this year and has upped its advertising spending to Dollars 25m, running a campaign under the slogan 'Antarctica, the Best and the First and there is nothing more to be said'. The battle hotted up last October when the government freed beer prices after years of controls. Sales fell 10 per cent last month because of recession and both companies have fixed their sights on Carnival to boost their market-share. Each has an eye, too, on the international potential and are hoping tourists visiting Rio will remember the beer they drank when they return to their homes. This year, for the two days of parades, Brahma's 'Number One' box will play host to 350 politicians, film stars and leading society figures. Little more than 200 metres away, Antarctica's boxes will offer a night-long banquet followed by breakfast, with sleeping areas available for those who cannot take the pace. While Brahma is reticent about the names of its VIPs (though dropping rumours of the presence of Kevin Costner and Richard Gere), Antarctica confirms it will be playing host to singer Liza Minelli, film-Canadian model Linda Evangelista. However, hopes that this will draw the television cameras have been foiled. The two leading channels have agreed not to show the brand names and they plan to give plain white T-shirts to anyone they interview. Both brewers feel they have already had value for money. Brahma is spending Dollars 300,000 and Antarctica Dollars 500,000 and Guanaes says: 'The idea was to create an event the whole city is talking about and we've certainly done that even before Carnival'. Ostrovsky agrees: 'It's not really a war - it's a show like everything else in Carnival and one that we're both capitalising on'.</p>

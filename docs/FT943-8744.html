			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Balaguer poised for new term as tensions rise Mr Joaquin Balaguer will be sworn in today for a seventh term as president of the Dominican Republic amid political confusion and rising tension. This follows the failure of legislators on Sunday to approve an agreement between the government and opposition to end a three-month political crisis in the Caribbean nation by having a new election next year. In a surprising concession to foreign and domestic critics who have persistently claimed that he has retained office through a tainted election three months ago, Mr Balaguer had agreed to a new election in mid-November next year. This was accepted by Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, the loser in the controversial election, who cancelled a series of strikes and street protests planned for this week. However, the pact between Mr Balaguer's conservative Social Christian Reform Party and the social democrat Dominican Revolutionary Party of Mr Pena Gomez was scuttled on Sunday when the National Assembly voted to hold the new election in May 1996. Deputies from the Revolutionary party walked out in disgust leaving the Reform Party to approve the delay. Mr Balaguer, aged 87, blind and crippled, at least appears ready to envisage an end to his political career, as the assembly approved an amendment preventing a president from having consecutive terms. Tensions in the country heightened when the elections board, after being silent for eight weeks, announced a fortnight ago that Mr Balaguer had defeated Mr Pena Gomez in the May 16 election by just over 22,000 votes, less than 1 per cent of the electorate. Mr Pena Gomez, who would have been the country's first black president if forecasts by pre-election polls had materialised, was unwilling to accept the result offered by the elections board, which is funded and controlled by the government. The opposition leader and foreign observers of the election had concurred that about 200,000 Dominicans who should have ben eligible to do so, could not vote, and that most of these appeared to be Mr Pena Gomez' supporters. Mr Balaguer's promise of an early election was clearly intended to mollify not only Mr Pena Gomez, but also the US. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, called for new elections because the allegations of fraud were widespread enough to have affected the outcome. It is not the first time that the ruling Reform Party has been accused of less than honest methods in helping Mr Balaguer to a slim victory, but foreign interest in the recent election has been high because Dominican political developments will influence the situation in Haiti. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola. Mr Balaguer has long opposed international efforts to secure the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, who was overthrown and exiled three years ago. Mr Pena Gomez is more inclined towards supporting efforts to pressure Haiti's military leaders into leaving, allowing Mr Aristide to return.</p>

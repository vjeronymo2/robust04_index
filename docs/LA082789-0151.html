			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSALS TO HIKE GASOLINE AND SALES TAXES  </P> <P> It is no surprise that California's transportation system is failing to meet  our needs. Like our life's blood, state highways transport our food, fuel and  wastes. If our blood system fails, the body dies. California's economic  lifeline may also be fatally stricken unless our state's transit system is  resuscitated quickly.  </P> <P> A cure for this potentially deadly illness is at hand. An increase in the gas  tax proposed by the governor, legislators, consumer groups and businesses will  be on the ballot in the June, 1990, election. Revenues from a "user fee" of  five cents the first year and one additional cent per year over the next four  years will provide an $18.5-billion shot in the arm for transportation. The  money will be solely devoted to transportation needs, including construction,  maintenance and mass transit such as light rail, ride sharing and additional  freeway carpool lanes.  </P> <P> One of the most ambitious points of the plan is the requirement of local  governments to develop growth plans to address specific transportation issues.  Further, the legislation decreases bureaucratic red tape to reduce delays and  cost hikes, keeping projects on time and within budget.  </P> <P> If voters pass the measure next June, specific construction plans are scheduled  to begin immediately. In Orange County, Interstate 5 will be modified in  several areas to ease the commuter gridlock. Traffic lanes will be expanded on  portions of the Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and Garden Grove freeways. Reconstruction  will begin for the interchange at the Santa Ana and Costa Mesa freeways and  also for an interchange on the proposed extension of the Corona del Mar freeway  at the I-5. In addition, future plans include a commitment to widen and  complete the right of way on the Santa Ana Freeway near Santa Ana and acquire  right of way for the widening and creation of an interchange on the Santa Ana  Freeway near the Orange and Garden Grove freeways. An area of Highway 74  (Ortega) will be expanded. Lanes will also be added to portions of the Laguna  and Riverside freeways .  </P> <P> Over the next 20 years, the state's population will jump to 36.3 million. The  number of vehicles will rise to 31.1 million. That's 7.5 million more people  and nearly 9 million more automobiles. Without immediate adoption of this  comprehensive plan, our urgent transit needs will remain unmet and our  already-clogged arteries will come to an abrupt halt.  </P> <P> WILLIAM CAMPBELL  </P> <P> State senator, 31st District  </P> <P> El Toro  </P></p>

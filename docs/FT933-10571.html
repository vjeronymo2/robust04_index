			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tight cotton stocks may boost prices WORLD COTTON prices should rise moderately during 1993-94 and 1994-95 because of tight stocks outside China, according to the International Cotton Advisory Committee. It said the Cotlook A Index could rise from an average of 58 cents a lb during the current season to 65 cents in 1993-94 and 70 cents two seasons from now. The committee, which groups 44 cotton producing and consuming countries, said stocks outside China were equal to the 1989-90 low of 38 per cent of use. It added that estimates of 1993-94 world production had tightened in recent months. Production estimates for India and central Asia were reduced to a combined 240,000 tonnes during July. Estimated production in China for 1993-94 was 4.4m tonnes, a drop of 350,000 since June. 'Expectations of lower cotton area in China have been buttressed by government estimates, while reports of pest infestations and low morale among cotton farmers have prompted downward revisions in yields,' the ICAC said.</p>

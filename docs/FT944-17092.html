			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (2): Hotel discount boom may be ending - International occupancy rates seem to be rising The international travel business has been hard hit in the last few years. The 180 members of Iata, the Inter- national Air Transport Assoc- iation, collectively lost Dollars 4bn in 1993 - making a cumulative loss of Dollars 15bn for the years 1990-93. It has been a tough time for airlines, and conse- quently a tough time for hoteliers, too. However, business travellers have been able to pick up some bargain prices, as the rack rate - the officially published rate charged by hotels - has rarely matched the achieved rate - the rate actually obtained by the hotel from the guest. Everyone's cloud is someone else's silver lining, and nowhere is that more true than in the recent doldrums blighting the hotel industry. Hotel occupancy rates throughout Europe have on average been hovering around the mid to low 60 per cent mark, at least until this year. The consequence for business - and other - travellers has been considerable scope for hard bargaining on price. Hoteliers everywhere responded to the drop in demand by focusing on keeping their occupancy levels as high as possible. The motto was: build volume first, tackle prices later. Thus, more and deeper concessionary rates have been available in all business hotels situated in the world's key cities. So much so, that travellers have perhaps grown accustomed to thinking that reduced rates are here to stay. But things are changing, quite patchily at the moment, but at a speed which might catch some travellers on the hop. According to Mr Andrew Duncan, a director with hotel and leisure consultants Pan- nell Kerr Forster Associates, the market last year began to improve, albeit in fits and starts. Thus, while in 1993 the average occupancy rate in European hotels was 62.8 per cent - 0.5 percentage points lower than in 1992 - London's business hotels achieved 74 per cent, their best performance for several years. Against that relative improvement in London, in continental Europe as a whole, the room revenue yield per available room in 1993 was DM130.88, a fall of 9 per cent on 1992's figures. In some cities, such as Vienna, where a relative over-supply of hotel rooms is set to continue into 1995, bargains are obviously still to be had. Yet the broad picture suggests that the good times - for travellers at least  -are probably over. Mr Michael Ball, marketing and sales director of Utell International, the world's largest hotel reservations company, dealing with 6,500 hotels across 147 countries, says: 'That period of turmoil, of mismatch between supply and demand, is coming to an end. 'Two years ago there was heavy discounting in the hotel business. You could walk into virtually any hotel and it would have rooms to sell. But occupancies everywhere have risen significantly in this year compared with last. 'The Farnborough Air Show used to be considered a bit of a test of the UK market. For the last few years, hotels have not filled during the show - this year they did.' In the UK, the recovery is particularly strong in London where at the moment average occupancy rates are around 90 per cent, against the low 60s in 1992 and 1993. With such rates, hotels can afford to be sniffy about discounting, and refuse even to consider such a request from an individual traveller who walks in off the street. Yet so battle-scarred is the hotel industry that few people are prepared to say that the worst is over; the last three years have, in Mr Ball's words, 'been so horrendous for the hotel business' that it is premature to say the current recovery is permanent. 'All that can be said with confidence right now is that hotels in the UK, the US and Asia have seen their average occupancy levels rise this year. And when demand increases, prices firm up, as with any other business. 'Furthermore, there are internationally no black spots on the horizon. Everyone is now doing their budgeting, with a view that 1995 is going to be a good year. Hoteliers are saying to themselves that, now occupancy rates are stronger, they need to pay attention to closing the gap between achieved and published rates for a room. There is the nub of the whole argument,' says Mr Ball. The clearest indication that the discount boom is ending is that Utell's achieved rate went up in September for the first time in a couple of years. Analysts argue it is still far too early in the recovery cycle for rack rates - published rates - to be increased, but special or distress sale rates are probably already a thing of the past. Preferred, or negotiated, corporate rates are likely to firm up or even rise in the course of 1995, according to Mr Ball. That is the bad news for the tight-budget traveller. The good news is that if they are prepared to try, most trav- ellers, even individuals, can now get a corporate rate - ie, some reduction on the rack, or published price - throughout Europe and the US, in city centre hotels. And negotiated rates, where hotels give signif- icant reductions in return for promised volume bookings by a large agent or corporation, are of course still a key part of this business. However, even that depends on your destination. In Asia, where many countries have either avoided the recession altogether or been cushioned from its worst effects, the prob- lem is frequently not so much obtaining a discount as getting a room. In some parts of Asia 'negotiated rates are now being withdrawn from the mar- ket - corporate rates are as good a reduction as you can expect,' says Mr Ball. drawn from this highly fragmented market, now poised for probable recovery but jittery that another Gulf war or similar major international upheaval might erupt? The days of the daft discount are probably over for the foreseeable future. The negotiated rate is under threat in those economies currently booming in Asia and some parts of Latin America, such as Argentina. The corporate rate survives, healthily in Europe and the US, precariously in some parts of Asia. And if there is another year or two of such relative tranquillity, then rack rates are bound to nudge upwards.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Consensus near on abortion draft European and US delegates said last night they hoped to clinch by today an effective consensus on one of the most controversial passages on abortion in the draft document of the International Conference on Population and Development, despite sustained Vatican opposition. Approval of the section, which urges governments to 'deal openly and forthrightly with unsafe abortion as a major public health concern' would be a victory for western and other participants at the conference, determined to win the broadest possible consensus behind its final document. Many such representatives also believe the religious row over abortion which has dominated the meeting threatened to obscure the thrust of the document, which aims to provide a broad-based global programme for population stabilisation into the next century. Mr Tony Baldry, British foreign office minister, said 'very considerable progress is being made', on the text, adding that he believed the controversial language would win approval during last night's session. EU delegates said a version of the text already contained in the draft, and which states that 'in no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning' was winning 'broad consensus'. Both Mr Baldry and Mr Timothy Wirth, US assistant undersecretary for global affairs, said progress had also been made in talks with Islamic and Roman Catholic countries in agreeing on language which had been interpreted as condoning homosexuality and advocating adol-escent and extra-marital sex. Passage of the contentious abortion text would, however, be only the first round in what most delegates believe will be tough negotiations in the next few days. The Vatican yesterday issued a statement in which it repeated its absolute objection to abortion, saying that while it recognised many women suffered 'difficulties' in pregnancies, 'such difficulties do not warrant the violation to the right to life'. The Holy See 'cannot give explicit or implicit support to those parts of the document regarding abortion,' the statement said. Vatican delegates were yesterday busy on the floor of the main committee room rallying opposition to the text. 'They were yanking out Catholic delegates and getting them in a corner - there was a lot of strong-arm tactics,' said one African delegate.</p>

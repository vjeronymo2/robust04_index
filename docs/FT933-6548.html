			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Bosnian peace plan awaits final Moslem verdict THE FUTURE of the peace plan for Bosnia today hangs in the balance as the three ethnic assemblies vote on a proposal to divide their republic. The Bosnian parliament was seen as holding the crucial vote, because Serb and Croat assemblies were likely to back the plan after endorsement by their leaders. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, has already said he could not support the proposal, which leaves the mostly Moslem republic with disjointed landlocked territory. Bosnia's Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders are due to return to Geneva next week to deliver the verdicts of their parliaments. Deputies to the Serb assembly yesterday met behind closed doors in Pale, their mountain stronghold outside Sarajevo, amid reports of complaints that Serb leaders had given too many concessions to their rivals. The proposed map, put forward last week by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, international mediators, in an attempt to end the 17-month war, gives Serbs about 54 per cent of territory, Croats 17 per cent, and Moslems some 28 per cent. In a move to consolidate his control over the Yugoslav army, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic yesterday sacked 42 generals, including chief of staff General Zivota Panic. He will be replaced by Gen Momcilo Perisic, age 49, who was promoted to that rank during the Croatian war. He drew widespread criticism from western diplomats in April 1992 for ordering intense bombardment of the south-western town of Mostar, now consumed by Croat-Moslem clashes. The European Community yesterday said it would study how it could help administer Mostar provided Bosnia's warring parties accept a Geneva peace deal. The carefully worded statement, issued through the Belgian presidency, avoided any final commitment to the idea announced by Lord Owen last week that the EC should take charge of administering Mostar for two years. In New York, it was announced last night that Mr Stoltenberg, the UN special envoy, and Gen Jean Cot, UN force commander, had ordered an investigation into allegations of 'improper conduct' by UN troops and civilian personnel in former Yugoslavia. This was focusing on Sarajevo where some UN soldiers and civilians are alleged to have trafficked in drugs and engaged in black marketeering and a prostitution racket.</p>

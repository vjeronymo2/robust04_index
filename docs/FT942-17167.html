			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Sao Paulo cashes in on privatisation hopes - Brazil's industrial heart needs to fund an 8% budget deficit Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial powerhouse, is rushing to raise funds on local and international capital markets. The move has been sparked by the drying-up of traditional state revenues combined with election-fuelled spending plans. Without giving up control of public companies, the state government is selling equity stakes and cashing in on international interest in sectors regarded as privatisation candidates, such as electricity and telecommunications. The money is for current spending and infrastructure projects. The projects include roads, an extension of the city's tube line, which is also receiving World Bank and Interamerican Development Bank money, and 100,000 new homes. Traditionally, state spending increases in election years and, according to bankers and analysts, Sao Paulo's money raising is aimed at keeping the centrist Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) in power at elections in October. The state government denies this, arguing it is coincidence that most of the offerings are this year. Since last November the state, facing a deficit of 8 per cent on its Dollars 18bn budget, has raised Dollars 515m from equity sales, including Dollars 300m from a private placement of non-voting American depositary receipts (ADRs) in its electricity generator Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo (Cesp) in February. Locally, sales of equity in Cesp and its distribution subsidiary have raised Dollars 215m. The government expects another four debt or equity issues in other companies to raise about Dollars 700m. These include a planned equity-linked Eurobond issue offering a stake in Telesp, the state telecom company, similar to that made in January by the state of Minas Gerais, which offered equity warrants in its electricity company Cemig. The other issues are of debenture and shares in the state sanitation company, an initial public offering in its gas company and debentures in the state bank's leasing firm. Mr Eduardo Saad, managing director in Sao Paulo of Merrill Lynch and co-ordinator for the ADR placement, believes more states will attempt similar operations. However, international issues will be limited because only a handful of states have large enough companies to interest foreign investors. Furthermore, equity-linked bond issues are complex and overseas investors suspicious about taking on state debt, according to Mr Saad. 'A lot of states have financial problems with the federal government. They would probably not pass the test of the bond market,' he says. The financial problems date from Brazil's economic crisis in the 1980s, when many states ran up huge debts and used state banks to bail them out. The crisis has worsened in recent years and last year governors were told they could no longer borrow from their state banks. Sao Paulo has also been hit by shrinking sales tax revenues, traditionally its main revenue source, following a 'tax war' between states to attract industry. The state's total debt is about Dollars 22bn. Despite these problems, it remains the industrial heartland of Brazil, accounting for more than half the country's industrial production and with a gross domestic product of Dollars 189bn in 1992. Mr Eduardo Maia, state finance secretary, says the equity offerings are part of a new philosophy. 'We are preparing the ground for the privatisation of the electricity industry and other sectors, and for a new, slimmer state that will target spending on social programmes.' He believes the proposed Eurobond issue, for Dollars 200m- Dollars 300m, will succeed because it will be sweetened by options to buy stock in Telesp, the largest subsidiary of the government- controlled telecommunications giant Telebras. However, Mr Alvaro Simoes, a director of Banque Indosuez's Brazilian operations, which led the Minas Gerais-Cemig issue, believes the Sao Paulo-Telesp operation will take at least six months to put together. Although the Minas Gerais issue was regarded as sovereign risk, most foreign investors were confused about the relationship between the state and the federal government and concerned about financial health of the state, says Mr Simoes. He adds that investors were reassured by the competence of state officials and that the Minas Gerais budget has balanced for the past three years. But investor caution and market conditions, along with a recent move by the central bank to slow down Eurobond issues, may pose difficulties for the Sao Paulo issue. Some bankers believe Sao Paulo will find it harder to win over foreign investors due to its financial problems. A former adviser to the state bank says: 'Although Telesp is an attractive company, Sao Paulo will probably face more problems than Minas Gerais because of its financial image.'</p>

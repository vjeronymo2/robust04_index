			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Challenge to the ancient charters - In a Nutshell Market charters dating back several centuries are being used by some local authorities to prevent the creation of retail centres which provide premises for small independent shops. The ancient charters, which give exclusive rights to street market traders, prevent anyone else establishing 'a concourse of traders', according to Tim Brookes, chairman of the publicly-quoted In Shops group. In Shops operates more than 60 serviced retail centres which provide space for small shops on one to three year licences and avoid the need for retailers to sign up for conventional 25-year leases. It unsuccessfully challenged one council in the English courts and is now considering whether European Community statutes might provide redress.</p>

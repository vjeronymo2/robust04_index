			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> WATER-RATIONING PLAN IS ADOPTED  </P> <P> The Thousand Oaks City Council has unanimously adopted an emergency  water-rationing plan that would force residents and businesses to cut back by  up to 20% in the event of a continued drought.  </P> <P> The measure would only be instituted if the Metropolitan Water District, which  provides state water in the eastern part of Ventura County, decides that  drought conditions warrant rationing, said Don Nelson, city utilities director.  </P> <P> Officials say they expect 70% to 80% of the 12,800 customers in the city to  comply with the rationing order. The city has recorded a 600-million gallon  drop in projected water consumption since voluntary water rationing was imposed  in May, Nelson said.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks' plan calls for rationing to be imposed in three phases. The  first phase would be imposed if there is a 10% shortage in the state's water  supplies. Residents would be warned to cut back on watering lawns and washing  cars or face civil and criminal penalties.  </P> <P> Shortages of 10% to 20% would involve more serious measures. Customers would  have to reduce consumption by 10% or face penalties on their water bills.  Penalties are calculated at $2 for every unit, or about 750 gallons, of water  used.  </P> <P> A family that used 25 units of water each month would have to cut back by 2.5  units, or see a $5 penalty in its water bill.  </P> <P> If the city's water shortage exceeds 20%, customers would have to cut back by  20%. Excessive users could be forced to install flow-restricting devices on  their faucets or face having their water shut off. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

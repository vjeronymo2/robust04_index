			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHICK CENTERS SEEKING A FINANCIAL CURE;  </P> <P> ADDICTIONS: PATRICK J. FRAWLEY JR.'S HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING DESPITE THE BOOM  IN DRUG- AND ALCOHOL-TREATMENT SERVICES.  </P> <P> Patrick J. Frawley Jr. has had a diverse career. He started in the  import-export business, ran a company that makes ballpoint pens, chaired the  Schick Safety Razor Co. and another concern that makes movie prints. He is also  a wealthy man and recently sold one of his Holmby Hills estates to television  producer Aaron Spelling.  </P> <P> But for the last 20 years, Frawley, 65, now chairman and president of Frawley  Corp. in Studio City, has had a one-track mind. He wants to cure the nation's  alcoholics, drug addicts and smokers of their habits, and he thinks his  company's Schick hospitals and clinics are the places to do it.  </P> <P> "My entire focus is on the hospitals because it's a life-and-death matter,"  said Frawley, who ought to know: He is a reformed alcoholic and he believes  addictions can be cured through negative reinforcement.  </P> <P> Drug and alcohol treatment would seem to be booming these days, with movie  stars and athletes coming out of the closet with their substance-abuse problems  and because of the nationwide charge started by former First Lady Nancy Reagan  to "just say no" to drugs. Indeed, the number of drug and alcohol programs in  the United States increased from 5,747 in 1982 to 6,866 in 1987, according to  the National Assn. of Addiction Treatment Providers, an Irvine-based trade  group.  </P> <P> "It's big business now," said Alan Haveson, spokesman for the National Council  on Alcoholism, a New York-based research and education group that estimates  about $15 billion a year is spent on chemical dependency treatments.  </P> <P> But Frawley's three Schick Shadel hospitals and three smaller Schick clinics in  California, Washington and Texas -- which originally adopted their names from  the Schick razor company and have been around since before former First Lady  Betty Ford even admitted she was an alcoholic, much less started her own clinic  -- are in need of some therapy themselves.  </P> <P> In the nine months that ended Sept. 30, Frawley lost $1.2 million on revenue of  $21 million, and its stock, which is listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange, has  slipped from a 1988 high of $8.50 a share to $6.50. The number of patients  admitted to Schick fell 18% in the last year, to about 2,000, and company  officials admit a return to profitability isn't right around the corner.  </P> <P> That is partly because of the growing competition, but Frawley said the company  has been hurt even more by recent cutbacks in insurance coverage for chemical  dependency treatment.  </P> <P> Employers and insurance companies are increasingly favoring outpatient care  over inpatient programs, which often are more than twice as expensive. That's  bad news for Schick's drug and alcohol programs, which require patients to stay  for about two weeks and which cost $12,000 or more.  </P> <P> "What they're doing is trying to save dollars, not do what's best for the  patient," said David Batt, Frawley's vice president, treasurer and secretary.  </P> <P> But Robert Waldron, spokesman for the Health Insurance Assn. of America, a  Washington-based trade group, said insurers are justified in emphasizing  outpatient treatment, because recent studies show that outpatient programs are  as effective as inpatient programs for most addicts.  </P> <P> Frawley isn't the only company in the industry that's suffering. Comprehensive  Care Corp. of Irvine, the nation's largest alcohol and drug treatment concern,  has been losing money; its stock has plunged, and it's trying to stave off  creditors who want payment of $25 million in overdue loans.  </P> <P> Frawley, who refused to have his photograph taken for this article, will talk  of little else but his method of treating addictions.  </P> <P> When a visitor asked him recently about plans for the company, he launched into  a discourse about Kitty Dukakis, the wife of former presidential candidate  Michael Dukakis, and her much-publicized substance abuse. Frawley maintained  that Kitty Dukakis could be cured by the Schick method.  </P> <P> This method uses negative reinforcement to teach the subconscious mind to  dislike the addictive drug -- sort of a twist on Pavlov's dogs. Patients are  confronted with the substances they are addicted to, while small electric  shocks and drugs that induce nausea are administered.  </P> <P> This technique is markedly different from the abstinence, counseling and "talk  therapy" favored by Alcoholics Anonymous and well-known detoxification centers,  such as the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage and Hazelden in Minneapolis.  </P> <P> But Max A. Schneider, medical director of family recovery services at St.  Joseph's Hospital in Orange, said there is no single treatment that works for  all people. "Most of us feel there is a place for aversion therapy," he said.  "Our problem is in appropriate selection of patients."  </P> <P> P. Joseph Frawley, Patrick's son and a doctor who runs the Schick Shadel  Hospital in Santa Barbara, admitted that the Schick method isn't foolproof. One  year after treatment, 65% of the patients treated at Schick for alcohol  dependency, 52% of the smokers and 51% of the cocaine addicts remain free of  their habits. Still, he said, those results compare favorably with many other  drug programs.  </P> <P> Frawley's departure into drug treatment capped a long and varied career. He  started in the import-export business in San Francisco more than 40 years ago.  When a loan he made to a company that made ballpoint pen parts wasn't paid  back, he took over the business, which became the Papermate Pen Co.  </P> <P> Frawley sold Papermate to Gillette in 1955 for $15.5 million, which back then  was a considerable fortune. In 1958, he became chairman and chief executive of  Schick Safety Razor Co., where he stayed until 1970. From 1961 to 1970, he was  also chairman of Technicolor, a North Hollywood company that makes film prints  and videotapes.  </P> <P> While he was at the Schick razor company, Frawley earned a reputation for  tempestuousness. Frawley "was a temperamental individualist whose erratic  traits were magnified by a drinking problem," wrote Russell Adams in his book  "King C. Gillette, the Man and His Wonderful Shaving Device."  </P> <P> It was during his tenure at Schick that Frawley realized he was an alcoholic  and sought treatment at Shadel Hospital in Seattle. He was so impressed with  the program that he bought the hospital.  </P> <P> In 1970, Frawley sold the Schick razor blade business to Warner-Lambert, but  kept the hospital, which he had renamed Schick Shadel. "I couldn't keep my mind  on it so I sold it," he said of the razor business. "People were dying. What  would you do?"  </P></p>

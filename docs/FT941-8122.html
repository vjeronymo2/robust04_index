			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz in Swatch car venture talks Daimler-Benz, the German engineering group which owns Mercedes, will discuss today a possible joint venture with SMH, Swiss maker of the Swatch watch, to develop a small, economical car. Mr Roland Klein, Daimler-Benz spokesman, confirmed yesterday that a possible collaboration between the two companies was on the agenda as the company's board meets for its usual Tuesday meeting. But he warned that no final decision was yet in sight. The 'Swatchmobile' project has been promoted by Mr Nicolas Hayek, SMH chairman, for several years. Volkswagen was involved, but withdrew in January last year. Volkswagen said then it was under pressure to cut costs and wanted to avoid the heavy invest-ment associated with the project. Speculation that Daimler-Benz would build the long-awaited Swatch car has recently increased after Mr Helmut Werner, the chairman of Mercedes, said last week in Frankfurt that his company may team up with Swatch. SMH has been talking with various carmakers for about a year. The new two-seater, environmentally-friendly small car would be a welcome addition to the Mercedes range in the face of increased competition in what is deemed an increasingly important strategic market segment. German rival carmaker Volkswagen recently announced that its Audi subsidiary would build a small car starting in 1996. And BMW is taking control of the British car producer Rover, which manufactures similar cars. 'Nothing has been decided,' a spokeswoman for Swatch said, adding that the group would be making no announcement today. Mr Hayek said recently he expected to name a partner this year.</p>

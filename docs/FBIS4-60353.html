			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amirah Huwaydi: "Clampdown on Alexandria Islamic </F> Society"]    [Text] A decision by the governor of Alexandria to dissolve  the board of directors of a religious society for what was  officially described as financial malpractice triggered clashes  last week between security forces and members of the society and  their sympathisers in the working class Alexandria neighbourhood  of Al-Wardiyan. An undetermined number of people were injured  and others arrested.    A source at the Alexandria state security department put the  number of those arrested at 20. But 'Adil 'Id, a lawyer and  member of the Alexandria branch of the Egyptian Organisation for  Human Rights [EOHR], said as many as 338 people had been  detained.    The trouble began when Nahid Hafiz Abu-al-'Azm, a  representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs, went to the  society's head office, accompanied by a number of policemen, on  8 May to enforce the governor's decision.    According to eyewitness Yusri 'Abbas, a butcher who lives  and  works in the neighbourhood, members of the society and their  families as well as hundreds of sympathisers reacted by staging  a sit-in inside the building which they locked from the inside.  "Sheikhs shouted anti-government slogans through loudspeakers  and urged the people of the district to challenge the police,"  he said. By that time, the number of police had swelled to  hundreds.    Another eyewitness, Ahmad Qasim, said the protesters hurled  stones and bottles of acid at police who responded with tear gas  and used batons. The violence continued for two days.    According to 'Adil 'Id of the EOHR, 138 persons were  remanded  in custody for 15 days on charges of staging an illegal  gathering, resisting the police and damaging property. Some of  them are members of the society and the Islamist-leaning Labour  Party while others are members of the Physicians Syndicate and  the local municipal council. Moreover, 'Id said, about 200  persons were detained under state of emergency powers, and no  specific charges were levelled against them.    The security source said the governor's decision to dissolve  the board of al-I'tisam bi Habl Allah society was triggered by  administrative and financial irregularities. The Arabic name of  the society is derived from a Quranic verse and may be  translated as "holding fast to the rope which God stretched out  for the faithful."    The governor's decision means that "board members will have  to be replaced by others through democratic elections," the  source said. "It does not mean that the role of the society must  come to an end."    The society is located in a four storey white building atop  the Abu-'Umar Mosque. In addition to running the mosque itself,  the society also extends medical and educational services to the  poor inhabitants of the neighbourhood.    Dr Ibrahim al-Za'farani, chairman of the human rights  committee of the Physicians Syndicate, said the board of the  society was not the first to be dissolved. Others which faced  the same fate were al-Rida', Huda al-Islam, al-Ikhlas and  al-Tawhid. "All were Islamic-oriented and all were in  Alexandria, and the reasons for dissolving them were not  legitimate," he said.    Al-Za'farani said that instead of shutting down these  societies, the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) should  compete with them in extending services to the public. "And the  NDP is capable of offering much more than these nongovernmental  societies," he said.</p>

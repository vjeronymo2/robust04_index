			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 16 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Indonesia hopes  that an international conference on East Timor scheduled to be  organized in Manila later this month will not go through because  its aims do not accord with the Philippine Government's  understanding of the East Timor problem, Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas said here Monday.    Alatas made the statement at a press conference following a  meeting with Philippine President Fidel Ramos' special envoy,  Raul Manglapus, who had come to Jakarta to explain Manila's  position towards the privately sponsored conference.    "We still believe there is a way to solve the issue," Alatas  said.    He said although the Philippine Government's commitment to  its national constitution and freedom of speech was  understandable, Indonesia was disappointed that the conference  would still take place.    He said in Indonesia's view the planned conference was not  an  academic exercise nor an event to promote democracy. Neither  would it be discussing human rights in the Asia-Pacific region  in general as its organizers had at the beginning claimed.    "It is certainly a political campaign against Indonesia," he  stressed.    "The name of the conference is Asia-Pacific Conference on  East Timor. How could they (the organizers) say that it will  deal with human rights or democratization in the region," he  said.    Alatas said Indonesia was suspecting that Ramos Horta,  Cecillia Jimenez, and Renato Constantino -- diehard opponents to  East Timor's integration with Indonesia -- were behind the  planned conference.    "Claiming to be representing some obscure non-governmental  organizations, they are trying to make the East Timor issue an  Asia- Pacific concern," he said.    Alatas warned that both Indonesia's and the Philippines'  national interests would be affected if the conference went on  as scheduled by its sponsors.    Previously, Raul Manglapus had said it was difficult for the  Philippine Government to prevent the conference from being held.    "The conference is scheduled to be held in one of the  universities in Manila. Some universities in my country have a  certain autonomy and that's why it is difficult for us to  prevent them from staging any academic event," he added.    He said the Philippine Government fully supported  Indonesia's  effort to protect its territorial integrity.    "Moreover, we have long-standing bilateral ties and live in  the spirit of ASEAN," he said.    He said the Philippine Government was determined to take any  step necessary to prevent the conference from causing any damage  to its ties with Indonesia.    When asked whether or not he would visit Indonesia again if  his government failed to prevent the holding of the conference,  Manglapus said: "It depends on how angry your country is."    "But I am hopeful that after this meeting there will be  understanding on both sides. And, at least, the Philippine  Government will do its best to prevent any damage (to the ties  between the two countries)," said the former Philippines foreign  minister.</p>

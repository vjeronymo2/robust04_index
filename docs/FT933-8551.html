			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: When the penny drops . . . SOME YEARS ago, I bought a number of ordinary shares. Due to a takeover and the recession, these have now degenerated into 'penny shares.' No dividends have been paid for some years and they are virtually worthless and not marketable, although they continue to be quoted in the financial press. Some time in the not too distant future, it is my intention to sell another shareholding which is showing substantial gains. I want to offset the cost of the loss-making shares against the anticipated capital gain. 1. Is it possible to dispose of the now-penny shares by returning the relevant certificates to the company registrar and asking him to cancel the registration? 2. Would it be acceptable to give away the shares to a charity or an individual by returning the certificates to the company registrar and informing him of the change of ownership? 1. No. 2. Charity: No, you would be deemed to have sold them to the charity at their indexed cost, broadly speaking, by virtue of section 257 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Individual: Provided that the person is not a connected person* as defined in section 286 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, you should be able to establish an allowable loss by executing a share transfer form in his or her favour (remembering to complete the stamp duty exemption certificate on the back) and sending it to the registrar, with the certificates. Share transfer forms are obtainable from most business stationers. You might like to ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares) and CGT16 (Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988). The pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction) could also be helpful. *The term 'connected person' includes your husband, your parents and parents-in-law, your siblings and siblings-in-law, children and children-in-law, and your grandchildren and grandchildren-in-law. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

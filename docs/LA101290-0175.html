			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> DRIVER SHOT TO DEATH ON FREEWAY  </P> <P> A motorist was killed by an accidental shot fired by a companion on the  Foothill Freeway today less than an hour after another couple's car was  peppered with gunfire in an attack on the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> The slain 19-year-old from Pomona at first was thought to have been killed in a  random freeway shooting, as reported by his five Vietnamese companions, who had  said they were asleep at the time of the 3:50 a.m. incident.  </P> <P> But sheriffs said evidence later showed that the fatal bullet was fired through  the rear of the driver's seat. The gun was not found.  </P> <P> In the other incident, Theresa Rodriguez and her husband, Alex, were fired on  about 3 a.m. by a passenger in one of two cars racing on the Ventura Freeway in  Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Theresa Rodriguez was driving north when one of the two cars, each containing  two men, pulled in front of her car and suddenly slowed. One car then pulled  alongside the couple's car, and its driver began yelling obscenities at the  woman. As she attempted to drive off the freeway, the car's passenger fired  gunshots at her auto. Neither of the Rodriguezes was hit.  </P></p>

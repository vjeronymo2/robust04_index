			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN AS NUMBER ONE...AND PULLING AWAY;  </P> <P> THE END OF THE AMERICAN CENTURY BY STEVEN SCHLOSSTEIN (CONGDON &amp; WEED:  $22.95; 537 PP.; 0-86553-201-0)  </P> <P> Steven Schlosstein doesn't necessarily want a trade war with Japan, but he  would settle for a cold war. "From now into the next century," he writes, "the  ideological challenge to America will not be Communism . . . but a softer brand  of authoritarianism from Japan . . . called turbocharged capitalism."  </P> <P> He belongs neither to Richard Gephardt's school of losing through Japan-bashing  (in 1988, at least) nor to the cadre of Japan-won't-change revisionists who  oppose punishing our rivals for beating us fair and square. He does believe  that the powerful, strategically directed, "goal-oriented" economies of Asia --  not only Japan but Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore -- could relegate the United  States to the condition of a geopolitical and economic backwater in the next  century.  </P> <P> Avoiding this outcome, in his view, will require rigorous economic, political,  educational and cultural reforms. A Sputnik-like scare, such as a recession,  might also be needed to rouse the American people to the new international  dangers they face even as the author of the old ones, the Soviet empire,  finally implodes.  </P> <P> The litany of national ills that Schlosstein recites, while increasingly  familiar since Ezra F. Vogel kicked off the "Japan Is Number One" 11 years ago,  is troubling indeed. Our eighth-graders score 12th in mathematics out of 14  industrial nations. Our non-military Research and Development runs well behind  Japan's, and our neglected manufacturing sector is lagging badly as well. Our  "fiscally irresponsible Congress," paralyzed by the legal corruption of  special-interest politics, is unable or unwilling to adopt measures to reduce  the deficit, boost savings and provide the kind of incentives to strategic  industries that the Japanese and Koreans do.  </P> <P> Three-quarters of the education money we spend per student goes to entrenched  bureaucrats rather than teachers. Meanwhile, American business has to spend $30  billion a year on teaching high school graduates to read, write and add well  enough to go to work.  </P> <P> We have "the highest divorce rate in the industrialized world . . . (and) the  largest ratio of single parents to traditional two-parent families," and our  children are suffering greatly for it. Yes, the Reagan boom is booming away,  but one of Schlosstein's Japanese authorities sums that up nicely: "Individual  prosperity, national misery."  </P> <P> Those most concerned with immediate social ills such as homelessness, ozone  depletion and drug abuse will find little to inspire them here. Implicit in  Schlosstein's analysis is that we will no longer be able to address such  problems at all if we lose the capacity to create and preserve wealth.  </P> <P> So how do we halt the ravages of our great-power malaise (what the Japanese  call "the English disease")? He lays down brisk, confident prescriptions, as if  writing editorials in the Economist, but there's not much about how to get from  here to there. He concedes sotto voce that "we cannot emulate the Japanese; we  must find our own flexible solutions to these problems." But this  Japanese-educated writer and consultant finds so much to admire in the vibrant  capitals of Japan and the Pacific's "Little Dragons" that one wonders whether  in his heart of hearts he believes America is irredeemably wedded to its  sloppy, self-indulgent ways.  </P> <P> In the epilogue, basically an executive summary of the book, he waxes eloquent  about America as "the most precious experiment in human history." And yet when  he looks into our national petri dish he finds a disturbing amount of mold  around the edges. For instance, he thinks the morally illegitimate American  habit of nonchalant divorce is so damaging to the welfare of our children,  those oft-heralded leaders of the future, that he wants to boost income-tax  exemptions to keep Daddy at home and hit him with a penalty if he insists on  leaving. Meanwhile, Mommy might lighten up on what one of the Bush kids once  called "the Big A."  </P> <P> In one of the author's many "We shouldn't emulate them, but dig this" passages,  he reveals, "Asian cultures have a more tolerant view of sex. . . . Marital  expectations are lower and the frustrations fewer, but appropriately controlled  outlets are condoned and strictly monitored, from Turkish baths to love hotels.  And mistresses, an established practice in old Europe, are still a favored  tradition in Japan."  </P> <P> As for the kids themselves, his investigations took him to schools all over  Asia, and his heart went pitter-patter as the children of Singapore marched  around in single file in their crisp cotton skirts and white shorts ("not  shotgun-like, as one might expect of American youngsters") and the children of  Taipei and Tokyo merrily scrubbed down their classrooms.  </P> <P> No one who has stood in line behind a group of suburban American teen-agers at  McDonald's and eavesdropped upon their tribal dialogues can help but share the  author's concerns about the future custodians of Jefferson's covenant. Still,  there is a grudging, even troubling admiration in Schlosstein's passages about  Asian authoritarianism. He goes out of his way to excuse Lee Kwan Yew's limited  tolerance of freedom of the press in Singapore, for instance, and is as  supportive of Ferdinand Marcos' imposition of martial law in the Philippines in  1972 as many other commentators were then (though they'd be loath to admit it  now).  </P> <P> Lee is one of the great nation-builders of our time, and Marcos at his best  held out more hope to the Philippines than President Aquino's apparent  capitulation to the oligarchic status quo. And yet neither offers America many  applicable lessons, and America is the ostensible subject of Schlosstein's  inquiry. If he did not want us to think Asian models deserved to be studied and  even appropriated by the United States, one wonders why he devoted so much  space to them.  </P> <P> Just as none of our problems is of Asia's making, neither do Asian systems hold  the answers. Unlike Japan and the Little Dragons, we are a sprawling,  complicated, culturally and racially diverse nation whose principles of  equality, justice and free enterprise never will be and need not be sacrificed  at the altar of productivity.  </P> <P> The only valuable thing the Far East can probably give us is as many of its  people as it can spare. Already more than half our legal immigrants are Asian.  If I were President Bush I would resolve to admit 2 million Hong Kong Chinese  to the United States before 1997 -- when, Schlosstein believes, and diplomatic  developments since he finished his book have seemed to confirm -- Beijing will  smother the colony like a blanket.  </P> <P> The author notes that "all eleven of New York's Westinghouse science finalists  in 1988 were Asian-American. . . ." The operative word in that compound is  "American," and therein must lie the solution to many of the problems he sets  out so forcefully -- not so much in the importation of Asians, which sounds  crass and mechanical, but the capacity for this nation to renew and redirect  itself to address new challenges.  </P> <P> The postwar boom that made America the world's most powerful and prosperous  nation is over, and to sustain both our position and our values we must rise to  the economic challenge being posed by our single-minded competitors in Asia.  Those of us who have grown fat on America's postwar orgy of consumption might  get back to fighting trim when confronted by a new wave of enthusiastic, highly  skilled immigrants.  </P> <P> Schlosstein does not sit in his office and collate statistics; he travels  widely and speaks to a broad array of authorities wherever he goes. What would  otherwise be a dry book benefits greatly from his digressions and descriptions  (although perhaps even George Will himself would recoil from the suggestion  that he has a "patentable, boyish grin."  </P> <P> He writes well, although in tackling everything from NATO to day care he makes  a number of the generalist's small errors. For instance, Deng Xiaoping was many  things but never premier of China; the United States was driven out of Vietnam  in 1975, not 1974, and the "Soviets" didn't lose to the Japanese navy in 1905  since Russians weren't Soviets until 1917.  </P> <P> What Schlosstein knows all too well is our great new adversary. He includes a  chilling account of a dinner he attended where some Mitsubishi executives burst  into Imperial Japanese Navy marching songs. He even raises the specter of a  newly militarized and even nuclearized Japan that might use its power against  us.  </P> <P> Unlike many, however, he does not counsel fear, resentment or punitive  sanctions; just discipline, so our economic health is not forever hostage to  Japanese capital, and healthy competition. Indeed, how we handle our new  adversary might well dictate the fortunes of our old one. Mikhail Gorbachev  looks like a dove in Europe but a hawk in Asia, where he has been conducting a  mighty military buildup even as he courts Japanese technology.  </P> <P> U.S. protectionism could well plunge what is now the favored policy of a  minority in Tokyo -- a turn toward Moscow for investment opportunities,  resources, and new markets -- into the political mainstream. Gorbachev would  like a neutral Germany, but he'd love a neutral Japan. If the protectionists  get their way, he might get his.  </P></p>

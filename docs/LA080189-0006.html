			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. STRATEGY FOR NUCLEAR RESPONSE  </P> <P> A few items of interest from Part I of Sunday morning's (July 23) paper:  </P> <P> 1. Tony Aliengena completes his Friendship Flight. His father praised the  "tremendous reception" the group received in the Soviet Union and George Bush  wants a copy of the Friendship Scroll signed by thousands of children during  the trip.  </P> <P> 2. Thousands of U.S. sailors and American citizens board three Soviet warships  at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia to "exchange gifts, smiles and handshakes"  and "foster good will."  </P> <P> 3. The Bush Administration is quietly revising the U.S. strategy for fighting a  nuclear war to include the "creation of new weapons so devastating they could  penetrate the deepest underground bunkers and 'decapitate' the entire Soviet  leadership."  </P> <P> Thanks, guys. I'm going back to bed.  </P> <P> SUSAN MENNING  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

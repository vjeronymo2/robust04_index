			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has  declared that it is irresponsible of the coalition groups to  allow the Assembly to go into recess despite the difficult  conditions currently facing the country.    At a news conference in parliament today, Yilmaz charged  that  Turkey is experiencing the most severe economic crisis since the  establishment of the republic, the number of workers dismissed  from work is increasing, and inflation has reached 140 percent  in five months. [passage omitted]    In addition to the economic crisis, Yilmaz noted, we are  also  experiencing a judicial crisis. He remarked that the decision  of the judiciary is not being implemented despite a binding  constitutional article on the subject.    [Begin Yilmaz recording] It has become clear that through  the constitutional amendments, the government actually wants to  ensure the continued membership of DEP [Democracy Party]  deputies in the Assembly by changing Article 84, and to prevent  any possibility of by-elections. The prime minister, who  boasted of having ousted the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  from the Assembly during the local elections -- referring to DEP  deputies -- and who said that DEP deputies are the shadow of the  PKK in the Assembly, is now trying to amend the Constitution in  order to keep the DEP deputies in the Assembly. This, in turn,  is the work of a mentality unable to see even two months ahead,  the same mentality that prevails in the economic area. [end  recording]    Yilmaz pointed out that the government is allowing the  Assembly to go into recess while the interparty constitutional  committee decided to continue to work. The differences of views  with regard to Article 24 can easily be overcome, Yilmaz stated.  Explaining that ANAP is not responsible for the deadlock, Yilmaz  claimed that the deadlock was caused when the other coalition  partner changed its stand and used secularism as a life jacket  in politics. The ANAP leader said: As the Assembly is going  into recess, the issues included in the government's  democratization package have been suspended. Now, our nation  will carefully follow the next actions of the Social Democratic  Populist Party, which declared that it will leave the coalition  if the democratization package is not passed.</p>

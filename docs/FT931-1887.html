			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Pressure mounts for Rabin to halt violence AN ARAB stabbed and wounded six Israelis in a Jerusalem school playground yesterday and soldiers shot dead two Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Israelis demonstrated and threw stones after the stabbings, which put pressure on prime minister Yitzhak Rabin to stop a wave of bloodshed. Police stopped a crowd from lynching the attacker. Rabin cut short a US trip on Friday because of the violence. In the southern Gaza refugee camp of Rafah, soldiers shot dead 11-year-old Mohammad Jarbou, the ninth Palestinian killed by Israelis in the Strip in a week. UN officials said he was shot in the neck leaving school during sporadic stone-throwing protests. In the town of Khan Younis in the Strip, soldiers shot dead a muezzin, a Moslem who calls worshippers to prayer at the mosque, Palestinians said. Mr Rabin said Palestinians would get nothing from Israel through violence. 'I believe that in the long run a real solution to the problem is around the negotiation table,' he told reporters. He responded to criticism by right-wing opponents and ordinary Israelis of his handling of security by pledging on Sunday to increase the police force by 1,550 officers. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in ambushes and troops shot dead four Palestinians over the weekend.</p>

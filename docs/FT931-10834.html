			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Massey case an example to Hoover Sir, In October 1978, when there was a different UK government, Massey-Ferguson announced the closure of its Kilmarnock-based combine harvester factory, which then employed 1,509 people. The reason was, to quote Massey's president, Mr Victor Rice: 'We had little choice but to concentrate all combine manufacture in Europe at M-F's other plant in France.' As a result, this factory of almost 1m square feet was closed and all production was transferred to Marquette. I do not recollect any resistance from France to accepting this work at the expense of workers in the west of Scotland. The closure of this plant was handled most responsibly because the management went to the unprecedented length of paying for consultants to advise the unions on how best to make their case; so that the disagreements would be rationally based rather than emotional. Massey Ferguson also paid for an international search for replacement employment; I was privileged to lead this team and we had some success. The union leaders appreciated that it was essential for the labour force to be seen to be responsible and so not discourage potential new employers from the area. We had none of the flag waving processions seen on TV which tend only to satisfy the needs of the leaders and which do nothing towards attracting new employment. Now that the boot is on the other foot with Hoover, cannot the French unions and others accept the swings and roundabouts? After all, they are still well ahead on this basis.

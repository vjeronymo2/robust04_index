Mr Andrey Tatarinon of the Russian Embassy in Bangkok told a  seminar at Chulalongkorn University that Russia still maintains  a limited presence at Cam Ranh Bay, after withdrawing most of  its forces in 1992.    "Some limited presence still remains as a factor of  stability  in the region," he said in response to a question from guest  speaker Dr Michael Share of Hong Kong University.    Dr Share has been giving a series of lectures on the  collapse  of the Soviet Union, its implications to World Commumsm, and  Russian foreign policy in Southeast Asia which have been  organised by the university's Institute of Asian Studies.    "ASEAN does not talk about it (the limited Russian  presence),  and Vietnam doesn't insist on our total withdrawal," Mr Tatarmon  said.    He said the Russian military and Vietnam continued to  negotiate a lease of Cam Ranh Bay, which America had developed  during the Vietnam War.    However, the issue is not a priority in bilateral relations.    "There are bigger problems--Vietnam's debts (estimated US$8  billion) joint exploitation of petrochemicals and other things,"  he said.    The development of Cam Ranh Bay into an international  commercial port was first proposed by then Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the annual meeting of the foreign  ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  in Manila, in July. Russia was then invited as a guest of ASEAN.  "We are not necessarily rushing to leave Cam Ranh," he told  reporters.    Mr Kozyrev proposed the transformation of the facilities at  both Cam Ranh Bay and Subic--the naval base in the Phihppines  controlled by Cold War enemy, the U.S.--into logistics support  centres for naval activities.    "What is important is to transform this arrangement into one  that exudes the new strategy of stability and cooperation in  this region," Mr Kozyrev told reporters.    Mr Tatarinon added that the proposal may be taken up by  ASEAN  itself in the next few years.    Cam Ranh Bay is said to be one of the region's best natural  deep- sea ports.</p>

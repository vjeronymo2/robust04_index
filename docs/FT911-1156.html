			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Debt downgraded at Canadian group MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded CDollars 800m of Canadian Pacific's Ltd senior unsecured debt following last Monday's announcement by the big conglomerate of a first-quarter loss of CDollars 5.3m (USDollars 4.6m), or 2 cents a share, writes Robert Gibbens. The unsecured debt is held mainly in subsidiaries. CP Ltd's consolidated long-term debt was CDollars 4.4bn at the end of 1990. The downgrading is to single A-2 from single A-1. Moody's said that because of the long recession and the deep trough in the forest products industry, CP Ltd's recovery would take longer than expected and some interest coverage ratios would suffer. The recession has hit the transportation units heavily besides forest products.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Center seeks to identify those strategies that will be effective in preventing and/or reducing AOD-related violence among or affecting youth, ages 6 to 11 and 12 to 14. CSAP wishes to fund prevention programs that include strategies targeting risk/protective factors in the individual, family, school, peer group, neighborhood/community, and society.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because AOD-related violence is a highly complex problem, effective prevention of it requires a comprehensive, community-based approach. Community-based initiatives offer advantages over more individually-focused strategies by encouraging the various segments of the community to accept an active role in AOD prevention. Further, the community-based approach emphasizes that a wide range of environmental factors influence youth who become involved with AOD-related violence. Therefore, efforts predicated on this approach avoid the error of developing programs based on a conceptual framework that blames the victim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This demonstration grant program differs from its predecessor, the High Risk Youth Demonstration Grant Program, in two significant ways: (1) It encourages applicants to examine risk factors that are common to both AOD use/abuse and AOD-related violence, and (2) it asks applicants to involve all appropriate segments of the community in the prevention effort targeted to high risk youth. Applicants are expected already to have established a community coalition capable of addressing risk factors in multiple domains. Members of the community, including youth, should be involved in identifying relevant risk/protective factors and in designing interventions to address them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program Goals and Objectives: The overall goal of this program priority area is to demonstrate strategies that will: (1) prevent or reduce those factors that place youth aged 6&hyph;14 at risk for AOD-related violence, and (2) reduce the incidence and prevalence of AOD-related violent acts and of AOD use among the target population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To achieve these goals, CSAP encourages applicants to design projects that will positively influence the target population by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Increasing children's and youth's communication and other social and life skills, including conflict-handling skills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Promoting youth bonding/commitment to school, church, and/or community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Improving communication and other necessary skills among participants' parents to reduce the level of family conflict and domestic violence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Increasing school policies, procedures, and staff attitudes that promote school bonding/commitment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Linking children and youth with positive community role models. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Organizing media awareness and media advocacy initiatives to address inappropriate portrayal of AOD and violence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Target Population: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In keeping with CSAP's emphasis on primary prevention and early intervention, the target population for this program is youth. Children experience developmental challenges requiring them to master age-specific tasks; their particular needs and the approaches appropriate to meet those needs vary significantly from age to age. This program, therefore, divides the target population into two sub-populations: children and youth aged 6 to 11, and youth aged 12 to 14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within both sub-populations, youth may experience factors or conditions that increase their vulnerability to AOD use and to being witnesses, victims, or perpetrators of AOD-related violence. These risk factors can be organized according to six domains: The individual, family/significant others, school, peer group, neighborhood/community, and society. Youth who experience risk factors in multiple domains are considered to be at ``high risk.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (4): Havoc as crops fail - Jute The Indian jute industry, which is concentrated in West Bengal, is having a hard time because of the crop's failure in the 1993-94 season. Of the country's 73 jute mills, as many as 59 are located in this eastern state and they are finding it increasingly difficult to procure fibre, specially of the superior grades, to maintain normal production. Compared with last year, prices of raw jute have almost doubled. According to industry officials, many of the financially weak jute mills - they constitute the majority in the industry - will have to stop production as the season advances. In view of the short crop of 6.5m bales of 180kg each, against an annual average of 8.5m bales, the federal government has allowed free import of fibre in the current season. But little is coming from Bangladesh, as jute prices there are even higher than in India. In 1982-83 a short crop of 6m bales played havoc with the industry, leading to a loss of market for jute goods both within and outside the country. Now, officials say the government and non-government agencies concerned with jute must formulate a strategy to bring about stability in the production of fibre. Jute products are already priced higher than synthetic substitutes. Any further rise in prices would put the industry in a spot. Not only must there be a greater degree of stability in the production of raw jute, but there should also be a significant improvement in the quality of fibre. A report prepared under the UN Development Programme-assisted national jute development programme has warned that unless the share of the top three grades of fibre is raised from 7 per cent to about 20 per cent of the total crop by 1996-97, the mills will find it difficult to sustain their product diversification programme. Jute mills such as Champdany, Delta and Ludlow which have been steadily increasing the production of export quality yarn and non-traditional high value items including carpets, soil saving bags, decorative fabrics and wall hangings are in good health, while units exclusively engaged in the manufacture of traditional products such as sacking bags, hessian cloth and carpet-backing cloth are mostly in the red. According to Mr SS Kanoria, chairman of Ludlow, 'if the rest of the jute industry in West Bengal is to do better, then they should follow the example of the diversified mills,' which are modernising and upgrading their production facilities. The prices of value added items are 'anything between three and seven times those of traditional products.' It does not speak well of the industry that in spite of the need for diversification, the majority of the mills have been sticking to traditional products. The high value non-traditional products had a negligible share of 5.78 per cent of the total production of 1.23m tonnes of jute goods. However, nearly 70 per cent of the production of non-traditional items is exported. The UNDP-sponsored report says that 'the export market for value added products continues to be large and it is likely to grow sharply.' The production of such items can be raised to 300,000 tonnes by 1996-97, representing about 18 per cent of the industry's total production provided the mills make the necessary investment and change their marketing strategies, according to the report. Mr Sunil Jhunjhunwala, chairman of Delta, will not accept that jute is 'a sunset industry. The diversified products have given a new lease of life to quite a few mills. Of all the natural and synthetic fibres, jute is the cheapest and it blends well with the other fibres. Jute fibre has the strength and it also has a nice texture. In the future, many textile grade products will be developed out of blended jute yarn.' Mr Kanoria thinks that jute reinforced hardboard can replace timber. He is confident that the UNDP project to determine if jute yarn can be blended with cotton to make denim fabric will be a success. Jute, according to him, will find many new industrial applications. In the meantime, however, the federal government is no longer willing to give protection to jute in spite of the fact that more than 4m families are engaged in raw jute cultivation and over 200,000 people work in jute mills. The official order saying that cement and fertiliser factories should pack a certain percentage of their production in jute bags is still there, but it is not enforced. Mr Jhunjhunwala says: 'We must accept the fact that certain products like cement and fertiliser should ideally be packed in synthetic bags and not in jute bags. The time is not far away when sugar will also be packed in synthetic bags.' Synthetic bags, he admits, are cheaper than jute bags and 'do not allow seepage of materials. Market forces should decide whether a particular product should be packed in jute or in any other material.' With the gradual loss of segments of the domestic market, contraction in the size of the industry is inevitable. And no one expects a spectacular improvement in the export of traditional jute products. Except for a handful of units, the jute mills have postponed modernisation and product diversification for far too long. The Belfast-based Lumus Mackie has promised to make available a new range of high speed spinning and weaving machines. But before they invest in new machines and technology, the jute mills want an assurance from the West Bengal government that they will be allowed to 'rationalise the complement of workers and link wages to productivity'.</p>

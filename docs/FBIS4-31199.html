			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The 2 June 1994 issue of Bratislava  SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak contains a four-page supplement  entitled "HZDS" (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) and  subtitled "regular supplement of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia." On its front page, the supplement carries the  following introductory statement by Dusan Kleiman, head of the  HZDS Press and Information Section: "Esteemed readers. As of  today, we are beginning to publish in the daily SLOVENSKA  REPUBLIKA a regular HZDS supplement. In a situation when the  attitude of the majority of the mass media toward the HZDS is  more or less hostile, our possibilities of informing the public  are limited. Our aim is to at least partly fill the gap this has  created in the public. We want to brief you in some detail  about developments within the HZDS and put across to you the  HZDS positions on current developments in the sphere of  politics, the economy, culture, the social sphere, and so forth.  We hope to meet your expectations and to retain your favor."    The first issue of the supplement includes articles,  interviews, and commentaries expressing HZDS positions on  various recent developments (the motion of no-confidence in  Privatization Minister Janicina, the Presidential Office's  rejection of an HZDS-initiated referendum, the departure of  Deputy Marian Kelemen from the HZDS group in parliament, the  bill on conflicts of interest, the dismissal of district-office  chiefs following their criticism of President Kovac, and the  government's talks on the provision of an IMF loan).  Contributors include members of the "shadow cabinet," such as  former Deputy Prime Minister Sergej Kozlik, former Justice  Minister Katarina Tothova, and former Transport and  Communications Minister Roman Hofbauer.</p>

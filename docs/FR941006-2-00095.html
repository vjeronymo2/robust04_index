			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The acts and omissions of WIX's President and RSO violated NRC requirements over an extended period of time. These violations jeopardized the public health and safety and, on that basis alone, represent a very significant regulatory concern. These violations demonstrate that the Licensee and its President are not willing or able to comply with the Commission's requirements to protect the public health and safety. As a result, I am also issuing an Order (EA 94&hyph;140) this date to the President and RSO of WIX prohibiting him from engaging in NRC-licensed activities (except as necessary to store and tranfer material). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WIX's license has remained suspended since June 16, 1994. Several radiography exposure devices containing sealed radiation sources have remained in the Licensee's possession although the Licensee does not have authorization to use the material. Given the seriousness of the violations that occurred, and the NRC's order removing WIX's President and RSO, who is responsible for this material, I find that the public health, safety, and interest require the Licensee to transfer all NRC-regulated material in its possession and that License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 be revoked. Furthermore, in view of the nature of the violations and the deliberate misconduct described in both the June 16, 1994 Suspension Order (EA 93&hyph;238) and the Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-licensed activities (EA 94&hyph;140) issued this date to Mr. Wicks, the Commission does not have reasonable assurance that the material will be safety stored and transferred during the time that it might take to litigate this Order and the removal Order (EA 94&hyph;140). Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the violations and deliberate misconduct described in the June 16, 1994 Suspension Order (EA 93&hyph;238) and the Order (EA 94&hyph;140) to Mr. Wicks of this date, are such that the public health, safety, and interest require that the Order to Transfer Material part of this Order be immediately effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161c, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 34: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. It is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The licensee shall transfer all NRC-licensed material acquired or possessed under the authority of License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 within 20 days of the date of this Order, either by returning the material to the manufacturer or transferring it to another person authorized to possess that material; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Any sources that have not been leak tested within six months prior to the transfer shall be leak tested by a person authorized to do so, prior to transfer of the source; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Licensee shall notify Ms. Linda Kasner, NRC, Region IV, (817) 860&hyph;8213, by telephone at least two working days prior to the date(s) of transfer of radioactive material so that the NRC, may, if it elects, observe the transfer of the material; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The licensee shall, within 5 days after transfer of the material, certify in writing to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, that all material has been properly transferred and provide the Regional Administrator copies of records of transfer required by 10 CFR 30.51. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The issuance of this Order does not otherwise alter the continued effectiveness of the Suspension Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. It is further ordered that: Following confirmation of the transfer of all NRC-licensed material currently possessed, as discussed above, License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 is revoked. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, at any time prior to final agency action sustaining the revocation of License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01, relax or rescind this order on demonstration by the Licensee, in writing, of good cause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, the Licensee must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Debt would constrain graduates Sir, Your leader, 'College for All' (September 1), raises the spectre of UK students in higher education paying for both tuition and keep. I have always felt that one advantage enjoyed by UK graduates as compared with their US counterparts is that, as a general rule, UK graduates do not enter the job market with substantial debt obligations. This, in my opinion, allows them greater flexibility in the selection of their career as, in seeking employment, attaining a salary sufficient to service their debt obligation is not a factor. This has been one of the reasons why quality graduates have, to date, felt able to pursue socially important careers albeit they are poorly remunerated. I am also concerned that a move such as you suggest will have undesirable inflationary consequences and could lead to a structural change in entities such as the National Health Service where the government would need to increase salaries or waive debt to attract a qualified workforce. Robert Schon, 14 Dominion Street, London EC2M 2RJ</p>

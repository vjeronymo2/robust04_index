			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Oktay Eksi: "What Was Said To Mislead Us in </F> the Past?"]    [Text] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] will  convene to approve the government's motion for the extension of  the Hammer Force mandate in Turkey today. In view of the fact  that the matter is a topical issue, we have decided to focus on  "how and when the question of Hammer Force began and what was  said on the matter at the time." I discovered an interesting  report when I studied the documents, a report that has been  overlooked for one reason or another. It said that the Council  of Ministers has agreed that "Turkey should assign a contingent  of troops to the military force, which will be established  within the CSCE framework and based in Erzurum to prevent the  war between Armenia and Azerbaijan." That shows that the  Turkish Government has decided to open our country's door to a  multinational force before sending off the one that is already  based on our territory.    Let us recall a basic point: A foreign military unit in any  country will take away something from that country's  independence, honor, and esteem. That will not change even if  the presence of that military unit is called for by the host  country. The invitation a country extends to a foreign military  unit will automatically give it the right to express its opinion  on that country's affairs and problems and even interfere in its  activities. Therefore, what is important for a country is "not  to be in a position to have to call for the deployment of a  foreign military unit in its territory."    In view of that, it is difficult to understand why Turkish  officials have agreed to the deployment of a multinational force  in Turkey for one reason or another when the problem of the  Hammer Force has not yet been resolved. It is common knowledge  that the reason Hammer Force has been deployed in Turkey is  still vague. Furthermore, the activities and objectives of that  force are debatable.    Before we say anything else, we wish to ask the following:  What has happened that our Western allies have decided to take  action on the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan when they  failed to act against the violation of the UN Charter and the  CSCE principles in Bosnia and condoned the Armenian attacks  against Azerbaijan for a very long time? Is it a coincidence  that the two problems, which have prompted them to agree to  dispatch military units to Turkey, are linked to matters that  were upheld by the Sevres Agreement but rejected by the Lausanne  Agreement in the past? The plan to give part of Turkey's  territory to the State of Armenia was in line with the spirit of  the Sevres Agreement. That approach was rejected by the  Lausanne Agreement.    Let us return to the question of Hammer Force. It is common  knowledge that Hammer Force is former President Turgut Ozal's  legacy. He is the person who advised former President Bush on  the deployment of an international military force in Turkey to  prevent Saddam Husayn from oppressing the Kurds in northern  Iraq. Ozal is the person to be blamed for the problem that  military force has caused to Turkey. Furthermore, it is common  knowledge that Ozal advised the U.S. officials to put pressure  on the Turkish Government before the TGNA debated the extension  of the Hammer Force mandate. The newspapers reported that on 2  May 1992.    Preparations were made for the deployment of Hammer Force in  Turkey in July 1991. With a view to convincing the Turkish  public of the necessity of that force, the then Prime Minister  Mesut Yilmaz said: "A decision has been adopted to the effect  that Hammer Force should seek the approval of the Turkish  Government for a cross-border operation."    We wish to ask the following: Aside from Hammer Force  seeking the Turkish Government's approval for its cross-border  activities, has anyone heard or read a report that it has  informed Turkey on any one of its numerous operations in  northern Iraq so far?    Do you realize what that means? It means that there is no  way for Ankara to be aware of a move by Hammer Force which may  create a war between Turkey and Iraq. Do you realize the threat  behind that state of affairs?    Furthermore, it is common knowledge that a number of  officials stressed in the past that "Hammer Force can be  withdrawn from Turkey in three months and the Turkish Government  will be careful not to allow the presence of that force to set  an example in the long run." The government's decision to "allow  the deployment of an international CSCE force in Erzurum for the  obstruction of the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan" has  proved that the officials lied in the past.</p>

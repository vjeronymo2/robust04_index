			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Rybkin is Top of the List"] </F>   [Text] The Russian Center for Political Culture Studies  has conducted a regular poll among experts asking them to rate  on a 10-point scale the political influence of State Duma  deputies this past April. The experts included parliamentary  journalists of leading newspapers, radio and television and  political scientists.    Their findings, wired in an INTERFAX report, indicate that  Speaker Ivan Rybkin holds the lead just as in previous polls.  While remaining uncontested leader, his April rating dropped to  7.6 points from 8.2 in March. Political scientists put this  down to the fact that a considerable number of his supporters  demanded his resignation over his conciliatory stance on the  president's version of the Treaty on Social Accord.    The runner-up is the Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov with  6.2 points. The poll results indicate that he is becoming an  increasingly weighty and acceptable political figure in the eyes  of both presidential supporters and the opposition. G. Zyuganov  was third in the March poll.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  leader, is back among the three top deputies (he scored 6 points  in April up from 5.4 in March) after the Duma supported last  month his suggestion that the internal affairs minister should  quit over the killing of deputy Ayzderdzis, and after he  negotiated his signing of the Treaty on Social Accord with the  president's team.    The budget debate jacked up the rating of Sergey Glazyev  (Democratic Party of Russia), chairman of the Duma Committee on  Economic Policy, who published in April a draft program of the  "Accord in the Name of Russia" opposition movement. He scored  5.6 points.    Next comes Grigoriy Yavlinskiy (Yabloko) who managed to move  in the April poll to fifth position from 17th in March.    Yegor Gaydar, "Russia's Choice" leader, dropped to sixth  position from second in March over his weakened influence on the  decision- making process in the State Duma.    Vladimir Isakov (Agrarian Party of Russia), Sergey Shakhray  (Party of Russian Unity and Accord), Viktor Ilyukhin (Communist  Party of the Russian Federation), and Aleksandr Vengerovskiy  (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) are in the upper part of  the table as they have always been in the Center for Political  Culture Studies polls.</p>

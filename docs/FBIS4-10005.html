			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar </F> Reyes with domestic reporters and unidentified moderator at the  Government Ministry in Managua -- live]    [Excerpt] We made an appointment with this Nicaraguan  citizen, and he gave us information that we can relay to you as  follows:    This Nicaraguan citizen said he was coming from Leon, where  he had been working as a mechanic, when he met two Nicaraguans  on a bus. The men were friends whom he had known a long time.  These men told him there was a job in Honduras for which someone  was willing to pay $80,000. The work consisted of setting fire  to a paint plant without leaving any trace so the plant owners  could collect the insurance money. On 7 March, the three men  went to Honduras, where they contacted the person who allegedly  had made the proposal. The person was a Honduran citizen named  Luis Hernandez Sosa, approximately 38 years old. The men  checked into a Tegucigalpa hotel.    The next day they went to a store, owned by an man of Arab  descent, whom the two men presented as the person interested in  having the work done. Later, they told this Nicaraguan citizen  that another meeting would be held on Wednesday. At that  meeting, the Honduran men told the Nicaraguan that the job was  not exactly to burn down a paint plant but to kidnap a Honduran  citizen who had approximately 20 million lempiras in his safe.  Later, the Nicaraguan and Hondurans went to another place, a  nightclub. The Hondurans reportedly used a small amount of  cocaine. During the talks, they said that the work was not to  kidnap this Honduran businessman but something else, a job that  paid $400,000: It was to assassinate Honduran President Reina.    We contacted the Honduran Embassy on the same day we learned  of this plan. On 14 March, Honduran authorities sent a special  delegate to Nicaragua in accordance with a letter that Colonel  Alvaro Antonio Romero Salgado, chief of the presidential staff,  addressed to Government Minister Mendieta. This special  delegate met with the Nicaraguan citizen who gave us the  information at this ministry. The Nicaraguan citizen was asked  whether he was willing to travel to Tegucigalpa and identify the  places where they had been and the people he had mentioned in  his statements. He agreed. They left on 15 March for Honduras.  Honduran authorities thanked us for the information. We  believe it to be our duty to reveal this sensitive information  to a government and people with whom we have excellent  relations. Honduran authorities today told us that, according  to the preliminary investigation in Honduras, a group, probably  linked to auto theft and most likely to drug trafficking, had  been active in this connection.    According to Col. Romero, the investigations have been  unable  to establish whether there was really a plot against President  Reina. The investigations continue. I want to reiterate that  the investigations are being conducted by Honduran authorities  in Honduras. We are willing to cooperate with the Honduran  authorities in any way we can to fully resolve this case. I  hereby reiterate our pledge to exchange this type of information  and any other information of international or national interest  with all countries; particularly in terms of the plot to  assassinate the president of Honduras.    The Honduran authorities told us that they revealed this  information today because it was leaked by certain news media,  but the investigation has not concluded. [passage omitted]</p>

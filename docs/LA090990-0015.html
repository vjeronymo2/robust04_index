			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A PUZZLER  </P> <P> The Puzzler has changed. I'm not sure when it started -- it's been some time --  but thetraditional tools of solution, such as etymology, history, literature  and overall erudition have been supplanted.  </P> <P> Now one needs nothing less than to be attuned to the subjective cuteness of  Sylvia Bursztyn and Barry Tunick.  </P> <P> The Puzzler used to provide a goodly dose of personal satisfaction upon its  completion; a certain smugness. Now, alas, I feel diminished by it. Rather than  a battle of wits, it has become an exercise in deciphering the lame puns of its  creators.  </P> <P> BRYANT H.

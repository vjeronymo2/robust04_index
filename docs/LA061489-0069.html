			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A letter from 154 members of the House of Representatives urged President Bush  to uphold all current anti-abortion policies. "Send an early, clear and  unmistakable signal of your intention to veto any appropriations or  authorization measure that would undo or weaken current law regarding  abortion," the lawmakers wrote. The representatives number more than the  one-third that would be needed to sustain a presidential veto. Rep. Christopher  H. Smith (R-N.J.) co-chairman of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, said the  letter was not aimed at a particular effort to change U.S. abortion policy, but  that with a decision expected soon in a Missouri abortion case before the  Supreme Court, more action on the issue is expected.  </P></p>

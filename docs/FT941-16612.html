			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: Rewards of straying from the Silk Route - Giles Whittell visits Samarkand and follows impossibly exotic branches of a road which has not changed for 1,000 years over some of its stretches 'I AM REGISTAN,' the loudspeakers bellowed, as purple and orange lights blinked at Samarkand's three great medieval madrasas. A handful of tourists gazed at them from a tier of plastic seating. The loudspeakers droned on about something to do with Lenin's flag and Uzbek pride, but I doubt if anyone was listening. The Registan is the most breathtaking architectural ensemble on the Silk Route. No-one had recorded a new soundtrack for the son et lumiere, but it didn't seem to matter. Not even Soviet pseudo-history can demean these monuments to the wealth accumulated in 14th-century Samarkand by Tamerlane. Timur-the-lame, self-styled heir to Genghis Khan, did not build them himself. What he did was force all Silk Route trade to pass through Samarkand by ransacking Urgench, its northern rival near the Aral sea. He also liked to display the heads of prisoners on stakes where these Islamic seminaries now stand. His grandson, Ulug Bek, commissioned the first of them in 1417 and smothered it in acres of blue and green mosaic. The two imitations that went up 200 years later are less pure as pieces of Islamic art, but no less impressive. The portal of the Shir Dor madrasa resorts blasphemously to mosaic lions in order to impress, while deep within the Tilla Kari madrasa several kilos of gold shimmer from the ceiling of the Golden Mosque, and you would have to be a dry old Islamicist not to ooh and aah at it. Tour operators are queueing to take you to former Soviet central Asia, and Samarkand, second city of Uzbekistan, is the place they hope to have you drooling over. It is certainly worth a visit. From the Registan you can walk past the tea-houses of Tashkent Street to the bazaar and the massive, brooding remains of Tamerlane's Bibi Khanym mosque. There is also Gur Emir, the terrible warlord's mausoleum. Legend has it that someone etched inside his coffin the words 'If I am roused the earth will tremble.' Five-and-a-half centuries later a Soviet scientist exhumed the body. It was the night of June 22, 1941, and within minutes of the coffin being opened an assistant rushed into the crypt with the news that Hitler had invaded Russia. There is much to shiver and marvel at in Samarkand, but it would be a waste to come all this way and not do some exploring. What is new in central Asia is the chance to stray away from Intourist's beaten track - from those branches of the so-called Silk Route that are now Tarmac to those which have not changed in 1,000 years. Start by looking south from the site of Ulug Bek's observatory. (Ulug Bek used astronomy to calculate the length of the year to within a few seconds, nearly two centuries before Copernicus was born.) From here, on a clear day, you can see the snows of the Zerafshan mountains marching into the desert along a highway of haze. Where you are standing, the temperature is probably close to 40'C, and the traffic fumes catch in your throat. Up there, you imagine, there are perfect valleys full of wild flowers and pristine air. You have to go and see. I joined an up-market, guided trek to the Fan massif, the highest in the Zerafshan range. It seemed the sensible option because these mountains are in Tajikistan, which was in the grip of civil war. The group included an 86-year-old who assured us he would be fine at altitude because he kept in shape on Sundays, on Dartmoor, with the Teignmouth branch of the Ramblers' Association. There was also a distinguished Foreign Office KCMG who told me on our first evening together that he loathed journalists. We crossed the Tajik border, very peacefully, in a minibus. At the ancient Sogdian city of Pendzhikent we transferred to a mountain-going truck which broke down soon after entering the mountains. Bunny, the octogenarian, impressed everyone by getting out and walking. As we gained height, tobacco patches gave way to juniper forest. The path narrowed and the gradient stiffened and Bunny changed down a gear or two. Raw horizons of rock and ice closed in to the west and the south. The air grew cold and thin and space was found for Bunny on a donkey. (This was cushy trekking; a small herd of donkeys carried everything except our sunhats.) That night, round a camp fire of 100-year-old juniper logs, the donkey drivers gave a spirited recital of Tajik mountain songs. KCMG and I replied with Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud and Jerusalem. The following day we crossed the watershed between Samarkand and Dushanbe. Bunny reached it leaning back on his donkey like a stunt-rider. It took four men to stop him falling off, but when he said the view was 'more spectacular than Dartmoor' it seemed worth the trouble. We camped at a place that used up all our superlatives. The grass had been clipped to a sward by mountain goats. The tents were sheltered by low rises dotted with boulders and cedar trees. The sun set over a sequence of miniature lakes strung out below us, and not far to the south a sheer wall of snow and rock reared up two vertical kilometres. We asked for more songs but the donkey men had found some heroin poppies and made tea with them. They were still blotto in the morning. We were told by our chief guide, Kolya, a quiet Russian alpinist who has raised walking to an art-form, that our path was a genuine strand of the Silk Route: the main route south from Samarkand right up to the 1950s. Maybe. It is true that the Silk Route had variants, but it is also true that every road in central Asia turns out to be ex-Silk Route if you let the tour guide pause for breath. The origin of this impossibly exotic camel track is well-documented. In 138 BC a Chinese general called Chang Ch'ien travelled to Fergana (east of Samarkand in present-day Uzbekistan) to buy some horses that were said to run so fast they sweated blood. The general found that in fact they bled because of a skin parasite. But he also learned that Fergana's merchants would pay a very handsome price for silk. His emperor, Wu-ti, thereupon lifted an export ban which had been in force since the Chinese started weaving silk around 2000 BC, and trading began. Chang Ch'ien had crossed the Tien Shan (the Heavenly Mountains) between Kashgar and what is now the Kirghiz town of Uzgen. Join the dots. This is the original Silk Route. You cannot follow it because 20th-century politics mean there is no road. But you can cross the mountains not far north, along the arduous road through Kirghizstan to Torugart, from where Chinese jeeps leave for Kashgar. An hour or two before the Chinese border there is a turning to a place called Tash Rabat. Take it. Do not on any account roar past in a cloud of dust as the Paris-Beijing rally did last year. At the end of a track, lost in the mountains, Tash Rabat is a grand old granite caravanserai that was sheltering Kashgari traders since before Tamerlane was thought of. You can camp beside it and hike up to Asia's continental divide, or hunt ibex with the lonely caretaker. Whatever you do, it will evoke the real Silk Route better than a Soviet sound and light show.

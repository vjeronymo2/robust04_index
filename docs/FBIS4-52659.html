			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Civic  organizations of Japan denounced the unjustifiable search of and  outrage against the Osaka organization of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by the  Japanese police.    On April 28, members of the Minamiosaka solidarity society  for peace and human rights comprising workers in Minamiosaka  area conducted street propaganda in front of four government  offices and distributed to citizens copies of a literature  saying that the recent search can never be tolerated.    They said the search by the Osaka prefectural police was not  an ordinary one but a "preliminary search" aimed at "freezing  the property" of Koreans in Japan and "preserving public peace"  in "case of emergency."    The chairman of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of the  Japan Social-Democratic Party, Yukio Takemura, said in his  recent statement that the search was a repressive act against  Chongnyon perpetrated under the cloak of "investigation." He  reaffirmed the resolution to struggle in solidarity with Koreans  in Japan to defend their rights.</p>

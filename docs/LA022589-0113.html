			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NO DRUG CENTER IN LAKE VIEW TERRACE  </P> <P> Iam opposed to the planned Phoenix House/Nancy Reagan Center's being located in  Lake View Terrace.  </P> <P> As a resident of Lake View Terrace, I am familiar with the proposed site and  think that far more suitable locations are available elsewhere. The site in  question, a former medical center, is surrounded by single-family homes and has  two schools nearby.  </P> <P> I realize the Valley needs such a facility. However, it is time another  community assumes this responsibility. Lake View Terrace already contains  several facilities for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse, a sanitarium  for the mentally ill, a youth correctional facility and the Lopez Canyon  Landfill, which accepts the majority of L.A.'s trash. OUR BACK YARD IS ALREADY  FULL! IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S TURN!  </P> <P> THOMAS D. FAY  </P> <P> Lake View Terrace  </P></p>

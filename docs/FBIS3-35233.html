The solution to the problem of  Bosnia and Herzegovina does not lie in the shelling of  particular armed positions for this is absurd and ridiculous.  It is a cover up for there are two issues which are separate  from each other. They are the racial annihilation of Muslims  and the political issue of the Republic of Bosnia and  Herzegovina as far as the method of governing it and the  representation of each party. This is purely a political  problem which does not require weapons nor be solved by  shelling. But the annihilation of Muslims is another issue and  beyond Sarajevo. For Muslims are being annihilated everywhere  in Yugoslavia and not in Sarajevo. The shelling of some  positions has nothing to do with this even if it stopped the  annihilation of Muslims. We are with the Serbs in the political  problem of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and against  them in the racial annihilation of Muslims which is not at all a  political issue.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK KENT COOKE CABLE SALE MAY TOP $1.5 BILLION  </P> <P> In a deal expected to top $1.5 billion, entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke announced  Monday that he has tentatively agreed to sell his nationwide cable television  properties to a consortium of cable operators.  </P> <P> Cooke, whose holdings include the Washington Redskins football team and the  Daily News in Van Nuys, did not disclose the sale price for his Cooke  CableVision Inc., which has about 700,000 subscribers in 19 states. One of the  buyers said the group agreed not to divulge such information.  </P> <P> However, the prices in some other major cable system sales last year exceeded  $2,400 per subscriber. Also, according to published reports when the Cooke  properties were put up for sale last August, he was seeking more than $1.9  billion.  </P> <P> The Cooke sale agreement comes at a time of rising cable fees, those charged by  the basic cable firms that provide the programming, as well as by the multiple  system operators.  </P> <P> If it is completed, the Cooke sale would be the largest since last year's  $1.55-billion purchase by Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp. of the  Storer cable properties from the leveraged buyout firm of Kohlberg Kravis  Roberts &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, also is a major  member of the consortium that has agreed to buy the Cooke properties. Although  no one at Denver-based TCI was available for comment, a source said that firm  would obtain about 200,000 subscribers in the West and Midwest. As of last June  30, TCI had 4.3 million subscribers, according to Channels magazine.  </P> <P> Another major buyer in the Cooke deal -- and one with a key role in organizing  the consortium -- is InterMedia Partners, a San Francisco limited partnership  formed recently to acquire and operate cable TV systems and newspapers.  </P> <P> InterMedia said the Cooke properties that it intends to buy serve about 215,000  subscribers in the Sun Belt. They include systems in Tucson and neighboring  counties in Arizona; certain suburbs of Nashville and Knoxville, Tenn., and of  Atlanta, and the city and environs of Aiken, S.C. Communications executive  Frank Washington of Sacramento will be associated with InterMedia in operating  the cable properties as the general partner of Robin Cable Systems.  </P> <P> Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles said it and its affiliates will acquire Cooke  properties serving about 44,000 subscribers in Oregon. Of these, Falcon Cable  Systems Co., an affiliate, is to acquire about 13,000.  </P> <P> According to a person familiar with the deal, other buyers include TCA Cable TV  Inc., which will acquire about 87,000 subscribers in the South and Southwest;  Hawk Cable, getting about 84,000 East Coast and Southern subscribers; Chambers  Communications, acquiring 30,000 in the West, and Rock Associates, getting  23,000 in the Pacific Northwest.  </P> <P> James Lacher, executive vice president of Jack Kent Cooke Inc., the  entrepreneur's principal holding company, said from his Woodland Hills offices  that he could not elaborate on the company's brief prepared statement  announcing the deal.  </P> <P> InterMedia, whose investors include banks, insurance firms and pension funds,  said its managing general partner, Leo J. Hindery Jr., organized the consortium  with Denver-based consultant Brian Deevy of Daniels &amp; Associates. The other  members designated Hindery and Deevy to negotiate with Cooke and his  associates. The Cooke deal is InterMedia's first major transaction.  </P> <P> The deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals and the execution of a  definitive sales agreement, is expected to be concluded at midyear, InterMedia  said.  </P> <P> Cooke, 76, who has his headquarters in Middleburg, Va., is one of the country's  wealthiest people. He formerly owned the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team,  the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and the place where they play, the Inglewood  Forum. His present holdings include the Chrysler Building in New York and other  newspapers in New Mexico and Colorado.  </P> <P> He founded his fortune through newspaper publishing and broadcasting ventures  in Canada, in partnership with Canadian press lord Roy Thomson until 1952.  Cooke then moved to the United States and became a citizen in 1960.  </P></p>

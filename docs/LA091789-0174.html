			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ST. GENEVIEVE KEEPS REINS ON N. HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> A joyous locker-room scene was rather rare last season as St. Genevieve High  struggled to a 1-8 record and a last-place finish in the San Fernando Valley  League.  </P> <P> But it's a different story this year.  </P> <P> "Ya gotta love it!" could be heard ringing out after the Valiants defeated  North Hollywood, 7-0, on Saturday night at Birmingham High.  </P> <P> It was a fitting exclamation. First-year St. Genevieve Coach Mark Lovett has  guided his team to a 2-0 start, quite a contrast to the misery of 1988.  </P> <P> Lovett's charges shut down the Huskies' offense, limiting it to 146 total  yards.  </P> <P> "They're very well-coached and aggressive defensively," North Hollywood Coach  Fred Grimes said.  </P> <P> The Valiants, who last week allowed only 15 total yards in a 9-7 win over  Murphy, have certainly shown a solid defense.  </P> <P> Offensively, it has been a different story.  </P> <P> St. Genevieve took a 7-0 lead on its first possession when quarterback Dominic  Muller hit tight end Mike Hoffmann with a 74-yard touchdown pass. But the  Valiants gained only 115 yards the rest of the way.  </P> <P> "We've got to get the offense rolling," Lovett said. "I'm an offensive coach.  It can't go on like this."  </P> <P> About the only highlight for North Hollywood was the play of tailback Mike  Lewis, who gained 115 yards in 28 carries.  </P> <P> One example of the difference between the teams' play occurred on the first  play from scrimmage after Hoffmann's touchdown.  </P> <P> Lewis took the handoff and rambled 55 yards for an apparent score, but the  Huskies were called for illegal procedure and the play was nullified.  </P> <P> The game marked another early season match-up between City and Southern section  teams and, as with other City teams, North Hollywood found itself hurt by a  late start. North Hollywood was playing its first game of the season and began  practice two weeks later then its Southern Section opponent.  </P> <P> With a limited staff and practice time, the Huskies entered the game with only  three offensive plays.  </P> <P> Two involved Lewis.  </P> <P> The only variation Grimes used came with 6:18 left and North Hollywood facing a  fourth and six on the Valiant 25. Quarterback Greg Roth pitched to Lewis, who  immediately looked for a streaking Krigor Kerkonian heading toward the right  corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> Lewis' pass was overthrown, however, and St. Genevieve regained possession.  </P></p>

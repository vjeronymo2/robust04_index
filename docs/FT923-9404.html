			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Aussie hockey stars in sight of gold AUSTRALIA'S men hockey players laid a ghost when they knocked Britain out of the Olympic tournament. Both at the Los Angeles and Seoul Games, the Aussies were gold medal favourites - and went home with nothing. Thumping the Old Enemy 6-0 to secure a semi-final place against the Netherlands has given the Australians an enormous boost. If the Dutch can be seen off tonight, as form suggests, then the most likely final is between Australia and Germany. At Karachi in February, the German team convincingly won the Champions' Trophy to add to their current European title. Set-piece moves, methodical and well-rehearsed, are at the heart of German success. Their remarkable forward Carsten Fischer lies third in the Barcelona scorers' table with six goals, all from penalties or penalty corners. Fischer's shaven head - a side-effect of drugs taken to combat diabetes - and industrial build lend him dominance in front of any goalmouth. Yet directly below him in the table lie Australia's two most prolific forwards, Stephen Davies and Jay Stacey, with seven of their aggregate 10 scores from field goals. German coach Paul Lissek has been working out the containment policy which would be necessary to end his country's 20 years without Olympic gold. Australian coach Frank Murray believes that his young team may be finding the key to turning their undoubted ability into victories. 'It's a confidence thing,' he said. 'They are just beginning to feel relaxed and, when you're young and inexperienced, that's the only way to play well. I've been thrilled at our attack but don't forget that we've only conceded two goals in the qualifying rounds.' Lissek faces a special psychological hurdle in taking his German team past Pakistan, first, and then Australia, to a gold medal. In 1990 the team passed a vote of no-confidence in Klaus Kleiter, a mentor who had led them for many years but with the biggest successes always elusive. Lissek played 50 times for his country. If Germany play and win in their traditional style, that will raise once more the tempo of hockey's internal debate about the influence of the penalty corner on a game that relies for its attractiveness on the sheer speed of play up and down the pitch. 'You have to be efficient at penalty corners but they're not the be-all and end-all. It bothers people when they dominate a team's results,' said Ian Taylor, former British international and now a BBC commentator. Defeat by Australia marked the end of a glowing era for men's hockey in Britain. Sean Kerly was both its herald and pallbearer. He announced after the match that his career was effectively over. 'This is the end. I don't see myself playing any more international hockey,' he said after his third Games. Kerly's seven goals in Los Angeles and eight in Seoul were the keystones in Britain's silver and gold medal performances. Perhaps more important, his panache and good looks gave the game a massive publicity boost and young male players a role model. In the 12 months after the team's return from Korea, even routine club hockey matches in the south of England would find hundreds of spectators on the touchline, rather than dozens. If Kerly were playing, numbers could be in the thousands, virtually overwhelming small clubs. The boom couldn't and didn't last, but it threw a welcome spotlight on a sport that has always felt, with some justification, that in Britain its skill, speed and integrity were too often overlooked. 'Olympic success has meant a massive amount in terms of sponsorship visibility and, more importantly, young players being attracted into the game,' said coach Norman Hughes in valedictory mood. Britain's hopes of a second successive hockey title were destroyed when the women's team lost their semi-final yesterday against the favourites Germany. Britain can still win the bronze</p>

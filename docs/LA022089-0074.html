			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Panama cut electricity to 77 homes rented by the U.S. military in the Panama  Canal area, charging the tenants had not paid their rent, a spokesman for the  U.S. Southern Command said. More than 100 people were moved out of the homes  and onto U.S. bases. Last March, the Reagan Administration ordered that all  U.S. government payments to Panama, including fees for basic services, be made  to an escrow account in the United States in an effort to keep funds from  flowing to the government of Panama's strongman, Manuel A. Noriega. The order  was part of a series of sanctions geared to force Noriega out of power. All of  the efforts have failed. The majority of the people living in the homes  affected by the power cut are U.S. Air Force personnel and their families, the  spokesman said.  </P></p>

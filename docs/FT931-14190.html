			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Sir Leon Brittan urges new US administration to push for resolution of Uruguay Round SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner, yesterday urged the incoming US administration to join the Community in pressing for a rapid resolution of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels. 'Every week we don't have an agreement costs the world dear in money and jobs,' Sir Leon told journalists, in his first public statement since taking over the European Commission trade portfolio. Sir Leon said he wanted to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, the incoming US trade representative, as soon as possible to discuss strategy for concluding the talks. The US and EC originally hoped a deal could be reached before President George Bush stepped down. Sir Leon said yesterday: 'We have not reached agreement, but we have certainly not wasted our time. We have injected new urgency into the process and have prepared the ground for a quick spurt to a successful conclusion.' Sir Leon said he still hoped a deal could be submitted to the US Congress before the administration's current negotiating authority expired. The official expiry date is March 2, but the authority could be extended and Sir Leon was careful yesterday not to set himself a specific deadline. 'An ambitious and constructive market-opening package, combined with sticking closely to the Dunkel text (draft conclusions prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general), seems to me to provide the basis for a successful negotiation,' he added. Sir Leon made clear that there was no possibility of reopening last year's controversial deal between the EC and the US on agricultural subsidies before provisional agreement had been reached with other members of the Gatt on the rest of the package. The agriculture deal is deeply unpopular in France, but Sir Leon said EC member states would get the chance to air their 'internal disagreements' formally once the whole package was ready for their approval.</p>

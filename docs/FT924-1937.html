			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Reliance Security shares dip SHARES OF Reliance Security Group fell 18p to 123p following the announcement of an 11 per cent downturn in pre-tax profits to Pounds 905,000 for the 27 weeks to November 6. Mr Brian Kingham, chairman of the USM-quoted security provider, said the fall included a reduced loss of Pounds 502,000 (Pounds 772,000) from the electronic security surveillance business. He was encouraged by an 8 per cent improvement in turnover to Pounds 34.1m but pointed out that lower profits reflected the impact of recession which was most notable in reduced margins. Earnings amounted to 2.7p (3p) per share and the interim dividend is held at 1.1p.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Gridasov, chief of the Main Administration of </F> Crop Growing of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of the  Russian Federation: "On the Course of Field Work"]    [Text] At the end of the first 10 days of May over a large  part of the European territory of Russia the weather was mainly  warm with small amounts of precipitation. The air temperature in  the non-Chernozem zone rose to 10-15 degrees, and in the Central  Chernozem region, the Northern Caucasus, and the Volga area, to  15-20 degrees.    In the Central Urals and the southern oblasts of Western and  Eastern Siberia it became considerably cooler. In many regions  there was rain, and in Chelyabinsk Oblast--snow. In Eastern  Siberia during the night hours the temperature dropped to minus  3-9 degrees. The rates of field work slowed up in these regions.    In the Far East, as usual, the weather was unstable. The  precipitation that fell here impeded field work.    The condition of winter crops in the Russian Federation as a  whole is worse than in 1993. Especially large areas have had to  be replanted in the Northern Caucasus, the Volga area, and the  Central Chernozem oblasts. The condition of the perennial  grasses basically corresponds to the average values over many  years. They did not survive the winter quite as well in the  Northwestern, several regions of the Central, the Central  Chernozem, and the Eastern Siberian regions. The sprouting of  grasses is at the usual level and only in the Central region are  the grasses somewhat behind in their growth.    In Krasnodar Kray the height of the alfalfa stand has  reached  30-40 centimeters and in some places 60, and in Rostov Oblast  has reached 40 centimeters. They will be ready for harvesting in  Krasnodar Kray on 20 May and in Rostov Oblast on 25 May.    In Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays, Rostov Oblast, and the  republics of the Northern Caucasus planting of spring grain  crops has been completed. Mass planting is continuing in the  Central Chernozem, Central, Volgo-Vyatka, Volga, and other  regions. The majority of farms in the Urals and Siberia have  begun field work.    According to data of the State Committee on Statistics of  Russia, on agricultural enterprises spring crops have been  planted on 19.228 million hectares, which is 3 million hectares  less than during the same period of last year. The rates of  planting have been negatively affected by the reduction of the  machinery and tractor fleet on the farms and the shortage of  mineral fertilizers, means of plant protection, and other  material and technical resources. An alarming situation has  developed with respect to technical equipment for procuring  feeds. During the past three years the number of mowers has  decreased by 126,000, rakes by 38,000, press-pickups by 16,000,  and feed harvesting combines by 4,300 units.    In Stavropol Kray spring field work will require 99,000  tonnes of fertilizer and there are only 37,700 tonnes available.  This is half as much as last year. Nitrogen top dressing of  winter crops alone will require 45,000 tonnes while 25,000  tonnes are available. The situation is similar in other  republics, krays, and oblasts of Russia.    Because of the shortage of mineral fertilizers only 20  percent of the winter crops have been top dressed in Bryansk  Oblast, 25 percent in Voronezh, 21 percent in Tambov, 23 percent  in Volgograd, 26 percent in Ulyanovsk, 40 percent in Stavropol  Kray, and 60 percent in Rostov Oblast. In the Russian Federation  as a whole winter crops have been top dressed on 3.2 million  hectares as compared to 4 million in 1993.    There are difficulties with the provision of fuel and  lubricants and on many farms the technical equipment is fueled  "right out of the tanker."    The main reason for the shortage of material and technical  resources is that the farms have no money. Up to this point the  grain receiving enterprises have not paid their bills for grain  for state resources for last year and the debt amounts to more  than R280 billion. The farms are unwilling to take out credit at  213 percent for fear of going into debt.</p>

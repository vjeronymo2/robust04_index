			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Foreign  Ministry Saturday called North Korea's discharge of fuel rods at  its 5-megawatt reactor "extremely regrettable" and voiced hope  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be able to  clarify the situation.    "It's extremely regrettable that North Korea gave  notification it will unilaterally begin changing the fuel rods  at its 5mw experimental reactor," said ministry spokesman Chang  Ki-ho in a commentary.    The spokesman supported the IAEA's dispatch of an inspection  team to North Korea.    "The Government of South Korea emphasizes to North Korea the  importance of sampling and securing the rods as demanded by the  IAEA and reminds it that the nuclear problem should not be taken  to a destructive stage by North Korea's unilateral changing of  the fuel rods," he said.    "The Government of South Korea urges North Korea to soon  engage in negotiations with the IAEA on the replacement of the  rods at the nuclear reactor and to carry out its full  obligations."</p>

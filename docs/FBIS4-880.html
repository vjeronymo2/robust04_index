			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou with </F> foreign and domestic correspondents in Niamey on 18 April--  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Voix du Sahel corresponedent  Braimah Fadoumouchi] Prime Minister, you recently declared that  financial folly is over in Niger and that all citizens must pay  taxes. How does the government intend to organize the  collection of national taxes.    [Issoufou] Following a working session with the major  revenue  collecting services at the Ministry of Finance, I said that our  financial vacation is over. This is justified because we have  witnessed a progressive reduction in taxation in our economy  since 1987. This has led to a drastic fall in the state's tax  revenues. As I have often emphasized, this has led to a fall in  taxes collected compared with the total revenue, the gross  domestic product, generated in the country. In the early  eighties, taxes amounted to 13 percent of the gross domestic  product. When we took over the management of the country, taxes  hardly made up 7 percent of the gross domestic product.    In my general policy statement, I made clear that one of the  government's priorities was to streamline the public finance and  to boost our economy. The streamlining of the public finance  must be accomplished in two phases. The first phase bears  regards the increase in revenues earned from taxes and the  second concerns the sound management of the state's expenditure.  Your question concerns the first phase related to increasing  revenue earned from taxation. We plan to increase our fiscal  revenue from 7 percent to 15 percent. In the stabilization and  economic reform program which we have signed with the  IMF...[pauses] in the confirmation agreement which we have  signed with the IMF and in the program which we intend to sign  to facilitate a strong structural adjustment program, our  objective is to be able to collect taxes making 11 percent of  the gross domestic product in 1996.    How does the government intend to reach this goal? As you  know, the government has been able to identify the obstacles  that caused the fall in fiscal revenues. One of the greatest  obstacles is the domination of our economy by the unofficial  sector. We will fight against this. The decision to devalue the  CFA franc on 12 January also falls under this category. The  devaluation was aimed at effectively reducing fraud which is  most commonly used by the informal sector. We will take  particular steps to fight fraud. We will also provide the  services with the necessary human and material resources  accomplish this goal, because, as you know, unfortunately, our  fiscal administration organ is understaffed, both the Central  Revenue Department and the Customs Service. All these  departments are understaffed. The government's objective is to  increase the human resources of these departments. There is  also the problem of transportation. We cannot control, for  example, the long border which we have with Nigeria without  vehicles to enable the Customs Service to accomplish this  mission. These are therefore the measures to be taken by the  government to achieve this goal.    [Fadoumouchi] How far have the Niger authorities gotten on  negotiations with our mining partners concerning the new price  of uranium?    [Issoufou] As you know, every year the Government of Niger  meets with buyers who are also shareholders in the uranium  mining companies, the Akouta Mining Company and the Air Mining  Company. Negotiations began at the end of 1993 resulting in a  fixed uranium price for 1994. It was fixed at 14,440 CFA per  kilogram. These negotiations also led to the fixed levels of  production. The level for 1994 was set at 3,000 tonnes. The  decision to devalue the CFA franc was made on 12 January.  Considering the fact that these mining companies import a great  quantity of other materials, they were obliged to review their  production costs. Generally, the price of uranium is [word  indistinct] price which is fixed according to the production  cost of the mining companies. So, as the production costs have  changed, the price must also change. Consequently, we have  decided to meet with the buyers again to hold fresh discussions  in order to fix a final price for uranium considering the  devaluation.    [Unidentified correspondent] Soon after the devaluation of  the CFA franc, the government took a number of steps to exempt  some goods from customs duties. This measure must end in April.  Have you already thought of the end of April? Have some  measures already been taken to prevent the situation from  worsening?    [Issoufou] You have asked an important question concerning  the CFA devaluation. Before answering your question, I would  like to remind you of the arguments on which this devaluation  decision was founded. Our governments had outlined a program of  stabilization and economic reforms. These programs were  intended to streamline the public finances and boost the economy  through internal adjustment measures. This is why, from the  beginning, the program was drawn up on a number of factors,  based first on the rate of growth of the gross domestic product  which was fixed at around 4 percent. [passage omitted] This is  why we have decided to reflect on the issue of devaluation.  This is why we have analyzed the positive and negative effects  of devaluation. Among these effects is the fall in the  purchasing power of the people. This in turn is linked to the  subsequent increase in inflation which we estimated to be a  level which, fortunately, was not attained. All the analyses  made and all the information received from the statistics  department have shown that the average inflation is currently  around 22 percent. As a first step, we reacted by freezing the  prices of essential goods because we felt that the stocks of  these commodities were in the stores; they were acquired before  the devaluation. So there was no reason for increasing their  prices. This is the reason for the government's first decision  to freeze prices, but the government cannot keep prices frozen  forever. This means that imports must continue under new  post-devaluation conditions. This is why we have envisaged a  second phase of regulation and administration of prices, and it  is this new phase that we are currently in.    As you know, the Ministry of Commerce is charged with fixing  prices of essential goods to protect consumers and avoid  penalizing businessmen. We have also envisaged that at the  local level, committees should fix prices as in traditional  markets. All this has helped to contain inflation. We know  that during the month of Ramadan fasting the inflation was high.  We are now witnessing a readjustment of the market and an  effective reduction in the rate of inflation. This reduction in  the rate of inflation was also obtained because the government  has taken a number of fiscal steps to reduce the effects of  imported inflation and it is in so doing that the government has  reviewed taxes on goods and services. For example, customs  duties have been reduced by half. All this was done, not only  to protect consumers, but also to protect our enterprises which  have a relatively large quantity of intermediary goods to  import. These are the measures taken by the government and  these measures have yielded extremely positive results because,  as I have said, they have helped to contain inflation. [passage  omitted]</p>

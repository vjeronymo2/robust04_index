			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (7): New techniques needed - Agriculture / Kieran Cooke considers its diminishing role 'Our traditional kampungs (villages) are actually more often full of dilapidated pondok (shacks), dirty and without modern amenities. To lead a life against the background of swaying palms and the full moon might be beautiful as depicted in a painting, but to continue to do so might not be suited to modern times' - Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malysian prime minister. THE AGRICULTURAL sector was once the main engine of growth in the Malaysian economy. But as the economy has grown, agriculture's role has diminished. As the manufacturing sector has prospered, agriculture has had to battle through increasingly difficult times, bringing considerable change to rural life. Malaysian agriculture is dominated by the country's wealth of primary commodities, including rubber, palm oil and cocoa. In 1980, primary commodities accounted for 43.7 per cent of total exports; but by 1991 they made up barely 19 per cent. On the other hand, manufactured goods exports made up 22.4 per cent of exports in 1980, but had risen to 65 per cent of the total by 1991. Due largely to the runaway growth of Malaysia's manufacturing sector, agriculture's contribution to overall GDP has been declining: in 1991 it was 17.2 per cent, compared with 18.6 per cent in the previous year. Such a trend is natural in an industrialising economy. But the speed at which the change has taken place has caused problems. Furthermore the manufacturing sector's growth is not entirely responsible for agriculture's decline. The sector as a whole faces its own difficulties, with stagnant growth and problems of scale and structure. Over the past 20 years, the main thrust of government agricultural policy has been support for smallholders and the sponsoring of state farms. The old foreign-owned plantation companies, through government ownership restrictions or due to their own financial constraints, found it increasingly difficult to run profitable enterprises. The government poured money into smallholder support schemes. Cheap credit facilities and a range of other aids were readily available. More than half the agricultural workers are Malays. Agricultural policy dovetailed with overall government aims: to eradicate poverty and to give the Bumiputras - mostly Malays - a greater share of national wealth. During the past 20 years, poverty has been significantly reduced, while smallholders and state farms now account for most commodity production. More than 70 per cent of rubber production in 1991 came from smallholder units. Policy is now changing. The government admits that the heavily subsidised smallholder and state farm systems have been inefficient and excessively bureaucratic. It now emphasises economies of scale and the need to move towards more sophisticated production techniques, plus improved marketing. Farmers' incomes have not kept pace with those in the manufacturing sector. Smallholders have been reluctant to invest in new technology to improve yields: while rubber yields per hectare in the estate sector increased last year, they once again declined among smallholders. The government now proposes a return to estate-type structures, with equity-holding smallholders consolidated into private corporate entities. Foreign investment in such areas is being encouraged. The need to improve production techniques is crucial, in order to combat domestic labour shortages and increased foreign competition. Malaysia as a whole faces a labour shortage, but in agriculture the problem is critical. Malays and to a lesser extent Indians - the traditional rubber 'tappers' - have migrated to the cities, finding better-paying and less arduous jobs. According to Bank Negara, the central bank, the total labour force in the rubber industry was more than 11 per cent lower at the end of 1991 than at the end of 1990. Meanwhile, thousands of Indonesians and Bangladeshis, many without permits, work in the plantation sector. A recent government clampdown on 'illegals' has caused concern. The Malaysian Agricultural Producers Association says output in the plantation sector could drop by as much as 30 per cent if all 'illegals' were deported. Both Indonesia and Thailand, with low cost labour, are now bigger rubber producers than Malaysia. Malaysia still retains its commanding position as world's leading palm oil producer, but competition for markets is becoming greater each year. In the worldwide rubber industry, in particular, there have been many attempts to achieve more equitable prices for the producing countries. Rubber producers want a more 'transparent' trading system, with prices set according to worldwide demand and supply, and not through private party-to-party deals between the plantations or smallholder groups and the main consumer companies, mainly the tyre manufacturers. Some moves towards such an open system at last seem likely. Consumer companies have become concerned that, if prices remain low, there can be no guarantee of long-term supply. Already several Malaysian rubber producers have moved into more profitable palm oil - or sold their land for leisure and real estate purposes. The government faces an uphill battle in its attempt to achieve dynamic but balanced overall economic development and to ensure the 3.5 per cent per annum growth in the agricultural sector targeted in the present Sixth Malaysia Plan. It seems inevitable that the more the manufacturing sector prospers, the more constraints the agricultural sector will face. Wider affluence has led to more food imports. Farmers continue to drift away from the countryside. Malaysia's rice production fell by nearly 8 per cent last year, and 20 per cent of local consumption has to be imported. But the outlook is not wholly discouraging. In the first quarter of 1991, overall agricultural production (including timber) increased by 7.7 per cent. While rubber exports declined, palm oil showed a healthy increase. A USDollars 500m government export credit financing programme for palm oil, granting various countries deferred payment terms for the purchase of large quantities of Malaysian production, has given new life to the palm oil industry. The emphasis now is on the development and expansion of agriculture-related production facilities. Much has been invested in research and development, and in downstream 'value added' activities. The palm oil sector is diversifying more into the oil and fats market. The rubber sector is producing more goods, including gloves and condoms. The Sixth Malaysia Plan says that agriculture has reached a watershed. The private sector, as in other industries, is expected to play a central role in onward development: 'In contrast to the previous plans, when agricultural development was largely public-sector driven, the emphasis will be on the important role of the private sector in revitalising the agriculture sector,' it promises.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / US to renew campaign for lower world interest rates THE US intends to renew its campaign for a commitment by leading industrial countries to a growth strategy involving lower world interest rates, in spite of a bruising confrontation over the issue at the recent meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers. Germany, supported by Japan and Britain, rejected the call made by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, for a shift in emphasis towards tackling slower growth rather than inflation. Senior US officials concede that they failed to persuade the other G7 members of their case in what non-US participants described as a tense and difficult discussion. However, the US intends to revive the issue at the summit of the heads of government of the G7 countries - the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada - in London in mid-July. The US tactics are apparently not to take a high profile on the issue for the time being, partly for fear of worsening divisions and in the hope of winning people round in time. Instead it plans to pursue the matter behind the scenes through the 'sherpas' or senior officials who prepare the summit agenda. The US case is that there is a serious shortage of investment capital. Much less money is available from such traditional sources as the Arab oil producing states, Japan and Germany, but that big demands exist in the Middle East, eastern Europe and Latin America. US officials stress current high real interest rates in Europe and note that banks will not undertake sufficient cross-border lending. The US argues that the current European, and especially German, strategy is too heavily determined by the desire to fight inflation - which is already low - and that it ignores the real difficulties. The US urges industrial countries to shift to what it sees as a more forward-looking strategy to solve the difficulties of growth in the 1990s. US officials see such an approach as important also for sustaining economic and political reform in eastern and central Europe. Such a dynamic approach, officials believe, would at least provide hope for expansion rather than what they see as an over-emphasis on inflation. Some of these issues may be taken up in a speech which President George Bush plans to deliver on Sunday on the economics of the new world order. The administration has been talking about signs of recovery in the US economy but is concerned that any improvement may be delayed and may not be strong if the European and Japanese economies are weaker.</p>

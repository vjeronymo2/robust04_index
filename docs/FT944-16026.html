			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Molyneaux gambles on lasting peace: So far, the UUP is backing its leader As the Ulster Unionists, the province's main political party, gather in Carrickfergus today for their annual conference, Protestants and Roman Catholics remain far apart. Both nationalist groups - Sinn Fein and the moderate Social Democratic Labour party - are opposed to any form of 'internal solution', while unionists stick to the principle that no change to the status of Northern Ireland can take place without the agreement of the majority. With the emergence this week of a potential third force in unionist politics, with the disavowal of violence by loyalist paramilitaries, there is a danger that unionism, already riven by bitter dispute between the UUP and the more hardline church-based Democratic Unionists led by Rev Ian Paisley, will be further fragmented. Loyalist paramilitaries would appear to share the view of the UUP leader, Mr James Molyneaux, that 'the union is safe'. The DUP remains more sceptical. Mr Peter Robinson, Mr Paisley's would-be heir, said in the Irish Times yesterday that it was 'folly to rely upon the word of any man, especially one who has publicly lied about Northern Ireland in the past'. Mr Molyneaux, pilloried by hardliners, risks being seen as another politician selling out unionist interests. Ominously, some are comparing his performance with the late Brian Faulkner, unionist leader and Northern Ireland premier, who was forced to resign after criticism of his signature of the Sunningdale Agreement in 1973. Some worry that current negotiations go much further than Sunningdale. Mr Molyneaux has put his political reputation on the line by endorsing a deal being drawn up between London and Dublin which at the very least will seek to increase Dublin's role in the affairs of the province. None the less, even if the policy fails and the violence resumes, observers believe Mr Molyneaux could still emerge with honour for having given peace a chance. Mr Chris McGimpsey, a UUP councillor, said: 'There's no point in us giving concessions to the nationalists in negotiations if we can't deliver our people. We're not going to cross the Faulkner line,' So far, there is no sign of dissent within UUP ranks. Mr Molyneaux has shown himself a skilful party manager, balancing the different shades of opinion, and giving real powers to some of his brighter lieutenants - Mr Ken Maginnis, his security spokesman, or Mr David Trimble, who advises on legal issues. The impression is often that these men, not Mr Molyneaux, are driving policy. Mr Molyneaux's line in backing the UK government is now seen to have been taken up by the political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries, with Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionists saying Protestants had nothing to fear from the framework document which London and Dublin are expected to conclude in the next two months. And unlike Mr Paisley, some in the UUP have acknowledged that if the IRA was to announce a permanent ceasefire, Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, could be drawn into the democratic process. The fringe parties now representing loyalist opinion also concede that they may be in talks with Sinn Fein in the near future. With the loyalist ceasefire, and after this weekend's UUP conference, Mr Major will be in a much better position to assess the unionist mood and judge whether the time is right to start the process of bringing Sinn Fein into talks.</p>

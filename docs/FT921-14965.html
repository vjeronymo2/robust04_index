			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Tempered optimism in west Midlands COMPANIES in the west Midlands, one of the country's main business regions, report a slight increase in confidence, although the outlook remains difficult, according to a study published today. The West Midlands Regional Group of Chambers of Commerce says 48 per cent of companies in the area think sales will rise over the next year, compared with a figure of 43 per cent in September 1991. However, Mr Howard Davis, chairman of the regional group, said that growth prospects remained poor. He wanted the government to reintroduce 100 per cent capital allowances to boost manufacturing investment and output. The allowances, which would enable companies to offset capital spending against profits, would be a sign that ministers were considering the plight of industry. He added that it would also tackle the large fall in manufacturing investment over the past year 'which must affect the ability of industry to compete as we pull out of recession'. In the survey of nearly 700 manufacturing and service companies the proportion expecting a rise in profits increased to 37 per cent, from 34 per cent in September. Just over a quarter of companies in the study, which was conducted in December, have fuller export order books compared with three months previously. The comparable figure in September was 21 per cent. According to the survey 15 per cent of companies in the region are working at full capacity and 11 per cent at below 60 per cent capacity. Nearly a fifth of businesses say they are finding cashflow easier than three months ago, while 29 per cent say it is worse. The comparable figures for September were 16 per cent and 32 per cent. Consumer confidence is low and will recover only slowly this year, according to Infolink, which monitors demand for credit. In November 1991, demand for credit to buy retail goods was up just 9.2 per cent compared with the same month in 1990, which Infolink says is extremely low for the pre-Christmas period.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Post Office chief delays departure SIR BRYAN NICHOLSON is to delay his departure as chairman of the Post Office until March next year. Sir Bryan, who was appointed as chairman for five years in 1987, was due to step down in October. He has been asked to stay on by Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, to allow more time to find a replacement. The general election will disrupt the timetable for replacing the Post Office chairman and also leaves in doubt the identity of the minister who will be responsible for Sir Bryan's successor.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Medal bike on track for road DESIGN elements from the Lotus Engineering bicycle on which Chris Boardman won an Olympic gold last year are to be used by Leeds-based cycle and clothing group Casket to make a range of bicycles under licence. Casket, which claims more than 20 per cent of the UK cycle market through its British Eagle, Claud Butler, Falcon and Townsend brands, will make and distribute the cycles under the LotusSport brand through its British Eagle arm. The licensing agreement is with Lotus Engineering, the consultancy arm of Group Lotus, the Norfolk-based sports-carmaker. British Eagle will make the cycles to Lotus designs incorporating the basic concept of a one-piece moulded frame. The machines, expected to be launched in the UK during March, will sell for between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,100.</p>

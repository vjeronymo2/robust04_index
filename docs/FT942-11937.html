			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (6): A fighter's comeback / Profile of an entrepreneur Teodor Nachescu's career as a top communist boss came to an abrupt end in December 1989 when angry workers turned him out of Aris, the machine-building factory in Arad which he had headed for the last ten years of the Ceausescu regime. It did not take long for the 50-year-old engineer - a self-proclaimed fighter - to make a comeback. Within months, he was using the entrepreneurial skills which he had gleaned while at Aris, one of the town's two largest firms, to set up his own private company. Today, he heads one of the most successful private groups in Banat, Romania's westernmost region. Avi Floria, the company he set up with his own small savings and those of 14 like-minded individuals in 1990, now has an annual turnover of Lei1.8bn (USDollars 1.4m) and more than 100 shareholders. Its interests range from pig and fur farms to a laboratory providing scientific analysis for farmers and a share holding in the town's recently established commodities exchange. 'I was more prepared than others in 1989,' he says. 'With Aris, I had the chance to travel and to see how companies in western countries worked ..I became convinced that a system based on state property could not lead the economy forward.' Like many of eastern Europe's most successful entrepreneurs, Mr Nachescu and his partners started in trade in order to accumulate capital for production. Taking advantage of Arad's close proximity to the Hungarian border, in 1990 Floria began to barter Romanian fertilisers, wood, furniture and machines for food, car batteries and agricultural machinery imported from Hungary and the west. By the autumn of 1991, the company had raised enough funds to set up its first chicken farm and a metal-welding workshop. Mr Nachescu says he went into agriculture and agro-business - one of the sectors most frequently targeted by new private firms - because of the comparatively small initial investment needed, and because he was sure there was a big market for food in Romania. He started with chicken-raising because of the quick turnover. Every seven to eight weeks, Floria's farm outside Arad produces 90,000 chickens of 1.5kg average weight, raised from one day chicks. Mr Nachescu says his prices are the lowest in Banat and that although Floria is smaller than state-owned chicken companies, it already has a 15 per cent market share in the area. Plans for this year include a Lei200m investment in a new 25,000 head pig farm and an animal feed plant. He had hoped to invest more this year but last autumn's interest rate rise to 120 per cent a year has forced him to cut back. Now he is considering applying for a dollar loan with single digit interest from the local Banca Agricola. This operates Dollars 170m in credit lines for small farmers on behalf of the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly interview with Georgian State Council Chairman </F> Eduard Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani; place and date  not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Batono [honorific title] Eduard, last week the  CIS executive secretary [Ivan Korotchenya] visited Tbilisi, and  it was said that all the CIS republics have agreed in principle  to the deployment of peacekeeping forces [in Abkhazia].  However, Russia's Federation Council rejected the idea. Also  last week, you had a telephone conversation with President  Yeltsin. Should we prepare for some unexpected developments as  far as the introduction of peacekeepers is concerned?    Another question. How would you comment on the following  statement from [Russian State Duma] CIS Affairs Committee  Chairman Zatulin: There is an alternative plan to the Russian  initiative; it envisages the introduction to Abkhazia of troops  of foreign states; if the Russian initiative fails, Russia will  lose its reputation not only within the CIS but also in the  entire world; as long as Russia is capable of carrying out  peacekeeping operations, it will be a key factor in the world;  the introduction of non-Russian forces to Georgia will result in  Russia losing its influence.    [Shevardnadze] Thank you and good morning. The introduction  of peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia has practically been decided.  This was reaffirmed by Russian president Boris Yeltsin in a  telephone conversation a couple of days ago. The details are  being worked out now. Some aspects of this operation were  discussed on television by Mr. Jaba Ioseliani [chief Georgian  negotiator at the talks with Abkhazia] yesterday. He stressed  some very important points.    Events will develop according to plan. At least, that is  what Mr. Yeltsin confirmed during our conversation. A failure  of this peace mission, if it happens, would seriously undermine  the CIS's reputation as a major inter-regional organization. I  think this would not be acceptable to any state, and, of course,  this would be a serious blow to Russia. Peacekeeping,  particularly in Abkhazia, is in Russian national interests. I  am thinking here of the stability of the expanses of southern  Russia. At the same time, this peace mission will reaffirm  Russia's international standing. Therefore, while a successful  completion of this mission is primarily in the interests of  Georgians and the Abkhaz, and in the interests of the state of  Georgia, at the same time it serves the interests of all CIS  countries, and primarily of Russia.    I welcome Mr. Zatulin's comments, which are realistic and  well- balanced.    [Oniani] The conflict in Abkhazia is only one of the  conflicts which have developed on former Soviet territory and  which were sparked off by aggressive separatism. These  conflicts have long since become a regular matter and their  number is, unfortunately, rather large. This has been for some  time, and now a conflict has developed in Ukraine in connection  with Crimea.    [Shevardnadze] I would say the following about this. Since  the late 1980's, when the disintegration of the Soviet Union  began, and especially in the 1990's, I have spoken publicly on  more than one occasion about separatism and about the threat  posed by aggressive separatism in post-communist times. One  such example is my address to the UN General Assembly in  September 1992.    Unfortunately, nothing was done in practice by either world  or regional organizations to avert the threat of aggressive  separatism or to create guarantees for a normal and peaceful  life of the planet's citizens as the cold war was drawing to its  historic end. The world has failed to recognize this threat and  its scale. Those who did recognize it did little to carry out  tangible measures. This is very unfortunate. Because of this,  we are now dealing with unpleasant events in Europe and  elsewhere which may turn into an even bigger threat in the  future.    This general remark also applies to Crimea. I am sure that  the Crimean problem will be solved within the framework of a  single and indivisible state of Ukraine and with Russian  assistance, which will have crucial importance. I want to  stress that the Russian factor in settling the Crimean issue  cannot be ignored.    Another point I would like to stress is that a confrontation  between Russia and Ukraine cannot be allowed to happen. Such a  confrontation would be a great disaster not only for the two  great states, which are our friends, but also for other  countries in Europe and Asia, including Georgia. Such a  confrontation would inflict serious and irreparable damage on  Georgia, the Caucasus in general, and the whole Black sea region.    [Oniani] Last week you hosted a meeting of representatives  of law-enforcement bodies. After this meeting, the Interior  Ministry carried out a major operation in Rustavi. Will such  operations be carried out again in the future, and how  successful do you think they are?    [Shevardnadze] We cannot be pleased with the present state  of public order. However, we must remember what state our  country was in a year ago, or even five or six months ago, and  we should compare that with the present situation in the  capital, in western Georgia, and in several other regions.    It is very important to recognize that there have been  certain changes and that a tangible improvement has occurred,  otherwise we will scare off our foreign partners who have a  great desire to come to Georgia and work here, for example, in  oil recovery, oil processing, gas recovery, and so on. We have  created conditions for these people to come and work in safe  surroundings. Such conditions exist in Tbilisi, Rustavi, and  regions of western Georgia. Unfortunately, the way we behave  often creates the impression among public opinion in Europe and  throughout the world that it is impossible to enter Georgia.    I would also like to say that public order is the main  factor  which will enable our country to emerge from the crisis. We  should be guided by this factor.    As I told you, a lot has changed. It happened primarily  because the role of internal affairs bodies has increased and  their organization, mobilization, and professionalism have  improved. Of course, they are getting assistance from the  Defense Ministry, the security forces, and others. However, the  main burden should be borne by the police.    Despite all this, these are only the first steps, since many  very serious crimes and terrorist acts which have plagued the  country remain unsolved.    The meeting you mentioned agreed that the Security Service  has to take on the difficult job of struggling against  terrorism. I said that all responsibility for the struggle  against terrorism should lie with the Security Service. Of  course it needs assistance and all of us should help it, but it  should bear the brunt of responsibility itself.    In a few days I will submit to parliament draft laws which  must be adopted if we want the struggle against crime to be more  efficient. Life has changed, and new types of crime have  emerged requiring new approaches and new laws. Therefore,  parliament should by all means complete this job before going  into recess. The draft laws are now being prepared.    Finally, I would like to tell our listeners that the  struggle  against crime will not slow down. On the contrary, it will be  stepped up every day, with more levels of society becoming  involved in this struggle.    [Oniani] Since we have mentioned Rustavi, let me ask you a  question about the election which will he held there on 12 June.  As you know, there are many rumors about these elections. Do  you view these elections with the perspective of head of state  or of chairman of the Citizens' Union? In other words, can you  express your preference for a particular candidate?    [Shevardnadze] I would not like to separate the two, and I  want the position of chairman of the Citizens' Union and that of  head of state to be compatible.    As for the specific issue of Rustavi, my preferences may not  mean much. I am just stating facts.    Several days ago I met with Rustavi Mayor (Soso Areshidze).  The meeting took place at the initiative of (Sergo  Doprotsashvili), a candidate for deputy [of the Georgian  parliament], who accompanied the mayor.    Their first request was that I help the people of Rustavi  establish and consolidate public order. The candidate for  deputy painted a truly bleak picture. I decided to give  instructions to Interior Minister Shota Kviraia, who promptly  prepared this operation, which, as you know, was carried out  successfully. The people of Rustavi have expressed sincere  gratitude for this.    I do not think that this operation should be a one-off  measure and part of a (?election) campaign. The interior  minister has promised me that the Interior Ministry will focus  its attention on Rustavi, that such operations will continue,  and that order will be established in Rustavi. [passage omitted]    If my opinion matters at all, I would say that the candidate  for deputy made a very good impression. He is a hard-working,  modest, cultured, and competent person. He is also a native of  Rustavi and is familiar with all problems of its inhabitants.  My impression is that he is not trying to gain popularity by  making ostentatious and cheap effects. He is a businesslike  person. That is my opinion, but of course it is for the people  of Rustavi to decide whom to elect.    [Oniani] And the final question. Last week parliament gave a  lot of attention to issues relating to the struggle against the  mafia and corruption. Political parties and the mafia,  officials and the mafia -- unfortunately, these issues are now  being discussed among the public. Despite all the talk, there  are few tangible results. There are reports that  law-enforcement bodies have a lot of evidence concerning the  involvement of officials and political leaders with the mafia.  Some of this evidence has been published. It would be natural  to ask what the authorities are waiting for. Are the situation  and events unfolding today the reason for the authorities' delay  in taking appropriate measures?    [Shevardnadze] When Georgia was in a state of civil war,  which lasted in effect for several years, including the last few  months of 1993 and the complex beginning of this year, it was  difficult to speak about a struggle against corruption and  organized crime. You know full well that these negative  phenomena accompany wars. This dirty business comes to the  surface during wars and sucks in a large proportion of the  public. As soon as they were given the slightest chance the  authorities emerged in the forefront of this struggle. A lot  has been discovered, and there is still much more that remains  to be revealed. Everything needs to be done in its own time and  in appropriate circumstances. The struggle against the mafia  and corrupt groups has to be dealt with by the whole of society  and this will be achieved.    You may have noticed that in the last month -- or, rather,  one and a half months -- a lot of material has been published in  the press concerning the mafia, organized crime, and criminals  in the economy, finance and so on. This is not the end of the  story; on the contrary, even more material will be published in  future. However, it will be published at a time when it can be  published.    As regards parliament's active role in this, naturally, such  a role by the supreme legislative body should be welcomed.  Without it, there can be no talk of finally overcoming  corruption as a phenomenon. However, parliament should work  using methods that are appropriate for it. For parliament to  take over the functions of the law-enforcement bodies and their  operational services could lead to a further disaster. We could  end up in a terrible situation of no return.    Therefore, I stress that parliament should work and exercise  its right to control and check. However, when some deputies  want classified information to be ... [pauses] How could that  happen if classified information were to be obtained by special  means and methods. Only employees serving this cause should  have access to such information. If parliament were to look  into it, advertise it, and make it public, not a single case  would be solved in Georgia. As I told you, I know that there  would be very bad results if the functions of legislative bodies  and those of law-enforcement bodies were mixed up. As I told  you, this would mean disaster.    [Oniani] Thank you for the interview.</p>

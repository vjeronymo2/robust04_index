			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar under pressure The dollar was again under pressure in foreign exchange markets yesterday as turmoil in financial markets dampened sentiment towards the US currency, writes Philip Gawith. The immediate cause of the dollar's woes was news that German M3 had grown by 20.6 per cent in January, which quashed hopes of an early monetary easing. The D-Mark rose against the dollar and European currencies after this news, but later fell back on profit-taking. It closed in London at DM1.7037 per dollar, from DM1.7090 on Tuesday. The dollar was also weaker against the yen, ending at Y103.670 from Y104.615. In New York it finished trading at DM1.7050 and Y104.20. The pattern of recent trading continued, with currency markets in a residual role reflecting the panicky behaviour in equity and bond markets, rather than moving in response to any fundamental factors. Although the Bundesbank had been assiduous in its efforts to discount a poor M3 number, the market was unprepared for the shock of 20.6 per cent - way above the 4 to 6 per cent target range for 1994 M3 money supply growth. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, commented: 'Even allowing for distortions, there is no doubt that the money supply figure was a shocker.' This was reflected in the three-month D-Mark interest rate futures on the Liffe. The December contract dropped 14 points at one stage, although it later recouped most of this fall. London traders said US hedge funds continued to be responsible for most of the selling pressure, which was emerging in the futures markets, rather than pension funds and corporate customers. Ms Alison Cottrell, senior international economist at Midland Global Markets, downplayed the M3 figure, which she described as 'laughable'. She said the Bundesbank would not have eased the repo rate on Tuesday if it had been concerned by the figure. The Midland analyst said the M3 number had merely hastened the market in the direction it was anyway moving. In this regard the US purchasing managers index on Tuesday had been more influential. 'It was just the market looking for another cliff to jump off,' said Ms Cottrell. She predicted that the Bundesbank council, which meets today, would be unlikely to cut interest rates. The problem it faces is that a policy easing that cheers financial markets would almost certainly come at the expense of its own reputation and the health of the bund market. The D-Mark was stronger against most European currencies. It finished at L990.2 against the Italian lira, from L989.8. Compared with the French franc it closed at FFr3.408 from FFr3.403. Dollar/yen continued to be influenced more by the politics of the US-Japan trade dispute than the chaos elsewhere in financial markets. The past few days have seen US officials again taking a more combative line against Japan. The Bank of Japan was again reported buying dollars to arrest the progress of the yen, assisted apparently by the insurance arm of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Analysts said yesterday that the dollar was victim of a fundamental reassessment under way of the outlook for interest rates. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, commented: 'The recent policy moves of the Fed and Bundesbank have alerted us that we had pushed markets up to far. The markets most at risk are those where people were most optimistic at the beginning of the year.' Sterling recovered from an early loss against the D-Mark and finished at DM2.5475, up from DM2.5395 on Tuesday. Yesterday saw the monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Last month the meeting heralded a 25 basis-point cut in UK interest rates the following week. The Treasury in its monthly report prepared for the meeting described the latest monthly indicators as 'mixed but consistent with a trend of continuing recovery'. Analysts said the Treasury appeared to be talking up the UK recovery as the report downplayed some recent figures that hinted at economic weakness. Although this stance would be inconsistent with an easing of policy, last month's report was also bullish. Following the controversy which accompanied the last cut, however, the Bank was expected to proceed cautiously. Room for manoeuvre will also have been diminished by developments in Germany which have lessened the prospect there of an early lowering of rates. After forecasting a fairly large shortage of Pounds 1.95bn in UK money markets yesterday, the Bank of England dealt with most of this in its early round when it put Pounds 1.6bn liquidity into the market. Liquidity conditions were therefore much easier than on Tuesday, when overnight rates rose as high as 20 per cent. In further operations the Bank injected Pounds 309m into the market.</p>

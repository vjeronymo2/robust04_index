			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would allow apples to be imported into the United States from Spain under certain conditions. Spain's production of apples in 1993 was approximately 821,000 metric tons (mt). Spain's export level over the past 5 years has averaged 20,000 mt. In the unlikely event that Spain's apple exports were fully diverted to the United States, they would represent about 0.4 percent of U.S. production, an amount that would not significantly affect the U.S. market. Moreover, there would not be any off-season advantages, since Spain's main production season, June through September, inclusive, is the same as for U.S. apple producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the United States is a net exporter of apples. Total U.S. utilized production of apples in 1993 was 4,760,682 mt (fresh equivalent). (Utilized production of apples refers to the amount of apples sold plus the quantities of apples used on farms where grown and quantities of apples held in storage, thus those apples actually used in some way). Imports of fresh apples in 1992 totaled 120,412 mt, or 2.5 percent of domestic utilized production that year, whereas exports totaled 507,614 mt, or 10.7 percent. Given this trade flow, the U.S. market for apples is not expected to exhibit the excess demand in the near future that could encourage increased foreign supply. The main commercial varieties grown in Spain (Golden Delicious, 50 percent; Granny Smith, 30 percent) are common varieties in the United States, and their export, therefore, would not satisfy any special market demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Asparagus (White)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would allow white asparagus to be imported into the United States from Austria under certain conditions. Total U.S. asparagus production in 1993 was 2,204,000 hundredweight (cwt), or 99,973 mt. Austria's current production of asparagus is around 400 mt, 95 percent of which is white asparagus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APHIS expects that annual exports to the United States may reach between 1 and 2 tons. This quantity represents less than 0.002 percent of U.S. production, and therefore would not affect prices received by U.S. growers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Blueberries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would allow blueberries to be imported into the United States from Argentina under certain conditions. Total U.S. blueberry production in 1993 was 170,397,000 pounds, or 77,292 mt. About 40 percent was produced for the fresh fruit market, and about 60 percent was processed. APHIS estimates Argentina's current production of blueberries to be 40 mt per year, and we expect that figure to expand to 200 mt by 1997&hyph;98. At present, all blueberry exports from Argentina (80 percent of production) are sent to Europe. If approved for entry into the United States, we expect that 19.2 mt or 60 percent of blueberry exports from Argentina would be directed to U.S. ports. This quantity represents less than 0.03 percent of U.S. production, and therefore would not noticeably affect prices received by U.S. growers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Carambola  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would allow carambola to be imported into the United States from Taiwan under certain conditions. Carambola (starfruit) is not currently imported into the United States. Ninety percent of domestic production takes place in southern Florida, where 60 to 90 growers cultivate a total of about 400 acres. Most of the producers would be considered small entities, according to the Small Business Administration definition of annual gross receipts of $500,000 or less. U.S. production of carambola in 1994 will reach between 5 and 6 million pounds, a quantity expected to gradually increase as consumer familiarity with carambola grows. At present, carambola is unknown to most U.S. consumers, and the industry faces the challenge of creating broader market appeal for this fruit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Besides Florida, a relatively small amount of carambola is produced in Hawaii (58,400 pounds in 1992). A regulatory change last year now allows carambola grown in Hawaii to be marketed on the mainland. The initial volume to be shipped this year is estimated at 1,500 to 3,000 pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Taiwan is reportedly the world's largest producer of carambola. In 1992, 35,738 mt (78.8 million pounds) were produced, about 12 times that of the United States. However, less than 10 mt (0.03 percent) of Taiwan's production is exported annually, mainly to Hong Kong and Canada. As an initial trial shipment, about 1 mt is expected to be exported to the United States per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California is a large and growing domestic market for carambola and the likely destination of carambola from Taiwan. It receives from 40 to 50 percent of Florida's carambola crop. California requires that carambola from Florida be cold treated, and APHIS requires cold treatment for shipments from Hawaii to the mainland. Imports from Taiwan would also require cold treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green shoots appear on Colombia's arid savannahs - A rice pasture experiment that is yielding dramatic results THE FARMER looked bemused as he looked out on rice growing on flat savannah land in eastern Colombia. 'It's too good to be true,' he said. Crops are a rare sight in the infertile and acid soils of South America's huge savannah lands, which cover almost half the continent's agricultural area and are particularly extensive in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Although traditionally used for cattle ranching, the native savannah make poor pasture. But ten years of research at the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, in Cali, western Colombia has led to the development of a rice variety that grows in savannah soils. This could open the way for a substantial increase in both crop and livestock production on savannah lands, one of the last areas in the world not exploited by farmers. The centre's researchers now believe that the savannahs can sustain rice-pasture farming and that crops can be grown for the first time on up to 240m hectares (600m ha) of savannah land - larger than the area of sub-Saharan Africa under food crops. 'The savannahs represents most of the area in the world that can be expanded for agriculture,' says scientist Mr Richard Thomas. With rice-pasture agriculture, farmers plant their rice and pasture at the same time. After preparing and fertilising the land, they plant the rice in rows and scatter the pasture seeds, a mixture of improved grasses and legumes. Farmers harvest the rice after three to four months and then graze cattle on pasture. 'The legumes pull nitrogen from the air, thus acting as a free nitrogen fertiliser,' explains Mr Thomas. He estimates that they effectively provide between 40 and 80 kg of nitrogen per hectare a year. For the first farmers in Colombia who tried the new system in 1992, results were dramatic. In all, some 4,000 hectares of savannah were planted with the improved grasses, legumes and rice. The unirrigated rice - adequate rainfall makes irrigation unnecessary - yielded an average of 3.1 tonnes a hectare. In turn the quality of the pasture has been improved both by the new grasses and legumes and by the fertiliser that remains after producing rice; this means that farmers are able to increase the numbers of cattle on their land. Where they might have previously stocked one cow to every 10 ha, they can now start to think in terms of two animals a hectare - a 20-fold increase. The cattle also gain weight faster on rice-pasture land. Whereas farmers previously waited two years before taking their cattle to market, the centre's scientists are hopeful that they will now be able to sell within 15 or 16 months. Although there are large farms on the savannah lands, there are also many smallholders with between 100 and 200 ha who make only a meagre living on the poor soils. By changing to rice-pasture they can grow a crop, which they have not done before, keep substantially more cattle and make their farms profitable. There are also environmental benefits. Many savannah pastures are over-grazed and the system could help to recover these lands and help to ensure they are farmed on a sustainable basis. Mr Thomas believes that it could also be used in some Amazonian forest lands that have been badly damaged by indiscriminate logging. The centre's scientists stress that savannah soils are poor and that rice should not be planted continuously - 'for no more than three or four years', says agronomist Jose Ignatio Sanz. Farmers should then leave the land purely for pasture for several years before growing rice again. Nor should rice be planted on its own on savannah land. If the new rice variety is grown in monocropping fashion on the savannahs, it may produce well in the first year, but yields will be down to almost nothing by the third. 'We want farmers to understand that the system is fragile,' says plant breeder Mr Elcio Guimaraes.</p>

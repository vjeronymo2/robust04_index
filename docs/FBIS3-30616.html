			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Konstantin Subchev: "False Prophet"] </F>   [Text] Another legend in our new political mythology  collapsed with the rebellion of National Assembly members Mehmed  Hodzha and Receb Cinar, and that is that Ahmed Dogan commands an  "iron guard" in the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS]. The  disputed legitimacy of the DPS in Bulgarian political life and  the fresh memories of the "revival process," ensured an internal  unity and discipline within the DPS of which all other parties  were envious. In addition the DPS succeeded in implementing all  its demands regarding the Bulgarian Muslims' rights and  freedoms. However, it is impossible to live only by acquiring  the right to learn the mother language and the freedom to pray.  It was precisely the DPS supporters, especially those in the  southern parts of the country, who were most affected by the  shock therapy and the economic crisis. Consequently the stream  of tourists with a one-way ticket to Turkey has not stopped.    It was Ahmed Dogan himself who inflicted the heaviest blow  on  the DPS. The media created the aura of him as the best  Bulgarian politician, while his supporters elevated him to the  rank of a prophet. However, with his behavior, which resembles  that of an eastern sultan, and with his unclear sources of  income he provided his impoverished electorate with sufficient  reasons for dissatisfaction. In addition, his authoritarian  style of leadership and almost conspiratorial political contacts  created a conflict within the DPS leadership. Thus Ahmed Dogan  gradually became one of the numerous false prophets in Bulgarian  political life. According to both the Bible and the Koran such  prophets have an unenviable fate. However, perhaps the "Dogan  case" really is a part of a greater game?</p>

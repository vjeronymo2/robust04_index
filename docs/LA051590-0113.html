			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ruling Could Hamper Maxxam Refinancing: A Humboldt Superior Court judge has  ruled that any prospective buyer from or lender to Maxxam Inc.'s Pacific Lumber  forest products unit must be told that a pending lawsuit could award Pacific  Lumber's estimated $2.5 billion in timberland to the filer of the suit, Robert  Martel of Redway, Calif. The ruling denied a motion by Maxxam to remove from  the suit a lis pendens, or notice of pending action. The presence of such a  notice makes it more difficult for Maxxam to sell or refinance its subsidiary.  </P></p>

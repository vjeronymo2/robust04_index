			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON;  </P> <P> HOW DID MILT MCCOLL, NFL PLAYER AND ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON, COME TO MIRROR HIS  DAD'S LIFE SO PRECISELY?  </P> <P> ON THE TURF of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, at an L.A. Raiders game last  fall, outside linebacker Milt McColl -- 6-foot-6, 230 steel-cased pounds -- was  just another faceless warrior sporting the silver and black, an oak among oaks.  </P> <P> Three months into the off-season, in the crowded emergency room at San Jose's  Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, he is somewhat more conspicuous. Part of it  is his musculature -- a white lab coat doesn't quite conceal the kinetic body  so painstakingly honed to create mayhem in the NFL -- and part of it is his  height. He looms over his medical colleagues, more so because he stands so  erect, beeper clipped to one coat pocket, "Manual of Emergency Medicine"  protruding from another, obligatory stethoscope slung around his neck. Very  doctorly. Doctorly and big.  </P> <P> In his eighth-grade yearbook, Milt McColl wrote that he hoped to become a  professional athlete. No surprise. Just about everyone who knew Milt knew that  his old man had played pro football. Four years later, Milt's senior classmates  at South Hills High School in Covina voted him "most likely to succeed," and he  was asked to pose for a yearbook picture in career attire. He showed up wearing  surgical scrubs and wielding a butcher's knife. No surprise. Everyone knew that  Milt's dad was an orthopedic surgeon.  </P> <P> Milt won a football scholarship to Stanford, his father's alma mater; pledged  Zeta Psi, his father's fraternity, and starred on Stanford's football team, as  his father had done. But as graduation neared, the odds of his life continuing  to mirror his father's narrowed considerably. Football isn't exactly the most  accessible profession. Only one player in 30 makes the jump from college to the  National Football League, and many of those last just long enough for a rubdown  and a cup of Gatorade. For that matter, medical school has never been mistaken  for a day on the Seine. Either one, medicine or pro football, is a formidable  challenge by itself, the achievement of a lifetime for most. To stay on his  father's path, Milt had to conquer both -- and at the same time.  </P> <P> It used to be almost axiomatic: Sons followed in their father's tradition.  Blacksmiths' sons became blacksmiths, bakers' sons bakers. It's a little more  complicated now. A banker's son may become a banker, or he may resolve to be  anything but a banker. Some sons barely know their real father, live under a  different roof with a different man at the head of the table -- if indeed the  family sits together at a table. Or a son may know and like his father but have  no idea what he actually does for a living: "He works for Rockwell -- something  to do with computers."  </P> <P> For Milt McColl, explanations for having produced a virtual carbon copy of his  father's life don't come easily. Milt pursued the legacy not at his father's  urging, nor even upon great reflection, but instead almost instinctively, as  though guided by providence. He never observed his father in surgery or  accompanied him on hospital rounds. Milt simply gravitated toward his father's  achievements like water seeking equilibrium. "Sometimes I think I didn't think  about it as much as I could have," he says. "It just seemed natural."  </P> <P> In the '50s, Bill McColl earned his medical degree and completed an internship  and part of his orthopedics residency during an eight-year playing career with  the Chicago Bears. Milt, too, has played eight years in the NFL: seven with the  San Francisco Forty-Niners and one, last season, with the Raiders, all the  while pursuing his medical studies. He became an MD at Stanford in March, 1988,  taking almost seven years instead of Stanford's norm of four or five, and now  is nearing completion of his internship. Within the next year he will begin a  four- or five-year residency -- in orthopedics, of course.  </P> <P> Attempting such an unlikely amalgam of careers might never have occurred to  Milt had his father not shown what was possible. "I just felt that the way he  lived his life set a great example," Milt says. "That's why I've wound up doing  so many of the things he's done. Not because he wanted me to -- maybe he did --  but because it just seemed the way it should be."  </P> <P> THAT'S ALL a father can do, really -- set an example. And what an example Bill  McColl set. As a Stanford senior in 1952, he was thinking about play ing for  the Chicago Bears while studying medi cine at the University of Chicago. A  two-time All-American who played with fierce intensity, McColl was the scourge  of any team Stanford opposed, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound powerhouse whose renown  reached near-mythical proportions during his college career. He played seven  different positions -- offense and defense -- threw touchdown passes that  traveled 70 yards in the air and he seemed almost unstoppable when he had the  ball. A 1951 article in Sport magazine dubbed him "Gibraltar in a red jersey"  and told of tacklers "bouncing off him like peanuts pegged at an elephant."  McColl's face adorned the covers of Colliers, Sport and Sport Life magazines.  The Helms Athletic Foundation selected him as college football player of the  year. United Press named him lineman of the year. "If a coach had 11 McColls,"  former Stanford coach Marchie Schwartz once commented, "all he'd need to do  would be to blow up the football."  </P> <P> Bill McColl was selected by the Bears high in the NFL draft, but he had long  believed that medicine was his calling. His father was a physician, and  medicine was a proud tradition in the McColl lineage. Technically, he was  already in medical school at Stanford; the university allowed some students to  enroll after only three years of undergraduate work. Still, professional  football held an allure for him, and he wondered if there might be a way he  could play for the Bears while continuing in medicine.  </P> <P> University of Chicago Chancellor Lawrence Kimpton thought the very notion was  utterly absurd. In a letter to his friend Richard Balch, Stanford's dean of  students, Kimpton wrote: "Bill McColl must be nuts. You can't go to medical  school and play professional football at the same time. It's impossible.  Anyway, why doesn't he give up the game? There is no future in professional  football, but the future of the medical profession, unless the University of  Chicago succeeds in curing all the diseases, is pretty good. When you are in  medical school -- at least any good one -- you spend all your time on medicine.  You live it, eat it and think it, and you ain't traipsing around the country  playing football."  </P> <P> Obviously, Kimpton was correct about the future of medicine, but he was wrong  about everything else. While traipsing around the country as the Chicago Bears'  starting tight end, McColl kept pace with his class at the University of  Chicago Medical School, becoming an MD in 1955 after three years there. Four  years later, still serving his residency at the University of Illinois  hospitals, he retired from football to concentrate on medicine.  </P> <P> For the most part, McColl confined his medical studies to the off-season,  attending school in winter, spring and summer and then skipping the fall  quarter to play football. But he overlapped medicine and football during his  rookie season, just as Milt would do 30 years later. Actually, pro football  would have been unfeasible for McColl had it not been for the Bears' feisty  owner and coach, George Halas, who was remarkably tolerant of McColl's unusual  circumstances. Halas even rescheduled the Bears' daily practices from  afternoons to mornings during McColl's first year so that the sessions wouldn't  conflict with the rookie's classes. He had no choice but to be tolerant,  because McColl, before signing his contract (for $12,000, a  more-than-respectable sum in those days), insisted on a unique concession from  Halas: Whenever medicine and football conflicted, medicine would take  precedence. If McColl had to miss a practice or a meeting, or if, as was  invariably the case, he had to arrive late to training camp, Halas couldn't say  a word. On only a couple of occasions did the coach entreat his tight end to  temporarily reverse his priorities, in each case eliciting a reminder from  McColl: "But George, you promised." And that would be the end of it.  </P> <P> "He wanted me bad enough to sign that," McColl says now, with a hearty laugh,  obviously savoring the memory.  </P> <P> In 1962, three years out of football and with his residency completed, Bill  packed up his wife and their six young children and moved to Taegu, South  Korea, where for two years he worked as a medical missionary. The young doctor  divided his time between Presbyterian Hospital and Ae Rak Won Leprosarium,  where he did pioneer work in reconstructive surgery on leprosy patients. Though  he received only a subsistence allowance for his services in Taegu, he was  known to dip into his own pocket to cover medical expenses for people who  needed treatment but couldn't afford it. He found time as well to make weekly  trips to the Sungbo-Won Orphanage to visit the children and check on their  health.  </P> <P> Not long after his return to the United States, McColl was selected by the U.S.  Junior Chamber of Commerce as one of the country's Ten Outstanding Young Men, a  distinction he shares with such illustrious previous honorees as John F.  Kennedy and Leonard Bernstein. Still keenly interested in leprosy research and  treatment, he is chairman of the board of American Leprosy Missions. He is also  a member of the college football Hall of Fame and was selected to the NFL Hall  of Fame for his outstanding "service to humanity." His only significant defeats  have been political: three unsuccessful bids for U.S. Congress. In a nasty  primary in Orange County's 43rd Congressional District in 1982, McColl was  tainted by an opponent's charge of voter registration illegalities. Ultimately,  the San Diego County district attorney's office exonerated McColl, and a  Republican Party ethics panel censured his opponent, but McColl hasn't been  tempted to re-enter the political arena since.  </P> <P> Fifty-nine now, McColl isn't much over his playing weight, and he still moves  with unmistakable grace. He resides with his wife, Barbara, whom he met at  Stanford, in a stunning La Jolla home on a palisades overlooking Tourmaline  Beach. With orthopedic practices in Baldwin Park and San Diego, the doctor is  still making good use of what he learned in Chicago between Bears games. Of  merging the rigors of the NFL and medical school, he says, "It's not hard. It's  a matter of discipline."  </P> <P> BARBARA MCCOLL IS a slender, energetic woman with an impressive record of civil  involvement and service. If she joins an organization, she usually ends up  wielding the president's gavel. In this family, she explains, "you're expected  to achieve." When Bill and his sons used to toss a football around, they did so  because it was fun but also "because it gets you somewhere," Barbara says. "If  Milt wants to talk to you, . . there has to be a reason. It's not just to be  friendly, just to be a good guy."  </P> <P> Milt's wife, Cindy, observes this same dynamic between Milt and his father.  "They don't just sit together and sort of relax and shoot the breeze," she  says. "There's always a purpose in what they're doing."  </P> <P> Bill McColl knows no other approach to life. "That's the way the world is, you  know?" he says. "We go to church and we go to school and we go out for Little  League -- if you want. If you don't want to, then you don't. But you ought to  want to."  </P> <P> Desire has never been scarce in the McColl household. All six of Bill and  Barbara's children were superb students (one term they all brought home  straight A's), and all six graduated from Stanford. Four of them have MBAs.  Duncan, the oldest, was a football All-American and did a brief stint in the  NFL. John, a year older than Milt, distinguished himself on Stanford's  volleyball team. Bonnie was a Stanford song girl. Jennifer, the youngest,  recently entered Fuller Seminary. Only Milt, second-youngest and now 29, found  his father's shoes to be a perfect fit.  </P> <P> "God clears a path for the man who knows where he's going," Bill McColl used to  tell his progeny. That and things like, "The Lord helps the man in motion. But  if you're sitting on your duff, nothing happens."  </P> <P> "He always described himself as what's called the 'good-enough' father," Milt  says. "He always was very, very involved with what was going on, but he kept  his distance. My father has never been one to say, 'I think you should do  this,' or 'I think you should do that.' Never once did our parents say, 'We'd  like you to go to Stanford.' "  </P> <P> Certainly, though, the elder McColl must have recommended medicine to Milt as a  profession.  </P> <P> "I never talked to him about it at all," Bill says.  </P> <P> Football, then. Surely he urged Milt to play football.  </P> <P> A photo caption in a 25-year-old issue of Southern California Presbyterian  magazine suggests otherwise. The photograph, taken in South Korea, shows Bill  and his three little boys tossing a football around. "Will there be any more  All-Americans in the McColl family?" the caption asks, and then it quotes Dad:  "It's up to the boys if they want to play football. I wouldn't push them into  it, but I wouldn't say no, either, if the game appeals to them."  </P> <P> BY ALL ACCOUNTS, Milt is not quite the athlete his father was. Even Milt admits  that. He was named scholastic All-American at Stanford as a senior but was  ignored when the other All-America teams were named. Worse, he was ignored in  the 1981 NFL draft because the pros thought he was too slow and lacked the  necessary bulk. That came as a blow to a young man who had long been nurturing  the athlete's dream. In high school he just assumed he would take his rightful  place on an NFL team. "I thought I was a great player," he recalls. "I'd tell  myself, 'I'm going to play pro football. My dad did it and my brother's going  to, and I can do it, too."  </P> <P> Duncan, four years Milt's senior, did indeed do it. The Washington Redskins  picked him early in the 1977 NFL draft, Milt recounts. "And then, all of a  sudden, two years later, he's not playing any more. I started to realize, 'Wait  a second, it's not quite as easy as I thought it was gonna be.' " Midway  through Stanford at the time, Milt played his last two seasons of college ball  and then wondered which NFL team would give him a shot. When the call didn't  come on draft day, he was stunned. "I'd always thought I could do it and that I  had the ability," he says, "but reality sort of sunk in then."  </P> <P> Undrafted players have less than a 1% chance of winning a spot on an NFL  roster, but as any son of Bill McColl knows, the Lord helps the man in motion.  So Milt pumped up his resolve and headed for the broiling summer climes of  Rocklin, Calif., for a tryout at rookie camp with the 49ers, where the staff  included three of his former Stanford coaches.  </P> <P> Milt's chief linebacker rival was injured early in the camp ("Be prepared to  make your own luck," Bill McColl likes to say), so Milt found himself playing  every down, every practice, every day, . . in 100-degree heat. One day he  walked off the field after the morning scrimmage and collapsed on the  locker-room floor, bone weary and nauseated. "I looked up at the clock and  realized I was supposed to be back on the field in an hour for another  three-hour practice," he recalls. "And I said to myself, 'What an idiot I am!  I'm not even going to make the team!' " Discouraged, he telephoned "Gibraltar  in a red jersey." Gibraltar said: Keep working hard. You never know what's  going to happen.  </P> <P> In one dizzying week, Milt learned he had made the team and had been accepted  to Stanford Medical School.  </P> <P> Rookie camp was easy compared to the schedule that Milt kept during his rookie  season, when he played football by day and studied medicine nocturnally. A  typical day: Up at 6:45, breakfast, over to the 49ers' training facility by 8.  Films, meetings, strategy sessions, scrimmages, films, films, more films. Out  of there by 5 or 6, quick bite to eat, then over to Stanford to make up for the  day's missed classes. Specifically, two hours of fiddling with cadavers in a  deserted anatomy lab, two hours of microscope work in a deserted histology lab,  two hours of textbook study. Home by midnight or 1, five or six hours' sleep,  up at 6:45, do it all again.  </P> <P> Head coach Bill Walsh knew that Milt planned to study medicine, but he assumed  that the rookie would confine his schooling to the off-season. When he learned  otherwise, he summoned Milt to his office. During the season, Walsh explained  unequivocally , a professional football player must be completely focused on  football. The coach stopped short of ordering Milt to shelve medicine until the  off-season, but his preference was clear.  </P> <P> Milt remembers feeling "pretty blown away" as he left Walsh's office. "I felt  that if other guys could go out and drink at night, I could go home and study  medicine."  </P> <P> Discouraged, he telephoned Gibraltar, who said: Be the first guy in every day  and the last guy out at night. Show them how much you want to play.  </P> <P> Milt took his father's advice, and though he continued to piggyback medical  school and football, he never heard another complaint from Walsh.  </P> <P> Today Walsh remembers Milt McColl as a player who exhibited "a dedication and a  presence and a state of mind" he has rarely observed in other players. "Very  few people, athletes in particular, are able to project such time and  concentration into something and, at the same time, have a parallel career in  which they're able to give it the same kind of dedication."  </P> <P> Milt moved back and forth between his two worlds like a migrant following  crops, stressing football in summer and fall, medicine in winter and spring.  Medical school was often drudgery, and more than once he telephoned his  "good-enough father" for support and encouragement. Football seasons, on the  other hand, were welcome escapes. "People in pro football seem to make it out  as a rough existence," Milt says, "but in the real world -- well, I don't think  many of them have been in the real world . . . or know what it's like out  there." In the World According to Milt, pro football is a veritable joy ride.  "You basically work a 9-to-5 job . . . You're paid really well, you only work  six months a year . . . It's competitive and you're in the limelight. . . . I  go into medicine and I'm on call every third night, and I have to spend the  night at the hospital, and I work from 5 in the morning till 7 or 8 the  following night . . . about 36, 38 straight hours of work. Sometimes you get to  sleep, but not always. It's just part of the system. You have to do that to get  through it."  </P> <P> SANTA CLARA VALLEY Medical Center's emergency room is always bustling, in large  part because, as a county facility, it accommodates San Jose's underclass:  indigent alcoholics, schizophrenics, drug abusers, the homeless, criminal  suspects brought in by city police. At 6:15 on a Thursday evening, patients are  lined up on adjacent gurneys in partitioned treatment bays. Antiseptic and a  stale, sickly smell suffuse the room as gurneys are wheeled about by the staff  across ugly green linoleum. A disheveled man in police custody has become so  unruly that his arms and legs have been strapped to his gurney, and a physician  is sedating him. Somewhere, a woman is groaning in pain.  </P> <P> Dr. Milt McColl, on duty as part of the emergency-medicine rotation of his  12-month internship, appears oblivious to the distractions as he stands, arms  folded in front of him, and stares intently at illuminated X-rays of a woman's  chest. Not much in football translates to medicine, but McColl knows nothing if  not how to analyze films. The medium in football isn't X-rays, of course, but  the objective is the same: Determine where and why a system is weak. Sometimes  it seems to Milt that he has spent half his waking hours studying the  opposition for tendencies, patterns, a clue, a weakness -- any hint of  vulnerability, no matter how small. By NFL standards he is a master at it; it  has enabled him to survive for eight years in a league in which the average  career lasts only 3.6 years. When coaches speak of him, they inevitably refer  to his "astuteness for the game."  </P> <P> "He played smart football instead of just brute-force football," says Norb  Hecker, Milt's linebacker coach at Stanford and San Francisco.  </P> <P> In the judgment of new 49ers head coach George Seifert, the Niners' defensive  coordinator while Milt was with the club, "His understanding of defenses was  second to none, as far as the players I've worked with."  </P> <P> Off McColl's left shoulder, squinting at the X-rays with furrowed brow, is the  solicitous husband of the woman McColl is treating, a swarthy fellow wearing,  wouldn't you know, an L.A. Raiders jacket. But he hasn't the faintest idea his  wife is being treated by a Raiders linebacker. Given the zeal of the typical  NFL fan, if he knew, he might well be more interested in the doctor than the  diagnosis.  </P> <P> Such adulation may be a thing of the past for Milt McColl. After starting at  outside linebacker almost every game for the 49ers in 1986 and 1987, he was  traded to the Raiders, who used him primarily as a backup last season. During  the off-season, the Raiders fortified their linebacking corps, and in March  they told McColl they won't be needing his services this season.  </P> <P> With residency beckoning and a life of medicine to follow, Milt is infinitely  better positioned for this disappointing but inevitable juncture than are most  NFL players, many of whom have made no preparations whatsoever for a  post-football career.  </P> <P> Milt has an edge over his peers in medicine as well. With an NFL salary that  exceeded $200,000 the past few seasons and player shares from the 1981 and 1984  Super Bowls totaling $100,000, he is on financial high ground utterly foreign  to most doctors emerging from a costly medical education. The McColl family --  Milt and his wife, Cindy, and sons Connor, 20 months, and Kellen, 3 months --  recently moved into their new house, a modern, five-level foothill dwelling in  Los Altos Hills with a commanding 270-degree view of the Coast Range and San  Francisco Bay. Much of Milt's salary with the 49ers was deferred, so the  McColls are in good shape even if Milt has played his last down.  </P> <P> IT WAS AT precisely the same point in Bill McColl's life -- 29 years old,  eight-year NFL veteran -- that his own football career ended. Halas and the  Bears accommodated medical school, but ultimately medicine wouldn't accommodate  the Bears: The orthopedics faculty at the University of Illinois hospitals  voted 11 to 10 to ask Bill to quit the Bears and focus exclusively on his  residency. Presumably, the majority 11 weren't Bears fans.  </P> <P> McColl honored the vote without complaint, but he wishes he had it to do over.  "Today I would have asked to overrule the vote," he says. "I wanted to play  another season."  </P> <P> Milt would like to play another season as well, one more shared thread in lives  cut from the same cloth. "It's hard to ignore the fact that you can only play  football for so long," he says, "but you can be a doctor for the rest of your  life." Keep your options open, his father used to say. That maxim is now as  integral to Milt's philosophy as it is to Bill's. And as the years unfold,  Milt's example may well endow his own children with the same hopeful outlook,  the same expansive sense of opportunity. Would he want to see his sons emulate  him as closely as he emulated his father, extend the McColl tradition of MDs  playing in the NFL? "I feel the same way my father did," Milt says. "If that's  what they want to do, I certainly will support them, but it's up to them. All I  can do is give them the pros and cons of what I've been through." In that, as  so much else, he is his father's son.  </P> <P> Milt may have acquired the best qualities of each of his parents -- or so Bill  McColl was musing not long ago. By Bill's reckoning, Milt owes, at the very  least, his grace, tact, considerate nature and sociability to his mother.  </P> <P> Satisfied with that pronouncement, Bill falls silent and so must be prompted:  What does Milt owe to his father?  </P> <P> His face clenches in concentration as though he is hard-pressed to think of  even one of Milt's virtues for which he could possibly take credit.  Unacknowledged, perhaps because it is too obvious, or maybe for modesty's sake,  is Milt's athletic prowess.  </P> <P> Suddenly, Bill McColl's face brightens. "My size," he says with a great,  unbridled laugh. "Milt's got my size."  </P></p>

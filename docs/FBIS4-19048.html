			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Top Republikaner Candidate Protects </F> Skinheads"]    [Text] Uwe Goller, land chairman and top candidate of the  North Rhine-Westphalian Republikaner for the European election,  has obviously covered up the fact that party colleagues of his  were involved in an attack on an asylum-seeker's hostel. This  can be concluded from documents available to the North  Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution.    On 7 October 1991, skinheads attacked a temporary housing  camp in Bergheim near Cologne. The perpetrators managed to  escape.    Two years later, the Executive Committee of the Republikaner  in the Mittelrhein district discussed the involvement of a  leading functionary in the attack. According to the minutes of  the meeting, a party member declared in lieu of an oath that the  functionary had told him that he had planned the attack,  participated in it, and then hid his friends in his basement.  Land Chairman Goller was informed. He and his deputy met with  the "denouncer." The result: The man withdrew his statement.  Despite the findings about Republikaner involvement in crimes,  North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Minister Schnoor (Social  Democratic Party of Germany) does not want to apply for a ban:  "The party must be opposed by political means."</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Travel: Purpose-built on a swamp - Practical Traveller / Washington Washington DC was staked out of a swamp in 1790 by George Washington and was the first city to be built as a national capital. It was designed by a Frenchman with Paris in mind. The result: wide, tree-lined avenues radiating like a spike from the Capitol and White House, fountains, monuments, parks and no building that is taller than the dome on the Capitol. In spring the trees are covered with cherry blossom; in December white lights glitter on black branches. It is a city of power politics and diverse neighbourhoods: Capitol Hill, Georgetown, Chinatown, multi-cultural Adams Morgan, exclusive Dupont Circle. If you are exploring on foot, the street numbers get smaller as you near the Capitol. North/south streets are numbered, east/west have letters. There are Tourmobile sightseeing buses, old Town Trolleys - you can get on and off as often as you like - and Metrobus. (Metro information: tel: 202-637-700 for advice). Metrorail (a one-day pass costs Dollars 5) is possibly the cleanest subway system in the world - some parts have carpets - and easy to follow. Taxis are reasonably priced. (A taxi driver from Sierra Leone told me he thought the US was still the only place where dreams came true, but advised against venturing into Washington's derelict eastern areas). There are riverboats, canal barges and helicopter flights. Hotel rates are lowest at week-ends, around holidays, during mid-winter and late summer. Many offer free rates for children. The Washington DC Convention and Visitors Association has lists of all categories of accommodation, and bed &amp; breakfast (luxury and budget) can be booked through agencies, though there is a booking fee. Fitness enthusiasts are well-catered for in several hotels. The ANA Hotel's superb health centre (2401 M Street, NW) covers 16,000 sq ft and is packed with gadgets; there is an exercise physiologist on the staff. The Capital Hilton has jogging routes in its centre, and 250 non-smoking bedrooms. Washington has more than 50 museums and 70 art galleries, almost all of which are free and open seven days a week. The Smithsonian National Air &amp; Space museum - nearly 8m visitors a year - is the world's most-visited museum, while the national museums of natural and American history are not far behind. The White House, the only head-of-state mansion in the world open to the public without charge, is 19th in visitor popularity, while the Smithsonian's Anacosta museum comes to the aid of the museum-weary with a free bus which makes three round trips to its other museums on the National Mall. Several new museums worth noting: the US Holocaust Memorial museum (Independence Avenue and 14th St, SW); the National Postal museum (City Post Office Building, Capitol Hill); the Smithsonian's Freer Gallery of Art (1200 Jefferson Drive, SW), which has a collection of work by Asian and 19th and 20th century American artists. The Department of the Treasury offers one-hour guided tours on Saturday mornings - a week's advance registration is required (tel: 202-622-0896), plus photographic ID on the day. Not new, but worth visiting, is the Pentagon (202-695-1776). Information about entertainment can be found in the Friday edition of the Washington Post and the weekly CityPaper. Half-price tickets to most events, including sport, can be obtained on the day of performance from Ticket-place in the lobby of Lisner Auditorium at 21st &amp; H Sts, NW (tel: 202 TIC-KETS for information.) Brochures, free maps and advice are available at the Washington Visitor Information Center, 1455 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, or tel: 081-392-9187 in the UK. Companies offering short-breaks and longer holidays in Washington from the UK include: United Vacations (081-313-0999); Kuoni Travel (0306-742222); British Airways Holidays (0293-615353); and North America Travel Service, which has offices in Leeds, Nottingham, Manchester and Barnsley.</p>

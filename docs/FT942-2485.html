			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Manifesto for the masses The best of miracles, said GK Chesterton, is that they sometimes happen. Possibly; but our own century's apparent miracles have a way of backfiring, or emerging as mountebank's legerdemain or the self-deluding optimism of the faithful. Recent revivals of A Doll's House have reminded us of Ibsen's conviction that sexual equality would require a miracle in people's attitudes. And another great dream of our time, the Utopia formulated by communism in response to Marx's theories, is still wistfully or bitterly lingering in the cold dawn of triumphant market forces. Manifesto at Battersea Arts Centre, aptly installed in the paternalistically self-assertive architecture of the old town hall in Lavender Hill, is a threnody for communism that almost turns into the kiss of life. Volcano Theatre Comany, directed by Nigel Charnock, presents physical, stylised performance. They have adapted work by Steven Berkoff and Tony Harrison but for their latest show has no specific author. Manifesto draws from sources as diverse as Arthur Koestler and the Dadaists; the French Revolution and Mayakovsky; above all, Marx and Engels. A sloping ramp like an indoor ski-track is manipulated in the course of this 75-minute exercise. The company comprises four men and two women who play with lithe grace, sinewy elegance and a mixture of menace and irony. At times the text becomes a kaleidoscope of the cliches of political jargon. All sides are given a hearing or, if you prefer, allowed to condemn themselves: revolutionaries, fat cats, liberals, reactionaries, artists and philistines. Other certainties besides death and taxes emerge: that the bourgeoisie ultimately gets clobbered by everyone; and that no Lloyds name should underwrite a creative artist in times of social upheaval. Images and music range from dancers spouting dialectic as they niftily execute Fred and Ginger numbers; and a prisoner's blindfolded eyes as they no less niftily execute him. Words include first-person recollections of political violence against the bosses of industry, and the pleasantly materialistic credo of a successful businesswoman. After about an hour the elegiac tone for the Utopia that never was leads to an apparent ending and applause. The actors sidle back, glaring at the audience, pretending to spot such contemptible types as the 'Guardian-reading pseudo-feminist new man radical', though mercifully not the costive, jaded note-scribbling Financial Times theatre critic. The company has a gift for the striking tableau, the acrobatic tumble, the sculptural grouping. Nothing much is settled, nothing finalised, no decision reached, except perhaps that revolutionary politics is still a primal soup from which something terrible or beautiful or ploddingly mundane may come. The sad little realisation, perhaps, that man is a competitive creature; collectivity is not in the nature of the beast. Full marks for vigour, freshness and passion. I am still not sure about the miracle.</p>

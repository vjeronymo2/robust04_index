			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (4): Information at your fingertips - Credit-Checking Services / A look at on-line information services for credit controllers, marketing executives and business analysts THIS MORNING postmen will be delivering around 13,000 summonses, 6,500 county court judgements and 150 bankruptcy orders to Britain's debtors - both corporate and individual. The anxiety caused by this 'paupers' progress' is not only felt by the insolvent themselves. It also causes considerable grief to credit-controllers as each debt represents a costly failure in terms of administrative expense, as well as the impact of the debt itself. A perfect system for credit control will never exist, but on-line systems are proving superior to relying on hunches or even in-house analysis, when assessing potential clients. 'Apart from making for quicker decisions when a salesman has found a new customer, it also saves the need for in-house expertise in analysing accounts,' comments Guy Glover, finance manager for British Steel Pounds 350m-a-year welded tubes business. The established credit vetting agencies like CCN, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Infocheck have provided on-line access to their databases for several years. These give details of corporate accounts, county court judgements and - most importantly - their credit view on hundreds of thousands of British companies. International databases are accessible through services such as Infocheck's Global Scan which provides instant access to information on most European Countries as well as South Africa and Canada. 'The appealing thing about Global Scan is that you can see through the index which countries a company like Colgate, for example, has a presence in - so you don't waste your time looking in overseas databases in countries where it does not exist,' says Mercury's Guy Robinson. Furthermore, if clients need information on, say, a German company, 'they used to have to hunt around for a week for it. Now they have access to that and other information from one source,' says Simon Underwood of Global Scan. 'Our custom service also provides information on any private or public company in any country in the world within, at most, three weeks.' On-line 'libraries' of business databases are now being built up by companies including BT and Mercury - 'this is one-stop shopping for information. You don't have to have separate subscriptions to each database and our help-desk acts as an honest broker as to which is the best service for your needs,' says David Rosenbaum, of BT Tymnet, which provides access through both Telecom Gold and Prestel. Such services certainly cut down on bad debt. The Charity Christmas Card Council's use of the CCN database through Prestel has helped keep its bad debt total down to Pounds 2,000 out of a Pounds 2m turnover. Where potential customer's credit references may be dubious, it insists on payment in advance and last autumn found that six of these businesses failed to send in a cheque. 'One of these was a firm which CCN showed had four county court judgements against it during the previous 12 months,' says 4C's Neville Bass. 'Lo and behold, two weeks later they appeared in the Gazette after going bust.' With on-line credit-checking services, the main drawback for some users is the cost which, with BT, is Pounds 3.15 a minute - 'there are simply too many pages on each report which you have to wade through before you get to what you really need which are the county court judgements and the credit view,' comments Mr Bass, who finds that the average search takes around four minutes. 'You start to wonder whether they put in a lot of guff just to keep you on-line. It's like the long announcements on the 0898 numbers seem to be designed to clock up the bill. And about quarter of the time there's no credit view - just a message saying: 'Sorry, these accounts are being updated.' ' BT is aware that time-based pricing is proving unpopular, particularly among less-experienced users - 'we are already beginning to introduce 'per report' pricing and intend to phase in this method for all our high-value services,' explains David Rosenbaum. Direct access to particular databases will, however, continue to be cheaper for those using over a few hundred reports a year because of the bulk discounts which are offered by the databases. 'For high-number, low-value orders, Infocheck is delightful because it is simple and straightforward. 'All the other databases can be a sledge-hammer to crack a nut,' comments British Steel's Guy Glover. 'On ICC and CCN, the information is a great deal more sophisticated and useful but the cost of getting in is fairly high.' His division has bought 'unlimited access' to Infocheck but he also uses both BT's Prestel and Telecom Gold as an additional executive tool  - 'they offer services galore and are instantly available. For example, this morning I went into FT Profile to see what the papers were saying about a possible merger which we're interested in.' A communications package enables him to dial into Prestel and take 'snapshots'' of certain pages which are then saved on to his disk. 'It takes less than two minutes on-line and then, if any ofthe information is interesting, such as company news or foreign exchange rates, I can dial-in for more details.' Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a market leader in credit-rating is generally only on-line to direct customers, although it is in negotiations with BT and Mercury. 'I have a greater 'hit rate' when looking for a particular company when I'm using Dun &amp; Bradstreet,' says one finance director, 'because it includes trade names and not just formal company names. But the expense of the service has often meant that, having found the company, I then switch to a cheaper service to do the credit check.' In reaction to such criticism, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Philip Mellor says that, over the past few weeks, the company has introduced 'the facility to select items from an individual report rather than take the whole report.' He claims that 'no other database also has such a comprehensive payment analysis system as ours which shows the delay in payment over the past 18 months for companies in comparison with their industry sector.' Rival databases emphasise different strengths - Infocheck's Ray Ruffles says 'our direct customers also get access to our instant on-line credit insurance service, as well as free usage of our added-value services, including company news and monitoring.' Mercury admits that its credit checking library is 'still in its infancy,' but it does seem well-placed to take advantage of the growth in the market. Last year it secured a contract with Companies House to be the sole on-line outlet for its database. 'It has become a magnet for all the other business information databases as they want to appear on the same menu as Companies House,' says Mercury's Guy Robinson. Mercury has also signed a letter of intent for a five-year contract with the British Chambers of Commerce for its Chambernet database which should be on-line in November. This DTI-sponsored project aims to enable users to produce lists of information such as which companies produce a given product, which companies import or export from a specified country as well as lists of company officials such as IT directors. Mercury has also been invited to join an EC-funded consortium to produce a pilot scheme for a European business register. Although Mercury's vision of a system providing pan-European credit-checking and marketing information is alluring, the obstacles to its realisation range from the incompatibility of European accounting standards to the difficulties of translating the Greek alphabet. Meanwhile, the key decision for financial controllers is to find which one or more databases offer the information they require - and the cheapest form of accessing it. Otherwise the credit checking bill might be greater than the savings in bad debts.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Hekmatyar 'runs training camps for Tajik insurgents' MR Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the hardline Islamic Afghan leader is operating training camps for anti-government forces in Tajikistan, bolstering the already-powerful opposition, according to KGB and diplomatic sources. The military aid is fueling the warfare that has plagued the Central Asian nation of 5m people ever since the Soviet Union was dissolved in December. Fighting has killed between 500 and 2,000 people in the last three months. More than 100,000 non-combatants have fled, mostly Uzbeks and other non-Tajiks who have been attacked by Tajik nationalists, officials say. Tajik officials say President Rakhmon Nabiyev's control is effective in just one of Tajikistan's five regions. Three or four hundred men have already been armed in camps run by Mr Hekmatyar near the northern Afghan town of Imam Sahib, and returned to Tajikistan to fight, said Col Jurabek Aminov, Tajikistan's deputy KGB chief, speaking in the capital of Dushanbe. He said 400 more were under training in the camps.</p>

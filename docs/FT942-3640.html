			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Factory output prices subdued Britain's producer price figures for May presented a mixed picture of inflationary trends, with subdued price rises for finished goods somewhat overshadowed by an upturn in the cost of fuel and raw materials. The Central Statistical Office reported that the price of goods from UK factories in May increased at the lowest annual rate since December 1986, suggesting no immediate danger of output prices boosting consumer price inflation. But prices for materials and fuel purchased by industry showed their fourth consecutive seasonally-adjusted, month-on-month increase, reflecting higher oil and commodity prices. This end six months in which input prices fell compared with the same month a year before. The output price index, which is not seasonally adjusted, increased by 0.1 per cent between April and May and was up 2 per cent in May compared with May last year. Excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, the output index - this time seasonally adjusted - was also up by 0.1 per cent on the month and 2 per cent on the year. The CSO said this index, which is considered a good guide to underlying trends, showed an annualised increase of only 1.1 per cent in the three months to the end of May compared with the previous three months. By contrast, the seasonally-adjusted index for input prices increased by 0.9 per cent in May compared with April. On an unadjusted basis the input price index rose 0.7 per cent during the month and was unchanged compared with May last year. The Treasury welcomed the lower-than-expected output price rise but warned that it was important that industry's 'good performance on cost control' should continue in the light of higher input prices.</p>

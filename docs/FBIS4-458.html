			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial comment: "Cyclone Nadia for the General State </F> Budget"]    [Excerpt] (Maputo) The Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] has been preaching to the government because of the  skeletal budget that has been awarded the university but, then,  it goes along with a proposal for high subsidies for members of  the National Elections Commission, CNE. In other words, a CNE  member earns more money in two months than the amount that has  been budgeted for the running of the Faculty of Economy.    The unarmed opposition has often accused the government of a  lack of clarity and austerity in public spending. They are  quite right. However, so far none of the three members who  represent the unarmed opposition in the CNE appears to have come  forward to protest this proposal for such high subsidies and  benefits.    This CNE proposal is ideal for the Mozambique Liberation  Front [Frelimo], which has 10 members in the CNE. Those 10  people will be earning fabulous salaries -- particularly by  comparison with the minimum wage -- and Joaquim Chissano can now  start saying: "look, Frelimo costs so much but the opposition,  if it wins the upcoming elections, will cost three times as  much."    It looks, therefore, like the CNE and its appetites may yet  be the Cyclone Nadia that the General State Budget needed to  become as ravaged as Nampula Province. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Veba chief killed MR Klaus Piltz, chairman of Veba, Germany's fourth-largest industrial group, was killed in an avalanche on Easter Monday, the company said yesterday. Two of his three children, Uta and Klaus, and a family friend also died in the accident in Oetztal, Austria, Christopher Parkes reports from Frankfurt. Mr Piltz, 57, took control of the energy-to-retailing conglomerate less than four years ago after the death of Mr Rudolf von Bennigsen-Foerder. His main contribution to the Dusseldorf-based company was to restructure his predecessor's acquisitions, rather than sell them off as expected. He moulded a group with distinct but interlocking interests in energy, chemicals, petrol stations, retailing, transport and distribution.</p>

			<p>CSO       [NAFTOVA I GAZOVA PROMYSLOVIST Jul-Sep 93, etc.]  [Editorial report] New oil and gas fields with potential for  industrial exploitation have been discovered in Ukraine thanks  to novel exploration methods (Kiev NAFTOVA I GAZOVA PROMYSLOVIST  [OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRY] No. 3 Jul-Sep 1993). Two gas deposits  and  10 fields containing both oil and gas were detected at the  northern edge of the Dniepr-Donets Depression, the main oil and  gas producing region of Ukraine. The newly discovered fields  are believed to contain over 250 million tons of hydrocarbons,  and the stratigraphic range of the commercially exploitable oil  and gas deposits is over 1000 meters. This is the first time  that industrial quantities of hydrocarbons have been found in  Ukraine in crystalline basement rock, which was previously  considered to be unpromising for exploration. The deposits'  relative proximity to the surface means that they can be  exploited with existing equipment, material and technology, and  without foreign investors. These circumstances heighten the  significance of the discovery for Ukraine, which lacks the  materials and equipment required to explore its main hydrocarbon  reserves, located at depths of 5,000 to 10,000 meters (Moscow  IZVESTIYA 12 Sep 92). The deposits have the added advantage of  being located near large industrial users in Kharkhov, Okhtyrka  and Sumy.    The new exploration techniques consist of a set of highly  accurate and efficient nonstandard geophysical surveys developed  for detecting oil and gas in sedimentary mantle and crystalline  basement rock. One innovation, conducting zonal seismic surveys  longitudinally along discordant faults, made it possible to  detect fairly long lines of folds rapidly and prepare them for  exploratory drilling. Seismostratigraphic analysis was used to  detect untraditional forms, such as horst, paleovalleys and wide  fractured zones, which characterize structure in sedimentary  mantle. The authors of the NAFTOVA I GAZOVA PROMYSLOVIST  article proved experimentally that low-value anomalies in  pseudoacoustic and pseudointerval rates associated with  fractured rock zones are caused by high porosity and, for the  most part, with gas saturation. These survey methods were  developed under a state program drafted by the authors and can  be used in other territories of Ukraine.    Ukraine has been seeking to reduce its 80 percent dependence  on gas imports from Russia and Turkmenistan by boosting domestic  production, now at one-third its 1990 level. A comprehensive  national program ``Ukrainian Gas and Oil to 2010'' is addressing  problems in oil and gas exploration, production, and processing  (Kiev DEM0KRATYCHNA UKRAYINA 3 Jul 93).</p>

Today, the Defense  Ministry said: The ministry is examining a plan to introduce  new types of missiles because the Nike Hercules missile our  military has is too old and the Hawk missile has limitations for  improvement. The ministry also said that it is examining the  Patriot missile and the ERINT [extended-range interceptor  missile], which the U.S. Defense Department had recently decided  to introduce.</p>

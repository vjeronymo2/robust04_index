			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Brussels plan on cross-border jobs set to fail A European Union draft directive to provide basic employment rights for workers posted by their employers to work in another EU country looks set to fail at a special meeting of EU social affairs ministers called to discuss it in Brussels today. Ministers appear to have been unable to reach agreement during the past fortnight ago over the controversial directive, which many European employers see as a burden on business. The Commission wants the directive to set up minimum legal standards for posted workers to prevent them being exploited, through undercutting of local labour market standards. Mr Michael Portillo, the UK's employment secretary, is likely to draw comfort from the disarray among the member states over the directive. Portugal, Greece and Italy are sceptical of the proposal as many employers fear it would force them to increase pay for seconded workers in member states with higher wages. 'Bar a miracle today, the directive will not get through the Council. It is getting more difficult all the time', a Commission official said yesterday. However, Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU's social affairs commissioner, will not give up pressing for legislation covering posted workers during the French presidency of the EU, beginning on January 1. Today's probable outcome will be a setback to Mr Norbert Blum, Germany's labour minister, who had hoped to crown Germany's presidency of the EU with a victory over an issue that has troubled the Commission for years. But it now seems likely it will be left to each member state to decide whether or not to introduce domestic legislation to protect indigenous employers from competition through lower-cost labour used by foreign companies. 'Mr Portillo should not crow about this. The EU directive would have been a minimalist measure. Now there is a real danger that some EU states will bring in laws that will undermine the position of posted workers', an official said. Divisions in the Council centre on how long a worker has to be posted to be covered by the directive. Some ministers want it to apply to all posted workers while others favour a four to six-month period before it applies.</p>

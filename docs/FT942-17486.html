			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Water chiefs urged to fight curbs: Institutions press for Ofwat's likely proposals to be referred to MMC Two of the UK's biggest fund managers are urging water companies to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than accept tough price limits that could be set by Ofwat, the water industry regulator. In an unprecedented move against the regulator of a privatised industry, Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management and the Prudential, the UK's largest institutional investor, have written to water company managers. They are concerned that water company profits and dividends will suffer if a forthcoming review by Ofwat is too harsh. Their move marks a new level of investor activism over the way privatised utilities are regulated. Several utilities, notably British Gas which took its case to the MMC, have resisted regulators' proposed price caps. However, this is believed to be the first time leading investors have intervened by pressing managers to consider an MMC referral. The institutions' move not only pits them against the regulator but also consumer groups which welcomed the long-term review of prices when it was announced in November by Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, with a promise to 'get customers off the endless price escalator'. Ofwat will decide this summer by how much more than inflation water companies can raise bills between 1995 and 2000. Its decisions will be announced on July 28. The Prudential's letter said: 'We do regard it as important that if the company is forced to operate under financial constraints which fail to reflect an appropriate balance between the interests of shareholders and customers, then the company should be prepared to seek a reference to the MMC.' Both institutions disagree with the way Ofwat sets price limits. They question the rate of return on capital the regulator has said it will allow companies to earn, and its method of calculating each company's capital value. Any successful appeal to the MMC would have to show that Ofwat's methodology was flawed. In its letter, the BZW offshoot said: 'In view of the risks to long-term value inherent in Ofwat's assumptions, we believe there would be much to gain by challenging them, even if this involves an appeal to the MMC.' The companies sent strategic business plans to the regulator last Thursday. They are due to be given Ofwat's draft decisions on May 20. Each company will be able to raise objections at a meeting with the regulator in June before final price limits are published. Mr Byatt said recently price increases proposed by the companies in the business plans - which on average allow for an increase well above the rate of inflation - would be unacceptable to customers. The water industry argues that the rises are needed to pay for modernising the infrastructure of drains and treatment plants, and to bring water quality up to the standards specified in European Union directives. Mr Byatt has said he is considering cutting the rate of return water companies have been allowed to earn since their privatisation in 1989. He argues this was set at a deliberately high level to attract new investors. With the industry well established, Ofwat argues the risks are lower, and companies should fund future improvements through greater efficiency or higher borrowing.

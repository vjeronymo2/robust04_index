			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / LDP's public spending package Liberal Democratic party leaders yesterday signalled they stand ready to stimulate the economy with another public spending package early this spring if the economy is still in the doldrums, writes Charles Leadbeater. A special LDP task force which is considering extra measures to boost the economy is likely to recommend further proposals aimed at stabilising the financial system which is beset by mounting bad debts. Separately Mr Kabun Muto, head of the LDP's tax panel, added his weight to business leaders' recent calls for a temporary income tax cut of about Y6,000bn (Pounds 30bn) to be introduced in the summer. The economy's weakness was underlined by the 0.5 per cent contraction in the money supply last year with December 1991, the fourth month of contraction, according to figures published by the Bank of Japan. Japan's money supply expanded by just 0.6 per cent last year, compared with growth of 3.6 per cent in 1991.</p>

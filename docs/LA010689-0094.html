			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP SEEKS TO AIM ANTI-SMOKING DRIVE AT CHILDREN  </P> <P> Reasoning that the best way to break the smoking habit is to stop it before it  begins, sponsors of the successful tobacco tax initiative Proposition 99 said  Thursday they want to focus their anti-smoking education campaign on school-age  children.  </P> <P> "We want to teach every child about the hazards of smoking," said Dr. W. James  Nethery, chairman of Coalition for a Healthy California. He added that "90% of  all smokers start by the age of 19, and 60% begin by the age of 14."  </P> <P> Key members of the coalition are the American Lung Assn., the American Cancer  Society, the American Heart Assn., the Planning and Conservation League and the  California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems.  </P> <P> Proposition 99 imposed a 25-cent-a-pack tax increase on cigarettes and placed  comparable tax hikes on cigars and other tobacco products. The roughly $650  million a year raised by the new taxes will go into anti-smoking education  campaigns, health care, cancer research and enhancement of natural resources.  </P> <P> The anti-smoking education campaign is part of a proposed five-part legislative  program to implement the initiative that was unveiled here and in Los Angeles  on Thursday by Proposition 99 sponsors.  </P> <P> Nethery and others said they are bracing for what they think may be a battle  over the money because state funds are being stretched to the limit by another  November ballot initiative, Proposition 98, the school funding measure.  </P> <P> David Langness, an official of the American Heart Assn. in Los Angeles, said:  "This is the first major new source of revenue for government since the passage  of Proposition 13 (the property-tax cut measure) in 1979. The barracuda will be  out."  </P> <P> The plan put forward by the Proposition 99 coalition envisions that the $650  million in new revenues would be split this way: $292.5 million would go to  hospitals and doctors to defray medical treatment costs for those not covered  by public or private insurance; $130 million would go into an education fund;  $32.5 million for research on a cure for lung cancer, heart disease and other  tobacco-related illnesses and $32.5 million into a natural resources account  for park and wildlife enhancement projects.  </P> <P> The remaining money, roughly $162.5 million, would go into a general account  that would be distributed to various unspecified programs that would be  approved by a special committee.  </P> <P> As for the education fund, sponsors of Proposition 99 said they want  legislation that will earmark 70% of all the money for programs aimed at  school-age children.  </P> <P> School districts would be eligible to apply for the Proposition 99 money, but  so would community clinics, volunteer health agencies, local health departments  and hospitals and community clinics.  </P></p>

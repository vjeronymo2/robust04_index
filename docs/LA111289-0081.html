			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC IN THE SOUTH  </P> <P> Jim Newton's article (Oct. 30) on the problems of Mission Viejo caused by the  development going on around the south Orange County area is a well-expressed  view of our city's concern about the traffic problem posed by this population  explosion.  </P> <P> The puzzling thing about this article, though, is how anyone can do any  research, whatsoever, on this subject without underlining and repeatedly  emphasizing the obvious lack of responsibility by Orange County's supervisors  for permitting this development without first assuring that transportation  access was adequate to cope with it.  </P> <P> In this responsibility, our supervisors have been deplorably remiss.  </P> <P> BRUCE H. PLANCK  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

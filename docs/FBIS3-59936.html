			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Dubyna: "Will American Sisyphus Disarm </F> Us?"]    [Text] In a LOS ANGELES TIMES article dated November 23  1993, a high official representing the United States  administration commented on the U.S.-Ukrainian negotiations on  nuclear disarmament in the following way: "Our negotiations with  Ukraine remind me of the tale about Sisyphus. When you think  that you have managed to push the stone up the hill you suddenly  realize that the stone is again lying at the foot of this hill."    Why does the American Sisyphus want to do this ungrateful  work? It is not difficult to guess. Ukrainian missiles are  targeted at the United States and can smash it in seconds.  Given the unstable political situation that can go out of  control at any time, the U.S. strategists do not exclude the  possibility that a fervent Cossack can press a missile button  just to frighten those Americans overseas.    Currently, Ukraine does not lay any claims to the United  States: This state has not yet done anything good or bad to it.  Next, if we even wanted to press this missile button we would  be unable to do so because Russia controls 176 missiles and  nuclear warheads stationed on the Ukrainian territory. No  doubt, this situation disturbs Washington because the United  States cannot guarantee that Russian chauvinists and  nationalists dreaming of world domination will not come to power  tomorrow. Americans cannot but notice the transformation of the  Russian Government after the latest October events. Since  then, the Russian Government has adopted a range of "strong"  decrees including the Russian military doctrine and Russian  Foreign Intelligence Doctrine "Prospects for NATO Development  and Russia's Interests."    Russian President Boris Yeltsin continues writing letters to  Western leaders while Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is enraged  with Ukraine because it has ratified the START-I Treaty.    I would like to emphasize that the issue of Russian  democratic chauvinism is not yet on the agenda, because the  political situation is unstable. I would like to recall that  the internal strengthening of Russia has always led to its  foreign expansion. One more thing: Enormous Russian potential  had always enabled it to quickly recover from various natural  calamities. This happened in the 17th century, when Russia was  almost enslaved by Poland in the Smolensk War (1633-1634).  However, in some 20 years, Russia began waging military  operations against Ukraine. One hundred years later, after  Russia was defeated in the shameful Crimean war in 1853-1856, it  strengthened its positions in the Balkans after a successful war  with Turkey in 1877-1878. Again, after a disastrous civil war  in 1918-1921, Russia began making claims on the international  community.    Washington knows history all too well and ponders on the  possibility of the revival of Russian international influence.  If Ukraine does not overcome its critical financial situation  by the time Russia regains its power, our state will lose its  independence. If this happens, Ukrainian nuclear missiles will  become Russian property; however, they will be directed at the  United States. This explains why Washington Sisyphuses are  aiming at the destruction of Ukrainian missiles as soon as  possible.    Moscow supports Washington Sisyphuses in conducting their  negotiations with Ukraine because, first, Russia could  appropriate Ukrainian strategic nuclear arms, and, second,  Russian strategists are anxious that the Ukrainian party could  retarget its missiles from the United States at Russia. It was  not accidental that when Ukraine slowed down the process of  disarmament in spring, the Russian mass media launched a wild  campaign claiming that Ukraine could acquire control over  nuclear missiles. Does this mean that Russia thinks that a  nonnuclear state could be easily subordinated? I want to  underline that if things go this way, the United States will be  unable to guarantee our security. By the way, they are not  going to do it at all.    U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher put it quite clearly  when he visited Kiev in October. His joint press conference  with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko went like this:    [Christopher] At first, you should disarm, then you will get  money.    [Zlenko] At first, you give us money, next, we begin  disarming.    We require an enormous sum of money -- some $2.8-5 billion.  Will the American Sisyphus grant us this money? I doubt it.  That means that Ukraine will continue to preserve nuclear arms  on its territory. It is senseless asking Russia to pay us  compensation.    As for Washington, I think that it will at last come to the  conclusion that nuclear disarmament requires joint efforts. It  is absurd to do this work alone.</p>

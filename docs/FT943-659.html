			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / First eurobond for Lebanon Lebanon is to launch its first eurobond offering today to help pay for the rebuilding of a country torn apart by 16 years of civil war. The original target for the issue of three-year bonds, which bankers say is the first eurobond to emerge from the Arab world, was Dollars 150m, but it was increased yesterday to Dollars 300m, the maximum amount authorised by the Lebanese parliament, because of unexpectedly strong demand from international investors. Mr Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister who was in London yesterday, said the deal would allow the government to diversify its funding sources. 'We are trying to finance our construction programme through several sources. This deal opens the door to the international capital markets,' he said. The proceeds of the eurobond offering will be used mainly to finance the building of a ring-road around Beirut. There are also plans to build homes across the country to encourage people displaced by the 1975-1990 civil war to leave the capital. The total cost of Lebanon's reconstruction programme is estimated to be about Dollars 11bn, to be spent over the next eight to 10 years. The government intends to finance the programme through the budget, internal borrowings and bilateral agreements with other countries and international agencies such as the World Bank. It has already signed contracts to upgrade Beirut airport and to modernise telephone, electricity and water systems. Improvements to Lebanon's infrastructure could revive the tourism industry, which provided about one quarter of its national income before the civil war. Merrill Lynch, the US bank which is arranging the offering, reported strong demand for the bonds from a wide range of investors, including institutions and rich Lebanese expatriates. The latter are expected to take up one-third of the issue. 'This is a sign that confidence in the future of Lebanon has returned,' said Mr Riad Salame, governor of Banque du Liban, the central bank. Lebanon's foreign debt stands at Dollars 310m which compares with total foreign assets of Dollars 7bn, of which about half is in gold. The bonds are expected to be priced to yield about 325 to 350 basis points over US government bonds. Although there are no immediate plans to launch a second eurobond, Lebanon is likely to seek a credit rating from international rating agencies within the next year. International bonds, Page 35</p>

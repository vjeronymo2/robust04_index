			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Morocco may return with sovereign issue MR MOHAMED Berrada, the finance minister of Morocco, said the country was likely to re-enter global capital markets shortly with a sovereign bond issue, Reuter reports. He said the country was prepared to borrow small amounts at short maturities in the international markets. He noted, however, that some banks were bombarding him with requests to bring Moroccan bond deals to market, and drew a parallel with the 1970s when banks lent money freely to the third world and ended up with a debt crisis. 'In our strategy, we want to return to the market but I don't want to increase my external debt. If I want debt, I only want it for private sector companies,' he said during a visit to New York to promote Morocco among investors. Mr Berrada said a small sovereign bond issue would be necessary to get the ball rolling before private companies returned to the market. The minister's visit to New York has helped prompt a three-point rally in the price of Moroccan debt in the secondary market, dealers said. It is currently trading at 66-3/8 per cent of face value, a discount that Mr Berrada said was not justified because the country had always serviced its debt. 'If you want to make very big money very quickly, you buy Moroccan debt,' he said. The government is currently considering the possibility of allowing the use of discounted Moroccan foreign loans in debt-for-equity swaps in the tourism and agro-export sectors, said Mr Berrada.</p>

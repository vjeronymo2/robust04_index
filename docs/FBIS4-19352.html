			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Kurt Kister commentary: "Knight Rudolf Is Consecrated by </F> Washington"]    [Text] Washington, 14 Apr -- It is a ritual of German-U.S.  politics that every four years the candidate of the opposition  party travels to Washington to assure the Americans, on the one  hand, that everything will basically be the same after a change  of power in Bonn. On the other hand, the visit serves to signal  to the voter at home that the candidate can move on an  international level: In the realm of symbolic politics, the  handshake with the respective master in the White House  corresponds to knighting in the Department for Foreign Countries  [as published].    Since Tuesday [12 April], the new warrior has been Knight  Rudolf of Palatinate. He was "noticed" with more than the usual  interest in Washington; it is also known there that Scharping  has a realistic chance of replacing Kohl. Altogether, Scharping  made a good showing. His reserve, his self-confidence, and his  occasionally demure friendliness left the image of a serious,  responsible politician.    Although the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  chairman did not tire of stressing the basic continuity of  German foreign policy in the event of his assumption of power,  differences appeared when one had a closer look. This was most  clearly shown in the debate on the form and extent of Germany's  possible participation in UN military actions. Scharping -- he  said this repeatedly -- left Washington with the conviction that  in the White House and on Capitol Hill this question is regarded  as far less urgent than it is presented in the government  coalition and the media in Germany. He does not believe that  Washington wants to or will exercise political pressure on the  Germans in this respect.    From the point of view of the campaigner, this argumentation  is understandable. The SPD is attacked by the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP] because of its alleged attitude of refusal. Moreover,  parts of the party are still feuding with Scharping because they  do not want to put up with his blue-helmet line. Therefore, it  is in Scharping's interest to invalidate at least the accusation  that the United States is putting pressure on the Germans.    All that reminds one a little bit of the fact that nobody  discusses the fire brigade as long as there is no fire. At  present, there is no immediate occasion for the Americans to  accuse the Germans of dodging. However, neither Bonn's  checkbook diplomacy during the Gulf war nor beating about the  bush over the AWACS mission in the Balkans or the public  relations action in Beledwynne have been forgotten. Even though  nobody told it to Scharping in this form, German fears of an  increased UN commitment are like a shadow on the lung that  provides the transatlantic relations with breath.    Not in vain did the Senate adopt two resolutions that say  explicitly that Germany should create the political and  constitutional prerequisites for "full" participation in UN  military actions. The pressure that Scharping did not (yet)  feel this week is developing there, for example.</p>

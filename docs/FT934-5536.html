			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK open to Sinn Fein talks: Optimism for peace grows as documents suggest IRA may lay down arms The government last night declared it was ready to reopen contacts with Sinn Fein as hitherto secret documents suggested the IRA had been on the brink of ending its 25-year campaign of violence in Northern Ireland. An unapologetic defence by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, of extensive contacts this year reinforced the impression at Westminster that Mr John Major believes the IRA may still lay down its arms. The optimism was echoed by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said last night that there had already been a marked de-escalation of violence in recent weeks. Papers released by the Northern Ireland Office suggested there had been no large-scale IRA attacks since November 12 and Downing Street indicated that a declared cessation of violence lasting for two months or so might provide the background for formal talks with Sinn Fein. That in turn raised hopes that Mr Major and Mr Reynolds might inject momentum into the peace process at a summit which might take place as early as this Friday. However continuing differences between the two governments over the drafting of a joint communique at the summit were underlined last night by Mr Reynolds who said 'lots of progress will be required for a successful summit at this stage'. Government officials explained that Mr Reynolds was considering not holding the summit if progress could not be made on the communique beforehand. Sir Patrick's comments came after the startling disclosure that the government would have opened a dialogue with Sinn Fein as early as January 1994 if the IRA had kept an apparent pledge in November to end its campaign. But the government's account of the messages passed to and fro between the two sides from February to November - which Sir Patrick insisted did not amount to negotiations - was challenged vigorously by Sinn Fein. Mr Martin McGuinness, the leading Sinn Fein member involved in the contacts, accused Mr Major of fabricating some of the 30 or so pages of documents released in London. Most of the messages conveyed by what the documents refer to as 'the Provisional Movement' also suggest the IRA has not shifted from its position that Mr Major must accept that Ulster will eventually be part of a united Ireland. Sir Patrick, who weathered with relative ease a storm of criticism from hard-line unionists, told a crowded House of Commons that if the IRA ended the violence permanently 'the way would still be open for Sinn Fein to enter the political arena'. He insisted that the government's basic conditions for bringing Sinn Fein into the political process had not changed. The IRA would have to offer a permanent end to terrorism and the British government would not drop its constitutional guarantee on the status of Northern Ireland. That meant 'the key to peace is in the hands of the IRA'. But if current efforts failed, the government would keep exploring 'the opportunities for peace'. Downing Street said his statement had been approved by Mr Major and senior members of the cabinet at an emergency ministerial meeting earlier in the day to agree a response to the weekend revelations about the contacts. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, was suspended from the Commons after accusing Sir Patrick of lying. But his outburst was brushed off as a theatrical display by moderate unionists. Conservative MPs offered support for the government strategy and there was only muted criticism from Ulster Unionists. The most revealing document, dated November 5, sets out detailed arrangements under which the IRA would halt its campaign and start 'preliminary dialogue' with the government in mid-January. Sir Patrick said the offer had been in response to an explicit commitment to peace from the IRA, which was denied by Sinn Fein. Despite its insistence that basic conditions for Sinn Fein participation in talks had been as strong in private as in public, the documents revealed the government was prepared to offer considerable flexibility to Sinn Fein in arranging an end to hostilities. It told Sinn Fein that a declaration of a cessation of violence could initially be kept private. The government would then be ready to enter into a 'dialogue' within two or two-and-half months. Both offers appear considerably softer than Mr Major has yet admitted in public.</p>

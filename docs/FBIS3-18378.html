As the president of the Federal Statistical Office, Hans  Guenther Merk, stated, the white-collar workers got away with a  stagnation of their net incomes. The situation in the new  laender was much more favorable. Net wages there increased by  up to 8 percent.    Thus, the adaptation of incomes to the western level  continued in the east, Merk stressed. Miners and workers in  surface and underground engineering achieved the biggest  increase. They reached 77 and 74 percent of the wages of their  west German counterparts. In the industry, the wages in the new  laender reached 66 percent of the western level, and in trade  and the banking and insurance industry, they reached 68 percent.  The gross income per month of the blue and white-collar workers  in the east rose by 17 percent to 3,000 German marks [DM]. The  average gross income in western Germany was DM4,500, which is  3.8 percent more than in the previous year.    As the Federal Statistical Office reported, prices in the  old  laender were 3.3 percent higher than one year ago. According to  preliminary calculations, inflation is increasing more slowly  than in the past: In January, the rate was still 3.5 percent.  From January to February, the inflation rate increased by 0.2  percent, whereas the increase was still 0.9 percent in the  previous month. Whether it will be possible to achieve an annual  inflation rate of 3 percent or a rate with the figure 2 in front  the decimal point this year will depend on the increase of  prices for public and private services and on the development of  the rents, Merk stressed.    At 4.2 percent, the average annual inflation rate last year  reached the highest level since 1982.</p>

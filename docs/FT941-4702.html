			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Mercury to spend Pounds 200m on network Mercury, the main rival to British Telecommunications in the UK, will today announce a Pounds 200m upgrading programme aimed at increasing its capacity to compete in the provision of advanced telecoms services. The investment in 'intelligent networks' technology will give Mercury one of the most advanced networks in Europe, able to offer new features such as corporate phone 'meetings'. The main contractor is DSC, a fast-growing US supplier specialising in intelligent networks technology, which is installing similar systems for several US regional Bell companies. Other contractors include Northern Telecom, the Canadian supplier, and GPT, the UK-based joint venture between General Electric Company and Siemens, the German group. Investment for the first year is expected to approach Pounds 20m, with new services coming on stream as early as next year. Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent company, intends to spread the technology to other operators under its control, including Hong Kong Telecom. DSC already has a contract with Optus, the main rival to the former state monopoly in Australia, which is part-owned by C&amp;W. 'Intelligent networks' are sophisticated signalling and computer systems giving operators the power to route calls and programme local exchanges without having to install software and hardware at each exchange. They also offer operators large efficiency and reliability gains. The investment underlines C&amp;W's long-term commitment to Mercury, despite its avowed intention to concentrate future investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It also points the way to future competition between operators not just on price, as now, but also on the range of sophistication of services, as in the US.</p>

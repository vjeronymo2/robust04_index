			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Drama follows figures from fantasyland: The entertainment value of EuroDisneyland WHEN Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney entertainment group, this week told the Los Angeles Times about his company's latest 'creative smash' he was not talking about a new movie or cartoon, but about EuroDisneyland, its theme park in northern France. 'It's as good a piece of entertainment as we've ever delivered anywhere in the world,' said Mr Eisner. The children whizzing around the park's attractions may well agree. But unfortunately for the Disney chairman, EuroDisneyland is also providing another form of entertainment: the spectacle of its trials and tribulations in the financial world. Euro Disney has for the past fortnight been beset by speculation about everything from the departure of its vice-chairman (which it confirmed) to a secret plan to close the park for the winter (which it denied). Its shares have fluctuated daily as investors have digested each new twist in the plot. Yet the real drama is being enacted behind the scenes as Euro Disney's executives struggle to find a way of defusing the group's financial problems by securing a fresh influx of capital. Euro Disney is in deep trouble. It lost FFr1bn (Pounds 114m) in its last financial year to September 30 and is on course for another loss of FFr1.8bn this year. Its net debt has already risen from FFr18.5bn to FFr21bn since the year began and is set to rise further in the slack winter months. Unless it secures new capital, Euro Disney will stay trapped in a vicious cycle of rising debt, spiralling financial costs and mounting losses. It will also run out of money. Euro Disney announced last month that Walt Disney, which owns 49 per cent of its shares, had promised to meet its working capital and short-term investment requirements until March, when it hopes to have completed its restructuring. Euro Disney says that, so far, it has not had to ask Walt Disney for support. Analysts suspect the crunch will come in late November, when attendance is expected to fall sharply and Euro Disney could run out of cash. Euro Disney would then be technically bankrupt and its US parent would have to help. The critical question is whether Euro Disney will be able to complete its restructuring by the March deadline. One option is to renegotiate the terms of its existing loans to try to benefit from recent reductions in French interest rates. At present it pays half its debt at fixed interest rates. However Euro Disney failed earlier this year to persuade its banks to revise the loans. Even if it succeeds this time, a new agreement would only provide a partial solution. What the company really needs is an influx of cash to reduce its existing debt and to trim its interest bill. If Euro Disney was an ordinary company it would stand little chance of raising cash in the traditional way: by attracting an external investor, securing a loan extension from its banks, or persuading them to underwrite a right issue. But the protective presence of Walt Disney, one of the largest and most profitable entertainment groups in the US, should ensure its survival. 'There's no way that Walt Disney is going to allow any business bearing the Disney name to go under,' said one analyst. 'It's got enough cash and enough clout with the banks to help Euro Disney if it wants to.' Even Walt Disney's influence is unlikely to enable Euro Disney to attract external investment. Walt Disney this week played down US press reports that it was considering this option. It could afford to raise its own 49 per cent holding in Euro Disney. However the medium-term losses would be so high that this would scarcely be an appealing prospect for Mr Eisner and his shareholders. Loan extensions also seem unlikely. Walt Disney would be expected to resist demands from the banks that it guaranteed the loans as a quid pro quo for extending them. Higher debt could also imperil Euro Disney's attempts to crawl out of the red by burdening it with an even higher interest bill. The consensus among analysts is that a rights issue is the likely solution. Walt Disney would doubtless take up its full rights of 49 per cent, which might make Euro Disney's banks feel more comfortable about underwriting the rest. The hitch is that the size of the issue would be restricted by the recent fall in Euro Disney's shares which closed at FFr58.35, up FFr0.85 yesterday against FFr164 at their peak before the park's opening. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, suspects the Euro Disney could stage a one-for-two issue at FFr50 a share, compared with the original offer price of FFr72 in 1989, to raise FFr4.25bn. If the proceeds were used partly to reduce long-term debt and partly to help finance the construction of a second park on the Euro Disney site, she calculated that Euro Disney would finally come out of the red in the 1999 financial year with a net profit of FFr88m. However Euro Disney might decide to plough all its extra capital into debt reduction and leave the plans for the second park on ice. This might make sense in the short term, but in the long term Euro Disney needs a second site to attract more visitors and encourage them to stay longer, thereby boosting park revenues and hotel occupancy levels. Mr Eisner said this week that Euro Disney was 'like a movie that starts off slow'. The problem is that it may take a very long time for the action to begin and until then, the production budget will get higher and higher.</p>

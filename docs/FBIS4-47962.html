			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda we will learn in the next few hours if the  cease-fire is to hold. The transitional government announced an  end to the fighting for 2200 GMT, 7 May and the Rwandan  Patriotic Front is considering an end to the fighting for this  evening. What is certain is that fighting continued in Kigali  yesterday with heavy fighting taking place near the airport.  The Rwandan Patriotic Front is still refusing to negotiate with  the government, but it does not exclude talks with the Rwandan  Armed Forces if they dissociate themselves from the government.  A member of the RPF political bureau, Mr. Sendashonga, explains  the reasons behind this attitude. He was interviewed from  Byumba, in the north of the country, by Monique Mas:    [Sendashonga] If the Rwandan Armed Forces dissociate  themselves from this government, then we are ready to sign a  cease-fire agreement, an agreement to end the fighting, however  this does not imply the recognition of the self-proclaimed  government.    [Mas] What is your main objective?    [Sendashonga] Obviously, it would be to take Kigali. This is  the eventual objective.    [Mas] Do you believe in a military solution?    [Sendashonga] We believe that there are now three issues. We  must be allowed to achieve the rescue of the people who managed  to survive the genocide, the killings. The civilian and  military elements responsible for these killings and this  genocide must be rendered harmless forever; I mean, mostly the  people behind the killings. We must be left to restore law and  order, peace and security throughout the country and this for  each and everyone.    We know that there are sound elements in this army, but they  are hostage to their environment and their commanders. If these  commanders understand that this complicity with corrupt  politicians is pointless we are ready to welcome them at any  time.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: IVANA'S FRENCH TWIST IS NOW ALL THE RAGE  </P> <P> Since Ivana Trump appeared on the May cover of Vogue looking 15 years younger  and sporting a blond topknot on her head, Orange County hair stylists have been  doing the twist -- the French twist.  </P> <P> In a single sweep of her tresses, Ivana showed women everywhere how a new hair  style, not to mention a little plastic surgery, could turn one into a youthful  cover girl.  </P> <P> Almost overnight, stylists began getting requests for French twists from local  Ivana-bes.  </P> <P> "We're doing more up-dos than we've done in a long time," says David Cope,  owner of Copa de Ramo in San Juan Capistrano. "The style is soft and pretty,  and we haven't had pretty in a long time. Everything's been hard and angular  and bobbed."  </P> <P> In a given week, he has about a dozen clients asking for some variation of the  French twist.  </P> <P> At Flora Hills in Corona del Mar, soft, casual twists with tousled tops have  become desirable among clients wanting a change, as Ivana did.  </P> <P> "Anytime a woman wears her hair up it makes her feel sexier," says Flora Hills,  owner of the boutique and salon.  </P> <P> Like Ivana, some of Hills' customers want a French twist to go with their new  face lifts.  </P> <P> "A lot of times a face lift isn't that drastic of a change," Hills says. "But  if a woman changes her hair style, her clothes and her makeup, she'll have a  whole new look. She'll even begin to walk differently."  </P> <P> The French twist has been out of favor for so long, many women don't know what  to call it. They just ask for a 'vana.  </P> <P> "Ivana went from one extreme look to another, and people noticed the hair  style. It looked great on her," says Shelly Serrecchio, owner of Cy-Raks salon  in Dana Point.  </P> <P> Other customers, especially younger women, want the tousled twist made famous  by Claudia Schiffer and her seductive ads for Guess? jeans.  </P> <P> "Everybody notices that girl," Serrecchio says.  </P> <P> The French twist Schiffer wears differs from the Brigitte Bardot version that  inspired it. Schiffer's is a lot messier.  </P> <P> "It's more relaxed and sexier than the '60s," says Sharon Orr, salon manager of  Aida Grey in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. "It has a little pouf to it, but I  don't want to say bouffant because I don't want to scare people."  </P> <P> Today's twist calls for a less structured look with loose tendrils of hair  falling around the face.  </P> <P> "In the past, the French twist had more of a beehive look, almost as if the  head was pointed in back like a cone head," Cope says.  </P> <P> Ideally, the twist should look "as if you grasped the hair in one hand, twisted  it and stuck one pin in it. That's the effect you want," Cope says.  </P> <P> "Sometimes that's a lot harder to achieve than a sleek look. Anybody can  back-comb and spray, but it's harder to make it look messy. You have to have a  good eye to know when to stop."  </P> <P> Myla Renee, a stylist at Aida Grey, practiced doing a twist on fellow stylist  Pam Frey, who sometimes wears her blond hair in a French twist to work during  the day or to go dancing at night.  </P> <P> Renee begins by using hot rollers to put soft waves in Frey's fairly straight  hair.  </P> <P> "If the hair is straight and silky, the style will slide right out," Renee  says. "You wouldn't need to do this for processed hair."  </P> <P> With a round brush and blow dryer, she adds slight curl to the bangs at the  crown to create the volume needed for a tousled top. A gel or mousse can also  give a little lift to hair that tends to fall flat, Renee says.  </P> <P> To make the twist, Renee pulls the hair up and toward the back for an uplifting  look. She sweeps the hair to one side, anchors it in place with a row of bobby  pins, then twists the remaining hair with her hands.  </P> <P> She secures the coil up along the back of the head with more bobby pins. When  she comes to the end of the twist, the remaining hair is wrapped around in a  loose topknot.  </P> <P> Renee leaves wispy tendrils of hair to frame the face, picking at them with a  small comb and squirting them lightly with hair spray to add fullness.  </P> <P> "It should look as if you just stepped out of a convertible," she says.  </P> <P> Stylists can invent endless variations of the French twist. The bangs can fall  forward, as Ivana's do, or sweep to the side, as the Guess? model's do. The  topknot can be large or small, and sit either forward or toward the back of the  head. For Ivana, the grander the affair, the larger her topknot.  </P> <P> French twists work best when one has shoulder-length hair.  </P> <P> "Bobs won't work," Serrecchio says.  </P> <P> Older women like the style because it lifts up from their face, giving them a  youthful appearance. Younger women, meanwhile, look more sophisticated with  their hair up.  </P> <P> "Anyone can wear a French twist," Serrecchio says. "I've done a 16-year-old  girl who was going to be in a wedding, and I've done a modified version for  older women that wasn't as messy."  </P> <P> Stylists say the twist is especially popular with brides and bridesmaids  because it looks sophisticated and complements the headpiece. Others wear it to  the beach, to work or to parties.  </P> <P> Ken Beck, a stylist at Europa International in Fashion Island, Newport Beach,  says his clients want a French twist to wear to special occasions, such as a  night to hear a performance by Opera Pacific or a formal fund-raiser. At a  recent fashion show for Nordstrom, Beck gave all models with shoulder-length  hair a French twist.  </P> <P> "It's a really uplifting look," he says. "My mom's been wearing it for years.  It's easy and it looks sophisticated."  </P> <P> If the hair is dry, Beck says, anyone can do a French twist in five minutes.  </P> <P> "Don't overdo it, don't overwork it," he says. "That's when you start looking  like a schoolmarm."  </P></p>

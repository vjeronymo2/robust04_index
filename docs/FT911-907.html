			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Pavlov sees economic light dawning in rebel republics DOMINATING the thoughts of Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, is the most obvious manifestation of the Soviet economic crisis: the wave of strikes by miners and other workers, especially in steel mills and engineering plants. In an interview yesterday, he stressed that part of his anti-crisis programme seeks to put an end to strikes in the vital sectors of the Soviet economy. The prime minister said that President Mikhail Gorbachev had before him a decree for his signature which would be published next week, after the Victory Day holidays starting today. That decree, he said, would install a 'special regime' in key sectors - including coal and metallurgy - under which workers who went on strike, and those who incited them to strike, would be liable to prosecution. He dismissed suggestions that troops would be used either to force workers to work or to stand in for them, saying that the normal forces of law and order would suffice. He appears to be thinking of an 'anti-strike' agreement for workers defined as essential. They would receive compensation for losing the right to strike. The prime minister believes he is within sight of getting all 15 Soviet republics to sign the anti-crisis plan, to which he has the agreement of the Supreme Soviet and the backing of the president and the ruling Communist party. He said representatives of all republics have been taking part in the plan's formation - in Lithuania's case, with observer status - andthis Sunday they are expected to come back to talks with Moscow, with the full authorisation of their own governments, on what they wish to see in the final version of the programme. Next Wednesday, the cabinet of ministers will meet under the chairmanship of Mr Gorbachev to try to finalise a draft. The prime minister appeared to put on one side the question of the predominantly political Union treaty, which Mr Gorbachev has stressed must soon be signed. Instead, he gave priority to economic agreements under the anti-crisis programme, under which the Soviet and republican governments would agree which 'questions should be settled through presidential decrees and which should be tackled through the republics.' Here, as elsewhere, Mr Pavlov indicated that it was not important which level of government controlled which part of the economy. The essence was: could it be done competently? He claimed to be confident that all republics would, sooner or later, recognise economic logic and sign up to it. 'What can Georgia (a so far recalcitrant republic) do outside the Soviet market?' he asked. On the other hand, he appeared to recognise the right of those republics which wished not to sign up to be granted full independent status. 'From the point of view of the economy, we do not differentiate between Lithuania and Czechoslovakia, if it (the former) has not entered the economic union,' he said. 'Why would we sell a tonne of oil to Lithuania and receive a tonne of pork in return, when we could receive two tonnes on the market?' His optimism may be well-founded: an official at the Moscow mission for Armenia - one of the rebel republics - said yesterday the republic intended to sign economic agreements with the centre, adding: 'We are still in the Soviet Union, and we have no intention of disrupting economic links with it. We are striving for political independence, but economic independence will take several years.' It is this line which Mr Pavlov sees prevailing. Next week, in his view, the republics will be forced to choose between full economic independence and Soviet reality.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, March 30 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in central  China's Henan Province have grown spring crops on 2.013 million  hectares, an increase of 126,000 hectares compared with last  year.    According to local officials, the area sown in cash crops in  the province experienced an increase of 11.4 percent compared  with that of last year, while local farmers have also been urged  to maintain a stable grain growing area.    Among the cash crops sown, the growing area of cotton now  reaches 778,800 hectares, 157,700 hectares more than last year's  level, said the officials.    To ensure the success of this year's spring farming, the  provincial government held a working meeting early this year to  work out detailed plans for spring farming.    At the same time, the province also held a provincial-level  briefing sending forth information concerning agriculture and  helped to analyze market trends in connection with farm produce,  as well as announcing to local farmers preferential policies  from the central government regarding grain and cotton  production.    The endeavor has effectively aroused the initiative of  farmers in growing grain and other cash crops.    Local agricultural banks, supply and marketing cooperatives  and departments of means of agricultural production have also  moved in and managed to provide local farmers with necessary  funds and means of agricultural production, such as chemical  fertilizers, pesticides, plastic sheeting and seeds.</p>

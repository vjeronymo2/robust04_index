Criminal proceedings against Cherepkov were instituted in  February 1994 on charges of bribery.    The decision followed the second day of unrest in the city.  On Wednesday, armed riot police stormed the mayor's office and  told Cherepkov and his closest aides they were dismissed from  office. First Deputy Mayor Vladimir Gilgenberg, who put up  resistance, was literally carried out from the building by  police.    This was the second armed invasion of the city  administration  building. The first one occurred on the night of February 13,  and was prompted, according to an official version, by the need  to question Cherepkov on receiving a bribe from a certain  Volkov. The mayor then remained at power thanks to public  support.    Supporters of the toppled mayor, including a group of voters  who nominated him to the regional council, have announced that  Cherepkov's toppling was an act of open arbitrariness and a  gross violation of human rights. They said they would hold acts  of protest, including hunger strikes at the regional  administration headquarters.</p>

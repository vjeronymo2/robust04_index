			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Block votes are fair, says Morris THE LEADER of Britain's largest union yesterday warned Labour to resist pressure for rapid moves to cut its links with the unions amid dispute among leading trade unionists on the future of the block vote. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said yesterday he backed the move to cut the block vote from 90 per cent to 70 per cent of conference votes, but added that it should remain more or less in its existing form. Trade unionists are not yet agreed on the size of the cut to make in the block vote. 'It seems to be the season for 'hip-shooting' but we want to resist that because the future of the Labour party is more important than one day's headlines,' Mr Morris said. He said block votes were 'fair votes'. A review group on links with the unions is due to report to next year's conference. It is unlikely that a single member of that review group supports a complete break in the relationship. However, there is a consensus emerging in favour of removing union influence from electing the Labour leader and from the selection of local candidates. The principal dispute remains how far to reduce the influence of union votes at the conference. Yesterday the AEEU engineering and electrical union, which is at the opposite end of the argument from Mr Morris, proposed cutting the union vote to 31 per cent, increasing the constituency vote to 46 per cent and giving MPs and MEPs 20 per cent between them. Under the AEEU plan, unions would get one vote for every 10,000 members who pay the political levy, but eventually the size of the union vote would depend on the number of individual party members in a union. Separately, the GMB general union repeated its plan to cut the block vote to 50 per cent and put forward a plan to allow union members who pay the political levy to become 'associate members' of constituency Labour parties with a role in selecting parliamentary candidates. Mr John Edmonds, GMB general-secretary, expressed scepticism about the AEEU's plan to reform the block vote. 'I understand that this (the AEEU plan) is a working document within the AEEU and I think that is how it should be regarded,' he said. A composite motion on union links, backed yesterday by the national executive committee and to be debated by the conference on Wednesday, expresses 'strong support for the continuation of the party's links with the trade unions' and regrets 'ill-informed and malignly intentioned criticisms of the trade union/Labour party link'. But, while recognising the financial contribution of the trade unions to the Labour party, the motion calls for 'structures to be as democratic as possible to encourage greater involvement of individual party members and levy-paying members of affiliated organisations'.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (6): Shop window for red chips - Hong Kong and China Big-time investors are not normally renowned for toeing the same line as die-hard communist governments, but when it comes to Hong Kong both groups are united in their failure to recognise the place as a separate country distinct from China. To the Chinese leaders, Hong Kong is a victim of evil colonialism. To the investors - who recognise it in so far as they pour money into it - Hong Kong is an English-speaking, sanitised shop front for the mainland, which is precisely where their money is directed. Mr Eugene Law, Hong Kong research director at Standard Chartered Securities, said: 'When we market Hong Kong equities to clients, we market Hong Kong just as part of the China concept. A lot of the new money coming into Hong Kong is coming in with China in mind.' The attractions of Hong Kong as a gateway to China embrace not only westerners - who are more comfortable with the banking and legal framework operating in the colony, and widespread use of English - but also to overseas Chinese, particularly in Taiwan where direct links with the mainland are still prohibited. Corporate Hong Kong has been quick to cash in on this change in sentiment, just as the economic infrastructure has evolved to address new demands on its service industry. Of the 64 new companies that were listed in Hong Kong last year hardly any neglected to devote serious column inches in the prospectus to China plans. Investors with a foothold in Hong Kong can participate in China's growth via equity, debt or venture capital. So far the share market is the most vibrant, although there is a significant number of funds invested in unlisted China projects and many businesses are also taking this route, injecting funds into land and plants across the border. Equity investors have a number of options ranging from the purest form of B shares (shares specially designated for foreigners which are listed on one or other of China's two stock markets) through to Hong Kong-listed companies which carry out the bulk of their activities across the border: the so-called red chips. In between are H shares, former state-owned enterprises now listed on the Hong Kong stock market; American Depositary Receipts of China and Hong Kong-listed companies traded on Wall Street; convertible bonds based on Hong Kong shares and listed on Luxembourg or London stock exchanges; and Hong Kong-listed China funds. Six of an initial nine state enterprises earmarked for H shares are now listed in Hong Kong; a second batch is due to be announced by Beijing any day now. The popularity of China exposure is reflected in over subscription levels of stocks touting China links: the first H share, Tsingtao Brewery, was oversubscribed by 110 times and saw its share price rise 28.57 per cent on the offer price; China Travel Service was 411 times oversubscribed. Mr Douglas Eu, an investment manager with Jardine Fleming Investment Management, says: 'It has always been my view that Hong Kong is China. It will indisputably be China in three and a half years, and any investment stretches past that time frame. So what people are paying for today is China, and the market has already put a value on Hong Kong shares that is 100 per cent China based.' For foreigners, there is a greater availability of China shares in Hong Kong than there is in the mainland itself. As of January 7, the market capitalisation of the B share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen stood at, respectively, USDollars 1.7bn and USDollars 952m, while the total for H shares was USDollars 2.32bn. Adding in the wealth of pure China companies traded in Hong Kong - such as China Travel Service and Guangdong Investments  -gives an aggregate market capitalisation of something approaching USDollars 15bn, he said. Mr Robert Lloyd George, chairman of Lloyd George Management, reckons the Hong Kong market - which now has a capitalisation of around HKDollars 2.97 trillion - will be split equally between Hong Kong and Chinese plays by the time the colony reverts to China in 1997. 'If you take the market as a whole, we reckon that now something like 80 to 100 companies could be defined as China plays: mostly smaller manufacturing companies, H shares, red chips and China shell companies,' he said. The last category is a more recent phenomenon where China companies - many of which are PRC government-related - back into listed entities. Recent examples of these so-called backdoor listings include Shougang International and Shougang Grand (both belonging to Shougang Beijing); Continental Mariner and Beijing Development ( CITIC Beijing) and the World Trade Centre (CEROIL). Part of the appeal of buying a Hong Kong-listed entity - regardless of what its origins might be - stems from problems attached to more direct China investment. B shares are illiquid, in limited supply - at the moment there are just 19 B shares in Shenzhen and 23 in Shanghai - and expensive. (Even when B shares are chosen they are broadly transacted through Hong Kong offices as it is not only investors who prefer the colony: brokerages say staff transferred to offices in Shanghai will often respond by resigning on the spot.) Mr Law said: 'When it comes to investing into China, a lot of investors find it difficult to go into the market itself. Even B shares and H shares pose difficulties because of the shortage of information.' Bread-and-butter disclosure is sketchy by international standards, and UK or US-based fund managers can find it tricky to make informed decisions on the material available. More often first-time investors will look to Hong Kong-based researchers to interpret the data, or simply stick their money in a China fund and leave the fund manager to do the worrying. There are some 17 China funds managed by Hong Kong registered companies, with a total net asset value of around USDollars 733m. There is also the comfort factor. The Hong Kong stock exchange, which has been on a roadshow to woo overseas investors, prides itself on its internationally acceptable regulatory standards. Much of the perceived risk and volatility is ironed out and investors buy into a more sanitised China. Mr Herbert Hui, head of the Hong Kong stock exchange's listing division, says shareholder protection is a key priority. 'The shareholder, be he a fund manager in London or a taxi driver in Hong Kong, should be able to rely on the same standards of protection,' he said. Also important for international institutional investors is Hong Kong's more stable currency, which is pegged to the US dollar. Swings in China's Yuan, as demonstrated last year, can still wreak havoc on a China operation's receipts and outgoing, but where the scrip is denominated in Hong Kong dollars the face investment is not affected. But while Hong Kong has carved itself a unique niche role for now, brokers say it has a limited shelf life. Shenzhen and Shanghai are now as important stops on visiting fund managers' Asia circuit as Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. Given a year or two, Mr Law reckons Shanghai will become as important a stopping off point as Hong Kong itself.</p>

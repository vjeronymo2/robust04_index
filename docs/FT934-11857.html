			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Miners dig themselves into a corner: James Buxton explains how an experiment in going-it-alone came to grief 'THERE'S a great deal of raw emotion among the lads today,' said Mr Jackie Aitchison. 'They are extremely disappointed'. Mr Aitchison was speaking about the reaction of the 167 miners who each invested Pounds 10,000 in Monktonhall Mineworkers - the consortium of which he is chairman - to the takeover offer by RJB Mining. This values their stakes at Pounds 1,000 each, but they are being told there is no alternative. Raw emotion, sometimes bordering on paranoia, has been a recurring theme in this sad story of the attempt by a consortium of miners to reopen a pit and prove that they can make a profit where British Coal failed. They are not alone in asking why financial support from government and local authorities should be available now, when it was denied to the consortium after it was formed in 1991. The consortium's bid to take over Monktonhall was opposed by Labour members of Lothian regional council. The National Union of Mineworkers was also opposed to the project. But the miners were supported by Conservative and other politicians, and in December 1991 British Coal offered them the lease of the pit, rejecting a bid by Caledonian Mining, a private mining company from Nottingham. The miners met Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, then a junior energy minister, and Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish Office industry minister. They received encouragement but no financial assistance. Price Waterhouse, the miners' financial advisers, failed to persuade any financial institution to put money into Monktonhall, although Bank of Scotland made a bridging loan which turned into a longer-term relationship, now likely to end in a Pounds 1.8m write-off. Instead the first 110 miners put in an astonishing Pounds 10,000 each, mostly by borrowing, to raise Pounds 1.1m, thus guaranteeing themselves a job. Mr Jim Parker, a former British Coal manager who was Monktonhall's managing director, said that no one was deceived about the risks. He also said: 'Men here in their 30s are going to make a lot of money at Monktonhall'. The company had the barest minimum of capital when it took over the mine in June last year. But all would have been well, Mr Aitchison said yesterday, if the miners had been able to start production that September and start earning revenue. Unfortunately much of the secondhand mining equipment which they had bought failed, and they encountered adverse geological conditions in reopening the first face. Mr Parker left the company in December. By the time full production started in January the company was heavily in debt. In late February Monktonhall announced that it was seeking an outside investor, but when Caledonian Mining responded it was publicly brushed off. In March, with the miners, now numbering 180, having worked for two weeks without pay, Lothian region appointed the merchant bank Quayle Munro to assess the situation. Quayle Munro reported that Monktonhall would be viable only if new coal faces were opened up, costing Pounds 3m. The bank then started looking for another investor. RTZ and Hanson declined. On September 1 RJB Mining signed a letter of intent and started guaranteeing the miners' wages. The day before Quayle Munro had publicly criticised the consortium after it sent a delegation to seek money from the Libyan government. The miners face the loss of most of their investment but not of their jobs. Recriminations over who is to blame are just starting.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles as dollar hits yen low Wall Street US equities tumbled yesterday after the dollar briefly hit a post-war low against the yen and a pivotal technology company issued a profits warning, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 33.93 weaker at 3,707.97. The index fought back from a 55-point deficit after the New York SE imposed its 'uptick' restrictions on program-guided sales in the final hours of trading. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 4.14 at 451.34, while the American SE composite receded 4.32 to 431.87. NYSE turnover was a fairly heavy 298.7m shares. Among the leading indices, the Nasdaq composite suffered the sharpest setback. It came on the heels of Lotus Development's announcement that its second-quarter results would disappoint Wall Street. After opening the week with a 1.2 per cent decline, the index dropped a further 10.06, or 1.4 per cent, to close at 708.79. The pessimistic mood in equities refused to budge yesterday after two previous sell-offs. But early on, the damage was mostly confined to a few issues. The most notable was Lotus. The software company plunged Dollars 14 3/8 , or about 28 per cent, to Dollars 37. At least one Wall Street securities house, Merrill Lynch, lowered its rating on the stock after the company's announcement. For most of the morning, the broad range of equities drifted lower in lacklustre activity as the day's economic news elicited little reaction. The Commerce Department said the US trade deficit had widened in April to Dollars 8.4bn, from a revised March figure of Dollars 6.87bn. Instead, investors were focused on developments in the foreign exchange markets. After drifting lower in early activity, the dollar suddenly lurched below Y100 just after midday. The action triggered a fresh decline in bond prices, and a wave of program-guided selling in equities. Among the Dow industrials, the cyclicals were the chief culprits. Caterpillar, which was facing a strike by 14,000 employees represented by the United Auto Workers Union, was marked down Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 102 1/8 . General Motors lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 . Mascotech, a supplier of motor vehicle components, dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 14 3/4 . Mr Jack Kirnan, the Salomon Brothers analyst, had lowered his rating on the issue after the company indicated that earnings were likely to come in at the low end of forecasts. Takeover news, or rather the lack of it, also had an impact on share prices. Quaker Oats plunged Dollars 8 3/4 to Dollars 73 1/4 after Nestle denied speculation that it had plans to acquire the US food group. US Healthcare fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 , giving back more than it had gained in the previous session on expectations that a merger agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson was imminent. On the Nasdaq, many technology issues followed Lotus in a downward spiral, with some analysts identifying the profits warning as another sign of flagging demand in the industry. Apple dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 26 and Applied Materials lost Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 38 7/8 . The selling spilled over into Big Board issues as well. Texas Instruments retreated Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 74 1/4 and Micron Technology Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/8. Canada Stocks in Toronto fell sharply again in moderate trading, in line with other major world stock markets. The TSE 300 composite index finished 40.9, or 1.0 per cent, lower at 4,047.5. On Monday the index dropped 1.64 per cent. Yesterday was the sixth straight day of decline for the index. Losing issues outpaced winners by 664 to 184, while volume came to 65.3m shares, compared with Monday's light 47.2m. Trading value amounted to CDollars 839m. All but one of the 14 stock groups lost ground, led by industrial products and real estate, which were off 2.05 and 1.78 per cent respectively. Consumer products declined 1.68 per cent, energy stocks fell 1.30 per cent and banking slipped 1.0 per cent. The golds sector gained about 1 per cent.</p>

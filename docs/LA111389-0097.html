			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> E. GERMANY ELECTS 2 REFORMERS;  </P> <P> PARLIAMENT SHAKES UP LEADERSHIP  </P> <P> East Germany's Parliament chose a leading reformer as premier today, and in a  surprise move elected a moderate non-Communist as its speaker for the first  time.  </P> <P> Hans Modrow, the new premier, replaces Willi Stoph, who resigned along with his  44-member Cabinet last Tuesday.  </P> <P> Modrow, 69, is a well-known reformer within the Communist Party, which has been  headed by Egon Krenz since Oct. 18. Krenz himself has promised some reforms,  including free elections.  </P> <P> Modrow, the only candidate for the post, is charged with forming a new  government.  </P> <P> The vote came at the end of an extended session in which the Parliament, until  now a simple rubber stamp for the ruling party's policies, broke out into the  open debate it had avoided for four decades.  </P> <P> Earlier, the body elected a non-Communist, Guenther Maleuda, as its new speaker  in an unprecedented secret ballot. The ruling Communist Party did not propose a  candidate for the post.  </P> <P> Maleuda was elected to replace Horst Sindermann, a Communist Party official who  was sacked from the ruling Politburo last week.  </P> <P> Maleuda surprisingly defeated Manfred Gerlach, chairman of the Liberal  Democratic Party, who was one of the first politicians to call for broad  political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> Maleuda, 58, is chairman of the Democratic Peasants Party, one of the four  small parties that have been allied with the Communists for 40 years. During  the political turmoil in recent weeks, the four parties have been cautiously  exploring ways of becoming more independent.  </P> <P> The elections came after a weekend in which East Germans by the millions  exercised their new freedom to travel, a right granted by the government to  counter an exodus of emigres to the West.  </P> <P> East Berliners today began returning to their jobs after four days of frenzied  celebrations at the newly opened Berlin Wall, and officials said fewer than 1%  of those who crossed into the West during the weekend chose to stay in West  Germany.  </P> <P> About 100,000 East German visitors still headed West today, West German  authorities said. The flow of visitors was far slower than during the weekend,  when more than 3 million people made the trip.  </P> <P> Today, more than 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig to demand free  elections from a government that already has been pressured into granting them  free travel.  </P> <P> The demonstrators, gathered in the city that has become the focus for protests  against the East German leadership, demanded the Communist Party abolish its  monopoly on power.  </P> <P> West German television newscasts estimated the number of protesters at between  200,000 and 300,000.  </P> <P> Also today, the Communist Party's 163-member Central Committee set Dec. 15 for  an emergency party congress, which would have the power to elect an entire new  Central Committee and change party politics.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, French President Francois Mitterrand invited the leaders of the  European Community countries to a special meeting Saturday in Paris to discuss  the rapidly changing situation in Europe.  </P></p>

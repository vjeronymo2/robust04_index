			<p>CSO     [Text] New diamond is being considered as the ultimate  material for application in the field of electronics. Plans to  develop new diamond materials and eventually to establish its  application technology are moving along steadily. Both industry  and academic groups have active R&amp;D programs both on  substances  already available, such as diamonds and DLC (diamond-like  carbons), and on new substances such as nanotubes and  fullerenes. They have even tried to operate transistors and  fabricate several passive devices using those materials. But all  of this is still in the initial stages of development.  Therefore, a national-scale project is being promoted for a  wide area of new diamond R&amp;D that will cover areas from basic  research to application in electronics and optics.    Diamonds have high heat resistance. a high energy gap, high  strength, as well as desirable optical and magnetic properties.  In recent years, diamonds are being vigorously applied not only  in wear-resistant products because of its extreme hardness. but  also in electronics and optics.    Under these circumstances, the `New Diamond Forum,' a new  diamond R&amp;D group, in December 1993 established the `New  Diamond  Technology Research Group' to study potential diamond  applications for power electronics and disaster prevention  systems.    Abroad, meanwhile, the U.S, Department of Defense is funding  studies of silicon carbide device application and research on  diamond electronic devices, packaging and optical components.  The European Community is also focusing research on new diamond  development.    Progress in new diamond development abroad has stimulated  Japanese industry to demand promotion of a national project in  Japan.    Specifically, the project calls for application of diamonds  in ultimate performance electronics materials through  development of fabrication technology for new substances and new  materials, property control, and development of evaluation  technology.    Possible applications include various environmentally  durable  electronic components, oil drilling tools, and new functional  catalysts. They also will contribute to the safety of the  global environment and provide solutions to energy problems.</p>

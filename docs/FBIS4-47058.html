			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Konstantin Zbarovskiy, with a commentary by the </F> Economic Policy Department, under the rubric "The Coca-Cola  Project Has Been Exempted From Taxes": "Anatoliy Sobchak Has  Lightened the Tax Load by Way of an Exception"]    [Text] A large project of the Coca-Cola St.  Petersburg Bottlers company (one of the Russian branches of the  Coca-Cola Nordic and Northern Eurasia company), which called for  the construction of a production complex in St. Petersburg for  manufacturing brand-name beverages, was on the brink of failure  until recently. It was quite likely that it would share the fate  of a project of another American giant, the Procter and Gamble  company, which after one year of preparations altogether gave up  the construction of a plant in the city on the Neva. However, as  KOMMERSANT learned yesterday, the management of the company  division in Oslo resolved to embark on construction in St.  Petersburg as early as in July upon the signing of a directive  to exempt the Coca-Cola St. Petersburg Bottlers from the payment  of taxes in 1994 by Anatoliy Sobchak. The new enterprise should  manufacture the first batch of beverages next year.    Coca-Cola St. Petersburg Bottlers announced its  intention to build a new production complex in the Pulkovo area  for the first time in February 1993. The total area of the  parcel comes to 43 hectares. The necessary volume of investment  is estimated to be $34 million-$35 million. The project is  advantageous from the social point of view, too: According to  preliminary estimates, the new plant will provide jobs for more  than 2,000 people.    Since the partner companies that had previously signed  contracts with the Coca-Cola St. Petersburg Bottlers joint-stock  company failed to meet their obligations to build the first  stage of facilities networks, the burden of financing this  segment of the project has to be shouldered by Coca-Cola in its  entirety. The amount necessary for this, which came to $23.8  million, turned out to be greater than the company itself had  planned. At that point, Coca-Cola approached the economic  development committee of the mayoralty of St. Petersburg with a  request to reduce lease payments for land. It is curious that  this request was accompanied by a quite categorical official  statement: "The company does not give bribes in any form and  will persistently seek a resolution of this problem." The  tenacity of Coca-Cola representatives astounded the mayoralty.  In the words of Aleksey Kudrin, the chairman of the Committee  for the Economy and Finance of the mayoralty, the history of  Coca-Cola representatives knocking on doors in the official  echelons deserves to be published in the form of a handbook for  Western businessmen, under the title "How To Work in St.  Petersburg."    So the company will have its way: Anatoliy Sobchak has  signed  the directive "On the Construction of Engineering Communications  in the Area of Pulkovo Highway." In keeping with the directive,  Coca-Cola St. Petersburg Bottlers shall be exempted from the  payment of quite a bunch of taxes in 1994. KOMMERSANT considers  it necessary to give a full listing of these taxes: They are the  tax on profit, the tax on enterprise property, the land tax and  lease payments for the parcel of land, the tax on advertisement,  and the tax for the maintenance of housing, facilities of the  sociocultural sphere, and law enforcement organs. An agreement  has also been reached to the effect that the relief will be  extended, taking into account the payment of the cost of  construction of the engineering infrastructure. Such a case sets  a precedent in the practice of work of the St. Petersburg  mayoralty with foreign companies. According to an ironic  assertion by Aleksey Kudrin, the pattern of tax exemptions for  the debtors of the city, for example, the Vodokanal, was used in  developing it. On the whole, the company has been exempted from  50 percent of Russian taxes.    The tractability of the mayoralty is perhaps due to the  recent defeat of another large foreign investor, Procter and  Gamble, in St. Petersburg. At the end of last year, this company  abandoned altogether the construction of its plant in the city  (the project was valued at $300 million). Differences between  the executive and legislative authorities of St. Petersburg were  one of the reasons for this abandonment. The mayoralty did not  want to pick a quarrel with Coca-Cola, to boot. In the committee  for the economy and finance, they believe that tax exemptions  suit both sides and will be used for cooperation with other  foreign investors. Therefore, the "tax holiday" for Coca-Cola in  St. Petersburg is the first case, but by far not the last.    [Boxed item]  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   The fact that the relief granted is quite radical is  noteworthy: Coca-Cola may refrain from paying to the local  authorities the profit tax, at the rate of 22 percent; the tax  on property, at the rate of 2 percent; the tax for the  maintenance of housing, at the rate of 1 percent of the cost of  products; on advertising, at the rate of 5 percent of its cost;  the tax for the maintenance of the sociocultural sphere and law  enforcement organs, at the rate of 3 percent of the labor  remuneration fund; and the tax on land, at the rate of R700 per  square meter.    It is remarkable that such radical steps of the St.  Petersburg authorities are quite symptomatic of the modern  economic policy of Russia. In the environment of an obvious  shortage of actual financial resources, the authorities strive  to avoid in every way possible the direct allocation of funds,  especially those in foreign exchange, to enterprises and prefer  to provide support in the form of granting tax and customs  relief. This is much more convenient: It is one matter to spend  the already available money, and it is quite another to spend  some kind of future revenues, which are frequently very much in  doubt (given the ineffectiveness of the Russian tax system, most  of the future taxes ultimately remain on paper). Apparently, in  the immediate future this tactic will be used extensively to  attract Western investors who do not dwell in particular on the  specifics of Russian taxes, in the customary belief that to get  an exemption from them is the same as getting real money. For  example, as Aleksandr Shokhin admits, the government intends to  compensate the Mars concern for investment in Russia by relief  in the payment of customs duties.    Besides, local authorities have an opportunity to enjoy  additional advantages of such a policy. In particular, in  exchange for tax relief they can shift to investors some of the  duties to finance the urban infrastructure, as well as use the  amount of tax relief or leasing fees as a peculiar contribution  to the statutory fund of a joint enterprise (The government of  Moscow has already started to vigorously use this variant).

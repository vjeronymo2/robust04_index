			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Groupe Suez The looming sale by Groupe Suez of its Victoire insurance subsidiary does little to lessen the confusion surrounding its strategic direction. This is not because a company anxious to maintain a profile in financial services is shedding an insurance business. Suez lacks the retail banking network that is needed to distribute bancassurance products, and Victoire is a less interesting investment since its German business was sold last year. Without Victoire, though, the Suez portfolio, which ranges from banking to hotels and steel, will look odder than before. Recent asset sales appear driven primarily by the need to offset losses on property lending. Exceptional gains of FFr4.4bn from asset sales last year more than accounted for net profits of FFr1.6bn. Provisions should be lower this year but, given the exposure of Suez to the still weak commercial property market, the improvement may be slow. Victoire may thus be the most convenient piece of family silver to put up for sale. But Suez is also raising resources to go on the acquisition trail. Its industrial stakes may give it clout in investment banking, but such an approach depends heavily on an ability to make sensible purchases. Suez will be judged as much by what it buys as what it sells. Given the discount of some 30 per cent to net assets at which its shares are trading, the equity market is not particularly confident. If there are resources to spare, investors might prefer to have them back.</p>

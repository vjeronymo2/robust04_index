(``CBOE or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposal to amend its rules to impose fees on market makers who fail to observe certain participation duties on the Retail Automated Execution System (``RAES'') for equity and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index (``SPX'') classes of options. Among other things, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rules 8.16, ``RAES Eligibility in Equity Options'' and 24.16, ``RAES Eligibility in SPX/NDX,'' to impose the following fees for failures to satisfy the rules' log-off requirements: <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  (1) a fee of $100.00 for each of one to three failures within one twelve-month period; (2) a fee of $250.00 for each of four to six failures within one twelve-month period; and (3) a fee of $500.00 for each of seven or more failures within one twelve-month period. In addition, the proposal provides that members who fail to meet the log-on requirements of CBOE Rules 8.16(b) or 24.16(b) ordinarily will be suspended from participation on RAES at the applicable trading station for a period extending to 21 consecutive business days. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78s(b)(1) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR &sect;240.19b&hyph;4 (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CBOE Rules 8.16(a)(iii) and 24.16(a)(iii) require a market maker participating in RAES for equity or SPX options to continue on the system only as long as he is present in the trading crowd and to log off RAES when he leaves the trading crowd, unless the departure is for a brief interval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CBOE Rule 8.16(b) states that in option classes designated by the Market Performance Committee (``MPC''), any market maker who has logged on RAES at any time during an expiration month must log on the RAES system in that option class whenever he is present in that trading crowd until the next expiration. CBOE Rule 24.16(b) states that unless exempted by the MPC, any market maker who has logged on RAES at any time during an expiration month must log on the RAES system in SPX/NDX whenever he is present in that trading crowd until the next expiration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34270 (June 28, 1994), 59 FR 34457 (July 5, 1994) and 34329 (July 7, 1994), 59 FR 35954 (July 14, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to impose fees on members who fail to observe the RAES log-off requirements set forth in CBOE Rules 8.16(a) and 24.16(a). The proposed fees for equity and SPX RAES are identical in amounts and graduated structure to the fees approved recently for failures to comply with the log-on and log-off requirements for Standard &amp; Poor's 100 Index (``OEX'') options. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  For OEX options, and as proposed for SPX and equity options, the fee amounts increase in relation to the number of times each calendar year that a member does not log off as required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34376 (July 14, 1994), 59 FR 37109 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;12) (``OEX RAES Approval Order'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

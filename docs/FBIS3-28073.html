			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Washington-based correspondent Chong Il-hwa] </F>   [Text] According to high-ranking U.S. officials on 2  February, Pak Kil-yon, North Korean permanent representative to  the United Nations, has been invited to the national breakfast  prayer meeting to be held on 3 February in Washington and there  is a possibility that Pak will encounter U.S. President Bill  Clinton, who will also be attending the prayer meeting.    According to a high-ranking U.S. State Department official,  the State Department approved a one-day-two-night Washington  visit by Representative Pak and he is scheduled to attend the  national breakfast prayer meeting to be held on the morning of 3  February. The official said that an encounter was possible  between President Clinton and Representative Pak at the prayer  meeting.    Representative Pak's Washington visit to attend the  breakfast  prayer meeting is noteworthy because it is taking place at a  time when tension in U.S.-North Korea relations has risen anew  with North Korea's warning that it may not withhold withdrawal  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and with the plan to  deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK.    White House officials said: "President Clinton is scheduled  to attend the 3 February morning prayer meeting but how long he  will stay and with whom he will meet has yet to be decided upon."    A White House official said: "With the current situation in  which negotiation between North Korea and the International  Atomic Energy Agency is at stalemate, it would be very  meaningful for President Clinton and Representative Pak to meet  even briefly."    The U.S. State Department gave advance approval for  Representative Pak's Washington visit because the activities and  travel of North Korean diplomats to the United Nations,  including Representative Pak, are restricted to a 25 mile-radius  in New York.</p>

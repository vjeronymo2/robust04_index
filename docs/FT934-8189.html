			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan threat to delay Gatt offer JAPAN'S minister of agriculture, Mr Eijiro Hata, yesterday indicated Tokyo may not submit its list of market access offers on agriculture to Gatt by the end of the week due to a lack of progress in negotiations, notably on the controversial rice issue. Member countries are expected to table their offers by the end of this week to meet the Uruguay Round trade talks deadline of December 15. Japan does not want to be seen as being responsible for obstructing the successful conclusion of the Round, but it has continued to maintain an inflexible stance on the opening of the country's rice market. During meetings with Sir Leon Brittan on Monday, Japanese politicians kept up their show of resistance to tariffication of rice, maintaining rice was too sensitive a domestic political issue. Japan is offering to reduce tariffs on manufactured goods by 60 per cent. However, outside the agriculture ministry officials say various initiatives are being taken to seek a solution to the rice issue. There is a growing recognition that Japan cannot expect rice to be made an exception and it would be better to take the initiative in negotiating as favourable a deal as possible. 'We must not allow the Uruguay Round to fail as a result of Japan's rice problem,' one official said. 'Japan finds it difficult to accept tariffication as presented in the Dunkel text,' a trade official close to the Uruguay Round talks said. 'We are negotiating ways to modify this scheme.' One possibility would be to accept minimum access to a certain percentage of the rice market without subjecting the remainder to tariffication, though this is unlikely to be acceptable to exporting countries. Another possibility would be to introduce tariffication but on a more gradual timescale than the six years called for in the Dunkel text in order to minimise the impact. It is also conceivable that Japan might agree to tariffication after a certain grace period - the deal widely reported as being agreed with the US. Japan has been warned, however, that modification of the Dunkel text will be very difficult. The four-strong team of Commonwealth ministers who have just completed a world tour of political capitals yesterday said they were 'more optimistic' of a successful conclusion to the Gatt trade talks than they were at the mission's outset, reports Rachel Johnson. But there were still 'pitfalls and difficulties' to overcome. Key officials in Washington, Paris, Bonn, Tokyo and Geneva were still failing to communicate, the team said.</p>

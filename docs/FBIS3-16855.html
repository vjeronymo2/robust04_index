Answering questions from journalists about whether there was  discussion at their meeting of the problems regarding steps  Moscow might take in regard to Pyongyang, which is suspected of  developing nuclear weapons, the Russian minister said: "We  shall firmly insist upon fulfilment of all necessary obligations  and procedures." The forms in which this issue might be  settled, he pointed out, are now being discussed at bilateral  negotiations and the relevant consultations are under way,  including through IAEA channels. "I think we shall be acting  with Japan very closely, as well as with other partners," Andrey  Kozyrev stressed.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HEART ATTACK KILLS MALCOLM FORBES AT 70  </P> <P> Malcolm Forbes, publisher of the business magazine that bears his name and one  of the country's most colorful and outspoken millionaires, died of a heart  attack in his sleep Saturday at his home, a spokesman for the magazine said. He  was 70.  </P> <P> Forbes was pronounced dead at 4:30 p.m. EDT at Timberfield, his home in Far  Hills, N.J., said the spokesman, William Donald Garson, director of corporate  communications for Forbes Inc.  </P> <P> Forbes had returned Saturday morning from a trip to London, Garson said.  </P> <P> He died of natural causes, said Michael Schalet, the Somerset County medical  examiner.  </P> <P> The flamboyant magazine publisher, often seen with actress Elizabeth Taylor at  his side, was known for his hot-air balloons, Harley Davidson motorcycles and  extravagant parties. Forbes spent a reported $2 million on his 70th birthday  party last year.  </P> <P> He was proclaimed an honorary citizen of Tangier, Morocco, as that bash --  which included feast, seaside fireworks and nightlong dancing -- drew to a  close Aug. 21.  </P> <P> The nearly 1,000 guests featured some of the top names in business, industry,  entertainment and the arts: billionaire Donald Trump, Fiat Chairman Giovanni  Agnelli, opera singer Beverly Sills, television personalities Walter Cronkite  and Barbara Walters, Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, publishers Katharine  Graham, Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell, former Secretary of State Henry A.  Kissinger, and former Kings Constantine of Greece and Simeon of Bulgaria.  </P> <P> They were feasted in Moroccan-style tents to pigeon pie, lamb mechoui and  chicken tadjine.  </P> <P> Forbes' worth was estimated by various sources at $400 million to $1 billion.  </P> <P> He appeared in the celebrity columns of newspapers as often as on the business  pages, frequently in connection with a motorcycle ride or balloon flight.  </P> <P> Taylor had been his frequent companion since his 39-year marriage ended in  divorce in 1985.  </P></p>

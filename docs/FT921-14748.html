			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Tomkins rises 40% on growing US sales GROWING sales of bicycles, baths and handguns in the US and tight cash control on both sides of the Atlantic helped Tomkins, the UK industrial conglomerate, to increase pre-tax profits by 40 per cent to Pounds 43.7m in the six months to November 2. The conglomerate's figures, which included a 52 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 594.5m from Pounds 390.7m, were driven up with the help of a 26-week contribution from Philips Industries, the US industrial group acquired in August 1990, compared with 10 weeks in the first half of last year. As Philips was bought for Dollars 550m (Pounds 307.2m), funded by a 3-for-4 rights issue, the US share of Tomkins's trading profit has gone up to two thirds. Philips is now in a division called Tomkins Industries, which more than trebled trading profit to Pounds 17.6m from Pounds 5.2m on sales of Pounds 288.9m up from Pounds 95.7m. Philips's head office costs were halved and nine factories closed but Mr Gregory Hutchings, chief executive, said no costs arising from this action had been taken as extraordinary or exceptional charges. 'Reorganisation is part of our business,' he said. He named several ex-Philips subsidiaries, including Lasco Bathware and Lasco Panels, as star performers alongside the bicycles and lawnmowers sold by Murray Ohio, but some UK activities suffered: three were building related and four in the fasteners industry. The group had Pounds 70m in the bank and Mr Hutchings said he would prefer the next acquisition to be in the UK. He complained that companies were still too 'highly rated even though they are not doing well'. He was cool on the idea of expanding in continental Europe because of 'getting companies to operate properly', referring to labour laws and language barriers. Group trading profit rose 41 per cent to Pounds 37m, while interest received advanced to Pounds 4.15m from Pounds 2.63m. The Pounds 70m cash compared with Pounds 45m at the start of the year. Mr Ian Duncan, finance director, said the growth in interest income came in spite of rates falling from 15 per cent to between 10 per cent and 12 per cent. The group tends to borrow in the US and deposit in the UK to take advantage of differing rates. 'This time last year the gap was 4 per cent, now it's 2 per cent,' said Mr Duncan, stressing that at least half the interest income came from 'money in the bank' as opposed to exploiting the rate gap. Growth in fully-diluted earnings per share was limited to 9.7 per cent, making 9.01p, against 8.21p, because of the equity issued for the Philips deal. The interim dividend was raised 15 per cent from 2.8p to 3.22p. The breakdown of results from the five divisions showed that only the two dominated by US companies made progress. After Tomkins Industries, the next best performance came from professional, garden and leisure products. Trading profit rose to Pounds 7.5m from Pounds 6.6m on sales of Pounds 176.5m, up from Pounds 156.8m. Murray Ohio increased its sales of bicycles, mainly at the expense of importers, and demand for lawnmowers remained firm. Exports of Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers reached record levels and domestic sales also grew. In the services to industry division, good performances in the distribution of valves and vehicle components were more than offset by depressed demand for fasteners. Trading profit slipped to Pounds 4.8m from Pounds 5.3m on sales of Pounds 59m, down from Pounds 62.1m. Fluid controls fell back from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 4.1m on sales of Pounds 39.3m against Pounds 45.7m, affected by the slump in UK construction, while industrial products declined to Pounds 3m from Pounds 3.4m. Mr Duncan said that where turnover had fallen, the cash position had been improved by cutting stocks and debtors and other economies. The interest income generated in the UK had been more than the net figure of Pounds 4.15m, while the former Philips group had incurred an interest charge. Lex, Page 16</p>

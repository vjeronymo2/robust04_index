			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Restrictions on Management Stock Benefit and Recognition Plans (MRPs)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS Revisions prohibit MRPs in conversions of federal and state savings associations. Currently, however, the regulations and policies of some state banking and thrift regulators permit MRPs to purchase a certain percentage of the stock sold in a mutual-to-stock conversion of a bank or savings association depending on the institution's capital position. Under some of these regulations and guidelines, management also may be granted stock options up to a certain percentage of the shares issued in the conversion. Based on a review of numerous proposed conversions, the Board believes that some bank insiders may be sacrificing the interests of their institutions and depositors in order to acquire significant amounts of conversion stock and other benefits more advantageously than depositors. Also, in some instances, the issuance of conversion stock to an MRP decreases the opportunity for depositors to obtain conversion stock. Moreover, the issuance of stock options at the conversion price, rather than at the aftermarket trading price, which in recent years has been substantially higher than the conversion price, creates the impression that insider enrichment may be the main reason for the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These factors reflect negatively on management's fulfillment of its fiduciary obligations. In fact, it may be an inherent conflict of interest for management to decide to convert the bank to stock form when, as part of the proposed conversion, management will reap significant benefits. Independent business judgment is essential to the proper carrying out of a manager's obligations. This judgment may be severely clouded when MRPs are provided as part of the conversion transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed below, the FDIC received several comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule about management compensation in the conversion process. Many of these comments argued that the management of converting institutions should benefit from the conversion because such insiders are responsible for the bank's success and will undertake additional and perhaps more difficult challenges upon the bank's conversion to stock form. The Board does not disagree with this general point of view. While the Board believes that management and trustees would have increased responsibilities as a public company, preliminarily, the Board believes that, in most cases, market-based management compensation should be determined by the stockholders after the conversion is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In particular, the proposed rule would provide that no converted savings bank shall, for one year from the date of the conversion, implement a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified employee stock ownership plan, unless: each of the plans was fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion stock offering materials; all such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation and no sooner than the first annual meeting following the conversion; in the case of a savings bank subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by a majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation and no sooner than the first annual meeting following the stock issuance; for stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant; and for management or employee stock benefit plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed restrictions on MRPs do not include specific percentage limitations. Preliminarily, the FDIC believes that the proposed restrictions would adequately safeguard against potential management self-interest in mutual-to-stock conversions. Also, pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC would continue to look to MRP percentage limitations in the OTS regulations, as well as in the applicable state law and regulations, as a frame of reference for reviewing proposed conversions of State Savings Banks. In addition, the FDIC believes that specific percentage limitations on MRPs may be too rigid and not serve to stem management abuses in every situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board requests specific comments on whether MRP percentage limitations should be specified in the FDIC's regulations and, if so, what those percentages should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

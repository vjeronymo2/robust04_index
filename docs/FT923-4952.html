			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (6): US giant wraps up takeover - Competition in UK domestic parcels sector intensifies THE recent arrival of the world's largest package delivery company on the UK domestic parcels scene will further sharpen the already fierce competition in that sector of the distribution market. The company concerned, US-based United Parcel Service, finally made its move into the UK parcels business at the end of June with the acquisition of privately-owned operator Carryfast. The latter, which has 17 depots, 350 vehicles and an annual turnover of around Pounds 31m, operates one-day guaranteed and three-day guaranteed UK delivery services. In contrast to the UPS expansion, rival US parcels giant Federal Express had just a couple of months earlier vividly illustrated the tough nature of the UK domestic parcels market by pulling out of that business and other European operations because of continuing losses. That withdrawal had in fact left only one other of the world's big four express companies, TNT, active in the UK domestic sector. The fourth member of the quartet, DHL, sold its UK domestic delivery organisation Elan to a group of venture capitalists in August last year. The FedEx retreat this year triggered an important battle for business among remaining parcels delivery operators seeking to win some of the estimated Pounds 40m worth of former FedEx business. The market's second largest carrier, Securicor Omega Express (SOE), got a head start by paying FedEx around Pounds 7m for the US company's business goodwill and other assets. But other operators were predictably quick to try and win some of that business away from SOE - market leader Parcelforce, for example, claimed that following the Fedex withdrawal, it picked up an additional Pounds 4m worth of new contracts by the end of May. Looking ahead, the next known big development on the UK parcels delivery scene could well involve the recently- announced plans to privatise Parcelforce. The Royal Mail organisation is reckoned to have more than 30 per cent of the market. It made a loss in the financial year to end-March 1992 of Pounds 24m but that was a substantial improvement on the Pounds 131m incurred the previous year. Mr Peter Howarth, managing director of Parcelforce prior to his promotion last month to become managing director of Royal Mail, confirms that recession has hit the overall UK parcels business very hard. 'There was a reduction of 20 per cent in the volume of express traffic during 1991/92 and a reduction of 40 per cent in the non- urgent market,' he says. To survive in that sort of market, says Mr Colin Millbanks, chief executive of Mayne Nickless group parcels carrier Parceline, companies have had to focus firmly on bottom-line performance rather than, as had been the case until the recession, concentrating on building up volumes. As an example of that trend, he points to Parceline's performance for the year ended June 30, 1992. 'Revenues increased 6 per cent, shipments increased 1 per cent but package throughput reduced by 1 per cent and our costs are 1 per cent lower year on year in absolute terms. Clearly we have increased margins considerably.' In addition to the leading players, there are reckoned to be something like 1,000 smaller companies operating in the UK domestic parcels delivery market, ranging from one-man operators to medium-size franchise organisations. Although none of them handles even 1 per cent of the overall market, it is estimated that those smaller operators together account for around 55 per cent of the urgent parcels business and 45 per cent of the non-urgent sector. 'With smaller operations and lower overheads, including the growth of franchising, this area could in time pose a greater threat to the larger established companies than current market influences,' suggests Mr Howarth. Further adding to the competition for UK parcels distribution business, particularly at the heavier end of the market, is a growing move by more traditional road transport companies to upgrade some of their operations to offer faster, time-definite deliveries. Kent-based Laser Transport, for example, recently entered the UK express market with the launch of next-day, two-day and three-day delivery services. For their part, established parcel delivery companies are putting an increasing emphasis on the provision of more information and improved customer care. Stimulating that development, they say, is the fact that customers are increasingly taking for granted the provision of fast, reliable delivery services at acceptable rates. 'Companies are requiring more management information from their express carriers to enable them, for example, to analyse expenditure by departments and service levels used. As companies increasingly need to be accountable, so do the carriers,' says Mr David Kennard, managing director of Securiguard group parcels company City Link. But parcels companies also say that both they and their customers are becoming more selective about the volumes and types of information passed between them. For example, there was at one point a clear move by some operators to introduce systems which could provide customers with fast proof of delivery (POD) information about all their shipments. More recently, though, there has been something of a rethink on that subject. 'It is easy to kid yourself that everyone wants POD information the minute a shipment arrives,' says Mr Jonathan Smith, general manager London and South East for British Rail parcels company Red Star. 'But we have found that what most people really want is for us to be pro-active when there is a problem. They want to know what has happened, why and what we are doing about it.' Support for that view comes from Mr John Bintliff, chairman of Elan. He agrees that the main information requirement of most customers is for news about 'exceptions', that is, when parcels are not delivered as scheduled. 'Initially, we telephoned that information, now we are faxing it direct off screen and in future, I am sure we will use EDI (electronic data interchange) systems,' he adds. In line with that increased customer care, parcels delivery companies are also developing new services and even partnership arrangements to cater for particularly specific requirements. A recent example of that trend is provided by TNT Sameday, part of TNT Express (UK). It has formed a partnership with Hutchison Paging (UK) to provide a two-hour replacement pager service for customers in mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. When delivering the pagers, TNT Sameday motorcycle riders will display the Hutchison brand on their vests and a magnetic logo on their machines.</p>

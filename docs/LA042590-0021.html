			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSAL YANKED FOR OXNARD REVIEW PANEL  </P> <P> Without an explanation, Oxnard Councilwoman Dorothy Maron withdrew a proposal  Tuesday to form a committee of residents and council members to review the  city's new General Plan, which she has criticized as being "very pro-growth."  </P> <P> At Maron's request, the City Council voted unanimously to withdraw her  recommendation to form a committee that would include the council and five  residents, one resident chosen by each council member.  </P> <P> Maron said she proposed forming the committee two weeks ago because she  believed that the General Plan failed to adequately address ways to regulate or  limit traffic levels, residential growth and "high-risk" industries.  </P> <P> In an interview after the decision, Maron declined to explain why she withdrew  her proposal.  </P> <P> "I can't tell the truth and if I can't tell the truth I won't comment," she  said, adding that she still has some concerns about the plan.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi said he is not sure why Maron withdrew her proposal but  guessed that she had been lobbied by Planning Commission members who oppose the  formation of another review committee.  </P> <P> He said Maron may have withdrawn her proposal because of "the reaction that  some of us have received from members of the Planning Commission:  disappointment, anger."  </P> <P> Takasugi and Councilman Manual Lopez adamantly opposed the recommendation two  weeks ago, saying it would only replicate the review process of the council and  the commission.  </P> <P> The General Plan, which is now being studied by the Planning Commission, is set  for council review and approval next month.  </P> <P> In 1986, the council formed the General Plan Advisory Committee, a 22-member  group of residents, city officials and other community representatives who  reviewed the General Plan during 33 meetings over 2 1/2 years. The Planning  Commission has been reviewing the plan since June, 1989.  </P> <P> In an interview Tuesday, Lopez said he thinks Maron's proposal to form another  review committee came as an insult to members of the commission and the  advisory committee "because they have worked on it for awhile."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Geraldine Furr, who previously supported the proposal, said she  changed her mind about forming a new committee after studying the matter  further.  </P> <P> She said she would like to have the General Plan come before the council before  making any decision on whether another committee is needed.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ann Johs, who previously supported the proposal, said she voted to  withdraw the proposal because a report drafted by city staff this week answered  some of Maron's concerns about the General Plan.  </P> <P> In general, the report says the Planning Commission and the advisory committee  have addressed ways of limiting traffic, residential housing and "high-risk"  industries.  </P></p>

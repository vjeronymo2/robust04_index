			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by the chief editor: "Democracy, O Your Majesty </F> the King!"]    [Text] King Husayn has always spoken warmly about the  freedom, dignity, and pride of the Jordanians, who only bow to  Almighty God. The king was not satisfied with this, so he  decided -- as he stressed in his address to the deputies  recently -- to return democracy to the country. Within a few  years, democratic institutions were set up, the National Charter  was adopted by the influential political forces in Jordan,  democratic laws were enacted, martial laws were abolished, and  public liberties were launched. All this was accompanied by  intensive royal calls for safeguarding the human rights of the  Jordanians as a prelude to setting up a Jordanian democratic  example in the entire Arab region. The objective of King Husayn  is -- as he himself reiterated in his address to the most  important democratic institution in the country, the Parliament  -- to make the Jordanians in particular, and the Arabs in  general, feel that they are no less great than the other free  peoples of the world.    It would be fair to say that the citizens in Jordan have  enjoyed an atmosphere of openness, frankness, and freedom the  likes of which do not exist in the entire Arab region. However,  we also must be fair and say that some officials are still  incapable of democratizing their mind, behavior, and way of  practicing their powers. We are now witnessing a kind of  retreat on the issue of human rights in Jordan. Deputies,  writers, and officials have admitted that the whole  democratization process will be endangered if the decisionmakers  do not take the initiative and adopt immediate measures to  safeguard the king's decision, to save it from the tampering of  those who are committing undemocratic violations, whether with  good or bad intentions. We, as journalists, are aware of the  long list of these violations. The masses, who know some of  these violations, sometimes file complaints, while other times  leaving the matter to God.    The strange thing is that most of the violations of human  rights in Jordan are committed in the name of the law under the  pretext of maintaining security. In other words, the citizen's  security is undermined and his dignity is rubbed in the dirt to  maintain security, as happened a few days ago in al-Baq'ah Camp,  where innocent citizens were forced to lay down on the ground  and were insulted and treated badly. When the deputies of the  Islamic Action Front [IAF] brought the matter to the prime  minister, in his capacity the head of the executive branch, he  said that this incident is an individual and separate one,  expressed his regret at such incidents, and promised to follow  it up.    In another incident, Engineer 'Abd-al-Majid Dayyah,  secretary  of the IAF branch in Suwaylih, was arrested under strange  circumstances. The people who carried out the arrests presented  a memorandum signed by the public prosecutor but with no names  in it. When Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah, who was present during the  arrest, expressed his astonishment at such behavior, the person  in charge of the arrest filled in the form in front of the  deputy.    In another incident, a youth was arrested because he was  carrying leaflets issued by the Muslim Brotherhood, which is a  legal group as we know, and was placed in custody with suspects  in immoral cases and criminals. This youth was released after  spending a terrible night with those people, who insulted him.  And the list of such examples is long. Certain citizens are  still banned from employment in accordance with the instructions  of the security forces. We also still hear about the  confiscation of passports, unfounded arrests, investigations,  and other practices that prevailed under the martial law.    Such incidents -- even if they are few compared with what  took place under the martial law -- should sound the alarm. The  royal decision is very clear, and the executive and judicial  branches are charged by the king's designation letter to carry  out all of the king's instructions. If these branches are  incapable of carrying out these instructions, then they must  step down immediately and resign because they are not faithful  to the interests of the people and are incapable of carrying out  the leadership's decisions. And if they do not want to carry  out the king's instructions, this is even more serious because  they will be declaring their rebellion and mutiny, God forbid.  This has never occurred in the history of Jordan. Our  contemporary history has never registered a government that  refused to implement the throne's instructions.    The citizens seek to entrench free democratic life and to  live under laws that ensure fair trials for suspects. However,  the citizens are now living in a state of confusion and anxiety.  This state can only end if we remove the gap between the  desires and instructions of King Husayn on one hand and the  practices of the executive branch on the other. If laws are not  implemented in a legal way our democratic march will be  threatened.    No honest citizen will call for freeing criminals from the  penalty stipulated by law, but the trials of those people must  be fair and their arrests must be under humane circumstances.  King Husayn does not accept fabricated accusations or that  injustice and insults can be practiced against his people.</p>

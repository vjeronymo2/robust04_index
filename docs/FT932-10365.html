			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Get to know the National IF YOU would like to get to know the collection at London's National Gallery better, Paintings and the Great Questions is thoroughly enjoyable and stimulating way to do it. Each Tuesday in May, Director Neil MacGregor talks about a different wing of the Gallery and a different period of art, focussing on the thought-world of artists and their patrons. On the following Thursday evening, the relevant wing is then open late (6.15-7.45pm) for a private visit by the audience which has been equipped with a study-pack. Next week's lecture will focus on Veronese's 'Family of Darius' and the marriage of Christianity and appreciation of antiquity in the Renaissance. Lectures begin at 6.30 in the Sainsbury Wing. Cost per lecture is Pounds 15; tickets are available from the National Gallery, telephone 071-389-1771</p>

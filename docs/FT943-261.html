			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan and US in last effort Eleventh-hour negotiations to prise open Japanese markets to US goods and services resume in Washington today. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's international trade and industry minister, and Mr Yohei Kono, the Japanese foreign minister, return to Washington after breaking off talks earlier in the week because of urgent parliamentary business in Tokyo. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative said the ministers were 'very aware' of the US resolve in the matter, which will culminate either in trade peace, deadlock or partial deals and partial sanctions. Firmly re-stating the US position on the framework negotiations, Mr Kantor warned Japan that he will accept nothing less than 'real, substantial, concrete, tangible agreements' to resolve the trans-Pacific trade imbalance. Negotiations, which have stretched fruitlessly over the past 14 months resume hours before the US deadline for new Japanese offers to open markets. Whether or not such a deal emerges by midnight tonight - the US deadline for sanctions if there is no agreement - Mr Kantor said he would make an announcement on Japan trade tomorrow. 'We're dedicated to altering a situation in which our market is open to their goods and their market is closed to our goods. That situation has to be remedied,' Mr Kantor said. 'We are going to adhere strictly to the dictates of the framework,' he added, referring to talks that have yielded no results. A US official said that Washington means business by the midnight deadline and will not countenance any delays. 'Either way, this is finished Saturday.' Meanwhile lower-level officials will keep talking, with both sides aware that a failure to find common ground this week could mark a dangerous downturn in trans-Pacific ties. Four sectors are under negotiation: cars, procurement, insurance and glass. US officials have all but ruled out a deal on cars and scoffed at Japanese suggestions Mr Hashimoto will present a new offer in the sector. US retaliatory action, however, would be some months in coming. If the US sends a list of market barriers to Congress under the Super 301 law, a three-week period of consultations would follow. On October 21, investigations would be initiated and it could take another year to 18 months before sanctions are imposed unilaterally.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A DECADE OF DEADLINES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1986: Semi-conductors pact. US threatens heavy penalty duties on Japanese chips unless Japan stops selling at below market prices in US and allows US manufactuers larger share of Japanese market. US imposes deadline for agreement but extends this several times as negotiators struggle to find mechanism for increasing US share without setting precise percentages or targets. Finally, stern midnight deadline imposed; agreement reached minutes before it expires.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1987: Legal services accord. US threatens to charge Japan with unfair trading practices and impose tariffs or quotas. 'Japan has been virtually closed to foreign lawyers for over 30 years,' says Clayton Yeutter, US trade representative. Japan agrees to expand kinds of legal matters US lawyers can deal with.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1988: Beef and citrus fruit agreement. Japan agrees to remove non-tariff barriers on range of products and reduce tariffs on others, thereby avoiding US investigation of Japanese restrictions. US withdraws complaint to Gatt. Yeutter hails agreement as 'a great day for American agriculture, a great day for Japanese consumers.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989: Radio and cellular telephones. Another US deadline approaches, this time for President Bush to make good threat to impose sanctions on potential 50-item list of products including colour television receivers, tape recorders and photocopiers. In more cliff-hanger negotiations, Japan agrees to improve access to broadcast spectrum for radio and cellular telephones and to provide comparable access to its cellular telephone market. Japan names a cellular telephone operator to install Motorola system; US claims that, by doing so, Japan assumes responsibility to ensure that operator performs.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990: Wood products. Five days before deadline on which US will, for a second year, target Japan as unfair trading partner under possible Super 301 sanctions, Japan agrees to remove various barriers to sale of US wood products. US removes Japan for trading-partners 'hit list'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991: Public works. US threatens to bar Japanese companies from federally funded construction projects and sets another deadline. This extended by 13 hours to allow for overnight negotiating; Japan agrees to double number of government-funded construction projects open to US bidders and introduce more-open bidding system covering both material and consulting services.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992: Paper products. US complains that Japan imports only 3.7 per cent of paper and paperboard products, of which only 1.7 per cent come from US. Agreement signed calling for Japanese authorities to encourage important paper users to adopt written purchasing guidelines applicable to both domestic and foreign suppliers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994: Cellular telephones. US trade representative Mickey Kantor, brandishing a Motorola telephone, accuses Japan of violating 1989 fair-access agreement, saying santicions would be announced within 30 days. At the last minute, Japanese authorities agree to monitor progress in investment by private operator in Motorola's system, to back low-interest loans from Japan Development Bank for that purpose, and to allocate more radio frequency to Motorola system.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994: Public procurement of telecommunications, insurance, access to car and car parts markets. US sets midnight, end-September deadline for agreements, saying that without agreement US law would require sanctions machinery to be put in train. Ryutaro Hashimoto, international trade and industry minister, despatched to Washington at last minute to try to resolve issues with Kantor. Further all-night negotiating sessions are expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

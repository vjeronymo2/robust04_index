			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Point of lesson missed Sir, William Packer has completely missed the point in his article, 'Betrayed by the system' (February 8), on the Lessons in Life exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, which is devoted to the Outreach Programme. The programme is not about learning, it is about getting people to want to learn. The Lessons in Life exhibition reflects this admirable mission, admirably. Nobody is claiming that people can be taught to draw in a day's workshop. Denise Larking Coste, executive vice president, CIES, 61 Quai d'Orsay, Paris, France</p>

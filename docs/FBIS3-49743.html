			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ilie Serbanescu: "An Awful Triumph"] </F>   [Text] Whether we realize it or not, these days Romania is  going through one of the most turbulent moments of its history.  For a short while, after the 1989 December events (about which  we did not know much at the time they occurred) we believed we  would be able to start living a normal life, escape from  uncivilized poverty and an aberrant international isolation in  an era of the most acute "shrinking" of the planet, due to the  impact of the formidable progress made in the field of  electronics and telecommunication. We had signs long ago that  this aspiration was but an illusion (and, in a tragic way, not  long after that significant December 1989). But now we are  absolutely sure of it. The West has dealt a mortal blow to the  Romanians. Or, at least to the naive people who believed that  ultimately, salvation from the West would reach us. The West  has robbed Romanians of hope.    We can advance toward a normal life only through our own  efforts and with the indispensable assistance of those we saw  living a normal life, that is, the West. It is difficult to  evaluate the percentage, but most probably at least half of the  contribution must belong to us. That is, we have to start  living a normal life, to work hard and become productive, to get  seriously organized in order to become efficient, and to be  merciless with ourselves in order to be able to confront  successfully an equally merciless international competition that  characterizes the end of the 20th century and the beginning of  the third millennia. We also have to be aware of the fact that  the values of democracy and the market economy must be promoted  because we indeed need them, and not because somebody somewhere  asks us to do so. The second half of the contribution in the  aforementioned proportion was expected to come from the West.  And a contribution of 50 percent is still not an exaggeration,  because this would not have meant immediate money and advice,  but rather the adequate political pressure that would direct us,  and even drag us if necessary, toward a normal life in those  many cases and situations in which the old mentalities and  structures fiercely opposed it. Currently the West is  announcing officially, even if it maintains a screen of bare  words, that Romania is not part of its world. NATO is  officially declaring that it has no intention of guaranteeing  security for the former communist countries from the new Russian  empire, guarantee that cannot exist in reality except if these  countries join NATO. But there is something else even more  tragic! If such an admission to NATO takes place, this will be  achieved in two phases: first the "Central European" countries  and never the "East European" countries. The American president  who came to Europe to sanction the policy of the West toward the  East, communicated to this to Romania through the fact that  after his stay in Central Europe he flew directly to Moscow. If  we acknowledge the American thesis, namely that Mr. Clinton did  not stop in Prague to seal Central Europe's blessing and  excommunicate East Europe, then, there can be only one, even  more annoying interpretation, for this discriminatory visit as  far as Romania's aspirations are concerned. Mr. Clinton went  there to appease those who not only thought that the West will  help them to emerge from their "eastern condemnation" but also  did all they could to change themselves and receive the alms and  assistance of the West.    It is clear now that there was no question of Romania's  admission even being discussed at all. Those who believed that  the West's reticence toward Romania was due to the leadership in  Bucharest were mistaken. The reality was exactly the opposite.  The leadership structure in Bucharest is the way it is  precisely because Romania was not considered even for a moment  as part of the Western sphere but as part of the Russian sphere.  Those who believed that the West would not indefinitely accept  that the old structures remain unchanged in Romania and the  reform aimed at a market economy has not been implemented, were  naive people. The reality is that the West was less than  marginally interested in our country, because Romania was not  and will not be part of its world.    Those who led our destinies -- probably were aware of this  --  through the current official NATO decision, experience these  days a real triumph. They can prove now that Romania's  association to the Western world does not take place not because  of them, that is, because of the communist restoration or the  blocking of the reform, but because of the West itself, which  has showed that it does not want us. As a matter of fact, they  did their duty formally and advanced the request to join the  NATO, when it was clear that in no way can such a thing come  into question. The excommunicatory treatment applied to  Romanians -- who, contrary to the Central Europeans, are  considered in the West as people from the other side of the  fence -- is a shattering additional argument for the "Eastern"  statute of Romania.    What else can the Romanians do? The ideal reaction -- or  better said idealistic reaction -- would be if they obstinately  progressed on the path of democracy and of market economy in  spite of the leadership in Bucharest which is not really in  favor of it. In a way, it would be a case of promoting a  "pro-Western" attitude without the West. These are impossible  prospects because we did not do it before, not even when it was  believed that the West is with us!</p>

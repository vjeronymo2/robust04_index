			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ADULT-ORIENTED-BUSINESS CURBS PROPOSED  </P> <P> A series of proposals aimed at curbing some of the problems caused by  adult-oriented businesses have been unveiled and could lead to new restrictions  on adult bookstores, peep shows, billiard parlors and businesses serving  alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> At a study session Wednesday night, City Manager George Tindall and  administrative analyst Catherine C. Standiford presented the City Council with  what they termed a "matrix" of proposed changes in city ordinances and policies  for dealing with adult uses and businesses regulated by the state Department of  Alcoholic Beverage Control.  </P> <P> Among the possible changes are restrictions on the number of hours the adult  bookstores and peep shows may operate (many are open 24 hours a day), and  zoning regulations that would space the businesses farther apart.  </P> <P> Other proposed changes include requiring a conditional-use permit for adult  uses, or possibly changing the zoning along Garden Grove Boulevard to  residential or commercial zones that do not allow adult-only uses.  </P> <P> "I think we all agree with these in concept," said Councilman Robert F. Dinsen  at the conclusion of the study session. Many of the recommendations are  expected to be brought back to the council later for formal action.  </P> <P> Garden Grove has seven adult bookstores and peep shows, and the city has  battled for years to regulate those businesses, all of which are located along  Garden Grove Boulevard. Tindall said that in the area between Beach Boulevard  and Magnolia Street, the crime rate is 50% higher than other areas of the  thoroughfare, and twice as high as the rest of the city.  </P> <P> The program of changes is "not going to get rid of adult uses. It's going to  give us better control of them," Tindall said.  </P> <P> Council members were not in favor of creating a special zone for adult uses,  like the notorious "combat zone" in Boston in the 1970s.  </P> <P> "I've been to Boston and seen the combat zone," said Councilman Frank Kessler,  a former chief of police. "It was appropriately named. Believe me, you don't  want a 'combat zone' in Garden Grove."  </P> <P> Also coming under scrutiny were billiard parlors and pool halls, which have  proliferated in the city with the influx of Southeast Asian residents.  </P> <P> "Crime doesn't necessarily happen in the billiard parlors," said Police Chief  John Robertson, "but crimes such as shootings have happened nearby, and they  have become a hangout for local gangs."  </P></p>

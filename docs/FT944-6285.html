			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Fear of rate rises subdues PSBR joy  -Markets The financial markets gave an unenthusiastic response to yesterday's Budget. Traders welcomed the the reduction in public borrowing but the good news was tempered by fears of interest rate rises and future tax cuts, our Financial Staff writes. UK government bonds fell by more than  1/2 a point on the day, while the FT-SE index was up 14 points to close at 3061.1, although equity prices fell marginally after the Budget announcement. On the currency markets sterling showed little response to the budget, rising half a pfennig to DM2.4550 after the speech, before stabilising. Sterling lost ground against the dollar, which was buoyed by renewed speculation of higher US interest rates. Yesterday evening it was trading at Dollars 1.5630, compared with Dollars 1.5680 before the release of US consumer confidence figures and the Budget speech. Traders were disappointed by the Chancellor's forecast that public sector borrowing for the current financial year would be Pounds 34.5bn, higher than many analysts had expected. However, the PSBR downward revision for 1995/96 to Pounds 21.5bn from the current estimate of Pounds 28bn was welcomed, as were significant reductions for the two subsequent years. Mr Robert Barrie, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities house, said: 'By 1998-99 there will effectively be a balanced budget. That has to be good news for the gilts market.' Mr Barrie said the Budget marked a 'shift in the tide from the last couple of budgets which were marked by fiscal tightening and the next couple of budgets which will be tax-cutting'. Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International, said there was 'deep cynicism' about whether the improvement in the PSBR targets could be maintained. 'It feels like we are being set up for tax cuts next year,' he said. There were other serious causes for concern. Economists said the upward revision in GDP growth estimates would put pressure on interest rates. 'We are still looking for a base rate rise either early next year or even late this year,' Mr Barrie said. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in London, said that the chancellor's commitment in the Budget to low inflation had 'clearly heightened expectations of an early interest rate rise'. Mr David Miles, UK economist at US investment bank Merrill Lynch, expects interest rates to rise by between 150 and 200 basis points before the end of next year. Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura, said: 'There is nothing in this for the gilts market.' He added that the chancellor had 'given a clear signal that the period of fiscal restraint has come to an end'. Some traders were unhappy about the slow speed of the development of the gilt repo market. 'We are now officially at the same stage we all thought we were at unofficially a year ago,' a trader said. One senior equity marketmaker described the Budget as 'shockingly boring'. He said: 'Apart from the usual tobacco, brewing, spirits, petrol, diesel stories, there seems to be nothing for us to get our teeth into.'</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: Best sanction against conflict of interest Sir, As a practitioner in an investment management group I was interested by Lex's worries ('Investment trusts', February 27) about conflicts of interest between invest-ment trusts and their managers. I personally keep the bulk of my assets in the shares of the investments trusts of the group where I work, for the simple reason that I know that the investment strategy followed is the same as I would follow were my assets large enough to warrant a discrete port-folio. Thus as a manager my interests are precisely ad idem with the other shareholders of the investment trusts. No regulator could invent a more telling sanction.

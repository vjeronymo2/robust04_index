			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Rover in the black with Pounds 128m turnround British Aerospace said yesterday that the Rover vehicles business had achieved a Pounds 128m turnround in 1993 at the trading level before taking into account exceptional items. Rover's profit before interest, but including exceptional items, rose to Pounds 56m last year from a loss of Pounds 49m. The Land Rover four-wheel drive vehicle operations accounted for the lion's share of the profits, and BAe refused to disclose whether the car operations alone had managed to break even. Total Rover group vehicle production (including Land Rover) rose 6.2 per cent last year to 430,211 from 404,971. Within this total, production of the Honda Concerto fell to 18,406 from 32,444. Mr George Simpson, Rover group chairman, said capital expenditure by Rover rose by Pounds 12m to Pounds 222m last year and had averaged Pounds 200m a year in the last five years. The workforce increased to 33,900 at the end of 1993 from 33,500. The number of white collar jobs had been cut, but production workers had been added at the Solihull and Cowley assembly plants.</p>

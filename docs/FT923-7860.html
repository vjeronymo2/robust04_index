			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Silica aerogel launched in space: Sixteen pieces of silica aerogel, one of the lightest solids on earth, were launched into space last week when the space shuttle Atlantis released the European Retrieval Carrier, or Eureca, satellite. The silica aerogel pieces are glued into aluminium canisters connected to the outside of the satellite. They will remain in space for nine months acting as cosmic dust catchers. The experiment, which was constructed at the University of Kent, is designed to detect evidence of organic material containing carbon and hydrogen to address the age-old question of whether life exists in space. The material was produced by scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Within the last six months they have developed an even lighter silica aerogel that is less dense than air. Commercial applications are expected to include packaging and insulation.

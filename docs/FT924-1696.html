			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bagri sees wider horizons for LME - The incoming chairman is eager to enhance the London Metal Exchange's international status MR RAJ Bagri takes over as chairman of the London Metal Exchange in January at a time when several important issues have to be resolved - among them the question of whether the time is ripe for the exchange to move aggressively to win copper business away from the New York Commodity Exchange. Although he is no revolutionary (as you would expect of a man of 62 who has been associated with the LME management since 1973) Mr Bagri insists that, if the exchange is to enhance its international status - as he intends it to  -'there can be no no-go areas'. It needs strategically-placed delivery points for its metals all over the world. This means Mr Bagri would like to see changes in the US, where LME-authorised warehouses do not stock copper, and in Japan, where they are restricted to storing only primary aluminium. The first US warehouses started operating less than a year ago and copper, which is traded in sterling in the LME 'ring', was excluded so as not to challenge the New York Commodity Exchange's copper contract. This is a dollar contract and occasionally presents arbitrage opportunities to LME traders. However, recent turbulence in currency markets caused a change of heart among London-based traders so the LME copper contract will shortly switch to from sterling to dollars. This eliminates the main reason for excluding copper from US warehouses. But Mr Bagri does not believe the LME should challenge Comex head-on. 'At the end of the day it will be for the users of and dealers in metals in the US to decide whether they feel their best interests will be served by having LME warehouses (for copper) in that part of the world.' He says 'frank discussions' will take place between the LME and US users of the exchange, but no pressure will be brought to bear. 'I do not rule out the possibility of copper in US warehouses - or any other part of the world  -but this is not something we want to thrust on people.' He hoped, however, that consensus could quickly be reached to allow copper into LME warehouses in Japan. On another 'hot' topic - the question of whether ring-dealing members of the exchange are getting a raw deal compared to other members - Mr Bagri says he does not want to pre-judge the study the LME board has asked to be carried out. Nevertheless, 'on the face of it there is probably some merit in what the ring-dealing members have been saying. They say they are being asked to carry a greater share of the burden of running the exchange, supporting the exchange and carrying on the business of the exchange, but returns are not commensurate with risks being taken and facilities provided. 'If this is true, we will certainly have to address ourselves to the situation because, if we want to maintain our pre-eminence as a price reference for the international metals market, we need a healthy market, and we need good training practices, we need good, qualified people on the ring, and we need reliable floor members. That means the ring-dealers must be happy.' Mr Bagri suggests there is no suitable alternative at present to the LME's 'open outcry' trading system and he is not worried about the recent fall in the number of ring-dealing members, caused primarily by the introduction of new types of associate broker members who do not sit in the ring. He says it is much more important to have a good cross-section of the metals industry represented in the ring. 'Whether the right number is 16 or 22 I can't say. I think it is much better to have a good, fully-committed, fully-financed ring membership of, say, 17 or 18, rather than 20 to 25 members which include quite a lot of weaker members. But I accept the fact that below a certain minimum number it would be difficult for us to run the type of market which we are running. 'But I honestly don't think we are running that risk. I think that, just as some people in the last few years have found it uneconomical or uninteresting to remain ring members, similarly, a number of people will find that, considering the size of the market and the volumes, and taking full advantage of their own strengths, they can make a very good go of ring membership. So I don't think the traffic will be one way only.' Mr John Wolff, the outgoing chairman, suggested recently that the time had come to debate brokers' commissions, which had been steadily eroded over the past 20 years. He pointed out that 'now we are trading ever further forward, it means that in some cases brokers are not actually paid commission for two years and three months after they have executed a contract'. Mr Bagri says you can't blame users for getting the best deal possible from brokers and the market. 'But they may have begun to recognise the law of diminishing returns has already set in and from a longer term point of view it is in the interests of the users of the market that they ensure they are paying adequately for the services they utilise because otherwise they will be net losers in the long run.' Nevertheless, he suggests 'the days of setting minimum commissions are long gone'. Then there is the urgent issue of the LME's base. Its lease on the present premises at Plantation House in the City of London runs out in 1994 and a decision has to be made by the middle of next year. Mr Bagri, without actually saying so, gives the impression he would prefer to stay put. He says: 'If I was the owner of Plantation House I would do everything possible and try desperately hard to try to keep us here'. Even so, the LME is looking at alternative sites. 'I do not believe in change for change's sake but we have an obligation to get value for money for our membership,' he adds. Mr Bagri is certain about one thing - the LME will not move in with another exchange or other exchanges in spite of invitations to do so. 'Our judgment so far is we are better off being independent. I have a feeling that people don't expect the LME to be within a big conglomerate of markets - that's what I hear from my international contacts and what I hear from the market place. We are better off maintaining our individual position, particularly in view of the very special nature of our activities and the way users of the market expect us to act.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President-elect Nelson Mandela at the Grand </F> Parade in Cape Town on 9 May; issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR  Wire Service]    [Text] Mr Master of Ceremonies, Your Excellencies, members  of the diplomatic corps, my fellow South Africans, today we are  entering a new era for our country and its people. Today we  celebrate not the victory of a party, but a victory for all the  people of South Africa.    Our country has arrived at a decision. Among all the parties  that contested the elections, the overwhelming majority of South  Africans have mandated the African National Congress to lead our  country into the future. The South Africa we have struggled  for, in which all our people, be they African, coloured, Indian  or white, regard themselves as citizens of one nation is at hand.    Perhaps it was history that ordained that it be here, at the  Cape of Good Hope that we should lay the foundation stone of our  new nation. For it was here at this Cape, over three centuries  ago, that there began the fateful convergence of the peoples of  Africa, Europe and Asia on these shores. It was to this  peninsula that the patriots, among them many princes and  scholars, of Indonesia were dragged in chains. It was on the  sandy plains of this peninsula that first battles of the epic  wars of resistance were fought.    When we look out across Table Bay, the horizon is dominated  by Ro?ben Island, whose infamy as a dungeon built to stifle the  spirit of freedom is as old as colonialism in South Africa. For  three centuries that island was seen as a place to which  outcasts can be banished. The names of those who were  incarcerated on Robben Island is a roll call of resistance  fighters and democrats spanning over three centuries. If indeed  this is a Cape of Good Hope, that hope owes much to the spirit  of that legion of fighters and others of their calibre.    We have fought for a democratic constitution since the  1880s.  Ours has been a quest for a constitution freely adopted by the  people of South Africa, reflecting their wishes and their  aspirations. The struggle for democracy has never been a matter  pursued by one race, class, religious community or gender among  South Africans. In honouring those who fought to see this day  arrive, we honour the best sons and daughters of all our people.  We can count amongst them Africans, coloureds, whites, Indians,  Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Jews -- all of them united by a  common vision of a better life for the people of this country.    It was that vision that inspired us in 1923 when we adopted  the first ever bill of rights in this country. That same vision  spurred us to put forward the African claims in 1946. It is  also the founding principle of the Freedom Charter we adopted as  policy in 1955, which in its very first lines, places before  South Africa an inclusive basis for citizenship.    In the 1980s the African National Congress was still  setting the pace, being the first major political formation in  South Africa to commit itself firmly to a bill of rights, which  we published in November 1990. These milestones give concrete  expression to what South Africa can become. They speak of a  constitutional, democratic, political order in which, regardless  of colour, gender, religion, political opinion or sexual  orientation, the law will provide for the equal protection of  all citizens.    They project a democracy in which the government, whomever  that government may be, will be bound by a higher set of rules,  embodied in a constitution, and will not be able govern the  country as it pleases.    Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is  especially true in a country such as ours where the vast  majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the  same time, democracy also requires that the rights of political  and other minorities be safeguarded.    In the political order we have established there will be  regular, open and free elections, at all levels of government -  central, provincial and municipal. There shall also be a social  order which respects completely the culture, language and  religious rights of all sections of our society and the  fundamental rights of the individual.    The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated  us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority  lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work  with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the  future. The cornerstone of building a better life of  opportunity, freedom and expression is the most dynamic program  of social upliftment in the history of this country. The  Reconstruction and Development Programme -- this needs unity of  purpose. It needs unity in action. It requires us all to work  together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and  build a nation united in our diversity.    The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections.  They want change! And change is what they will get. Our plan  is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to  guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the  widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our  people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to  support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a  central role we will try to change our country from a net  exporter of raw materials to one that exports finished products  through beneficiation.    The government will devise policies that encourage and  reward  productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities -  African, coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we  can assist them to make inroads into the productive and  manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale  distribution to which they are presently confined.    To raise our country and its people from the morass of  racism  and apartheid will require determination and effort. As a  government, the ANC will create a legal framework that will  assist, rather than impede, the awesome task of reconstruction  and development of our battered society.    While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit  of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate  and bring about the change that our mandate from the people  demands.    We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South  Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the  conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the  past with the intent of constructing a new order based on  justice for all.    This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today,  and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.</p>

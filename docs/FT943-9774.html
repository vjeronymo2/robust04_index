			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Great Southern falls to SCI - Raised offer wins approval but depends on Takeover Panel decision Service Corporation International yesterday won its hostile bid for Great Southern Group, the UK funeral company, after gaining the approval of the previously antagonistic Field family with its third cash offer for the company. Last Tuesday's offer of 680p a share was raised to 775p after Great Southern entered negotiations with Loewen Group, SCI's main US competitor. However, Loewen was only prepared to make a 690p cash offer. SCI's latest offer depends on the failure of an appeal by Vancouver-based Loewen, which has objected to the fact that SCI's previous final offer listed no conditions under which its bid could be raised. The bid from SCI demonstrates its determination to break into the fragmented UK funeral market. It plans a rapid expansion, spearheaded by Great Southern. The 775p offer values the company at Pounds 112.9m, and represents a 63 per cent premium over the 475p share price before SCI made its first offer. It is offering 309p per convertible share. The Field family, which has a three-hundred-year history in the funeral business, will raise Pounds 51m from the sale of its interests in Great Southern. Mr Barry Field, MP for the Isle of Wight, will get close to Pounds 8m for his personal shareholding in JD Field, the private company which owns a 56 per cent stake in Great Southern. The offer still depends on Wednesday's decision from the Takeover Panel on whether SCI can increase last Tuesday's final offer. It is a suitably controversial ending to what has been an extraordinary takeover battle. Hostile bids have been virtually unheard of in the funeral business, and the Field family were clearly shocked by the arrival of Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, SCI's larger-than-life presi-dent. Mr Heiligbrodt made every effort to force a dialogue with the Field family, but the clash of styles made this difficult. At one stage, Great Southern refused to discuss the offer unless the price did not begin with a 6, while their offer document was described by Mr Heiligbrodt as 'garbage'. There were numerous ironies. SCI had been invited to look at Great Southern by people closely connected with the Field family and the company, even though the company claimed a united front against the US aggressor. But as the prices rose, the Field family decided they would sell out; it was just a question of price. SCI always said it would pay a significant premium for a recommended offer, and Mr Heiligbrodt said yesterday that he was delighted that the Field family had backed his third cash price. By contrast, the Field family's original negotiating position had been an 800p offer, and the final bid is closer than had ever seemed likely. The only distressed party appears to be Loewen Group. But even assuming its appeal is unsuccessful, it will have the comfort that its main rival in the increasingly competitive market for US funeral acquisitions will be Pounds 13.8m the poorer for Loewen's involvement.</p>

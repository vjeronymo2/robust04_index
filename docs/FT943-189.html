			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Personal View: Ukraine's blueprint - President Leonid Kuchma outlines the case for further aid When Ukraine became an independent country in 1991, it was poorly prepared. The state lacked el-ementary na-tional institutions, and our terms of trade deteriorated sharply, as Russia raised its energy prices in 1992, leading to a severe structural balance of payments deficit. During the past couple of years, Ukraine has also been the victim of misconceived economic policies. As a result, it was hit by hyperinflation of 10,155 per cent in 1993, as well as a drastic fall in production, a sharp decline in the standard of living, and corruption. But to its credit, Ukraine enjoyed democratic presidential elections and a smooth transfer of power this summer. By 1994, the economy was in a terrible state, with two overwhelming problems facing the country. First, the budget deficit was projected at 20 per cent of gross domestic product for this year. Second, our trade deficit was running at Dollars 3bn a year. I have made the solution of these two challenges my political priority, because if they are not brought under control, the very survival of Ukraine could be endangered. To make my priorities clear to the international community, I invited Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, as my first official foreign guest after being elected president of Ukraine in July. Two months later, Ukraine concluded its first agreement with the IMF, on a Systemic Transformation Facility (STF), finally signed yesterday. We are initiating comprehensive economic reforms in Ukraine, drawing on the successful experiences of other countries in transition from administrative command economies to a market economy. We have been successful in maintaining our budgetary revenue at about 40 per cent of gross domestic product. But our first step will be to bring down the budget deficit for this year to 10 per cent of GDP. To accomplish this, we have decided to undertake some important reforms. We shall unify our exchange rate and abolish all import subsidies, although that will bring about substantial price increases of imported oil and natural gas. Similarly, to reduce large subsidies for coal, we shall allow the domestic price of coal to rise. Certain agricultural prices will also have to rise, and rents will be gradually increased to reduce housing subsidies, but compensation will be given to the disadvantaged and a social safety net will be developed. The National Bank of Ukraine is already pursuing a responsible monetary policy. It has brought inflation down to 2.5 per cent a month in both July and August of this year, though certain parliamentary decisions in August have led to a number of agricultural credits that have boosted inflation in September and depressed the free market exchange rate. The second step will be taken at the beginning of next year. It is my intention that Ukraine shall conclude a fully-fledged 'stand-by' agreement with the IMF this year. I then want my government to implement a macro-economic stabilisation programme. The budget deficit must not be larger than can be financed - at about 5 per cent of GDP. Prices will be further liberalised and domestic trade completely so. All remaining export restrictions can then be abolished. In parallel, I intend to activate small-scale privatisation and initiate a mass privatisation before the end of this year. Our present tax system is a shambles, with far too many loopholes and tax rebates. I have instructed my administration to put the system into order before December. Draft legislation has already been drawn up, cutting tax rebates to reasonable levels by international standards. The short-term symbol of success will be the stabilisation of the national currency, the hryvnia, in terms of both domestic prices and the exchange rate. Therefore, I want to peg the exchange rate of our currency from the beginning of 1995 and exchange our provisional coupon currency for our national currency. Its stability will symbolise Ukraine's maturing statehood. The people of Ukraine have decided to put the economy right and we are prepared to bear the costs of adjustment. However, our economic situation is difficult, and our imports have already been reduced to a bare minimum. Further reductions would cause more suffering than I can justify to my people. I am appealing to the international community to provide Ukraine with serious financial support now that Ukraine has become serious about reforming its economy. We are already working closely with the IMF, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, but we shall need bilateral financing from the Group of Seven and other western countries, as well as Russia, which is de facto our main creditor. The G7 promised Ukraine financial support of Dollars 4bn at its Naples summit in July. This should now be forthcoming. Ukraine's need for international financing is quite obvious. Even after severe cuts in our imports, the current account is likely to amount to Dollars 3bn next year. Essentially, the whole deficit is being caused by imports of oil and natural gas from Russia. Therefore, international financing needs to be made available for our energy payments to Russia. Our international reserves are run down and they need to be replenished by at least Dollars 1bn. In order to introduce the hryvnia, Ukraine will need a stabilisation fund of Dollars 1.5bn, so that a stable exchange rate can be defended. Altogether our financial needs for 1995 amount to Dollars 5.5bn, and the IMF has assessed our balance of payments need for the rest of this year at almost Dollars 1bn. A first tranche of the STF will provide us with Dollars 360m, but that will not be enough. We have proposed to the US that Dollars 200m of unused technical assistance grants be transformed into balance of payments grants. For the rest, we hope for matching funds from other countries. One of Ukraine's many advantages is that its foreign debt is actually limited, at about Dollars 7bn, including the arrears on energy deliveries from Russia and Turkmenistan, while we estimate that our total export of goods and services will amount to Dollars 15bn this year. A large part of our current debt consists of arrears that need to be regulated and rescheduled so that we can repay them. As our economy becomes more open, we also hope to attract substantial foreign investment. With an excellent geographical location and a highly educated labour force, Ukraine is well placed to achieve high economic growth in the future. But our chances of success will be greater if we receive appropriate international financial support to facilitate our transition until private investments start flowing in.

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SINK TO RETIRE AS BIRMINGHAM BASEBALL COACH  </P> <P> Wayne Sink, the Birmingham High baseball coach since 1978, is retiring from  coaching at the end of the season. But he might have saved the best for last.  </P> <P> Sink, 54, whose varsity teams have never won a league title, will be coaching  the favorite in the Mid-Valley League. Yet even with one of his more talented  teams coming back, Sink says it was time to hand over the reins.  </P> <P> "I just decided it was time to get out of coaching," he said. "There's not  enough satisfaction to warrant staying around.  </P> <P> "Satisfaction comes from winning . . . There are other things I'd rather do."  </P> <P> Sink, who works in the school's audio-visual department and also teaches  physical education, will remain at Birmingham as a teacher.  </P> <P> A graduate of Glendale High and Occidental College, Sink served four years as  an assistant football and baseball coach at Occidental before becoming a coach  at Birmingham in 1963. Sink also has coached the Valley Encino-Tarzana American  Legion baseball team since 1978.  </P> <P> Sink said he will recommend that David Contreras, the Birmingham junior varsity  baseball coach and an assistant with the Legion team, be hired as his  replacement.  </P> <P> The Braves, who finished 8-12 last season and third in the Mid-Valley at 6-10,  may be as deep as any team in Sink's career; only two players from the 1989  team were lost to graduation. Pitchers Josh Brown and Jason Mansfield return,  as do outfielder Danny Larson and infielder Justin Bass.  </P> <P> "In terms of experience, we're as good as any I can remember," Sink said.  </P></p>

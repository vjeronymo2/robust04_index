			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / London's voluntary groups see funds fall COUNCIL financial support for London's voluntary sector has declined at a time of growing need, research conducted for the capital's statutory grant-making body has concluded, Alan Pike writes. A survey of 27 of the 33 London borough councils showed funding for voluntary groups fell from Pounds 141m in 1990-91 to Pounds 127m in 1991-92. Only seven boroughs maintained their financial support in real terms. In inner London - where many of the capital's social problems are concentrated  -reductions in spending were more than twice as great as in outer boroughs. The research was conducted by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry on behalf of the London Boroughs Grants Committee, which makes grants to voluntary organisations operating in more than one borough. Mr Serge Lourie, a Liberal Democrat councillor who chairs the committee, said the research showed a 'critical' situation in which funding could not keep up with needs. He said: 'Our concern is that the disintegration of our social fabric threatens London's future prosperity.' The research is the latest in a series of studies showing that, in spite of government pressure for voluntary organisations to take on additional duties, the sector's financial difficulties are worsening.</p>

Lebanon, he added, has proved its  ability to overcome its crisis and is able to extend the state's  authority to every inch of its territory.    President al-Hirawi added that Lebanon, which seeks UN help  to safeguard its inalienable rights, rejects violence as a way  of resolving crises just as it rejects infringement of its  national dignity and legitimate rights. He added: Resolution  425 did not give us a right we were not entitled to. Rather, it  reaffirmed our sacred right to have our sovereignty respected.    The president added: Let Israel withdraw from our land and  the state will take it upon itself to maintain stability there.  He stressed the need for alertness and solidarity with our  brothers and cooperation with our friends to secure the  implementation of the international resolutions, chiefly  Resolution 425.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, head of the Palestinian  delegation to the peace negotiations, left Amman today after a  three-day working visit to Jordan. During the visit, Dr.  'Abd-al-Shafi met with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali and a number of Palestinian figures in Jordan.    In a statement before his departure for Tunis, Dr.  'Abd-al-Shafi said that he will meet with Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat to discuss the memorandum that was presented to  him by Palestinian figures two weeks ago. This memorandum calls  for expanding the base of decisionmaking within the PLO.    He stressed the importance of reactivating  Jordanian-Palestinian coordination within the framework of Arab  coordination. This is especially so since the peace  negotiations are facing a crisis that requires pooling Arab  efforts to overcome it in a way that guarantees Arab rights and  interests.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi is accompanied by a delegation that  includes a number of Palestinian figures who signed the  memorandum.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General Ze'ev Livne, commander of the Home  Front Command, said that Syria is continuing to procure  launchers and Scud missiles from North Korea. He said that for  the Home Front Command it does not matter where the missiles are  launched, whether from Iran, Syria, or Iraq. However, if they  are launched in Iran it poses much more complex operational  problems.    The commander made the remarks to our Army affairs  correspondent Karmela Menashe. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  today fired a 155 mm gun into a concrete wall as part of a  series of tests aimed at developing defenses for settlements  along the confrontation lines to enable them to withstand a  direct hit by a shell.</p>

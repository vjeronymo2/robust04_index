			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rene Degni-Segui, special rapporteur of the </F> UN Human Rights Commission for Rwanda, by correspondent  Jean-Karim Fall in Abidjan on 31 May; from the "Afrique Midi"  program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fall] You are the UN special  rapporteur for Rwanda. What does it really mean? What will you  do?    [Degni-Segui] I have been appointed to investigate.  According to my mandate I must see if these acts really took  place and who the perpetrators of these acts are, I must  establish the link between these acts and those who are  suspected of being the perpetrators. This is my mandate. I will  not be alone in this. I assume that the whole UN structure and  all UN personnel there will help me.    [Fall] What will your agenda be? Will you travel to Rwanda  soon?    [Degni-Segui] Yes. I believe that this is urgent because I  was given four weeks to draw up a first report. I received a  call from Geneva and I must leave for this long journey, for a  meeting of university deans and continue therafter to Rwanda,  but with stopovers in Geneva and Brussels.    [Fall] Degni-Segui, you are the dean of Abidjan Law Faculty.  The possibility of an international tribunal for Bosnia was  mentionned. It is now being mentionned in the case of Rwanda.  Can you define this notion of international tribunal?    [Degni-Segui] Let's say that it is a matter of setting up an  ad hoc structure with the task of trying those suspected of  being responsible for the crimes. [passage omitted]    [Fall] Last year you took part in -- you chaired -- an  international commission in Rwanda. What were your conclusions  at the time?    [Degni-Segui] I must say that I did not chair the  international commission of enquiry. Our conclusions covered  three points: genocide, war crimes, and the impotence of the  judiciary thus guaranteeing complete impunity to the  perpetrators of these massacres. [passage omitted]</p>

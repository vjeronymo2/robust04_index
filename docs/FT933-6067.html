			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor (2): No illusions over Bundesbank Sir In your leader of August 27 you point belatedly to the fact that the financial world is overwhelmed by English-speaking analysts and commentators. Nevertheless, your standpoint remains unchanged as you try to interpret the policies of the German central bank. You continue to underestimate two considerations that influence the Bundesbank's decisions over and above its current statutory duties: first, that if there is to be a single European currency it will have to be indistinguishable from the D-Mark; and second, that the central bank responsible for a European currency will have to demonstrate - and be able to defend - its independence, not only from politicians but above all from the market. It is obvious that the attitude in Frankfurt is that, if possible, no significant reduction in base rates should occur under market pressures and that, for as long as thunder continues to roll in New York and London, such corrections will be resisted. Too much is at stake. It should be equally obvious that a majority of continental politicians are under no illusions. There is a deep-seated, if unstructured, demand for a higher degree of unity; it may be naive but it is a political reality that the UK has never fully appreciated. Matters would be quite different if the cohorts of English-speaking analysts could point to decades of successful economic management where their advice was taken seriously. Regrettably that is not the case. Those with whom we have felt most comfortable in the marketplace will always have the strength to safeguard their dollar. Sterling, our once proud unit, will be left to its fate, and we to ask ourselves how that came about. No reasons are to be found in any of the memoirs of our politicians.

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JETS' OWNER SAYS HE'S NOT SELLING TEAM  </P> <P> The president of the Winnipeg Jets said he has no plans to sell the NHL team to  an investors' group from Anaheim, in the wake of Canadian news reports Tuesday  that a purchase offer was made.  </P> <P> "We have not accepted any offers," Jets President Barry Shenkarow said in a  telephone interview.  </P> <P> "We're not moving and we're not selling the team. Let's drop it."  </P> <P> Shenkarow conceded that he has been approached by people who "said they want to  buy the team." Among the offers was one from Anaheim, said Shenkarow, who  declined to identify the individuals involved.  </P> <P> "They saw who is the smallest franchise, in the smallest market," said  Shenkarow, who is negotiating with Winnipeg for a new arena in addition to  revenue from concessions and luxury suites.  </P> <P> He also declined to say how much has been offered for the team.  </P> <P> "If an expansion franchise is worth $50 million, you can figure it out,"  Shenkarow said.  </P> <P> Shenkarow wants an arena to replace the existing 15,405-seat Winnipeg Arena and  to boost revenue. He said the chances of getting a new facility in Winnipeg are  "50-50." If a new arena is not built, Shenkarow said, he would entertain other  offers.  </P> <P> Shenkarow said he is unfamiliar with Anaheim's proposed arena, which has been  challenged in court by the Rams, among others.  </P> <P> Marie Monet, president of Ogden Financial Services, the firm selected to build  and operate Anaheim's proposed 20,000-seat arena, said there is a group  prepared to buy a basketball or hockey franchise for the new facility.  </P> <P> But Monet and city officials have declined to identify the would-be owners  other than to say "it's not the city, not Ogden."  </P></p>

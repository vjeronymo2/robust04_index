			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Celson Franco: "Military Most Active Lobbyists </F> in Revision Process"]    [Text] Brasilia--The Armed Forces have put together the  best organized and most active lobby for the constitutional  revision process. Officers have traded their uniforms for  business suits and are scouring the corridors and offices of  Congress in small groups in an attempt to convince all  congressmen, regardless of ideological coloring, of the  correctness of their proposals. Their chief proposal, embodied  in a constitutional amendment submitted by Deputy Adylson Motta  (PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], Rio Grande do Sul), removes  them from the category of public servants and promotes them to  that of "servants of the state." The immediate objective of that  proposal is to solve the problem of pay.    "One purpose, obviously, is to give the military a merited  raise," says Motta. "The Constitution was written in a  revanchist era, and the military were punished as a result."    Actually, the military wanted to be recognized as "servants  of the fatherland." In the explanatory statement accompanying  his amendment, Motta listed characteristics supposedly  distinguishing the military from other public employees: "strong  professional ethics imposing irreproachable moral conduct" and  "unconditional compliance with the obligation to do one's duty  and sacrifice one's own life in defense of the fatherland." But  the expression "servants of the fatherland" was changed to  "servants of the state." Some congressmen, especially in the PT  [Workers Party], considered "fatherland" to be an exaggeration  and demanded its withdrawal as a condition for negotiating the  amendment.    Equality before the law--The basic proposal is found in  Subparagraph 12: "Compensation for the military on the active  roster, in the reserve, or in retirement is regulated by a  separate law." Motta's amendment is supplemented by another  bill, this one submitted by Deputy Prisco Viana (PPR, Bahia) and  stipulating, in Paragraph X, that "the general revision of pay  for civilian and military public servants will take place on the  same day, except in the case of legal pay adjustments initiated  by the president of the republic and intended to implement the  equality before the law that is dealt with in Article 39 of the  Constitution."    The target of military lobbyists is the Emergency Social  Fund, which is vital to the administration's economic plan.  Article 74 of the amendment establishing that fund prohibits the  granting of differentiated pay increases to the military, and  according to the military, that makes it impossible to achieve  the pay equality before the law that the Constitution calls for.  "Establishing the same standards for civilians and military is  illogical," says Deputy Francisco Rodrigues (PTB [Brazilian  Labor Party], Rondonia). He reports that over the past few days,  congressional advisers to the military ministries have been  stepping up their contacts with deputies and senators in an  attempt to persuade them to eliminate Article 74 from the fund  bill.    Military lobbyists are not confining themselves to the pay  issue. For example, they do not approve of the establishment of  a Ministry of Defense. And they do not want to lose their status  as guarantors of law and order, which Deputy Jose Genoino (PT,  Sao Paulo), wants to take away. Supporters of a redefinition of  the constitutional role of the Armed Forces argue that calling  them guardians of order is what gave the military the pretext  for the coups recorded in our history.    Fearing internationalization of the Amazon Region, the  military are also preparing amendments affecting the Indian  reservations. They recognize the Indians' rights over the areas  they occupy, but make an exception in the case of border lands.  "The native peoples have no notion of what a geographic border  dictated by nationality or state boundaries is," claims Senator  Irapuan Costa, Jr. (PP [Progressive Party], Goias).    IPVA--The military even want to amend the article allowing  the authorities to protect assets with historical or cultural  value and thus "eliminate the power of one authority over the  property of another." In this case, the object is to protect  military property, which is the target of what they call an  "abuse of authority," especially on the part of mayors. Another  amendment is concerned with collection of the IPVA [tax on  ownership of automotive vehicles]. Some municipalities, basing  their action on Article 155 of the Constitution, have decided to  apply the IPVA to aircraft, ships, and tanks.  <H5>  No More Right To Intervene </H5>   The military do not want to lose the role of guardians of  law  and order that is assigned to them by Article 142 of the  Constitution--that being perhaps the article most targeted by  left-wing congressmen, especially those in the PT. Deputy Jose  Genoino (PT, Sao Paulo), for example, says that the Armed Forces  ought to restrict themselves to national defense and the  guaranteeing of constitutional powers. Fear exists in the Left  that in keeping with the tradition of coups that extends from  the proclamation of the republic until 1964, the military will  again invoke their role as defenders of law and order to  legitimize their interventions.    Genoino, who was a guerrilla fighter for the PCdoB  [Communist  Party of Brazil] in the 1970's and now debates with his former  enemies in Congress, knows how important the amendment placing  the military in the special category of "servants of the state"  is to the Armed Forces. And he wants to trade his support on  that point for withdrawal of the provision giving the military  responsibility for guaranteeing law and order. "They are going  to have to negotiate," Genoino says.    Maybe so, but not now. According the military lobby's plan,  the first step was to prepare the amendments in which it was  interested. The next step was to select congressmen to sponsor  the proposals. The military are currently in the persuasion  phase: they are discussing their proposals with representatives  of all the parties. There are over 30 amendments affecting the  military, but not all of them have military support. Examples  are the amendment abolishing compulsory military service and the  one establishing the Ministry of Defense.</p>

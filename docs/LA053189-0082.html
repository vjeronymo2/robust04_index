			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN DISCOUNT RATE UP; U.S. DOLLAS KEEPS RISING;  </P> <P> AMERICA FACES HEAT FROM MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS AT HIGH-LEVEL CONFERENCE  </P> <P> The Bush Administration appears to be heading into a barrage of criticism from  its major economic allies over its decision to threaten Japan and other  countries with possible retaliation if they do not eliminate trade barriers  that the United States calls "unfair."  </P> <P> The assault is expected to come this week at the annual ministerial-level  meeting of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development, a forum of industrialized countries. The 24-country session begins  today.  </P> <P> The prospect of a strong backlash over the new U.S. trade actions came as  Japan's trade minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, met informally Tuesday with U.S.  Trade Representative Carla A. Hills to repeat his earlier assertion that Japan  "has no intention of negotiating" with the United States "in the context of"  the retaliation that Washington has threatened under the 1988 Omnibus Trade  Act.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meetings Scheduled  </P> <P> Later this week, Cabinet-level officials from Japan and Western Europe are  expected to push through strong language chiding the United States in the  formal communique that the ministers will issue at the end of their annual  spring meeting. The document has no force of law, but the criticism would  amount to a diplomatic rebuke of the United States' new, more aggressive trade  stance.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Hills and several other  high-level U.S. officials are scheduled to meet with their Japanese  counterparts here today to discuss a separate U.S. proposal to engage Japan in  wide-ranging talks aimed at dealing with structural impediments to freer trade  in both countries. Today's meeting will be the first time that the two sides  have gotten together since the United States announced its trade actions last  week.  </P> <P> The United States hopes that the broad talks it has proposed -- suggested by  Brady -- would deal with such issues as the closed nature of Japan's  product-distribution system, the inability of Americans to save what they need  to invest in new plants and equipment and ways to coordinate broad economic  policies. These are factors that many economists believe lie at the heart of  the trade imbalance between the two countries.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear whether Japan will agree to hold such talks, at  least until its government gets over its annoyance at being accused publicly of  employing "unfair" trading practices. Besides Japan, the United States last  week also cited Brazil and India for maintaining allegedly unfair trade  barriers.  </P> <P> The United States also is expected to run into conflicts with West Germany and  Japan over Washington's push to persuade those countries to take new measures  to help speed up the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit. The Bush  Administration wants them to spur more domestic demand -- which it hopes would  lead to increased buying of U.S. exports.  </P> <P> But both countries, along with Britain, contend that they cannot act right now  because inflationary pressures are mounting at home and would be heightened  further if authorities took new steps to increase domestic demand. U.S.  officials concede that there is little support among other OECD members for the  U.S. position.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Hills began what is expected to be a concerted U.S. effort to  deflect criticism of the Administration's new trade moves, saying at a news  conference attended mainly by European reporters that Washington has said only  that it wants to negotiate with Japan, India and Brazil and has not yet  retaliated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strict Rules Blamed  </P> <P> "I am an undying optimist by nature, and I believe that we will have some  fruitful discussions," she said at one point.  </P> <P> The U.S. trade complaints against Japan, announced by the Administration last  Thursday, cited Tokyo on three counts: stringent government procurement  regulations that prohibit the purchase of U.S.-made supercomputers; similar  restrictions on buying American-produced satellites, and excessively strict  lumber standards that effectively bar the import of American forest products.  </P> <P> Washington has also cited Japan for refusing to open its telecommunications  channels to foreign producers of cellular telephones and mobile radios. The  United States has also launched proceedings against Brazil, for restricting  import and export licenses to keep foreign goods out, and against India, for  restricting foreign investment and sales of insurance policies by foreign  underwriters.  </P> <P> Several U.S. trading partners, including Japan and the European Community,  contend that the U.S. action is illegal under international trade rules and  have threatened to challenge such U.S. "unilateralism" under the Geneva-based  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 96-country compact that administers  global trading laws.  </P> <P> Under international rules, countries having trade disputes with other  governments are expected to take their complaints to GATT. The U.S. law was  passed by Congress last year as part of an effort to require the Administration  to "get tough" on accused trade violators.  </P> <P> For all the apparent backlash over last week's U.S. action, the cases the  Administration used in citing Japan actually were relatively mild ones that  U.S. authorities thought could be resolved easily. Bush's own national security  advisers were against hitting Japan too hard for fear of weakening the  U.S.-Japanese political alliance.  </P> <P> Along with the other issues, this week's ministerial-level meeting of OECD  countries is expected to provide added political impetus to the Third World  debt-reduction plan that Brady proposed earlier this year and the Uruguay Round  of global trade-liberalization talks now under way in Geneva.  </P> <P> The ministers also are expected to issue a statement bolstering earlier calls  by their governments for concerted action to deal with urgent environmental  matters -- from global warming to problems with holes in the earth's ozone  layer.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, March 5 (TANJUG) -- Slovenian Defence  Minister Janez Jansa accuses President Milan Kucan of running  illegal para-intelligence services and spy groups, the  LJUBLJANSKI DNEVNIK daily wrote on Saturday.    The accusation comes at a time when the activity of these  services in this breakaway Yugoslav republic, which has recently  been made public by Kucan, is being traced back to Jansa's  ministry.    Commenting on Kucan's statement that para-intelligence  services and spies are keeping under surveillance leading  Slovenian state officials, prominent citizens and individual  reporters and are prepared to liquidate them if necessary, Jansa  told LJUBLJANSKI DNEVNIK that the president "probably has in  mind the various detective agencies ruled" by members of the  State Security Service from the Communist times, "most of whom  he knows personally." The agents were officially subordinated  to Kucan while he was Slovenia's communist leader, "and are  today probably unofficially" subordinated to him, averred Jansa.    The defence minister for the first time mentioned that he  has  received "numerous threats of physical liquidation," but did not  elaborate.    "Liquidation threats should be taken seriously, especially  after the murder of Ivan Kramberger," killed in the finale of  the 1992 presidential campaign, said Jansa.    The quarrel between Kucan and Jansa, who have traded  accusations also in a scandal involving arms smuggling for the  interests of Bosnian Moslems, has been joined by the leadership  of the United List, the second most influential parliamentary  party, which has announced its intention to demand the  resignation or recall of Jansa in the ruling coalition next  week, on the grounds that "he is unfit for this position of  authority."</p>

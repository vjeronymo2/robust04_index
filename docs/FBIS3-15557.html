That was reported to Interfax by the  Ukrainian border troops press-service on Monday.    At a news-conference on the border between the two  countries,  journalists have been told that Kiev disagrees with the verdict  and will instruct its Embassy in Poland to appeal the court's  decision. Border officers described the case with Lysenko as a  crude provocation. Major Lysenko was detained in Poland at the  end of August last year. In his words, his trip was private.</p>

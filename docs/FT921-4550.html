			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Le Pen comes under fire MR Pierre Beregovoy, French finance minister, said yesterday that Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the ultra-right leader, posed a threat to democracy and likened his rise to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, Reuter reports from Paris. 'We must realise that Le Pen's ideas threaten to be fatal for democracy. All democrats . . . must clearly say 'Never, never will we ally ourselves with Le Pen',' Mr Beregovoy told French television. 'I am among those who as an adolescent lived through the events of 1939 to 1945. 'I knew how Hitler and Mussolini took power, by flirting with the most perverse elements of human consciousness,' he said. The Socialists, expected to take a battering in regional elections on March 22, have made the fight against Mr Le Pen's National Front one of the central themes of their campaign. On Friday, left-wing demonstrators hurled petrol bombs at National Front's Rouen headquarters.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Gonzalez labour market threat MR Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said yesterday he intends to press ahead with tough reform of the country's rigid labour market with or without agreement between employers, the unions and the government in talks that started earlier this week. Addressing concern in financial markets that failure so far to agree on a much vaunted three-year 'social pact' - designed to help drag Spain out of recession - Mr Gonzalez said the pact was not an end in itself. If by the end of next month no agreement was reached on a three-year wage moderation deal, and the labour reforms the government wants, it would impose the reforms. 'I hope there will be agreement,' Mr Gonzalez said in his first newspaper interview since being elected to a fourth term in office last June. He said the pact was an instrument to create the conditions in which more jobs could be created, to provide competitiveness. 'We obviously cannot force pay levels on employers and workers (but) if there is not a pact, the government will apply the necessary measures within its competence.' The first phase of the tripartite social pact talks ended badly last week. The three sides had been discussing pension increases, jobless benefits, civil service pay and reactivating the economy when the government, forced to present a budget to parliament by September 30, ran out of time and included its own conservative targets in the budget. These were now the sovereign business of parliament, Mr Gonzalez said, implying that it was no longer possible to discuss them with the unions. This week the second and final phase of the talks began - on a global three-year agreement to hold wage rises below inflation, on labour market reform, including traditional forms of collective bargaining, and on introducing more flexible lay-off procedures. Mr Gonzalez said he recognised that the pact talks were 'very difficult' for the unions. 'We are talking about a pact with special characteristics,' he said, in which the unions were being asked to make sacrifices. He said the government was trying to improve the employment situation through gains in competitiveness. 'We are not saying, 'I will give you this and you will give that'. The big problem is that the government has nothing to give in exchange.' The unions have issued threats of action against the government's hard line in the talks, but are thought to be in too weak a position to hurt the government. Mr Gonzalez indicated he did not expect to have too much trouble getting the budget passed, even though his socialists are now in a minority in parliament.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Magnolia shares tumble 18p MAGNOLIA Group, a maker of picture frame mouldings, saw its shares fall 18p to 56p yesterday after reporting first half pre-tax profits down from Pounds 273,000 to Pounds 52,000 and passing its interim dividend. Mr Kurt Scharf, chairman, that after an encouraging first three months there was a severe downturn in the following quarter. He added: 'We believe that market conditions will not improve in the short term and we will therefore continue to reduce costs to ensure medium term profitability at lower levels of sales.' Turnover for the six months to June 30 fell 14 per cent to Pounds 9.47m (Pounds 11m). Earnings per share were 0.61p (3.05p). There was an interim dividend last time of 1.75p.</p>

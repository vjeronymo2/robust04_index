			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Mexican elections  scheduled for 21 August 1994.    On 8 March, Oscar Espinoza Villareal, finance secretary for  the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, denied reports that  his party had a special fund for the business sector to make  donations to Luis Donaldo Colosio's presidential campaign.  During a meeting of the PRI National Territorial Movement,  Espinoza said "his party does not depend solely on the business  sector for funds, and it would not use the sector as a means of  finding other sources." He called on party leaders "to be wise  in spending campaign money so as to prevent misunderstandings."  (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 9 Mar 94 p 11A)    On 10 March, PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio met with  trade and service leaders in Mexico City and offered to  deregulate certain areas of the government bureaucracy which  affects them. He said he would set "clear rules to eliminate  subjective decisions and extensively simplify the tax process."  He asked the leaders to present proposals during the campaign.  Through dialogue, he said, "I want to find the best ways for the  country to move into the 21st Century as a more sovereign and  just nation." In addressing unemployment and the contribution of  small and medium enterprise, he affirmed that "more guarantees  should be offered for those who take the risk to invest."  (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 5)    On 10 March, PRI Candidate Colosio met with hundreds of  radio  and television industry businessmen, executives, and workers. He  told them that "Mexico is a more informed, demanding, and  critical nation." Therefore, he added, "information is  fundamental for transforming Mexico." He said: "PRI and its  presidential candidate are not afraid of political competition,  but we do fear political incompetence." Pointing out that PRI  was the first to call a debate, he said: "We want Mexican men  and women to have access to better information to make their  decisions." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1430  GMT 11 Mar 94)    PRI Candidate Luis Colosio attended several events on 10  March, including breakfast with the Rotary Club, lunch with  party leaders, and dinner with members of the Mexican-Lebanese  community. The message was the same at all three: Mexico has  set its course, and that course will lead to social well-being.  "I believe we must look toward our grass-roots communities," he  said, "because nothing grows from the sky down. Everything  grows from the ground up." (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in  Spanish 0000 GMT 12 Mar 94)    Luis Colosio visited Nuevo Leon University on 14 March.  There he said that "Mexico requires a gradual democratic  transformation. Pluralism is what makes us stronger." He  stressed that in such a system "all Mexicans will have the  wonderful opportunity to decide and to elect." (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 1430 GMT 15 mar)    On 9 March upon arrival in Monterrey for a meeting with  university students, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate  for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, said his party  is totally independent from the government system. He expressed  regret that there were no other independent candidates or  parties, except for Pablo Emilio Madero, who is running for the  National Opposition Union. He said Diego Fernandez de Cevallos  of the National Action Party, PAN, and Rafael Aguilar Talamantes  of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, PFCRN,  are playing the government's game.    The meeting between Cardenas and the students took place at  the Monterrey Technological Institute and was broadcast by  satellite to several other universities throughout the country.  He said: "Social spending should be planned responsibly,  effectively, and efficiently, and without political conditions.  This is the area that has seen the least progress in the past  few years." He added that "inefficiency, corruption, waste, and  selectiveness has been the general tone" in this area. (Mexico  City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 10 Mar 94)    PRD Candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas addressed proposals  presented by the business sector on 9 March. "I do not know all  the details," he stated, "but I am pleased that they agree with  what I, as the candidate of the country's democratic forces,  have been proposing to save our economy. I hope the business  sector is, as they say, determined to offer their help in saving  the country." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish  1430 GMT 11 mar 94)    PAN presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos and  presidential candidate Jorge Gonzalez Torres, for the Mexican  Green Ecologist Party, PEM, visited the National Autonomous  University on 11 March. Fernandez de Cevallos spoke to  chemistry students and said the nation's universities should  serve as forums for political debate between presidential  candidates. He said there should be better ties between the  business sector and the universities to enhance specific areas  of study.    Meanwhile, PEM candidate Gonzalez Torres met with political  science students and warned that Chiapas is an example of what  can happen when there is no authentic democratic expression.  (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 11 Mar 94)    Jorge Gonzalez Torres was formally registered on 14 March as  the presidential candidate for the PEM. After the ceremony, he  suggested holding a runoff election for the August contest.  Gonzalez said: "It would be very good for Mexico." "If none of  the candidates get 40 percent of the vote," he explained, "a run  off election should be held. If the abstention rate reaches 30  or 40 percent, the number of votes that the winner receives  would still be small, but never less than 20 percent." (Mexico  City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 15 Mar 94)    On 10 March, Pablo Emilio Madero registered as the Mexican  Democratic Party's presidential candidate for the August  election. Following his presentation at the Federal Electoral  Institute, Madero said: "We should think about electoral code  reforms for the future. We can meditate, discuss, and implement  them later, but it will not be possible for this election." He  also spoke in favor of appointing electoral prosecutors to  prosecute electoral crimes.

Belarus Has the Ruble Once Again"]    [Text] The lengthy hesitation about whether there should  be a ruble zone were crowned on Christmas eve by the signing of  a treaty merging the monetary systems of Russia and the Belarus  Republic.    Andrey Illarionov, deputy chief of the Economic Reforms  Working Center, thinks that in its content, the agreement brings  us back to a situation where the noncash monetary systems of the  former Soviet republics were still undivided.    But the situation is essentially fundamentally new. Russia  has presented Belarus with a really royal Christmas gift. The  thing is that the National Bank of Belarus keeps its  independence, and two emission centers are being created -- that  of the Russian Federation Central Bank and that of the Republic  of Belarus National Bank. Curiously, the agreement envisions no  effective mechanism to keep tabs on emissions, primarily noncash  emissions.    One is also amazed, to put it mildly, at Article 6 of the  agreement. Under it, the National Bank of Belarus and our  Central Bank undertake to create a joint fund of gold [hard]  currency, and other highly liquid assets in an agreed amount.  Remarkably, the fund is to be formed in proportion to the share  of the sides in the aggregate credit emission. Belarus has  practically no such assets, with the result that the fund will  be set up by Russia, with Russia having to transfer to Belarus  part of its gold and hard currency reserves.    Being too big does not end there. It is proposed to merge  the republics' [as published] on the basis of one "hare"  [Belarus ruble has a hare depicted on it] per one ruble. Given  the real market rate of 4.5 or 5 "hares" per one Russian ruble,  this means that Russia would give Belarus virtually an  interest-free loan of approximately 1.6 trillion rubles.    According to the most conservative estimate, Russia will  simultaneously pay for it with a 10-percent rise in inflation in  one fell swoop.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Food: An Italian takeover in Japan - Appetisers FOR THE winemaker, busy restaurants selling their wine by the glass or bottle are the most effective and obvious way of making new customers. Many wine makers spend a great deal of time drinking their own wine in restaurants around the world as a way of promoting sales. No-one does it more assiduously than Angelo Gaja, the top winemaker in Barbaresco, Italy, who has seen exports of his wines to Japan soar as the Japanese have fallen in love with Italian food. In 1988 there were 72 Italian restaurants in Japan; today there are more than 1,000 and by the end of 1994 it is estimated there could be as many as 2,400. The quality of these restaurants is very high, too. Gaja confessed recently that the best Italian meal he has had in the last six months was in Tokyo at the Ristorante Manin (tel:0120-11-3778) when his menu included risotto with squid ink, pasta with Japanese mushrooms and stewed ox tail. Last month the Enoteca Pinchiorri opened in Tokyo (tel: 03-3289-8081) borrowing its name and style of cooking from the now world famous Enoteca Pinchiorri in Florence with Giorgio Pinchiorri, the owner of the Florentine restaurant, acting as consultant. At its opening dinner to 480 Japanese businessmen, diplomats and journalists it served a typical Italian menu which included Tuscan squid salad, sea bass with thyme and olive oil, lobster ravioli and a range of top Italian wines to match.                            *      *      * For originality of concept and design Belgo, a new restaurant specialising in Belgian food and beers, is hard to beat. In an ultra-modern, basement conversion the food is good and more varied than just moules and frites (my waterzooi, a Belgian fish and vegetable stew was excellent), the selection of more than 20 Belgian beers exciting, and the waiters' uniforms, purple monks habits with black aprons, unforgettable. It is open all week from 12 noon to 11pm, 72 Chalk Farm Road NW1. Tel: 071-267-0718. Bookings taken on the day only. Approx Pounds 20 per head.                            *      *      * News of two new London restaurant openings and three going out off their way to attract new business. Stephen Bull has opened his second restaurant, a bistro and bar, at 71 St John Street, EC1 (071-490-1750) and Antony Worall-Thompson has moved on to dell'Ugo, a multi-layered Italian bar, cafe and restaurant at 56 Frith Street, W1 (071-734-8330) with a particularly interesting menu. The Inn on the Park, W1, (071-499-0888) has responded to the recession by sharply reducing margins on its wine list and Al San Vincenzo, at 30 Connaught Street, W1, (071-262-9623) is replacing its set-price-only menus with a no-minimum-charge policy to attract more diners more frequently. Martin's, at 239 Baker Street, NW1, (071-935-3130) has been refitted as a bar and bistro serving three courses at around Dollars 20 per head.                            *      *      * The 1992 Andre Simon Memorial Award for the best food book of the year went to Arabella Boxer and Tessa Traeger for A Visual Feast (Century, Pounds 20). Oz Clarke took best wine book of the year award for New Classic Wines (Websters/Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 19.99). A special commendation went to John and Sally McKenna for their Irish Food Guide (Estragon Press, Pounds 9.95). The McKennas have just produced three new more detailed guides to Ireland for 1992 - 100 Best restaurants, 100 Best Places to eat in Dublin and 100 Best places to stay in Ireland (Pounds 4.99 each).                            *      *      * Prisoners Abroad is a charity which cares for the 600 British people imprisoned overseas. One of its supporters is also a collector of fine wines who has donated a wonderful range of bottles for a special wine dinner to be held on June 29 at Shampers, Kingly Street, London W1. The wines include mature vintage champagne and white burgundy, magnums of Chateau Leoville Las Cases 1981, and bottles of Montrose 1971, Lafite 1966, Domaine de la Romanee Conti Richebourg 1982 and Dow 1963. There are 16 places available at the dinner and interested bidders should phone Mark Astarita at Prisoners Abroad (071-833-3467) who is hoping for offers of a minimum Pounds 100 per place.</p>

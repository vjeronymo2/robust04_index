			<p>BFN     [Text] The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] has  expressed serious concern that while Liberians are trying to  unify their country, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], mainly the Nigerian  contingent, is doing all it can to break the chain of unity  among the Liberian people. Speaking at a technical committee  meeting yesterday involving the NPFL, UNOMIL [United Nations  Observer Mission in Liberia], and ECOMOG in Konala, Margibi  County, the coordinator general of the NPFL, Major General  Austin Clark, said the continuous issuance of passes for  Liberians to travel to and from Monrovia means further dividing  the Liberian nation and people.    Gen. Clark questioned from whence ECOMOG received its  mandate  to stop Liberians from travelling freely on the Monrovia-Kakata  high street. At the same time, another member of the NPFL  delegation at yesterday's meeting, Major General Charles Wright  has made it clear that no Liberian citizen will again go to  ECOMOG for so-called travelling passes before driving or riding  through his motherland.</p>

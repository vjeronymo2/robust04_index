			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM warns schools on standards SCHOOLS that perform poorly will face a choice between being helped to improve by teams of teachers coming in from outside, or being shut down, Mr John Major signalled yesterday. In his first post-election address on domestic policies, the prime minister also made clear that his desire to see change in the social agenda included housing and law and order, and was not confined to the higher-profile areas of education and health. That development of his campaign themes of the 'right to own, the power to choose' came in a speech last night to the Adam Smith Institute, the free-market think tank. In a look ahead to the white paper on schools which is due to be published later in the summer, Mr Major promised radical proposals for schools - particularly in inner cities - where the independent inspectorate of schools found standards were far too low. 'I do not believe that government can stand indefinitely by. If the governors or the local authority are unwilling or unable to put things right, then we must find ways to raise standards for the children in them,' he said. Drawing on his own experiences, as he did increasingly in his campaign speeches, Mr Major recalled his childhood among people who did not have much money but who still wanted to be independent, and said that the task for the 1990s was to widen the avenue of choice. 'We mean to empower not just the enterprising, but all people - the least well off  - those most dependent on public services as well.' In a scarcely veiled reference to the tone of some Tory rhetoric of the 1980s, the prime minister emphasised his view that reform had to start at the top, and that if people did feel dependent that was the fault of government and others in authority who arrogantly behaved as if they knew best. 'I don't want to hear any more carping about the faults of the dependent,' he said. Government had made people dependent 'not because we provide the welfare and the services, but by denying people the basic human dignity of independent choice in the way they are provided'. While education and health were at the forefront of the Tory election campaign emphasis on extending choice and opportunity, Mr Major's speech highlighted the need to extend further the government's plans to bring more choice into home ownership and into the public and private rented sectors. He said that the government wanted policing that would be more responsive to public concerns.</p>

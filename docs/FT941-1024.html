			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Old fish sleep, and man wreaks havoc: Fishing Salmon fishers are superstitious beings. The approach to a new fishing pool provides signals, salient indicators. When I asked in the tiny Irish village of Killavullen for river-keeper Frank Maher, they said: 'He'll be on the island; he's always there.' A salmon beat with a resident keeper holds promise. The physical approach consolidated this. You drive a curving avenue of superbly lofty beeches. The track drops into a boreen, or rough lane, and from here I could detect, across the River Blackwater, through the foliage, an aquamarine parasol, high-up. But what could be more natural than a parasol under which to eat lunch? By some occult premonition Frank had this repast just laid out. Lunch - lettuce and spring onions, grown by him on his island of course, plus a pork-hunk - was served in his hidey-house on stilts, under the parasol, and a bottle of whiskey was plonked down beside. His pet robin watched on the rail. Frank, the complete ghillie, had rods, personally tied flies, and, in the eventuality of me failing to deliver, a frozen salmon to take away. As you may have guessed, Frank Maher is a central part of fishing this beat. The extraordinary workload he puts in here is, in his words, convalescing. For Frank is a retired building foreman and has 10 children. It says something for him (and of Ireland) that nine of these have settled with their spreading families all around him in this luxuriant, mellow corner of county Cork. His voice is like a faraway train in a tunnel, and throaty with cigarette-intake; his face brown and seamed. His all-round ghillieing service includes cooking breakfast while you fish the dawn-pool. Grubbing, as Frank called eating, was followed, while resting the fishing pools in mid-afternoon, by pulling, known elsewhere as drinking stout. After two days of this, repairing late through the leafy lanes to my hotel, I felt as if Frank and I had been on his island for a week. The fishery? I nearly forgot. Old fish slept in pools, even when Frank rolled worms down into their murky lairs. Grilse showed. One kept splashing in a resident spot, slowly skipping. The water-surface over it was not only flat, but very slow, making all advances futile. Frank intended to remedy this supreme irritant by adjusting a dried-out channel which ran through his island and was presently blocked by rocks. This would quicken water gliding over the lie. There had been a silage spill on the Blackwater a short way upstream, and to this we attributed our lack of luck. By day three, the perpetual misty rain had slightly lifted the water-height, and by the time Frank had done his stuff in the frying-pan, two grilse were on the bank. He was jubilant, presenting me with the fishing book to enter them immediately, in case we caught so many later we would lose count. It all had to end. I consumed my last sausage and Frank and I adjourned to his local in Doneraile to do some pulling. The landlord, deadened by tales of vanished Blackwater salmon, listened in amazement when Frank told him he had been frightened by runs of fish vaulting past him, and had stepped aside to let them pass. Frank retired to the bosom of his township-sized family and I headed west for the River Slaney in Wexford. This proved to be a river more talked about than fished. Slaney is the name mentioned after Blackwater in Irish fishing - or it used to be. Once Ireland's best spring river, the Slaney is dying. Catches have started to decline sharply. On some beats the run is only just detectable. Two of the best traditional 200-fish beats only managed to creep into double figures this year. Aided by Lar Kenny, a ghillie of 38 years experience, and others, I built up a portrait of woe. Kenny knows fish and he maintains that, in retrospect, the signs of fish distress showed long ago. The salmon stopped their characteristic dolphin-action 'head-and-tailing'; they ran through pools they should have stopped in. Sea trout entered the river only just prior to spawning, then vamoosed again. Water quality continued deteriorating. As sheep stocking increased in the hills, riverbank grazing intensified and clear, gravelly beds became weed-matted and blackened. Young fish lacked vital oxygen, and a current study reports 14 traditional nursery areas devoid of fish life. As the salmon stock came under environmental pressure the awesome abstractions from 75 bag-nets in the 14-mile long estuary increased. Political pressure from the netsmen, protesting at low catches, resulted in an extended season. Meantime it became clear that, for a variety of political reasons, the heavily-mortgaged fishing-boats working off Donegal would continue their illegal drift-netting for salmon without effective restraint. Efforts to improve the marine fisheries protection service were met with an escalation of intimidation and violence. It is a fisheries war which officialdom seems content to lose. The Slaney salmon, which has survived the obstacle course in salt waters, now ascends its home river to find, half-way up, an imperfectly-functioning fish-pass attached to a Jerry-built weir. Out of this private hydroelectric scheme comes only pitiful quantities of electricity. For the rare survivors which pass the weir in a flood there is the prospect of being speared under nightlamps while laying eggs in the spawning-beds (redds). The ingenuity of wickedness is educational. The over-extended bailiff-force does manage, in autumn, to visit the upstream redds. But while the bailiffs supervise, red and inedible spawners were being pinioned and perforated by pitchforks elsewhere. Poor Slaney, with its swans and kingfishers and otters and beautifully-coloured riverbed; with its backdrop of verdant fields which lean into the bluey, faraway hills. What man in his furious cycle of pilfering has done to your natural richness. Michael Wigan stayed at Springfort, near Hall, near Mallow, in Cork, and the Slaney at Ballinkeele House, Ballymurphy, Wexford. His flight was arranged by Aer Lingus.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raghidah Dirgham, Randah Taqiyy-al-Din, Faysal </F> Makram, and Iqbal 'Abdallah: "Al-'Attas and al-Iryani Met, `Did  Not Fail'"]    [Excerpt] New York, Paris, Sanaa, Aden -- While the siege  of Aden -- whose residents are living without water and  electricity in conditions described by citizens contacted by  AL-HAYAH as worse than those they experienced during the 13  January 1986 incidents -- has intensified, a meeting -- the  first of its kind at this level since the war broke out -- was  held in New York between a northern official and a southern  official. The north was represented at the meeting, arranged by  the UN secretary general's special envoy to Yemen Lakhdar  Brahimi, by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and  development minister in the Republic of Yemen, while the south  was represented by Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime  minister of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen."    Al-Iryani and al-'Attas stressed to AL-HAYAH the importance  of the meeting. Al-'Attas said that the meeting with al-Iryani  and Brahimi "will [as published] be limited to discussing the  cease-fire question, the mechanism of observing the  implementation of the cease-fire, disengaging the forces, and  determining a venue and a date for the negotiations."    Al-'Attas described the meeting as "a start," saying it  represents "a first step." He added: "But my conclusion is  also that the brothers in Sanaa are procrastinating in order to  waste time at the Security Council." Al-'Attas did not rule out  another meeting with al-Iryani, saying that this depends on  Brahimi's "efforts."    He stressed that the meeting "discussed the cease-fire issue  and a monitoring mechanism to consolidate it." He also said:  "We could not complete" the discussions because "Dr. al-Iryani  says he is not authorized to discuss details" of the points  concerning "setting a time for the cease-fire, the observers  team, and the monitoring mechanism." Al-'Attas was eager not to  describe the meeting as a failure, emphasizing that it is  regarded as "a start."    Dr. al-Iryani said that the meeting with al-'Attas and  Brahimi "was not a failure. However, I say that there is an  attempt to exploit legitimate actions for illegitimate ends."    He denied that he said at the meeting that he is not  authorized to discuss a cease-fire mechanism. He said: "Of  course I am authorized to discuss the cease-fire mechanism, and  this is what we discussed. We agreed on the general aspects but  disagreed over some details." He went on: "As for the question  of setting a new time for the cease-fire, I do not have the  authority. It is to be decided by Sanaa and field commanders."  He disclosed that Brahimi asked him during the meeting to set a  new time for the cease-fire, but al-Iryani told him that he  would inform Sanaa that a new time is required. However, he  added, "it was I who requested monitoring to determine who is  violating the cease-fire. I requested that the monitoring  process be supervised by the French and U.S. military attaches,  and Haydar (al-'Attas) proposed the inclusion of the Russian  attache. I said I would convey this proposal to Sanaa."    Al-Iryani stressed that holding another meeting with  al-'Attas "is left" to Brahimi. He said that he is, "of course,  authorized to discuss the Security Council resolution." As for  setting a new time for the cease-fire, it is up to Sanaa, "and  what is required is to halt the war machine." [passage omitted]</p>

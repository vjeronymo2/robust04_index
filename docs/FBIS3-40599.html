			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Making Nuclear Program a Political Football"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said while addressing  a press conference at the Karachi airport that the politicians  have badly hurt the nuclear program by making it a political  issue, and the government will not allow this anymore. At the  same time, she revealed that Pakistan's nuclear program has been  frozen since July 1990. She forgot that it was her government  that ruled Pakistan at that time. The next day a government  spokesman clarified that the program is frozen at the July 1990  level, but it was not frozen by the Benazir government. The  government that followed her was responsible for this action.  This government spokesman told a "group of newsmen" that Madam  Bhutto did not say that the nuclear program was frozen in July  1990, instead it is frozen at the level it was in July 1990. The  caretaker government appointed by Ghulam Ishaq Khan was  responsible for it. (It should be remembered that this  government was led by Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, who is special  assistant to Madam Bhutto). Nawaz Sharif left this issue as it  was. Now the nuclear program will not be left frozen as the  situation has changed. Now the U.S. pressure is decreasing and  Pakistan will be freed from the Pressler Amendment restriction  without rolling back the nuclear program.    At Madam Bhutto's statement, her main rival, Nawaz Sharif,  reacted by saying that Madam Bhutto had admitted to her "crime"  about freezing the program during her government. Now she was  making compromises with the United States, and the nation will  not allow her to do that. Nawaz Sharif said in a meeting in  Lahore that, by appointing a man like Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali the  foreign minister and a journalist like Maliha Lodhi the  ambassador to the United States, Madam Bhutto had clearly hinted  that she is ignoring Pakistan's interests.    The whole nation listened to and read the feelings expressed  by the prime minister and the former prime minister with great  interest. Interestingly enough, both slipped while trying to  push each other. Madam Bhutto did not remember that she was in  power in July 1990. Now Nawaz Sharif forgot that Benazir's  government was dismissed after July 1990, new elections were  held, a new party called the IJI [Islami Jamhoori Ittehad]  (coalition of some parties) came to power getting two-third  majority, and the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] had failed to  form government in any state. The man who won the crown to the  prime ministership after this election was Nawaz Sharif. He  headed the government from 1990 to the middle of 1993.    The question arises: If Madam Bhutto had frozen the nuclear  program, why did not Nawaz Sharif disclose this information when  he was the prime minister? If this freeze was harmful, why did  not he rectify the problem? Why did he not take the nation into  confidence and expose all her actions at that time?    We should also ask Madam Bhutto if Ghulam Ishaq Khan and  Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi had frozen the nuclear program, and it was  an inauspicious act (that is why she hesitates in accepting  responsibility for it), then why did she make agreements with  Khan and Jatoi? Why did she cooperate with them? Why did she let  her representatives to become cabinet members during the  caretaker government appointed by Mr. Khan? Why did she go as  far as to let her husband be a minister? Why is Ghulam Mustafa  her confidant now? Why did she go to his home and ask him to  join her caravan? Can or should those who play with the nuclear  program be given such revered positions?    Madam Bhutto is saying that the nuclear program should not  be  made a political issue, and, at the same time, is using it as a  staff to punish other people. She also wants to take the credit  for protecting the nuclear program. At the same time, she is  trying to convince the nation that the nuclear program is safer  then ever in her hands.    Unfortunately, Madam Bhutto has changed her stand on this  matter so many times that we are not willing to consider her  word on this issue to be firm. She has once said that the  nuclear program was under the supervision of the president and  the Army, and she did not know anything about it. Nawaz Sharif  never announced such lack of authority; however, various members  of his government had made some inferences about this issue.  Therefore, we cannot say what plans he had for protecting the  nuclear program, and what he did achieve in this area. We can  argue in his defense that the United States did not reinstate  aid of Pakistan during his tenure. It also spread rumors about  declaring Pakistan a terrorist nation during that time. This  U.S. attitude indicates that Nawaz Sharif did not bow down to  the United States and refused to obey it.    Some people even say that the United States has punished  Nawaz Sharif for his arrogance, and did not stop until he was  thrown out of the corridors of power at a time when he had the  majority support in the National Assembly and the Supreme Court  had decided that the presidential action against him was  improper and illegal. Without discussing how much truth there is  in this claim, we have to say that some mysterious circumstances  surrounded Nawaz Sharif's fall from power. The nation has not  found the reason for this action yet.    Even when we ignore Nawaz Sharif's and Benazir Bhutto's  statements, claims, and assurances, we still feel instead of  making the nuclear program an excuse to accuse each other, they  should explain what "freezing the program" means and what was  its purpose is. Who was responsible for it? How much was our  nation hurt by this action? The time for if, but, and because is  past now, and neither you or anyone else can be fooled.  Therefore, these efforts to dupe the nation should be stopped.  The leaders of the government and the opposition should sit down  together (the military leadership that ended the long march and  assured new elections can arrange this) and instead of playing  gulli-danda [Indian/Pakistani game] with it, make joint  statements and present facts to the nation.</p>

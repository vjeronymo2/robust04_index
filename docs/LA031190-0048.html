			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> STATES CONSIDER PINNING TAXES ON THROWAWAYS  </P> <P> Laws aimed at curbing widespread use of disposable diapers, blamed for  aggravating waste-disposal problems, are being debated in a dozen states, and  an outright ban has been proposed for Vermont.  </P> <P> Most of the bills have little chance of becoming law, at least this year. In  Florida, a bill was withdrawn pending further study of the issue.  </P> <P> Most of the proposals call for a tax on throwaway diapers. In corn-growing  states, biodegradable diapers are being pushed because corn is used in their  manufacture.  </P> <P> In Colorado, for instance, a bill to tax disposables 0.25 cents per diaper was  sent off to three committees -- usually the kiss of death.  </P> <P> "That baby's going to go down like a burning kite, if I know the Colorado  Legislature," said one veteran reporter.  </P> <P> He knew his legislature. The bill was killed in its first day of hearings.  </P> <P> In New Hampshire, a plan co-sponsored by Deborah Arnie Arnesen, Democrat from  Orford, would levy a tax of 10 cents a diaper. No, she doesn't think it will  pass in this session.  </P> <P> "This is a very industrial state," said Arnesen, a mother of four. "Procter  &amp; Gamble could come in here and run for governor and win. We don't even  have a bottle (deposit-refund) law. It would be almost irrational for something  to pass the first time around. There isn't enough time to assess the  situation."  </P> <P> Isn't a 10-cent tax a little steep?  </P> <P> "It's politics," she said. "You ask for the sun, the moon and the stars and  then you compromise down.  </P> <P> "When it gets to the point that a family may save $15 a week by using a diaper  service, and when some good marketers come in here, then maybe people will  start to use cloth diapers at least part of the time."  </P> <P> Arnesen said she would be the first to oppose a state ban on disposables.  </P> <P> "You can't ignore the convenience factor," she said. "When I brought my  5-week-old daughter to the Legislature with me, I wasn't about to ask committee  members to sit in a smelly room. It was enough they put up with the baby."  </P> <P> Other states that have or are considering diaper legislation include New York,  Connecticut, Oregon, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Washington, Hawaii, Ohio and Kentucky.  </P></p>

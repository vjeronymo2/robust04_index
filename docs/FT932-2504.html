			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: Tosca revived - Opera in London Whenever management consultants are invited into opera houses, they come away recommending that companies should give more performances of each production. On that score nobody can complain about the Royal Opera's Tosca, first seen in 1964 and brought back more often since then than one would have thought possible. It still looks good, as long as one accepts the dated visual style. On Wednesday it housed a decent, standard revival. The performance managed to send a frisson of melodrama down the spine, even though the two main principals have voices that are not quite large enough. Looking elegant but remarkably petite in the grand costumes designed for Callas, Catherine Malfitano has her work cut out measuring up to Tosca in stature. At all the big vocal moments she is pushed to meet the volume and scale required. This is regrettable, as the slim figure and refined Latin looks make her a highly desirable heroine. There is plenty of temperament (it is easy to understand why she wants the portrait of the Madonna to be given dark eyes, when her own flash with jealousy so sharply) and nothing she does is cheap. Even the lines which sopranos have traditionally spoken, she sings as written. In each of her scenes with Scarpia, one sensed an electric tension crackling between them. Gregory Yurisich's Scarpia is nasty enough as the police chief, but he manages to be more chilling still when he is playing the lover trying to ensnare his prey. A torrent of sadistic desires seems to be bottled up inside this perfectly controlled persona. Unfortunately, he too has difficulty keeping a strong vocal presence over the orchestra, which robs him of some of his authority. It is strange that a voice which has seemed on the heavy side in lesser roles should sound underpowered when it comes to this one. There are no problems of that kind with the tenor, at least. Alberto Cupido has a sturdy Puccini voice, which has enough steel for Cavaradossi's heroic moments and a limited ability to melt at his romantic ones. The musicianship is apt to be unimaginative, but he gives good value. This means not only hanging on to top notes, but phrasing as long and broadly as he can. There is also a characterful new Sacristan from Donald Adams. The conductor is Daniel Oren, already encountered this year in Puccini at the Royal Opera. After his La Boheme the exaggerated speeds and garish orchestral colouring were only to be expected, but Tosca is a tougher score, which can take the treatment more successfully. I only wish that his idea of rubato did not run counter to my own instincts. Otherwise this is a convincing, sometimes exciting revival, which should serve the young audience at its three Prom performances well enough. Tosca runs until 26 June at the Royal Opera House</p>

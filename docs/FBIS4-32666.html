			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) -- The international  community should recognize both state entities in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Moslem-Croat  federation and the Bosnian Serb republic -- if the conflicts  there are to be settled, Bosnian Serb Foreign Minister Aleksa  Buha said to Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino Tuesday.  Martino arrived in Belgrade earlier in the day for a brief  working visit.    After the meeting, Buha told a press conference that he had  conveyed to Martino the Bosnian Serb stand that it was necessary  to accept that Bosnia's three sovereign peoples were entitled to  freely decide about their future.    It was made clear to Martino that the international  community  had to admit at last that an independent Bosnia-Herzegovina is  no more than a fiction, Buha said.    The Serb side said to the Italian delegation that the  international community had got entangled in a net from which it  can hardly free itself without new ideas, said Buha.    The Italian delegation's insisting on getting first-hand  information on the Bosnian Serb views of the solution to the  Bosnian conflict is interpreted by Bosnian Serb officials as  showing Rome's obvious intention to play a more active role in  the Bosnian peace process.    Assessing the results of his talks with Martino and his  aides, Buha said that the first impression was that they were  people prepared to work without prejudice.    Bosnian Serb Vice-President Biljana Plavsic, who also  attended the talks, said after the meeting that the talks with  the Italian foreign minister had come at the right time. She  apparently had in mind some important forthcoming meetings,  including the summit of the Group of Seven most industrialized  nations and Russia on July 8 to 10. There are indications that  the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be decided at this meeting.</p>

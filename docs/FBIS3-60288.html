			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Demin under the rubric "Ecology": "Burning </F> Gold"]    [Text] This is how V. Danilov-Danilyan, minister of  environmental protection and natural resources of Russia,  described the issue of garbage disposal in Russia and  specifically in the Moscow region at a press conference devoted  to ecological problems in our country held yesterday at the  House of the Russian Press.    In the words of Viktor Ivanovich, in developed European  countries household waste is sorted and either recycled or  burned. In our country, everything is burned without  distinction, producing smoke which does nothing to improve the  ecological situation in the country. Millions of rubles go up in  smoke. This happens because there are neither specialists in  sorting waste nor special plants. On the whole, the ecological  situation in Russia is critical, but for now nothing can be done  about it: In a country with a sick economy, the environment will  also suffer. Mr. Danilov-Danilyan stated that inspectors of the  environmental protection inspectorate are frequently unable to  even assess fines against enterprises: They run to billions, and  enterprises may go bankrupt, leaving hundreds of thousands of  people out on the street. Meanwhile, Russia has only 16,000  ecology specialists.</p>

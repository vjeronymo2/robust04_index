			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Kohl welcomes Major's VE Day gesture Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany has warmly welcomed a proposal from Britain's prime minister, Mr John Major, to invite high-level German participation next year at 50th anniversary celebrations of the end of the war in London. The British leader's invitation, an attempt to defuse a gathering diplomatic imbroglio over British and French reluctance to invite the German Chancellor to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings, came as Mr Kohl presented his own agenda of celebrations linked to the end of the second world war, and the final withdrawal of allied troops from Berlin. He agreed that it would not be 'appropriate' for him to attend the forthcoming 50th anniversary celebrations of the D-Day landings. However, referring to a possible visit to the UK, he said it could be done in a 'good and dignified manner', and the attendance of German war veterans would be 'appropriate'. 'The 50th anniversary of the end of the war is an entirely different matter (to the Normandy landings),' he said. Any suggestion that he had sought an invitation to Normandy, and had been rebuffed was 'pure fantasy'. Instead, Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand of France will attend a European youth festival in Heidelberg two days later. Mr Kohl announced that the allied withdrawal from Berlin would be celebrated in two stages, without any full-scale allied military parades. On August 31, President Boris Yeltsin of Russia will attend ceremonies in both Berlin and Weimar to mark the departure of the last Russian troops from German soil. Nine days later, Mr Kohl has invited President Bill Clinton, Mr Mitterrand and Mr Major to attend festivities marking the withdrawal from Berlin of the rest of the wartime allies.</p>

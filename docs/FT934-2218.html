			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Sensing centre to be probed The National Remote Sensing Centre, a part of Britain's space establishment which was privatised last year, is to be investigated following a report by the National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, Daniel Green writes. The report, published yesterday, says that the centre, majority controlled by British Aerospace, could have a 'privileged position' because it may be able to take competitive advantage of the close links it still has with the British National Space Centre, a government agency. The BNSC is expected to start its costing and pricing investigation into the sensing centre soon. The sensing centre, which made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 389,000 on sales of Pounds 4.1m last year, said it was aware that other space-sector companies were wary of its position but any fears were unfounded. It said it would, however, re-examine its costing and charging schemes. The NAO report broadly praised the UK's space policy.

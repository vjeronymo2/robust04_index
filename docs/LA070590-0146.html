			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL PASSES RESOLUTION BACKING ARTS ENDOWMENT  </P> <P> The Long Beach City Council this week backed the National Endowment for the  Arts and, in a resolution, urged Congress to resume the group's funding without  any restrictions.  </P> <P> The federally funded group has come under attack by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher  (R-Lomita) and other critics who complain that the government is subsidizing  pornographic works.  </P> <P> Supporters of the arts have argued that Rohrabacher is in essence calling for  censorship.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the council unanimously agreed that "the restrictive language  approved by Congress in 1989 would have the effect of promoting censorship and  inhibiting creativity at the expense of quality within the arts community, and  gives Congress the power to micro-manage the endowment and define obscenity  rather than the courts . . . "  </P> <P> Councilman Tom Clark, who asked for the resolution, said that "Long Beach is  supportive of the arts. I don't think that Long Beach is that conservative,  although it has an aura of being conservative."  </P></p>

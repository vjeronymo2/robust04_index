			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Business Travel: Dutch treat for big spenders - Schiphol removes upper limit on tax-free sales If you cannot resist that wide-screen multi-function television set in a European airport tax-free shop, your biggest problem now is how to fit it into the overhead locker. The old question of how to look innocent sauntering through the blue channel often no longer applies, thanks to increasing competition. Schiphol airport in Amsterdam has just removed the upper limit on tax-free sales for passengers flying to other European Union destinations. Schiphol retailers will now pay the value added tax on sales above Ecu90, the current limit on tax-free purchases for intra-EU journeys. Until July 1, Schiphol insisted that its tax-free retailers limited intra-EU passengers' purchases to Fl 250 - the Dutch equivalent of Ecu90 - per trip. That limit has now been abandoned, in part because of competition from other airports. The Dutch initiative matches a similar offer by BAA, the UK airport operator. BAA has paid the tax on purchases above the limit without much fanfare since the single market came into force, but it is now seeking a higher profile for its offer. Before deploying credit cards too freely, travellers should remember: The change applies only to tax-free purchases - duty-free tobacco, alcohol and perfume allowances are unchanged. Your tax is paid only if you are flying within the EU. If your destination is elsewhere, you remain liable for any taxes that apply. For regularly carried items, like laptop computers, it is worth retaining receipts to prove their provenance. Since some high-ticket sales are now being subsidised, it behoves the traveller to re-examine the assumption that 'tax-free' prices are necessarily bargains.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Draft rules issued for acquisitions The scope for companies to create provisions in acquired businesses would be reduced by proposals issued yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board. Fred 7, the financial reporting exposure draft on fair values in acquisition accounting, would curtail one of the most common devices for creative accounting in the late 1980s. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'In the past it has proved very difficult to see how profitable a company is for two to three years after a major acquisition.' The draft's key elements are: Fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities in the acquired company should reflect its position at the time of acquisition, and changes resulting from the acquirer's intentions. Accounts should not include provisions for future operating losses or reorganisation costs after the acquisition. Non-monetary assets should be valued at the lower of replacement cost and recoverable amount at acquisition. ASB, Fred 7. Accountancy Books, PO Box 620, Central Milton Keynes, MK9 2JX. Pounds 6.

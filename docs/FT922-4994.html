			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World News in Brief: Danish exit poll points to 'No' on Maastricht vote First results from Denmark's binding referendum on the EC Maastricht Treaty yesterday suggested that 55 per cent of voters may have said 'no' to ratification. The forecast was based on only 2.8 per cent of the votes cast but if confirmed, it would throw the whole European Community into confusion since the Maastricht treaty will fall unless ratified by all 12 EC member states.</p>

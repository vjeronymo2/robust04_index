			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  ANOTHER WALKOUT BY STUDENTS IN L.A.  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 students at George Washington High School in South Los Angeles  walked out of class Friday morning to protest the lack of progress in a  contract dispute between the school district and its teachers.  </P> <P> The demonstration, the second such protest at a Los Angeles high school this  week, was peaceful and ended after about 20 minutes.  </P> <P> At Friday's demonstration, a number of students indicated support for Los  Angeles Unified School District teachers' demands for pay increases. But the  students also expressed concern that they may suffer if the teachers do not  file their fall semester grades with the district. Some students need those  grades, due Feb. 3, to apply for college.  </P> <P> Teachers' union officials have said semester grades may not be filed with the  district if a settlement is not reached. But they have promised not to do  anything that would thwart the students' academic progress and have discouraged  students from walking out of classes.  </P> <P> District officials have promised students that they will produce official  grades and transcripts one way or another.  </P></p>

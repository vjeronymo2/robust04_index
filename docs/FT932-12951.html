			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Letter: Longstanding plea for European technological strategy Sir, Professor Hollerman (Letters, April 22) suggests that, in my plea (Letters, April 15) for a much-increased emphasis on technology in industrial and economic planning, I 'could make a stronger case'. But I already have. In my 1986 book Sunrise Europe (now regrettably out of print), I believe I gave a convincing description of how the European electronics industry got into its mess (now even messier) vis-a-vis the Americans and Japanese. And this was followed by an even more convincing prescription of how to get out of it through the increased demand for information technology products and services which would have been created by my proposed pan-European fibre-optic network, Eurogrid. But, as usual, the cry of the technologists was of little avail. Apart from the laboured efforts of the European Commission in setting up the Race (Research on Advanced Communications in Europe) project, there is little sign of my mooted broadband connections to every European home, office, hospital and school etc. Meanwhile, President Clinton is energetically doing just that by actively supporting the US infrastructure investment in 'information highways' - or the 'USA-grid'. The point, then, is that whereas the views of technologists are important in the formulation of corporate and governmental policies in America, Japan and elsewhere in Asia, this is certainly not the case in the UK or many other European countries. Until we can match their understanding of the salience of technical matters, both in production and use of technological goodies, we shall continue to suffer substantially lower economic growth rates than our transoceanic competitors.

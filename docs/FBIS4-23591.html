			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The chief of general staff, Lieutenant General  Oladipo Diya, has advised Chief Moshood Abiola not to confront  the government by making good his reported intention to be sworn  in as president on Sunday [12 June]. Gen. Diya was speaking  with State House correspondent Mohamed Labe shortly on arrival  in Abuja from his three-day consultation with traditional rulers  and leaders of thought across the country:    [Begin recording] [Diya] We continue to appeal to Chief M.K.  Abiola not to confront the government. I have said this, that  Chief Abiola believes in God. He is a very good Muslim. He  knows that it is God that gives one a position, and I know that  Chief M.K. Abiola would not want to see this country -- this  country that has reduced from what it used to be -- he wouldn't  want to see this country in chaos. I think he will not do it.    [Labe] On his confutations with traditional rulers and  leaders of thought, he said the talks had been successful.    [Diya] I think they have been very very successful. I am  more reassured now than ever before that our traditional rulers,  our elders are all committed to a united and very strong Nigeria.    [Labe] For three days, the chief of general staff criss-  crossed the country, talking with northern traditional rulers  and elders and their counterparts in the east, Edo, Delta, and  leaders of thought of the southwest. The traditional rulers  assured the Federal Government of their loyalty. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

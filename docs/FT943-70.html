			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance (2): World population growth The next 30 years will see another 3.5bn people added to the world's population, according to projections by the United Nations Population Fund. What is more, those startling estimates assume that fertility rates - the average number of children borne by a woman - continue to fall in most developing countries. Even though family sizes have been falling as economic and social development occurs, and as contraception becomes widely available, developing countries have also seen life expectancy soar in the past 40 years from 41 to 61 years. As a result, industrialised countries can expect their share of the world's population to shrink given their slow rates of population growth: at present about 1 per cent a year in North America, 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per cent a year in western Europe. Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the UN expects the proportion of people aged 65 and over in industrialised countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025. The UN warns that population growth will put huge strains on the supply of natural resources such as forests, fish and clean air. Industralised countries should also brace themselves for increased migratory pressures. But it dismisses fears of a global food shortage, pointing out that over the past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent, faster than population growth.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosita Caldera] </F>   [Text] The executive branch is scheduled to issue a formal  letter of protest to the United States as its first response to  the U.S. EPA's new marketing guidelines for unleaded  [reformulada] gasoline. President Ramon J. Velasquez announced  the government's decision in exclusive statements to EL  UNIVERSAL. Velasquez said the country will certainly feel the  impact of the U.S. move, which is why Venezuela will undertake  "every appropriate measure to correct this situation."    President Velasquez received a report from Simon Consalvi,  the Venezuelan ambassador in Washington, informing him of the  new gasoline guidelines in the United States. When the  guidelines go into effect in January 1995, the measure will  force Venezuela to stop selling some 50,000 barrels of oil a day  to the United States. According the president, such a loss  undoubtedly will adversely affect the country's financial  situation. The decision forces us to begin actions to prevent  the implementation of this measure. It contradicts the United  States' proclaimed policy of free trade and economic  integration. With this measure, Venezuela feels its economic  interests have been damaged. Moreover, this policy contradicts  Article 3 of GATT. For this reason, Venezuela, as a GATT  member, should denounce before GATT this unfair trade policy  affecting our exports.    The official statement the government will issue today will  be drafted in almost the exact terms used by President Velasquez  in making his statements to EL UNIVERSAL. The government will  insist the U.S. measure is at odds with Venezuela's rightful  desire to maintain its current export levels. Moreover, we have  a year -- from now until January 1995 -- to continue pressing  our just demands, the president added.</p>

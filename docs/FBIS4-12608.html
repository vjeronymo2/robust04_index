			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Riyadh, 6 Apr (SPA) -- Their excellencies the  ministers of trade in the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states  began the proceedings of the 20th session of the Trade  Cooperation Committee at the GCC headquarters in Riyadh today.    Dr. Sulayman al-Salim, Saudi commerce minister and chairman  of the current session, delivered a speech at the start of the  meeting, welcoming the GCC trade ministers and hailing the depth  of cooperation between the GCC states. [passage omitted]    His excellency concluded his speech by saying:  "International  changes are aimed at achieving real free trade, particularly now  that all the difficulties have been overcome and the Uruguay  Round has ended in success. Endeavors are also under way to  turn GATT into an international trade organization at the  meeting due to be held in Marrakesh soon. All this imposes  challenges on us and obliges us to make huge efforts to achieve  greater freedom of trade among us; we must remove all procedural  obstacles in order to pave the way so that we may keep up with  and adapt to these positive international trends."    He also said that he hoped that everyone would cooperate to  take more national goods off the list of the goods on which  there is an import ban. He added that he would like to see the  competent authorities reach a suitable formula to unify tariffs  within the GCC. After this the commerce minister announced the  end of the opening session.</p>

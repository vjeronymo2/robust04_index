			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Brothers: Welcome to Palestine, for which we have  struggled all this time. Welcome to all the Palestinian hands  that are rushing to build a beautiful, free, and auspicious  homeland. These are glorious days, with the arrival of the  vanguards of the Palestinian police force, the Palestinian  administrations, and the groups of Palestinian deportees. As  Palestinians, we must move toward hope instead of sorrow, toward  work instead of self- flagellation, and away from the edge of  illusion.    We are addressing those who support and those who oppose the  agreement. Why? Because what is appearing before us now is the  Palestinian homeland. Who dares to reject the homeland? Who  dares to escape from life into deplorable exile? Despite its  advantages and disadvantages, the Palestinian-Israeli agreement  has moved from paper articles into real national interaction on  the ground. It has moved from endless pages of opinions -- some  of which are right and some of which are wrong -- into a land  where a homeland is being established. This homeland needs  economic and administrative skills. It needs intensive efforts  to extend housing, water, education, health, judiciary, customs  services, and thousands of other details. This includes the  upcoming elections in the homeland, which will baptize our  democratic solidarity and our political life, based on pluralism  and respect for human rights.    As Palestinians, we must leave the waiting room and get  involved in work, collective effort, and comprehensive  participation. We must leave behind the sands of exile and the  language of skepticism, loss, fear, and hesitation. We must use  the dictionary of national presence.    We all know the language of accusations and counter  accusations was never our language. It was, instead, a  barbaric language imposed on us by the authority of the  diaspora, the dictatorship of geography and by coercive  alliances we could not escape. One party or another wanted us  to say (?no) in order to serve its personal interests and its  special strategy. For some of the factions, forces, and trends,  this word no was the only password.    The homeland is being born again. It is rising before us.  The license for entry to the homeland is the word yes: Yes to  building, yes to participation, yes to positive contribution.  This is everyone's responsibility.    O brothers, many tasks are before us. Our burden is large.  We must work hard, in keeping with our ambitions. Just as we  built for others, it is now time for us to build for ourselves.  Is there anything more sacred than having a homeland that we  can build and a future for our children which we can maintain  away from the pressures and haggling of others?    Welcome to Palestine, which is returning to life,  transformed  from absence into reality, from idea into the revolution, and  into the state. Welcome to Palestine -- the homeland, the  state, and the entity. Welcome to Palestine, the call of the  memory that never fades and the result of our effort that is not  in vain. Everything we do for it is for us. Every tree we  plant shelters us. Every house, every factory and farm, every  school, university, hospital, and laboratory we build will  testify to our everlasting presence.    At the places of exile, everything was claimed by others.  Welcome to Palestine. Welcome to all the hands that are united  together to build this great edifice.</p>

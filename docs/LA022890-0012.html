			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Once again deferring its looming fiscal 1991 budget crisis, the San Diego City  Council on Tuesday took no action on a package of tax and fee increases it had  planned to place before voters on the June 5 ballot.  </P> <P> Instead, the council scheduled a special budget meeting for March 7 -- just two  days before it must forward any ballot proposals to the county registrar of  voters for placement on the June ballot.  </P> <P> The 1991 fiscal year begins July 1.  </P> <P> Next week's meeting will be the third special session and fourth council  discussion in a month devoted to filling the $59.9-million gap between the  proposed $492.5-million fiscal 1991 budget and the $432.6 million that will be  available in the city treasury.  </P> <P> A vote scheduled for Tuesday was delayed to review an eleventh-hour proposal by  Councilman Ron Roberts that calls for the council to immediately enact $41  million in tax and fee increases, including a 2% utility users tax for  residents and a 5% utility tax on business and industry.  </P> <P> Roberts also wants to put a $20-million property tax increase on the ballot and  cut $6 million from the proposed budget, largely in arts and promotional  programs. His plan would make public safety the city's top spending priority.  </P> <P> The council is also scheduled to decide whether to place four other  revenue-generating measures and a Gann spending limit waiver on the ballot.  </P></p>

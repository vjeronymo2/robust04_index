			<p>BFN     [Text] Xining, April 3 (XINHUA) -- Cellular mobile  telephone calls are now available in Xining, provincial capital  of northwest China's Qinghai, following the recent installation  of a cellular mobile telephone system in the city.    Telecommunications business concerning cellular mobile  telephone calls is now within reach in all provincial capitals  of the country, as Xining, the last city to start such services,  switched on its system last Wednesday [30 March].    The new cellular mobile telephone system in the city has the  capacity to transmit 1,200 calls at one time. At present, the  city already has 400 users of cellular phones.    Cellular mobile telecommunications services have been  developing rapidly in China since October of 1987, when  Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, took the  lead to install and put into use a cellular mobile telephone  system.    At present, the country's mobile telecommunications service  has the capacity to transmit 1.56 million calls at one time.  The industry now has 638,000 customers, with the group growing  at a monthly speed of more than 30,000 clients, officials with  the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications told XINHUA.    They added that they are working hard on the implementation  of a national scheme based on a nationwide automatic switching  network, which was launched in March of 1993.    When the scheme is completed, customers with cellular phones  will only have to go through a simple registration procedure in  their home provincial capitals to use their portable units  freely in any other provincial capitals.</p>

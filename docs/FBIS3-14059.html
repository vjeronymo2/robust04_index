Nabil Sha'th, who headed a Palestinian delegation at  discussions with Israeli officials on Sunday and Monday in  Tunis, said the PLO was banking on a positive Israeli response  to its security demands when the two sides meet again here on  Thursday.    Earlier reports from both Tunis and Israel had said the  security talks would resume in Cairo on Wednesday.    "We can't say we got all that we wanted," Sha'th said of the  Tunis meetings, "but we are on the way toward an opening that  will allow for a resumption in the (autonomy) talks and the  protection of the Palestinians."    He added that Israeli and PLO delegates would "probably"  confer again here on Thursday at a meeting of 22 countries that  are to finance a Palestinian police force for autonomous  Palestinian areas of the Israeli-held territories.

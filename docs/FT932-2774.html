			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: Jobs for all a realistic goal Sir, In 1944 William Beveridge wrote: 'Idleness is not the same as Want; but a separate evil which men do not escape by having an income. They must also have the chance of rendering useful service and of feeling that they are doing so.' I offer this quotation in response to the letter from Prof Ronald Dore ('Proper recognition still to be given to unemployment problem', June 15). The case for full employment is not based solely on concern to alleviate poverty, but also on concern that everyone should participate in the economic life of the community. A 'citizen's income' would not satisfy that need. I also believe that Prof Dore exaggerates the problems created for employment by technical progress and improved welfare provision. We do not at present realise the full potential of the labour force, except for a minority of high-fliers. The 'learning capacity of people who did not do very well at school' is not developed as it could be - to judge by what is shown in international comparisons. The goal of full employment could still be achieved in the UK if it is given sufficient priority - and achieved well before the year 2020 on which Professor Dore asks us to focus our minds.

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> AZTECS;  </P> <P> LAYOFF HASN'T BEEN EASY ON LUGINBILL  </P> <P> San Diego State's midseason training camp continued on Wednesday with no game  in sight. The Aztecs' next opponent, Utah, is still 10 days away.  </P> <P> Coach Al Luginbill was asked how his team might handle the three-week layoff.  "I have no more clue on this than you," he said. "I think (Arizona Coach) Dick  Tomey when he was at Hawaii and (Air Force Coach) Fisher DeBerry are the only  ones I can think of who have gone through it. But I'm sure they're not going to  give San Diego State any pointers."  </P> <P> Damon Pieri continued to work at free safety in place of the injured Johnny  Walker. Luginbill said Pieri is likely to start at the position against Utah.  Trainer Brian Barry said Walker (foot) will not play in the Utah game.  Linebacker Derek Sang (neck sprain) is questionable.

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Howden rises to Pounds 18m as Danish provisions fall HOWDEN GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineer whose recent results have been plagued by a contract to supply tunnelling machines to Denmark, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.99m to Pounds 18.1m in the year to April 30 after a sharp reduction in exceptional provisions relating to the Danish contract. The company said that MT Group, the international consortium constructing the twin rail tunnels under the Great Belt waterway, had recently escalated the contractual disputes with James Howden, which supplied four boring machines, by threatening to demand payment of two bank guarantees - a performance bond of Pounds 7.8m and another for liquidated damages of Pounds 5.8m. This, Howden said, was despite indications given to the contrary and despite MT defaulting on payments to James Howden and denying it the right to perform under the contract. Howden described the consortium's move as 'a tactical manoeuvre' in the long-running dispute which is before the courts in Scotland and arbitration in Denmark. Howden has applied for an injunction to prevent MT 'pulling' the bonds, but said that, even if that happened, the damage to Howden would be slight - the Pounds 13.6m loss would not much hurt the now 'sound balance sheet'. Acknowledging that the Great Belt contract had not benefited the company one penny and had been a main claim on the board's time, Howden said that Pounds 8.4m cash from operations and Pounds 30.4m from August's rights issue had reduced group borrowings from Pounds 63.7m to Pounds 24.9m over the year. Subsequently interest charges fell from Pounds 9.58m to Pounds 5.13m, helping the pre-tax increase. The company said that MT dispute was not a shackle on its operating businesses, though the lack of Great Belt work accounted for Pounds 20m of the fall in turnover to Pounds 292.3m (Pounds 330.6m). Group operating profits rose by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 24.3m. Last time's exceptional charge of Pounds 10.4m shrank to Pounds 1.07m. This was further provision for possible future legal costs on the dispute. Mr John Jackson, chairman, said that Howden's 'strength in international markets had protected it from the worst of the recession'. The order book at the beginning of the current year stood at Pounds 300m (Pounds 250m), which includes Howden Canada's Pounds 64m share of a yet to be finalised power station plant order from Iran. Mr Jackson said that the air and gas handling division - 48 per cent of group turnover - 'had a busy and successful year', while construction and mining equipment's was 'disappointing'. Aerospace 'experienced a significant contraction in its markets' and processing and packaging 'operated in quieter market conditions'. The proposed final dividend is 1.3p (nil) making 2p (1.59p) for the year, as forecast last July, payable from earnings of 5.7p (1.4p).</p>

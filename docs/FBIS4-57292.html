			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Juan Jose Coello] </F>   [Text] The PGR [Attorney General's Office] described Nuevo  Leon as a narcodollar laundering capital after discovering that  about 70 alleged businessmen have approximately $4 billion  invested in area industries and businesses.    A high-ranking PGR official disclosed that an investigation  of money laundering in Nuevo Leon began by presidential order in  1991 and has not concluded.    "We have fully identified about 70 businessmen who live in  Monterrey and have investments in Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, and  Tamaulipas," the official said.    "Each drug trafficker we investigated led us to other people  involved. What were believed to be simple covers turned out to  be part of a gigantic money laundering network of international  proportions" the interviewed officer said.    All of those involved are directly connected with the  Matamorros Jail, and their leader is Juan Garcia Abrego, the  officer added.    The mafia's money, he said, is invested primarily in 15  types  of industries and businesses.    "There are narcobusinessmen in construction,  telecommunications, automobile dealerships, real estate, and  medium-sized export and foundry companies," he said.    He added: "There is also some involvement in art agencies,  travel agencies, transportation, buildings, finance companies,  the media, electronics purchases and sales, cattle ranching,  investments, and air cargo."    The PGR official said there are specific cases where only a  few of the partners in a consortium have committed the crime,  not every business partner.    The results of the huge investigation, he added, have just  now been made public, and he guessed that this is only the  beginning of a long chain of arrests and searches.    "These investigations have been the most complicated the PGR  has had to face during this six-year term," the source said.    Some of the businessmen involved in narcodollar money  laundering have left a trail and been identified, and there is  evidence against them.    "These are people from middle-class families who are  suddenly  millionaires overnight. They make their first appearance in  society as owners of gigantic businesses," he said.    According to the high-ranking official, the businessmen  involved in money laundering are known to everyone. They appear  in newspapers, create publicity for themselves, and enjoy much  prestige.    "They obey all laws, pay taxes, keep their bank accounts in  good order, request loans pretending to have financial problems,  and even go to church," he said.    "They keep everything in order except their business money  comes from drug trafficking," the official said.</p>

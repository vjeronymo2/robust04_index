			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / OECD urges Norway to curb state subsidies NORWAY'S Labour government was yesterday advised to curb state subsidies and open the country's financial markets to foreign competition. These are among the conditions needed to support a durable revival from the economic shock inflicted by the mid-1980s oil price fall, argues the annual survey on Norway by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A hesitant recovery is on the way, with gross domestic product (GDP) likely to grow by 2.9 per cent in 1993 from 2 per cent this year, says the OECD. Growth in oil output should lead to a big current account surplus of nearly 6 per cent of GDP next year, it adds. Despite Oslo's attempt to reduce the economy's dependence on oil, the OECD finds that it has used too much oil wealth to raise the share of state spending in national income, to nearly 65 per cent of non-oil GDP last year. This includes 'lavish regional subsidies, targeted subsidies to maintain the international competitiveness of ailing industries and record levels of support to agriculture'. This is an inefficient way of stimulating the economy and distracts entrepreneurs from the pursuit of efficiency, says the report. It advises Oslo to consider using oil income to reduce taxes instead. It singles out Norway's crisis-stricken banking system, where bad debts, piled up during the economic slowdown, have undermined confidence in the solvency of banks, forcing the government to pump cash into the sector. The study warns that a balance must be struck between restoring the stability of the banks and not 'giving signals which could . . . encourage careless behaviour by banks and their clients'. Banks 'must not become a new outlet for permanent subsidies', it says. OECD Economic Surveys - Norway. FFr70, from OECD Publications, 2 Rue Andre-Pascal, 75775, Paris Cedex 16.</p>

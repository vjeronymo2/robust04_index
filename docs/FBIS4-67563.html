			<p>CSO     [Text] Aligarh, March 29--Despite repeated warnings by  global environmental agencies, developing countries, including  India, have failed to adequately respond to the challenges posed  by the growing threat of pesticide pollution. Almost 50 per cent  of food in developing countries is contaminated with pesticides,  according to a recent report.    Scientists say that the study of pesticide behaviour is of  critical importance particularly for developing countries which  also face food shortages. Presently 135 pesticides are  registered by the Indian Pesticide Registration Committee. A  majority of these pesticides have been found to be unsafe by the  United States of America Environmental Agency.    According to a recent report by the World Health  Organisation  (WHO), every year at least five lakh people suffer from  pesticide poisoning all over the world and of these an estimated  5,000 die. Monitoring of pesticide contamination is therefore  absolutely necessary, it adds.    At a recent seminar of "soil pollution" in Madras, sponsored  by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry,  scientists have suggested that Indian farmers should be  immediately provided with "Soil Health Cards." The soil health  cards will help government agencies in analysing the pesticide  content in soils of different regions of the country.    The proposal has been accepted by the Tamil Nadu government.  Professor M.S. Swaminathan, an eminent scientist and chairman of  the national organising committee of the seminar, appealed to  other states to follow suit.    In his paper "Pesticides and Their Impact on Groundwater,"  Dr  R.P. Singh, a soil scientist at the Aligarh Muslim University,  has contended that at least three banned pesticides which were  considered hazardous in some western countries, do not pose the  same danger in some regions in India because of certain  characteristics of the soil and different climatic conditions.  According to him, if the soil characteristics of a particular  area is studied, then the selection of a proper and safe  pesticide becomes a distinct possibility.    Dr Singh points out that pesticides such as Carbofuran  oxmyal  and Phosphasmidon do not pollute groundwater when they are used  in clay loam and silt loam soils in India, provided the annual  rainfall is not high. These pesticides have a high absorption  affinity towards such soils and hence their movements restricted.    According to a United States environmental agency report:  "If  the partition coefficient value of a pesticide is more than five  and the organic matter's partition coefficient value is more  than 300, then the pesticide is not harmful."    Similar views have been expressed by Dr N. Sethunathan of  the  Central Rice Research Institute of Cuttack. He said: "The study  of leaching rates of pesticides using soil physico-chemical  properties will be of immediate help in controlling pesticide  pollution in flooded soils."</p>

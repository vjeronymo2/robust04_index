He said that they should cease what  they are doing immediately. In talks with a special envoy of  President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi, who delivered a message  this evening at State House in Dar es Salaam, President Mwinyi  said that the Tanzanians had received the reports about the  continued killings in Burundi with a great deal of sadness. He  said that the government could not remain silent while such  injustices continued to be perpetrated in a neighboring country.    He said that, under any circumstances, whatever happened in  Burundi affected Tanzania and other neighboring countries. He  said that it was for this reason that he had contacted the  leaders of the east and central African countries to seek an  urgent solution, in cooperation with the OAU.    For his part, the Burundian envoy, Mr. Severin Mfatiye, who  is also the ambassador of Burundi in Rwanda, briefed President  Mwinyi at length about the grave and deplorable security  situation in Burundi.</p>

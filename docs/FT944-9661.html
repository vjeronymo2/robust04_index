			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Depleted Democrats battle for party's soul After taking a severe beating at the hands of their Republican opponents in last week's elections, the Democrats yesterday started to fight among themselves over who should control what remains of their party. Congressman Charlie Rose of North Carolina was expected to announce yesterday that he would challenge Congressman Dick Gephardt of Missouri for the minority leadership, setting the scene for a pitched battle between the Democrats' competing wings. If the Democrats had kept a majority in the House of Representatives, Mr Rose might well have challenged Congressman Tom Foley for the speakership. But in the Democrats' general defeat, Mr Foley lost his own bid for re-election in eastern Washington state by the slimmest of margins. As majority leader in the outgoing Congress, Mr Gephardt ranks second in his party to the Speaker. With no speaker, the minority party's leader ranks first. Mr Rose represents the more conservative southern wing of the Democratic party, strongly supporting tobacco growers - the mainstay of his North Carolina district - and playing behind-the-scenes politics from his current position as chairman of the House administration committee. Mr Gephardt, meanwhile, began as a moderate and was one of the founders of the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist group which claims President Bill Clinton as one of its principal members but has often despaired of getting him to stick to its philosophy. In the mid-1980s, however, Mr Gephardt moved to the left, and ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 as a pro-union protectionist. Generally recognised as an extraordinarily skilful manager of the Democratic congressional caucus, Mr Gephardt starts the contest with a clear edge over Mr Rose. Even more tellingly, the election has moved the Democratic congressional party to the left. Many old-school southern Democrats will not return to Washington when the new Congress meets in January, through either retirement or defeat. In Mr Rose's own state of North Carolina the Democrats lost four of the eight House seats they had held. Of the expected 204 Democrats in the new House (results from some districts are not yet final) a clear majority represent districts in the northeast and midwest. Among the remaining southern Democrats, a much larger proportion now represents black and Hispanic districts. Both groups are shifting the party's centre of gravity to the left. In the Senate, a rather different leadership contest is brewing. Senator Jim Sasser had been expected to succeed Senator George Mitchell, retiring majority leader, but lost his re-election bid in Tennessee. That leaves Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who is viewed as having a philosophy very similar to Mr Gephardt's, to compete against Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, another of the Senate's liberals.

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Ben Johnson's doctor, Dr. Jamie Astaphan, bought large quantities of steroids  for a rancher on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts to increase the size of  cattle used for human consumption, according to testimony at the Canadian  inquiry into drugs in sport at Toronto.  </P> <P> Don Hiatt, described as a U.S. businessman, said he first asked Astaphan --  then his physician -- to buy him steroids in 1983 for use on scrawny animals on  the ranch he managed on St. Kitts.  </P> <P> Astaphan has been accused of supplying steroids to Canadian Olympic athletes  including Johnson, who was stripped of his gold medal and world record in the  100 meters sprint after testing positive for drugs at last year's Seoul Games.  </P> <P> Earlier testimony from drug companies in Canada established that Astaphan  bought large quantities of veterinary steroids but was never questioned about  it.  </P></p>

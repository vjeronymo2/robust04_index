			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subsides as new figures are awaited Wall Street US share prices powered higher yesterday morning on a surprisingly favourable reading on inflation, but the rally fizzled out during the afternoon, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just 14.80 better at 3,889.95, about 40 points lower than its best level of the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.32 at 467.79. On the NYSE, activity was brisk, with 337m shares traded by the close. Investors were even more restrained in the other markets. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.89 at 767.89, and the American SE composite 0.07 ahead at 458.57. Within 10 minutes of the opening the Dow industrials had surged by more than 50 points, triggering the NYSE's 'uptick' restrictions on programme-guided buying for the second time this week. Soon afterwards, the index began to recede, slowly at first, but at more determined pace towards the final bell. The initial impetus higher was the Labor Department's announcement of a 0.5 per cent decline in September producer prices. Economists had expected a slight 0.1 per cent gain. The slump in prices reinforced the growing sense that the economy was not accelerating fast enough to warrant an immediate tightening of monetary policy. Bond prices leapt on the news and held on to most of their gains. In equities, the apparent shift in sentiment late in the day suggested investors remained cautious ahead of today's data on consumer prices, retail sales and industrial production. Among individual issues, paper and pulp stocks rebounded after two days of weakness. International Paper recovered Dollars 1 to Dollars 77 3/4 after news of a lacklustre third-quarter performance pulled its share price down earlier in the week. Georgia-Pacific added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 77 1/2 and Champion International was marked up Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 5/8 . Both posted better-than-expected earnings. Though most of the earnings news was strong, there were some disappointments. Perhaps the biggest was Bausch&amp;Lomb, down Dollars 4 1/2 at Dollars 34 1/8 . Investors wiped 11 per cent off the share valuation of the optics company after it revealed net income of 13 cents a share, against 93 cents a year ago. In banking, JP Morgan added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 61 5/8 after announcing a profit level which slightly exceeded expectations. Bank of New York, which handily beat the forecasts, gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 3/4 . CBS back pedalled for the second day running. The day after the media group posted poor results, its share price dropped a further Dollars 20 1/2 to Dollars 309 1/2, thanks in part to a downgrading by Prudential Securities. The Nasdaq managed to stay in positive territory in spite of a Dollars 1 decline in Apple Computer to Dollars 41 1/8. Biogen was down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 45 5/8. But Altera, an integrated circuit maker, jumped 5 5/8 to Dollars 33 5/8 on upgradings by two Wall Street securities houses.</p>

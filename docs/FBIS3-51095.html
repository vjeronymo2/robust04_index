			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Final part of "nonbroadcast portion" of interview with </F> Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly  of the People's Government, ANPP, by reporters Julio Batista and  Rosa Maria Godoy on the "I Have an Opinion" program, on 10  January in Havana -- recorded]    [Text] [Batista] Then, you do believe that because of this  situation you have been explaining regarding the complex  problems the country, the government, and the National Assembly  [ANPP] have to confront....[changes thought] Do you believe that  in the current conditions we are experiencing, all these  difficulties, problems, and efforts bring the voters closer to  the parliamentary system or alienate them?    [Alarcon] I believe it brings them closer and has to do so  more each day. Unfortunately, in this world where interrelations  are growing, models are transposed, and concepts and  preconceptions are disseminated by the movies and other means of  mass media communication, many times when one thinks of a  parliament, what comes to mind is some gentleman giving an  address, or a group of people who debate issues, talk, are  experienced in rhetoric, are persuasive, etc. This is purely a  formal aspect, and I would add adjectival aspect, of what a  parliament should be from the socialist or people's point of  view.    This is why I insist in calling it a system of the people's  government, because the key is precisely to attain, as much as  possible, the people's direct participation in their government.  This is why out there some people still speak of the so-called  representative democracy, which is a fiction because it limits  the actual role of the people the moment they elect a  representative to congress or a parliament. Many times, as you  know, the one who wins the election is the one who has the  greatest financial resources, the one who can afford television  advertising, the one who can buy votes; in the end, the one who  has the most power. How many times are the people part of the  work of that legislator? How many times do the people have  anything to do with what the legislator does? They see their  legislator on television giving an occasional address or hear  from him during an electoral campaign.    In our case, we seek, have to seek, and can achieve,  precisely because of the characteristics of our society, making  the relationship between the voters and their government or  parliamentary system as constant as possible, as daily as  possible, as real and natural as possible. I believe that this  is possible -- pardon the redundancy. It is possible in a true  socialism and it is impossible in other societies.    [Batista] I would like to discuss the issue of the  forthcoming union meetings. You were saying that the delegates  have been asked to get involved in these meetings, to be  present. They are going to be very busy. Many people wonder,  because they see that the ANPP meets twice a year for two days  of work at the Convention Center. However, our delegates are not  professionals; they are comrades who have other jobs. With this  I want to say that our people have to understand that that  delegate is a working individual and that the ANPP works all  year long. I would like you to expand on this.    [Alarcon] I believe that what you say is true. Many examples  could be given, such as when the ANPP discussed the issue of  energy on June. Prior to this, we had created a special  committee to oversee that issue. This committee organized a  series of nationwide activities, not only the meetings it held  as a committee -- the member delegates of that committee -- but  an entire program of meetings of the provincial and municipal  assemblies, and also at the People's Council level. Among their  activities nationwide -- not every deputy visited every site --  they visited various production centers and major institutions  involved with the issue of energy. They held a total of 8,081  visits where they met with workers, enterprise managers,  technicians, etc., to discuss local energy problems. Figure out  how many hours, how many work days those delegates spent on this  issue before the ANPP spent one work day on its discussion. I  believe that, in terms of man-hours, it is more than any  discussion on any issue by any parliament in the world.    [Batista] There is one thing that worries me. You have been  explaining, as did Pedro Ross, that we need these debates on  economic problems. What level of information are the masses, the  workers going to receive about the main aspects to be discussed?  Or are they going to find out at the time of the meeting? Is  there a plan to begin to disseminate information to the people  on the main issues to be discussed? How is this going to be  carried out?    [Alarcon] The comrades of the labor movement are preparing  to  organize this program from their perspective. We believe that it  is important for each of these debates to be accompanied or  preceded by information presented by their respective  leaderships: in other words, a series of facts or opinions by  the leaders at each work center, which should be explained to  the workers, logically, prior to the beginning of the process of  assembly. This is a very specific, locally oriented effort.  There are going to be tens of thousands of these meetings.  However, they should be properly organized. We have insisted on  this to the delegates. It is not a matter of meeting for the  sake of meeting but to prepare the meeting well, adequately to  collect the information and necessary data so that everyone has  a better chance to understand the specific situation they are  going to debate.    [Godoy] Has a date been set for the special meeting of the  ANPP to continue discussion of the national finance situation?    [Alarcon] The response is short: Not yet. [laughter]    [Batista] Finally: At times one reads in the newspapers and  hears in the radio that 1993 was the worst year of the special  period. Does this means that 1994 will be better? What is your  opinion?    [Alarcon] I believe we should make every effort to ensure  that 1993 keeps its title in history as the worst year, the most  difficult we have ever confronted. I believe that it lies within  us, with the exception of natural calamities or unforeseen  events. We live in a world full of new and unpredictable  problems; but assuming that nothing extraordinary of a natural  or manmade nature occurs, we are able to affirm that beginning  with 1994, modestly, step by step, without spectacular results,  we will be able to reverse the situation Cuba has been facing.    I believe that there are many fields in which this is  possible. Once again I must mention the sugarcane harvest. It is  possible to achieve a more efficient harvest through the  committed efforts of all those involved in this activity and  everyone not directly involved but who can support it. There is  the whole movement of the sugarcane and nonsugarcane farming  cooperatives and the entire effort to increase food and cane  production through them. There are also efforts to reduce the  budget deficit, the subsidies that these sectors receive, and  thereby to help heal our national finances. This is another  specific example. There are also prospects in other sectors in  which the Cuba is making progress, such as tourism which is  growing at a faster rate than that seen in other countries  catering to tourism. In other words, there are real  possibilities within our reach.    However, the key to ensuring that 1994 will be better lies  in  our will to achieve this and in everyone's capacity to organize  and channel that will. I believe that we have returned to the  same theme, the underlying theme, the core issue of our entire  conversation. The key lies in organizing and channeling the  collective effort of the people in specific and general terms in  each place; the trust in that people, which has provided  abundant proof of its capacity to resist. I am convinced that  when the end of 1994 approaches, we will be able to look back  and see that through our efforts we are effectively overcoming  the crisis.</p>

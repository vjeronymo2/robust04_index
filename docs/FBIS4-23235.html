			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita has returned  home from Gabon, where he has just completed a five-day working  visit. This was the first visit abroad by the head of the  government who, in addition to discussions with the Gabonese  authorities, met with the Malian community there. Mr. Keita,  who returned home yesterday afternoon, stated, while taking  stock of his visit, that the behavior of the Malian community in  Gabon honors us. However, he added, the emigration of Malians  to that country poses a number of problems; there is a need to  reconsider our emigration policy.</p>

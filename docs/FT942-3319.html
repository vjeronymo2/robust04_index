			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Fugitive Botnar paid Pounds 3.8m - up 2,831% Mr Octav Botnar, the chairman of Nissan UK for whom an arrest warrant has been outstanding for the past two-and-a-half years, was paid Pounds 3.81m last year. The emoluments - representing a 2,831 per cent rise from his previous year's pay of Pounds 130,000 - were for his role as chairman of Automotive Financial Group Holdings, which owns AFG, one of the UK's biggest motor dealers. Of the total remuneration, Pounds 3.7m is described as a 'bonus' paid by AFG. The figures appear in the latest annual report filed by AFGH for the year to July 1993. During the year AFGH's pre-tax profits fell by 73 per cent to Pounds 11m, from Pounds 40.5m. Turnover was down 23 per cent at Pounds 419.9m. An arrest warrant was issued in January 1992 for Mr Botnar, 80, who is alleged to have been the principal conspirator in the largest corporation tax fraud in UK history. The Inland Revenue was cheated of Pounds 55m by Nissan UK, the Botnar subsidiary which had imported and distributed Nissan cars until Nissan took over the role itself. In the most recent information filed at Companies House, Mr Botnar's 'usual residential address' is listed as Columbia Drive, Worthing, West Sussex, the headquarters of AFGH. He has failed to return to the UK for two-and-a-half years, preferring to live in Switzerland in a villa near Geneva. During his absence, two of his former colleagues have been jailed for their part in the fraud. Mr Michael Hunt, former Nissan UK managing director, was sentenced last summer to eight years and last month lost an appeal against conviction and sentence. Since he went to prison, Mr Hunt has become eligible to receive Pounds 1.06m as his latest dividend payment on his 10.6 per cent stake in AFGH. The Inland Revenue is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m from Nissan UK, which it claims is the company's tax liability for a period of 17 years in which it alleges that the company's profits were understated. Nissan UK has appealed against the tax assessment, and this appeal is expected to be heard by the Special Commissioners of the Inland Revenue later this year. The ultimate parent company of AFGH is the Bahamas-based GF International Finance and Investments, while Nissan UK Holdings' ultimate parent is the Panama-based European Motor Vehicles Corporation. Mr Botnar is chairman of both companies. AFG's results, Page 26</p>

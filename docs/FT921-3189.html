			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Belgian Bonds: Focus on government's debt-cutting plans THE BELGIAN bond market is holding its breath until it sees how the new government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene plans to cut the overhang of public debt. This is still a record among OECD countries at 130 per cent of gross national product (GNP). Mr Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister who stays on in the new government, created a flutter in the financial markets last week when he suggested Belgian rates might come down a bit. The National Bank promptly quashed the idea, saying even a slight cut would have to await similar developments in Germany and the Netherlands. For two years, Belgium has kept its franc closer to the German and Dutch currencies than the European monetary system requires. Mr Maystadt was tempted into his remarks by a desire to make political capital out of the improvement in most of the fundamentals of the Belgian economy. In particular, inflation sank in February to a year-on-year rate of 2.3 per cent, or 2 percentage points lower than the price trend in both Germany and the Netherlands. Wage moderation is accentuated by the indexation system when inflation is on the way down. Belgium's current account surplus continues in steady surplus of around 2 per cent of GNP. The only glaring black spot remains public debt, which is where the bond market, handling almost exclusively government paper, comes in. Recent Maystadt reforms have vastly improved this market. The government, which issued BFr930bn debt last year, is getting a better deal by submitting a new range of linear bonds to auction rather than paying fat commissions to a cosy consortium of underwriting banks. The government's first 15-year bond a few weeks ago was well received. The spread on 10-year bonds over the German bund equivalent had fallen to 80 basis points by the end of last week, close to its historic low last summer. The market has recovered after the Maastricht agreement on European monetary union boosted hopes of further convergence. The government's indebtedness still puts a credit risk premium on its borrowings. But Mr Peter Praet, Generale de Banque's chief economist, sees change on the way. 'There are signs the new government plans quite a drastic fiscal package which, if credible, could see the spread coming down to 60 basis points.' The catalyst, as elsewhere in Europe, is the Maastricht agreement that governments can only qualify for monetary union by bringing their total debt down towards 60 per cent of GNP and annual budget deficits down to 3 per cent of GNP. The Dehaene government has committed itself to trying to hit these targets by 1996. Belgium still has miles to go before it rests. Even if the budget deficit - 6.3 per cent of GNP last year - were reduced to 3 per cent by 1996, its debt would then still be 110 per cent of GNP, and 80 per cent by 2006, according to one authoritative estimate.</p>

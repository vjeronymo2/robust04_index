Last year, Shanghai increased its exchange capacity  for cellular telephone communications by 40,000. Shanghai's  investment in cellular communications this year will double that  of last year's and the exchange capacity will increase three  times.    Shanghai opened China's first public cellular telephone  network in July 1982. It was only in 1992 that the subscribers  to the cellular phone system surpassed 10,000. Last year, the A  and B exchange capacity reached 60,000 and the number of  subscribers increased to 30,000, thanks to four months of  stepped-up efforts made by the staff members and workers at the  Shanghai Municipal Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau.    At present, the number of subscribers to the two Shanghai  cellular networks totals 44,890. Starting this year, Shanghai  will provide additional cellular phone services, including the  offering of telephone rambling service [dian hua man you ye wu  7192 6114 3355 3266 2814 0523] in cooperation with neighboring  Jiangsu and Zhejiang, as well as transfer call service, and busy  transfer call services.</p>

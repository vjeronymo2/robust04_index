A finger has been pointed at Iran in Shapur  Bakhtiar's murder, the shah's former prime minister, who was  assassinated on 6 August 1991 in his peaceful villa Suresne, on  the outskirts of Paris. This ultrasensitive dossier, which  after two years of investigation consists of several thousand  pages, should soon come to a conclusion. Within the next few  days, the Chamber of Accusation of the Paris Court of Appeal,  which met last Monday, will make a decision: Either to remand  the suspects accused in the assassination of the Tehran regime's  opponent to the Assize Court; to request more information; or to  simply shelve the case on the basis of a nonsuit ruling. In  theory, nine suspects, all Iranians or of Iranian origin, could  be called to the dock. In theory, because only three of them  were arrested and imprisoned in France. Of all the members of  the commando unit that, on 6 August 1991 evaded the vigilance of  the CRS [Republican Security Police] and entered Bakhtiar's  residence, the police could catch only Ali Rad Vakili [name as  published] after a long chase through Paris, Lyon, Sallances,  Valence, Annecy, and Lake Geneva. The other defendants, against  whom international warrants for arrest have been issued, are  still on the run or back in Iran.    Judge Bruguiere's preliminary investigation and the 177-page  final charge by the public prosecutor link the Tehran mullahs.  The document of the antiterrorist section abounds with details.  It incriminates no fewer than three Iranian ministries: the  Telecommunications Ministry, an adviser of which allegedly  helped two of the murderers get visas; the Foreign Ministry, one  of whose officers, Zeynal Sarhadi [name as published], is  accused of having supervised the commando members' escape from  France; and the Intelligence and Security Ministry, which is  mentioned several times in the public prosecutor's report.  [Information Minister] 'Ali Fallahian himself, vice minister at  the time of the murder, appears to have been one of those who  ordered Bakhtiar's murder. His name and his private telephone  number were found in the diary of one of the defendants  imprisoned in France, a former journalist and correspondent in  Paris. The conclusions of the Public Prosecution, written down  black on white in its charge, are very meaningful: "The Iranian  intelligence services effectively participated in the operation  of the criminal association" set up to murder the former prime  minister who was ousted by Imam Khomeyni in 1979. More evidence  needed in support of these conclusions? The dossier contains a  telephone number linked to Tehran's special services and which  was called several times by some of the accused. And the  dossier provides a very detailed description of a structured  logistical network between Iran, France, Switzerland, and  Turkey, which was uncovered with the help of telephone listings.  Tehran is still denying these accusations. [passage omitted]</p>

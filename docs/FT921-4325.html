			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): NatWest signals a tough line over pay NATIONAL Westminster Bank has indicated that it intends to take a tough line in pay negotiations with 76,000 UK staff this year by making an opening offer of 2 per cent. Although the bank is also increasing incentives for staff to perform well, unions say the total package is worth less than 2.5 per cent, lower than packages offered by Barclays and Lloyds banks to their employees. Mr Bob Carthy, general secretary of the NatWest Staff Association, said the offer was extremely disappointing. It followed a year in which staff had to contend with uncertainty about their future employment and changes in working practices, he said. Settlements at the big four clearing banks traditionally influence the outcome of pay talks at many other financial services companies. Before yesterday's publication of the NatWest offer Barclays had proposed a deal for its staff worth a little more than 3 per cent. Lloyds increased salaries for staff by 4 per cent from January 1, three months ahead of the settlement date, partly in an attempt to settle a dispute over a restructuring of pay scales. Under the NatWest offer, to be implemented from April 1, high-performing staff will receive up to 3.5 per cent in new money. This is because the bank is extending increments for outstanding performers, paid in addition to the general offer, from 6 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Further meetings between the bank and the staff association and Bifu, the financial services union, are planned. Union leaders believe an increase in the offer is likely, but say there are no signs that the movement will be substantial. The bank described its offer as respectable. The staff association has asked for a 5 per cent rise. The latest reported inflation rate, for the year to January, was 4.1 per cent.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / BAe cuts further 400 arms jobs Cuts in the British Aerospace group continued with the announcement yesterday of more than 400 additional job losses at its Royal Ordnance munitions and guns division, David White writes. The reduction at Royal Ordnance's Chorley factory in Lancashire brings the total of BAe job cuts announced in the past two weeks to about 1,760. Six other plants in the group's civil aircraft and guided weapons divisions were affected by the recent job cuts. The latest measure brought sharp condemnation from unions and the Labour party, which reiterated its call for a defence diversification agency to cope with the impact of declining military business. Royal Ordnance has been struggling to find export orders to offset reduced UK requirements. The company said the Chorley site would cease its current activity of filling, assembling and packing large-calibre ammunition, with the loss of 421 jobs by the end of next year. This part of Royal Ordnance's business will be concentrated at its Glencoed plant in south Wales. The cut will leave about 140 employees at the Chorley plant itself, in addition to about 400 headquarters staff. Royal Ordnance's total UK workforce, spread over 12 sites, will be reduced to about 4,500 compared with 16,000 when the government sold the company to BAe in 1987. A further 1,000 are employed in Germany. The latest cut comes in spite of the award last October of five-year ammunition contracts from the Ministry of Defence, worth about Pounds 200m.</p>

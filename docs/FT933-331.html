			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Losses deepen at Snecma in first half SNECMA, the French state-owned aircraft engine manufacturer, yesterday reported increased net losses for the first half of 1993 and said it had completed a plan to raise FFr759m (Dollars 133.15m) in new capital. The new capital will come principally from the French government. But United Technologies Corporation of the US, which controls Pratt and Whitney, the US aero-engine group, will also subscribe in order to maintain its share of Snecma at 1.73 per cent. Pratt and Whitney and Snecma have co-operated on several projects since the US group took its stake in the French company. Co-operation has centred on engines for regional transport and small business jets. Snecma blamed the rise in six-month net losses - from FFr302.7m to FFr351m - on the depressed state of the civil and military aviation markets. Sales fell sharply, declining by 18 per cent to FFr5bn. The deterioration in the international aviation market was shown in figures issued by Snecma. These showed the average production of CFM56 civil aviation engines, which was 880 in 1991 and 770 in 1992, is expected to be around 500 in 1993 and to decrease over the next few years. Faced with the continued weakness in international markets, the group said that there was unlikely to be a significant difference in performance in the current half year. The group is expected to report a net loss for 1993 as a whole. However, a spokesman for Snecma said that the decline in the net result disguised a strong performance in operating profits, which recovered from a loss last year of FFr46m to a surplus of FFr125m. According to Snecma, this recovery reflected the impact of rationalisation and cost-cutting measures. Like many French public sector companies, the group is in the middle of a cost-cutting plan.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SOFTWARE TOOLWORKS MOVES HEADQUARTERS  </P> <P> Software Toolworks Inc., a rapidly growing maker of video games and  personal-computer software, moved its headquarters from Chatsworth to Novato.  </P> <P> Besides its corporate staff, the company also moved its  research-and-development operations, and overall about 75 employees were  transferred, Chairman Les Crane said. But the company left its duplicating,  printing and packaging operations in Chatsworth, he said.  </P> <P> Software Toolworks chose Novato, situated north of San Francisco in Marin  County, because "the pool of available manpower is rich and deep and we felt  the environment was perhaps more conducive to creative programming," Crane  said.  </P></p>

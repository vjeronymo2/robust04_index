			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENNIS PATRICK RESIGNS AS FCC CHAIRMAN  </P> <P> The young, personable Los Angeles attorney who former President Ronald Reagan  appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission two years ago  surprised the broadcast industry Wednesday by resigning, effective as soon as  President George Bush finds a replacement.  </P> <P> In a three-page letter he hand-carried late Tuesday to White House personnel  director Chase Untermeyer, FCC chairman Dennis R. Patrick outlined what he  believed to be the outstanding achievements of the commission under his  leadership, but gave no reason for his departure.  </P> <P> During a 30-minute press conference Wednesday afternoon in Washington, Patrick  reiterated his accomplishments (repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, putting caps  on American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s long-distance rates and  deregulation of the broadcast industry) and said only that he planned to return  to the private sector. In his upcoming job search, Patrick said, "I haven't  ruled out either coast or any given profession," except for politics.  </P> <P> Though some broadcasters speculated that Patrick might resign with the change  in administrations, the 37-year-old attorney affirmed as little as two months  ago that he had no intention of quitting the five-seat commission to which he  was first appointed in 1983. He was named chairman in 1987, replacing Mark S.  Fowler, another Reagan appointee. Prior to his FCC appointment, Patrick had  been a White House aide.  </P> <P> Some veteran broadcasters suggested Wednesday that Patrick quit, in part,  because of his frequent battles with Congress over his deregulatory approach --  an approach that has only lukewarmn support in Bush's "kinder, gentler"  Administration.  </P> <P> It was a suggestion Patrick heatedly denied.  </P> <P> "The Bush Administration has really been very supportive," Patrick told The  Times after his press conference. "I sort of believe what Ronald Reagan used to  say: If you stay in government too long, you become part of the problem."  </P> <P> He said that the recent defeat of a 51% pay hike for federal officials was a  factor in his decision to leave, but not the deciding factor. Last month,  Patrick's fellow commissioner James Quello publicly complained about the defeat  of the pay raise when both the Senate and Congress voted it does on Feb. 7. As  chairman, Patrick currently earns $82,500 a year and Quello's annual salary is  $80,700.  </P> <P> "I expect I could earn substantially more in the private sector but one doesn't  serve in government for economic reasons," Patrick said.  </P> <P> Patrick said his biggest accomplishment was the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine  -- the 40-year-old FCC policy that requires broadcasters to air programs on  controversial issues, but he attached equal importance to the commission's  recent action on phone companies' long-distance rates. He said the lid that the  commission has put on rates will eventually save consumers about $900 million a  year.  </P> <P> Under both Patrick and Fowler, the commission has moved to change the way  broadcasters are licensed and has generally followed a deregulatory approach  that became a hallmark of most federal agencies during the early Reagan years.  Critics have argued that too much deregulation has led to large, longterm  problems in a number of industries, ranging from airlines to savings and loans  to television and radio.  </P> <P> But Patrick said he believes the competition that deregulation spawned was  healthy.  </P> <P> "I don't think we should draw any quick conclusions on the Bush Administration.  I don't think we'll see any substantial stop in the flow of these issues  because we can't . . . partially because the evolution of competition will  drive the process."  </P> <P> Since early last year, the commission has had only three members: Patrick,  Quello and commissioner Patricia Dennis. With Patrick's announcement, there are  now three vacancies, giving Bush the opportunity to virtually create a whole  new commission. Some sources have blamed congressional displeasure with Patrick  as the primary reason that appointments to the commission have been held up.  </P> <P> Patrick conceded that he will probably be remembered, in part, for his strong  stand on broadcast indecency -- an issue that blossomed the week after he took  over from Fowler in April of 1987 when the commission censured three radio  stations for allegedly broadcasting indecent material. Since then, the  commission has actively pursued complaints about obscenity and indecent use of  sexually explicit language and pictures on television and radio. One Kansas  City TV station was fined $2,000 for broadcasting the R-rated comedy "Private  Lessons" during prime time, but the station has never paid the fine.  </P> <P> "We've certainly taken a more active enforcement role in the past three years,"  Patrick said. "We've also taken some enforcement actions against dial-a-porn  companies. I think that will be part of my legacy and I don't apologize."  </P> <P> A legal challenge against the FCC's enforcement of a recent federal  anti-indecency law was filed late last year by a coalition of broadcast and  entertainment industry organizations and is currently pending before the  federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

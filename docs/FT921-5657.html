			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market report Gold market jitters yesterday followed the Indian government's weekend Budget statement which announced its intention to tap that country's huge private gold holdings, dealers said. Middle East selling sent gold down to Dollars 349.75 a troy ounce in London yesterday morning. It recovered later to Dollars 350.85, down Dollars 2.35 an ounce from Friday's close. Mr Andy Smith, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland, said that the proposals, ie. to lift a ban on gold imports and allow Indians living or travelling abroad to import 5 kg of gold, were likely to hit the Bombay premium for smuggled gold. The situation was reminiscent of 1990 when gold prices plunged Dollars 23 an ounce on Middle Eastern selling within seven days of that year's Indian budget.  That removed controls on the internal market and swiftly sent local prices down 10 per cent. About 200 tonnes of gold are smuggled into India each year to avoid import restrictions, mainly through Dubai. Mr Smith said that, while in the longer term India's budget proposals were an incentive to buy gold, in the short term many Middle East suppliers faced reduced margins on their Indian sales and might be tempted to sell.

Their  presence confirms the firm determination of the people of Upper  Huallaga (Tingo Maria-Tocache) to find reconciliation, peace,  and development.    The repented subversives, some with their respective  families, were welcomed by the commanders, officers, and  soldiers of Antisubversive Battalion No. 313, which is  headquartered in "Los Laureles" Fort, on the outskirts of this  city.    In increasingly frequent and massive numbers, waves of  townspeople are coming here to choose the path of pacification,  after having mistakenly joined the Shining Path, or after being  forced, or even abducted, to cooperate with this criminal  terrorist organization.    They explained to LA REPUBLICA today that before taking this  step, most of them had previously contacted peasant self-defense  patrol members of their respective localities.    That is why military authorities attach priority to the  organization of the self-defense patrols and the self-defense  committees in the towns of Upper Huallaga.    Some repented subversives try to make contact with military  authorities in the Emergency Zone, in the antisubversive  barracks of Tingo Maria and Tocache. Relatives, friends, or  some other spokesman mediate on their behalf, seeking guarantees  in exchange for their surrender.    Today we saw the new group of repentant people being  properly  registered at "Los Laureles" Fort. They will then be submitted  to a thorough medical checkup, including women and children.    All pregnant women, and mothers and babies are transferred  to  a Health Ministry hospital for specialized care.    The people will remain at "Los Laureles" Fort as long as  necessary to be monitored, to receive medical treatment, to  obtain the necessary documents to legalize their status as free  citizens who are not wanted by the courts and -- in some cases  -- to receive military protection as refugees.    Most of the ones from this central jungle area decide to  return almost immediately to their towns, back to their farm  work and to the self-defense committees that now fight the  Shining Path cells, which are desperately and unsuccessfully  trying to reorganize.    Today's arrival of the 100 repented subversives coincided  with the conclusion of a military training cycle of 30 peasant  self-defense patrol members from various peasant communities.    Some of these patrol members are former subversives who  repented and authorities of their respective localities who have  been courageous enough to accept the challenge, refusing to  yield to terrorist extortion and threats.    These authorities have actively organized self-defense  committees and peasant patrols to preserve order in the towns.  They comprise volunteers of a community who are supplied with  shotguns and machetes, and who are trained by the military.  They protect civilians.    A self-defense committee, which includes the peasant patrol,  has a much broader mission. It protects the community and, at  the same time, participates in reconstruction work, in the  construction of civil works for the community, and in social  support programs to promote development.    EP [Peruvian Army] Commander Javier Riva Ramirez is the  political-military commander of Leoncio Prado (Tingo Maria)  Province and chief of Antisubversive Battalion No. 313  headquartered in "Los Laureles." Today, he supervised the  incorporation of 100 peasant patrol members and the peasant  patrol members' training session.    Commander Riva reported that nine peasant patrols have so  far  been organized and trained in Leoncio Prado Province, the  capital of which is Tingo Maria.    Some 900 duly trained men, whom the government has supplied  with shotguns, are members of those patrols.    "To avoid infiltration by subversives, each peasant patrol  candidate is submitted to examinations and careful evaluations  that begin in their own community," Commander Riva said.    He described the following steps of the evaluation and  selection:     -  Peasant patrol candidates are first studied and selected  by the authorities and by the people of each community. The  names are then proposed before the military authorities of the  Huallaga Front.    -  The applicants then report to the respective  military barracks where a team of psychologists, psychiatrists,  lawyers, and other specialists will study their personalities,  backgrounds, and physical and mental capacity.    -  One these exams  are passed, applicants are ready to receive military  training.    -  Instructors teach patrol members defensive tactics in  order to efficiently patrol their towns, the theory of the  operation of firearms, practice with shotguns, and courage tests  in a combat range and in the field.    Under a burning sun, and in extremely muddy conditions  following recent torrential rains, LA REPUBLICA today watched a  military training session of 30 peasant patrol members.    It was the last session of their training; at 1100 they  attended a special ceremony at "Los Laureles" fort.    At that civic patriotic ceremony, hundreds of peasant  patrol members and a large number of repented subversives swore  allegiance to the Peruvian flag. They also swore to fight  terrorism and subversion so as to consolidate regional and  national peace.    At the shotgun exercises, the applicants today obtained  satisfactory grades. The instructors said that some are quite  good.    Instructors are especially interested in teaching patrol  members a defensive, rather than offensive, spirit.    An instructors told them: "Bear in mind that your mission  is, above all, to guarantee peace and order in your communities.  We are fed up with war and useless shedding of blood.  Consequently, be very careful when using the arms that we are  giving you today."    He added: "Do not forget that arms can help to protect many  lives. They must be used only when necessary and against  terrorist criminals who threaten our towns and our families."    When the patrol members fired their arms, the instructors  especially emphasized precautions for the use of shotguns to  avoid endangering innocent lives.    Commander Javier Riva told LA REPUBLICA that the new  pacification strategy in Upper Huallaga involves the creation of  the largest number of self-defense committees and the largest  number of repented subversives.    Commander Riva said: "This is linked with a broad program of  social support for people rescued from the Shining Path yoke."    He announced that soon his office will -- in coordination  with the commander of the Huallaga Front, General Alfredo  Rodriguez -- implement far-reaching agreements with the Special  Upper Huallaga Project and with Foncodes [National Compensation  and Social Development Fund], to find jobs and help the repented  subversives, who are now striving to rejoin society.</p>

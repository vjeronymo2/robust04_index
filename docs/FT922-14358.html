			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / World Trade News: Trade accord vital, says ICI chief SUCCESSFUL completion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations on world trade liberalisation is 'the key prerequisite' for future growth in the international chemicals industry, according to Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI. He challenged recent forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that the world economy would soon emerge from recession, insisting it would take until the second half of the 1990s for strong growth to return. This would lift world production of chemicals by 50 per cent to about Dollars 1,500bn (in today's dollars) (Pounds 860bn) by the year 2000, he predicted. Strongest growth would come in the Asia Pacific region, which is set to become as important a market as Europe, and in eastern Europe, which is at present a virgin market, but would rise to Dollars 150bn by 2000. Without trade reforms, output would fall 'well short' of these predictions. 'In my 35 years' experience of international business, I have never seen greater uncertainties about the short-to-medium term outlook,' Sir Denys told a Paris conference on world trade and investment. 'Surely it is completely unacceptable, with 85 per cent of the many complex trade problems already settled (in the Uruguay Round) that the agricultural issues which require to be resolved should be allowed to jeopardise the 93 per cent of the world trade not related to agriculture.' His comments follow a call last week by the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) for swift resolution of the trade talks, which began in 1986 and have been stalled for 15 months. Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, conceded recently that the Easter deadline for completion of the talks is likely to be missed. The ICCA, claiming to represent 70 per cent of the world chemicals industry, says the sector is already affected by delay. 'The industry is global and depends on open markets and agreed international rules,' it said and warned of emerging bilateralism and discriminatory trade regimes if the Uruguay Round failed. The chemicals industry, along with pharmaceuticals, has offered worldwide harmonisation of tariffs at 5.5 to 6.5 per cent, and the abolition of non-tariff barriers. In exchange, wants more protection for patents, and more freedom to invest internationally. This need is well illustrated by ICI, one of the world's largest chemicals companies, which has more than half of its annual sales of Ecu 18bn (Pounds 13bn) outside Europe, manufactures in 40 countries, and has sales operations in 150. After slow growth in the first half of the 1990s, Sir Denys sees chemicals output growing to about Dollars 500bn by the end of the decade - a rise of about 39 per cent from Dollars 360bn in 1991. The US will grow by a more modest 30 per cent, from Dollars 270bn in 1991 to Dollars 350bn. Portugal, which holds the EC presidency, will call a meeting of EC ministers on Gatt talks before Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, EC commission president, visit Washington on April 22, Reuter reports from Lisbon.</p>

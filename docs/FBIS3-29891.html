Kim said, "On May 13 last year, I ruminated on the  historical  meaning of `the Kwangju democratization movement' and announced  government measures to relieve the pain of Kwangju citizens and  retrieve their honor through a special statement. The mayor  should see to it that the city seeks a council of citizens and  related organizations to complete the government's measures as  soon as possible."    On May 18, 1980, hundreds of thousands of Kwangju residents  resisted then-General Chon Tu-hwan's attempt to grab power and  hundreds were killed by special soldiers.    Kim also voiced hope that the people of Kwangju will strive  to create an international city of science and industry, leading  other cities in the 21st century.    Meanwhile, Kim visited a machine tool factory and told  workers there over lunch that he was pushing ahead with change  and reform with all his might.    In an impromptu address, he said, "I will never neglect  change and reform, and the rooting out of irregularities and  corruption during my term of office."</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Power of private labels In public, many manufacturers of branded products still treat retailers' private-label rivals with disdain. Yet, in the UK at least, private-label production has become so big a business that few companies can afford to turn up their noses. A recent survey* by Conzept International, a branding consultancy, of 200 UK-based consumer goods producers - half of them in the food and drink industry - finds that fewer than a fifth derive less than 10 per cent of their total revenues from private-label manufacturing. Forty-four per cent of the companies said the business provided at least 40 per cent of their revenues. Fifty-eight per cent said it was a bigger share of their total sales than five years ago. The main reason for private-label manufacturing, mentioned by 30 per cent of companies, is to provide greater security for continuing sales revenue, while 27 per cent cited the opportunity to cover fixed costs. The companies divided almost equally between those for which private-label business consisted of producing cheaper copies of branded products or basic products at the lowest possible price and those which aimed to make unique products. The survey underlines how far private-label business gives retailers the whip hand in marketing decisions which manufacturers of branded products have traditionally controlled. It finds retailers are more important than manufacturers in controlling retail prices, advertising and promotion, packaging and design and the size of product ranges. Manufacturers still wield more control than retailers in the areas of distribution, delivery and product programming. Three-quarters of private-label manufacturers said their most important market was the UK. But 18 per cent said it was western Europe - which 48 per cent named as their second most important market. * Conzept International, Riverview House, London W6 9AR. Tel: 081-748 7874</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Further write-offs expected at IBM IBM is expected to announce another big write-off to cover further workforce cuts when it reports its second-quarter results later this month. The US computer company, still struggling to recover from its worst ever sales slump, will also provide an updated estimate of the number of jobs it expects to eliminate this year. Financial analysts are predicting that IBM could double its original projection of 25,000 job reductions for 1993. 'We expect a write-off of at least Dollars 1.8bn to Dollars 2.4bn for an additional 15,000 to 20,000 personnel reductions above the 25,000 estimate given last December,' said Mr John Jones of Salomon Brothers. Asset write-offs could increase the write-off by another Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn, Mr Jones predicted. IBM declined to comment on published estimates of job cuts, but reiterated earlier statements that the final reduction figures for the year were expected to be well above 25,000. Mr Lou Gerstner, new IBM chairman and chief executive, who joined the company on April 1, is expected to take a more aggressive approach than his predecessor, Mr John Akers, toward reducing costs. Last year, IBM reduced its workforce by over 40,000, to about 300,000, down from a high of 405,000 at the end of 1985. Faced with large write-offs for redundancies, IBM may again reduce its dividend, some analysts believe.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Small company share market planned A group of venture capitalists, merchant banks and stockbrokers intends to set up a new exchange for trading the shares of small, entrepreneurial companies to compete with the London Stock Exchange's official list. The move comes after the stock exchange apparently rejected a suggestion from the City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) that it operate the new market itself. According to Cisco, the Enterprise Market could attract capital from large and private investors previously inactive in that sector. Cisco forecasts that the new market could have 200 listed companies two years after inception. It hopes to attract at least five market makers and 20 to 30 stockbrokers specialising in small company shares. Cisco's founders include stockbrokers Singer &amp; Friedlander and Beeson Gregory, venture capitalists Apax Partners and accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. Over the next 10 weeks Cisco plans to conduct a tender process to find a commercial operator for the computer network and related services. Possible operators are Nasdaq of the US, Reuters and British Telecom. Initial costs are estimated at Pounds 5m and finance will come from a mix of venture capital, institutional investment and bank loans. Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco, said the concept of a new market had also been endorsed by the European Venture Capital Association whose members - managers of venture capital portfolios - would be prepared to list the shares of their own investments. In April last year the stock exchange appointed a working party after announcing it would close its Unlisted Securities Market for small company shares and attempt to find a successor. The exchange's board considered a report in December from the working party that recommended the establishment of the Enterprise Market. However, the board decided that further investigations were needed and commissioned research from Mori to be completed by April. Cisco believes that small companies get short shrift from the stock exchange whose members derive most profits from making markets in the shares of the largest companies. The stock exchange said it planned to go ahead with its market research.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Scholes accepts Pounds 96m bid by Hanson Scholes Group, the UK maker of electrical installation equipment, yesterday agreed to a Pounds 96.1m bid from Hanson, more than 20 years after it first held merger talks with the conglomerate's Crabtree subsidiary. The takeover combines two leading domestic suppliers in a market where continental European manufacturers are making inroads. Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, said: 'It is in line with our strategy of concentrating on major business sectors where there is scope to build or consolidate market superiority.' He predicted that Hanson would make more disposals this year but ruled out a share issue. 'We still think our equity is on the cheap side.' Hanson is offering 250p cash per Scholes share, equivalent to 32 1/2 times earnings in the year to June 1993. Scholes' shares rose 57p to 250p. Scholes has had merger talks with most of its rivals and in 1987 fought off a 275p a share bid from Delta. Mr Bill Riches, chairman, said: 'The commercial logic was always easy to establish. The problem was usually that both sides wanted to be the boss.' The logic has become even clearer in recent years as electrical circuit breakers, based on European standards and technology, have supplanted traditional British Standard fusegear. Scholes makes circuit breakers based on technology from ABB, the Swiss-Swedish giant which has a 4.5 per cent stake. ABB has agreed to Hanson's offer and will maintain its links with Scholes. Hanson estimates Crabtree and Scholes together will have 23 per cent of the UK circuit protection market, in line with France's Schneider and ahead of Delta. Mr Bonham said the Office of Fair Trading had shown 'no particular concern' over the deal but cautioned: 'You never know how they will define the market.' He said the volumes of the combined group would justify investment in automated manufacturing. Meanwhile there would be some job losses, particularly in administration. Scholes, whose main Wylex subsidiary is based at Wythenshawe near Manchester, employs 1,500. Crabtree, which Hanson acquired as part of Ever Ready in 1981, made an operating profit of Pounds 9.3m on turnover of Pounds 68m last year while Scholes made only Pounds 4.8m on sales of Pounds 62.7m.</p>

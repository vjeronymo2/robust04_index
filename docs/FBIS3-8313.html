			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu by Jan Skoda </F> in Bratislava on 3 March: "We Will Not Discuss Borders"]    [Text] Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu arrived in  Bratislava yesterday for a one-day working visit to Slovakia.  He met in Bratislava with the republic's most senior  constitutional representatives -- Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar  and Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the National Council of the  Slovak Republic -- and he was received by Slovak President  Michal Kovac. During his visit, the Romanian prime minister  granted our daily an exclusive interview.    [Skoda] Could you compare the standard of Romania's  relations with Slovakia and with the other Visegrad Group  countries? Are they better or do they lag behind in any respect?    [Vacaroiu] We have traditionally good relations with  Slovakia. A general agreement on friendship and cooperation  between Romania and Slovakia and a whole series of important  agreements -- for example, a memorandum on whose basis an  agreement on creating a free trade zone will be drafted -- have  come into force. We have signed an agreement on preventing dual  taxation and on protecting investments and payments as well as  other agreements concerning culture and tourism. A consular  agreement is under preparation. The important thing is that we  have formed a basis for intensifying cooperation between our  business entities. So, the dynamism of our bilateral relations  is very good on all levels.    [Skoda] Our countries are coordinating their foreign policy  and their policy toward the ethnic minorities within the  framework of the Romanian-Slovak agreement on friendship and  cooperation. Some political forces in neighboring Hungary have  described the signing of this agreement as "a step oriented  against the interests of Hungary." How do you now assess this  coordination?    [Vacaroiu] We are especially concerned about harmonizing  certain steps of common interest. Dealing with the issue of the  Hungarian minority in Romania, however, is our internal affair.  We are merely interested in ensuring that all the citizens of  our states have the same rights and responsibilities, but not  privileges. Our laws guarantee them rights. Certain circles in  Hungary and in our country are coming up with demands that are  unacceptable to us as a sovereign state. For example, we will  not discuss borders; otherwise, this could lead to  destabilization. The ethnic minorities -- and not only the  Hungarians -- enjoy the same rights as other citizens, and they  are not discriminated against thanks to the principles by which  we are governed. In any case, in resolving these issues, it is  essential to follow a correct path.    [Skoda] In essence, our two countries are pursuing the same  aims in foreign policy -- to join the North Atlantic pact and to  become integrated as fast as possible into West European  economic structures. How is Romania approaching the Partnership  for Peace? Have you already drafted a specific program for  Romania's involvement in NATO's military maneuvers and in the UN  "peace-keeping" operations in Europe?    [Vacaroiu] At the moment, we are going through the first,  transition stage of the economy's radical transformation and of  establishing a law-governed state. Therefore, in foreign policy  we are striving to secure stability and peace in our region.  For this reason, we have signed the Partnership for Peace, and  were the first country to do so. Adapting to the structures of  the NATO armies is proceeding concurrently with the reform of  the Romanian Army. Of course, we envisage that we will also  take part in some NATO exercises and UN peace-keeping  operations. However, this will also depend a great deal on the  financial resources....    [Skoda] In connection with recent developments in the  Balkans and the increased diplomatic activity by Moscow to bring  about peace in Bosnia, what is your assessment of the signing of  an agreement on the creation of a Muslim-Croatian Confederation?    [Vacaroiu] Romania has good relations with all the republics  of the former Yugoslavia. We believe, however, that the  involvement of all three sides in the Bosnian conflict is  necessary to bring about a lasting peace. Greater involvement  by the international community is essential in order for it to  supervise for a certain period the outcome of the peace process .</p>

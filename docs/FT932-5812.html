			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Management: Employers seek political lead on childcare There is more than a hint of impatience in the voice of Anne Watts, equal opportunities director of Midland Bank, as she sets out the bank's record on providing childcare. 'Midland has been at the forefront on childcare. We've done our bit, but we can't do it all. Government, where is your response?' That question is being increasingly put by UK blue-chip companies who feel that their childcare efforts are not matched by government action. Yesterday saw the launch of an employers' pressure group, Employers for Childcare (EFC), to lobby the government and the main political parties. Supported by the Confederation of British Industry, the principal activists, apart from Midland, include Kingfisher, Shell UK, TSB and British Gas. The group is not necessarily demanding large cash injections from public funds for childcare. It wants the government to take the lead in developing a national strategy for the daycare of children up to the age of 14. National standards for provision, an examination of the current tax rules, overall priorities on where services should be concentrated and an exchange of ideas on best practice, are all subjects the group wants examined. Employers, parents and care providers have their part to play, says EFC, but without central leadership 'isolated examples of good practice in childcare provision are swamped in a patchwork of inconsistent and badly co-ordinated services'. The facts, says EFC, speak for themselves. The UK has among the poorest public provision in the European Community and 'this means that large sums of money are being wasted on training, because employees with valuable skills cannot remain in the workforce without adequate childcare,' says the group's launch document. Figures collected by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggest that registered daycare is available for less than 8 per cent of children under five in the UK; even when children reach that age, the school day finishes mid-afternoon and holidays take up 175 days a year. It could be argued that if employers are finding they are losing skilled labour, the market would push them to make the necessary provision. The benefits are tangible. For example, Midland's 114 nurseries, which provide 850 subsidised places, plus 60 holiday play-schemes, are considered by the bank to have had a strong impact on the retention of staff. In 1988 only 30 per cent of women returned after maternity leave. By 1992, that had risen to 75 per cent. EFC's reply is that leaving childcare to employers can only ever work to a very limited degree: smaller companies may be unable to fund the setting-up of schemes and are likely to lack the know-how; even the largest employers are unable to provide the choice of quality care required in every geographical location. There is resentment that employers are being landed with an activity that consumes disproportionate resources. As the launch document states: '(childcare schemes) should not take large amounts of management time and skills from the development of their core business.' Chris Marsh, employment policy adviser to Shell UK, wants the government to recognise that market forces will not solve the problem: 'Many equal opportunities policies, such as enhancing maternity provision and introducing career breaks and flexible working, can be done by companies themselves. But childcare is of a different order of magnitude and complexity.' Shell has a nursery for employees' children in Aberdeen, one of its main locations, but employees at the company's London head office travel in from 32 different London boroughs and 17 counties. John Collins, Shell's chairman, says in EFC's launch document, that the company 'cannot make a tangible contribution over such a wide geographical area, which is why we look for an overall response to the issue, co-ordinated by the government, in which we can play our part'. British Airways points out that, even with a company subsidy, the cost to employees of a workplace nursery place can be out of proportion to their income, particularly for those who work part time. Taking a small child into a city workplace nursery is not always the preferred option for employees. While workplace nurseries are only feasible in a few situations, EFC points out that current tax policies are inconsistent and favour nurseries above other provision. British Gas, for example, provides nearly 2,000 of its employees with Pounds 30-worth of vouchers for childcare each per week, but the vouchers - unlike subsidised nursery places - are considered a taxable benefit. The group plans to put these detailed points to the government and to press for one department to take the lead. Fiona Cannon, TSB Group's equal opportunities manager, says the priority is to get all political parties to accept that childcare needs a national framework. 'The framework is the issue, rather than individual solutions to individual problems,' she says. Current members of Employers for Childcare are: BBC, British Airways, British Gas, British Telecom, Co-operative Bank, Grand Metropolitan, Kingfisher, Midland Bank, Rover Group, Shell UK, and TSB Group.

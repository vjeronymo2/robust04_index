			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / HarperCollins may report Mirror to police HARPERCOLLINS, publisher of Baroness Thatcher's memoirs, intends to report the Daily Mirror to the police because it believes that a criminal offence may have been committed in connection with publication of unauthorised extracts in the paper. Mr David Banks, editor, may also be reported. A version of the book, The Downing Street Years, complete with accurate quotations, appeared in the left-of-centre daily newspaper last week in advance of the official serialisation in The Sunday Times. The publisher took elaborate security precautions to protect the book, advised by former senior policeman Mr John Stalker. HarperCollins believes the loss of information, whether it was in the form of a copy, a computer disc or waste pages from the printing process, involved theft. HarperCollins believes that the Daily Mirror and Mr Banks might be guilty of an offence in receiving such information. Mr Banks said yesterday: 'I don't know if the book was stolen. If there was a book stolen it was not used here. We have been very careful all along.' He added: 'I have never had a complete copy of the work in any form. This is like a murder inquiry without a corpse.' HarperCollins paid Pounds 3.5m including serialisation rights for the book, which is to be published on Monday. The Sunday Times failed last week to get an injunction preventing the Daily Mirror publishing material from the book on the grounds that publication was in the public interest. The Sunday Times may now sue the Mirror for damages over the publication of the material. Action is likely to be taken against The Mail on Sunday for alleged contempt of court. On Friday Sir David Napley, acting for Lady Thatcher, obtained a High Court injunction preventing the paper from publishing material from the her memoirs. The action followed rumours that the paper was about to publish extracts. HarperCollins believes that the material published by the Mail on Sunday amounted to a breach of that injunction. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, yesterday defended to the European Commission the UK's decision to license Mr Ted Turner's new European satellite channel, the combined TNT/Cartoon Network. The channel has been banned from cable television networks in France and Belgium because of its American content. It is believed the commission has written to the French and Belgian governments asking why Mr Turner's channel is being blocked.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Observer: Cirencester Life A cynic might feel that the last thing the world needs is another life insurance company, but that's precisely what Sir Mark Weinberg, the man behind the development of Abbey Life and Hambro Life, launched yesterday in the splendid surroundings of Lord Rothschild's Spencer House. The new Cirencester-based J Rothschild Assurance might seem to face an uphill struggle initially. Two-thirds of its 180 salesmen have defected from Allied Dunbar and are subject to a one year moratorium on selling to old clients. So those salesmen will be relying on referrals for new business. Many might feel that the best way to lose a friend is to pass his or her name to a life assurance salesman but Sir Mark's right hand man, Mike Wilson, is confident. He says that former clients are sympathetic and that the salesmen see the task as a refreshing challenge. Since even a good salesman will sell only 120-150 policies a year - but earn around Pounds 50,000 in the process - one can understand the incentive.</p>

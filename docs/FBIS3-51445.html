			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with presidential hopeful and New Democratic </F> Force leader Andres Pastrana by Ana Maria Matute, in Venezuela;  date not given]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Matute] What exactly does New  Democratic Force mean?    [Pastrana] As in Venezuela, there was traditionally a  two-party system in Colombia. The system actually began breaking  up in the 1990 elections when the M-19 rejoined public life and  consolidated its position as a third party. This new political  movement has grown stronger since then in the National  Constituent Assembly. We in New Democratic Force started getting  involved during the elections for senators, when their mandate  was revoked. We are neither a party nor a political movement.  This means that we do not have legal status, that we are not  registered as a party. We are different from the Conservative  and Liberal parties and the Democratic Alliance (M-19), which as  a result get certain benefits from the government. We have  chosen not to register. I invited Liberals to take part, I  invited my Conservative Party, and independents. Today we have  eight senators, two of whom are from the Liberal Party.  Moreover, I have not resigned from my party. I have not told the  Liberals to resign from their party; rather, I have said that we  should put together a political force. What is happening in  Latin America is that the parties are wearing themselves out and  have ceased to be spokesmen for their people. People no longer  expect the answers to be Liberal or Conservative, just as I am  sure that in Venezuela one party alone cannot govern.    [Matute] How would you define yourself ideologically?    [Pastrana] As I told you, I have not resigned from my party,  the Conservative Party. In accordance with the new philosophy, I  would define myself as a centrist. As for economic policy, I  believe in the liberalization and the integration that are  taking place in the world. In this regard we have backed  President Gaviria. The development minister belongs to the  political movement of New Democratic Force. We believe that some  adjustments have to be made in connection with this policy in  Colombia's case, especially in the area of agriculture. I think  that the country has to aim for growth of over six percent, but  along with the well-being of its people. We have to lend a  social meaning to this economic growth. In this case I have  backed President Gaviria's efforts to do so because I think that  this is the way to lead the country into the future.    [Matute] Hasn't such support for a Liberal president carried  a high political price for your career?    [Pastrana] A few days ago I said that I do not hope that  things go bad for President Gaviria so that they will go well  for Andres Pastrana. I hope that things go well for President  Gaviria so that things go well for Colombians. And I think that  this is what people are hoping for today. I signed a political  accord with Gaviria and for this reason I am part of the  administration. It is a political accord under which I can  continue to disagree with him. I personally think that social  investment in Colombia has been weak. We have to really earmark  resources in order to move the country forward. I think that  governments have to be supported for what they do well and  criticized for what they do poorly, and this is what we are  doing.    [Matute] Do you think that the manner of practicing politics  is changing?    [Pastrana] I think that there is another way. People may  think at times that a political group is involved in an  administration in order to reap benefits. When I joined  President Gaviria's administration, Pablo Escobar had just  escaped from prison, and energy rationing was starting. In other  words, President Gaviria was at his low point. I think that this  is the new way of practicing politics. To a great extent this is  being shown in Venezuela, because Convergence is made up of 17  parties. In the case of Venezuela, even though COPEI [Social  Christian Party] is a party and AD [Democratic Action] is a  party, what the presence of Convergence may show is this: that  problems today cannot be identified as problems for AD or COPEI  members. As I think is the case in Colombia, problems are  neither Liberal nor Conservative; they belong to everyone. And I  think that in the face of this, if we can join efforts, we will  succeed, that is to say, form a national government.    [Matute] If you are elected, will you deal with Congress  through pacts?    [Pastrana] No, what I am talking about is the presidential  election; this is what we are putting together a movement for.  We are not submitting slates for Congress. We are putting  forward a political agenda for the presidency.    [Matute] What is your government program?    [Pastrana] We have not yet put forward our government  program  because we have not officially put forward a candidate. Our aim  is to launch the campaign officially this January with a pledge  in the form of a government plan. What Colombians are expecting  today is a very specific program to deal with the problems  besetting them. This is why it is hard at the moment to talk  about a plan.    [Matute] Colombia's two main presidential hopefuls, you and  Ernesto Samper, are being accused of using image, propaganda,  and the mass media more than contact with the people.    [Pastrana] If there is any distinguishing feature of Andres  Pastrana in politics, it is the slogan that I used during the  campaign for mayor: "saying and doing." And this is why I want  to commit myself to a government program. But I want to commit  myself to Colombians on the things that I can do as president.  They have tried to stereotype Andres Pastrana as someone who  does not speak up. But, as I said before, I am not officially a  candidate. Therefore, my campaign has not begun officially. I  have tried to introduce new styles in politics. During the past  election campaign for Congress we managed to get a half-million  votes in a month and a half without delivering a single speech.    [Matute] How did you manage that?    [Pastrana] Traveling all over Colombia, talking with people,  exchanging personal opinions with them. This is the same thing  that I have wanted to do in the presidential campaign. I have  been traveling around the country listening to people. In  general, it is the candidate who talks to the people, but we  never listen to the people so that a candidate can express what  they want through a government program. We are now holding  forums in each department to learn about people's deep-seated  concerns and worries, to find out what the priority projects are.    [Matute] What is Andres Pastrana's diagnosis of Colombia?    [Pastrana] The main issue in the country, and we cannot hide  it, is security. I think that with Pablo Escobar's death we are  doing away with one of the problems, which was narcoterrorism.  We are thus beginning a new chapter in Colombia's history. But  the guerrillas and crime in the streets remain. Infrastructure  is the other major issue. A study by the U.S. firm Monitor on  competitiveness in Colombia, an issue that our development  minister, Luis Alberto Moreno, has been addressing in this  administration, says that Colombian exporters' costs are 12 to  14 percent higher owing to the lack of roads. It is very  difficult to compete like that. We have to build all this  infrastructure so that the liberalization can expand and we can  compete on an equal footing. [passage omitted]    [Matute] In your opinion, what is the best way for Colombia  and Venezuela to settle the pending problem of delimiting  offshore areas?    [Pastrana] I personally believe in direct negotiations, as  they are called for in the San Pedro Alejandrino accord. But I  am going to be clear about this. I proposed an agreement to put  the delimitation issue on ice, because I do not think that it  ought to be a campaign issue. Venezuela kept its word, and the  candidates tacitly honored the agreement; the issue of the  delimitation was not a campaign issue. They heeded my proposal.  My worry is that in Colombia the candidates agreed to put it on  ice only until after the presidential election in Venezuela. I  think that the agreement has to extend until after our  presidential campaign. The other issues I think should continue  being discussed.    [Matute] Don't you think that the issue of immigration has  been brought up in the campaign in Colombia?    [Pastrana] Right now, yes. But I do not think that we can  continue to view relations from a negative perspective all the  time. People say that kidnapping is going on in Venezuela; they  complain about guerrilla raids. These are problems that directly  affect us and indirectly affect Venezuela. At times minor  problems disrupt relations between the two countries. There is  even one issue that is insignificant to us but not to Venezuela:  car theft. We have to do away with the scourge of kidnapping. We  have to look for ways to control our borders so that we can put  an end to these crimes both here and there. Let us hope that the  issue of immigration is not used for political purposes in  Venezuela either. President Velasquez has said that he is going  to review Decree 1911. I think that it has to be. In the final  accounting, there are Colombians who have helped to develop this  country, just as there have been Venezuelans in Colombia. We  cannot say that problems do not arise for us, both here and  there. The important thing is to investigate these complaints  and, if there are violations between the two countries, to  punish the guilty.    [Matute] Would one of the ways be to set up a bilateral  commission on immigration?    [Pastrana] Yes, this would enable the two countries to sit  down and talk about the issue of immigration, whether offices  need to be opened up along the border; it would provide a place  to look into the problems, to investigate. The most important  thing is to view relations not in terms of the past but with an  eye towards the future. I told President Rafael Caldera: Why  don't we use the Andean Pact as a bloc to negotiate a free-trade  agreement with the United States. Trade between the two  countries is almost $1.5 billion. This is something that I do  not think most people would ever imagine. This entire process is  irreversible. There were fears in Colombia that President  Caldera might be thinking about backtracking; I do not think so.  On the contrary, I am optimistic now. We know Caldera; we know  who he is, and we know that relations between the two countries  are going to grow stronger in several ways. One of them has to  be integration. I think that the Group of Three has been a  significant example of development. All of this is not going to  be easy, but these efforts at integration and liberalization are  important to us.

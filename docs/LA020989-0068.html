			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS WHEN YOU BUY A WHOLE, CURED PICNIC HAM  </P> <P> Cooking style has changed a good bit around our house in the past few years,  largely because there are no longer as many people around the table at dinner  time. We used to be a clan of four or six or eight, what with parents and  children and the hungry friends of children. Today, we are usually only two or  three, except on special occasions when there may be as many as 20, what with  parents and children and friends of children, and lovers of children and  children of friends, and lovers of children of friends -- you know what I mean.  Anyway, most of the time we're not as many around the table as once we were.  </P> <P> Now you might think that fewer people around the table would have changed my  wife's shopping habits. Cooking habits? Yes. Shopping habits? No. Neva still  buys meat as if she were cooking for a crowd -- if the price is right, that is.  It is not at all unusual for me to walk into the house to be greeted with a  kiss, a hug and a sensual whispered request such as: "Honey, there are six  chickens in the refrigerator. They were on sale. Would you cut them up and  package them for me before dinner?" Or, "Honey, Petrini's had a great special  on pork loin roasts. I got a couple -- do something with them, will you,  please?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stocking Up on Ham  </P> <P> Throughout the years I have encouraged her to be on the lookout for, and take  advantage of, meat specials like that, and I am delighted that she does. It  saves us a fortune on our grocery bill and we eat well. I have also instructed  her many times on the "how to" of cutting up a chicken and boning out a pork  loin roast and all the other money-saving how-to techniques we've talked about  in this column. Yet she doesn't do any of those things. "Honey," she coos, "why  do you think I married you?"  </P> <P> Ham was her most recent good buy. Picnic ham at 79 cents a pound. She bought  one for more than six pounds and the price was more than $5. "Do something with  this, will you, honey," she said, putting her large acquisition on the kitchen  counter. "I don't want to cook all this at once."  </P> <P> Picnic ham is the cured and smoked front leg of a pig. It has a bit larger  ratio of bone and fat to lean meat than ham from the hind leg and for that  reason is always much less expensive and often a very good buy. They are  usually, however, sold whole, and so often ignored by anybody not cooking for a  crowd. Never pass by a good buy on picnic ham. There are so many things to do  with one, even if you're only cooking for one -- or two -- or three.  </P> <P> Most of the meat on a picnic ham lies on one side or the other of the leg bone  that runs from the hock at the small end to the shoulder joint at the wide end.  It's a simple matter to run a boning knife along each side of the bone from the  hock to the shoulder, removing two good-sized pieces of boneless ham from which  to make all manner of meals. Bake one piece for a small ham dinner with perhaps  only a ham sandwich or two left over. Slice or dice the other for a ham and  potato casserole, ham and eggs or a grilled ham-and-cheese sandwich.  </P> <P> Trim the remaining meat off the top and bottom of the bone to cut into cubes  for creamed ham on toast or to grind for a delicious ham salad spread. The bone  and hock are ideal for flavoring a pot of red beans and rice, or split pea  soup. The possibilities are endless.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEVA'S CARBONARA  </P> <P> 1/4 pound bacon, diced  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons olive oil  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons butter  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 cups leftover picnic ham, cut julienne  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) package vermicelli spaghetti, cooked al dente and drained  </P> <P> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped parsley  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 3 eggs, beaten  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sliced black olives  </P> <P> Brown bacon in heavy skillet over medium high heat until cooked but not crisp.  Pour off fat and set bacon aside.  </P> <P> To same pan, add oil, butter, garlic and picnic ham. Saute lightly over medium  heat. Add cooked spaghetti, bacon, cheese, 2 tablespoons parsley, salt and  pepper. Stir to mix well. Remove from heat.  </P> <P> Pour eggs over and toss quickly to coat spaghetti evenly. Add olives and toss  again to mix in. Transfer to warm serving platter and sprinkle on remaining 2  tablespoons parsley. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HAM AND POTATO CASSEROLE  </P> <P> Butter  </P> <P> 3 or 4 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced thin, cubed or diced  </P> <P> 1 onion, peeled and sliced thin, cubed or diced  </P> <P> 1 pound leftover ham, sliced thin, diced or cubed  </P> <P> White Sauce  </P> <P> 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon chopped parsley  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Butter ovenproof casserole dish and line bottom with layer of potatoes. Top  with layer of onions. On top of onions place layer of picnic ham. Repeat layers  of potatoes and onions.  </P> <P> Place last layer of ham neatly around edge of casserole, leaving space in  middle. Pour on White Sauce, shaking dish gently from time to time so sauce  mixes thoroughly through layers. Place grated cheese in space left in center of  casserole and sprinkle with parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper.  </P> <P> Cover with foil tent and bake at 350 degrees 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake  another 30 minutes. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> Note: serve with beans or greens and corn bread.  </P> <P> </P> <P> White Sauce  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups milk  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Melt butter in saucepan and blend in flour. Stirring continuously, add milk  slowly. Cook until thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  </P> <P> Note: White Sauce combined with few thinly sliced and sauteed mushrooms and 1  1/2 cups minced picnic ham may be used for breakfast or brunch, served over  toasted English muffins or toast fingers.  </P></p>

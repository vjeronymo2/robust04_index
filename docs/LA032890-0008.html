			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA A CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> BALTIC FREEDOM NEEDN'T MAKE THE DOMINOES FALL;  </P> <P> MOSCOW COULD LET ALL THREE BALTIC STATES GO WITHOUT UNLEASHING AN EXODUS FROM  OTHER REPUBLICS.  </P> <P> There never has been reason for confidence that the Soviet Union would let  Lithuania secede. There has always been cause to ask if it can let Lithuania  go. The war of nerves against Lithuania these last few days probably reflects  indecision and conflict within the Soviet government itself. The choice that  government finally makes may prove the most important international event since  reform began in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Moscow understands that if Lithuania secedes, Estonia and Latvia would rapidly  follow. Disintegrative forces elsewhere would be reinforced. Voters in the  Ukraine on Sunday gave unexpectedly strong support to republican parliament  candidates committed to full independence. The Soviet Army seized Lithuanian  deserters this week because there soon would be no army if servicemen from the  republics experiencing autonomist agitation were permitted to leave at will.  Politicians and soldiers nonetheless see that military intervention to prevent  Lithuania's secession would carry devastating costs.  </P> <P> This is a turning point for Soviet reform, and there is one thing Western  governments could do that might make a constructive difference: They could  reemphasize to Moscow that they recognize a crucial distinction between the  situation of the Baltic republics and that of the other potentially  secessionist republics and communities.  </P> <P> Stalin's incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union at the start  of World War II has never been recognized by the principal Western governments.  The United States still accords diplomatic recognition to residual elements of  the prewar republics. France does not recognize the three as legally part of  the Soviet Union. Britain accords only de facto recognition.  </P> <P> It is different for the Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldavia and the other  Soviet republics where autonomist movements have sprung up. Each has a  complicated relationship with Russia, but none is considered by the Western  governments as other than a legitimate component of the Soviet Union. Whether  that status follows from World War II settlement, the civil war that followed  the 1917 Revolution, or czarist imperial expansion, it is uncontested by the  Western governments. Secessionist movements in those republics are Soviet  internal matters.  </P> <P> While the West has supported Baltic independence since the three republics were  formed in the 1920s, it is not the policy of the Western governments to support  or advocate the break-up of the Soviet Union itself. In Western eyes, Soviet  recognition of the Baltics' independence would not establish a precedent.  </P> <P> Precedence is the reason the Balts have presented so terrible a problem to the  Soviet government. If they are allowed to leave the Soviet Union, where will  this trend end? The question is fundamental: Disintegrative forces in the  Soviet Union already are more powerful than anyone among the Soviet reformers  is likely to have foreseen even two years ago.  </P> <P> Even letting the East European governments go their own ways was supposed to  produce reform, not revolutionary change in the European system and the  unification of Germany. Two years ago the belief in Moscow was that new and  more competent Communist leaders in Eastern Europe could explore economic and  political solutions the Soviets might adopt. Reforms there were supposed to  attract Western investment and Western mechanisms of economic dynamism, to the  Soviet Union's ultimate benefit. In fact, all but Bulgaria and Romania have  simply gone over to the West.  </P> <P> Similarly, the autonomy already accorded the Baltic states was supposed to  inspire new economic development and new interactions with the West. The Baltic  republics were supposed to become the Soviets' "Hong Kong." Instead, they now  reject autonomy and demand independence. Given independence, they, too, are  expected to go over to the West.  </P> <P> Two critical issues remain to be settled in the course of Soviet reform. The  first is this question of autonomy for the component republics of the Soviet  Union, implying, to those who advocate it, democratic decentralization -- but  threatening national disintegration. The second is German unification. In  principle, the Soviet Union seems agreed to Germany's unification. In fact, no  final accord has been reached as to how this will come about, and Soviet forces  remain in East Germany.  </P> <P> If Moscow decides to intervene in Lithuania to block independence, Mikhail  Gorbachev's central European policy still may be challenged in Moscow. There  certainly are people there who see the re-creation of a united Germany and the  autonomist movements inside the U.S.S.R. as dual threats to the survival of the  Soviet Union as a world power. What happens next in Lithuania must seem to them  a decisive event. They almost certainly are right.  </P></p>

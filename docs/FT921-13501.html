			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Collor suspends rise in pensions PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil issued a decree last night suspending a court-ordered increase in pension payments that has been threatening the country's chances of an accord with the International Monetary Fund. The suspension of the 147 per cent increase was immediately denounced as unconstitutional and the attorney general has already moved a court action to challenge it. The head of the Sao Paulo Pensioners Federation called it a 'dictatorial act' and said he would mobilise his members against the decision. However Mr Collor insists the government does not have the Dollars 10bn for the increased pensions. The rise would also have jeopardised the fiscal adjustment that it is due to present to the IMF next Wednesday in order to win approval for a Dollars 2bn loan. Mr Collor warned yesterday that those who had already received the payments might have to return the money. The move came after the sacking of the two ministers responsible for administration of the pension fund. The new appointees who took office yesterday are congressional deputies whom Mr Collor hopes will strengthen his fragile political base. He described their appointment as 'a clear signal to Congress that the government is willing to negotiate'.</p>

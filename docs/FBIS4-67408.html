			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Japan should take steps to  recover increasingly scarce marine resources in the area of sea  around Japan and to create better working environments for  female workers in the fisheries industry, urged a government  white paper released Tuesday [19 April].    The annual white paper on fisheries said Japan's total  fisheries production, including catch and cultured fish,  amounted to 9.27 million tons in 1992, down 7 percent from the  previous year.    It is the first time fishery production has declined four  straight years since 1945, the paper said.    Deep-sea fishery production increased by 0.8 percent to 1.27  million tons. It was the first year-on-year increase in five  years for deep-sea fisheries, which have been generally  declining due to tightening regulations on fisheries in  international waters, the paper said.    Coastal fisheries also increased by 4 percent to 3.27  million  tons.    Offshore fisheries, however, declined 17 percent to 4.53  million tons, dropping below 5 million tons for the first time  in 15 years.    The paper said the decline in offshore fisheries reflects  the  growing scarcity of marine resources in Japanese waters. "It is  an urgent task for Japan to recover marine resources in the  Japanese waters by such means as releasing fish fry and  maintaining underwater reefs for fish," it said.    Utilization of marine resources should also be more  effective, it added.    The paper, submitted at a regular cabinet meeting by  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata, also  noted for the first time the importance to the industry of the  female workforce.    Women are taking an important role in the workforce of the  fisheries industry and as leaders of local activities in fishing  areas, it said.    It is important to encourage young women in the field to  stay  by creating a better working environment for them, the paper  said.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> THE BIG SOUNDS OF GORDON GOODWIN  </P> <P> It may be that the kindest thing one can do for Gordon Goodwin is to refrain  from calling his energetic gang of players a big band. Given the negative  commercial stigma attached to those words, it's probably better to just say  that the 10-piece ensemble he brought into Bon Appetit on Wednesday night  sounded like one of the most exciting groups in town.  </P> <P> The truth, however, is that Goodwin's compositions and players did exactly what  big band music once did, but hasn't much done lately: synthesized the many  currents of music taking place at any given time into a collective expression  that is topical, entertaining and creative.  </P> <P> Virtually every piece Goodwin's band performed in the evening's late set was  filled with a lively spirit, bright and airy ensemble voicings, and solid  soloing. Opening with a crisply rhythmic "Over And Over, Again And Again,"  Goodwin quickly shifted into the samba rhythms of "Meet Me at the Carnival" and  a lovingly conceived to Bill Evans titled "For Bill."  </P> <P> Lisa Goodwin, the leader's wife, was featured on a set of three numbers,  singing with a lovely dark-toned timbre and a strong blues phrasing -- most  notably so on "Since I Fell For You" and a Goodwin &amp; Goodwin original, "I  Had a Dream We Said Goodby Last Night."  </P> <P> Goodwin's innate sense of whimsy, one of his many appealing qualities,  dominated "Down the Middle to Worthy," a tribute to the L.A. Laker forward  which was written, predictably and humorously, on the chord changes of "Sweet  Georgia Brown." A tribute to a different kind of sporting character, "Surf  Dude," was almost as much fun.  </P> <P> Virtually every member of the band soloed on one piece or another. Among the  most outstanding examples were Clay Jenkins' eccentric, Swing-inspired trumpet  improvisations, Dan Higgins' hot alto saxophone lines, and Goodwin's  blues-based tenor solos.  </P> <P> But the evening's real star was Goodwin's belief that large instrumental  ensemble music (for lack of a less problematic label) is still alive and  kicking. Call it by whatever name you like, Gordon Goodwin's band and the music  he writes for it are something very special, indeed. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

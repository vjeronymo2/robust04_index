			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 28 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  will spend RM [Malaysian ringgit] 16.2 billion (RM2.7 is  equivalent to U.S.$1) in the next five years to develop its  telecommunications industry to make it not only the hub of  telecommunication activities in the region but also a strong  telecommunication equipment exporter in the international  market. Energy, Telecommunications and Post Minister S. Samy  Vellu said Monday that as an emerging economy, the Malaysian  telecommunication industry offers huge potential of investments,  especially for highly sophisticated and imported equipment.    Malaysia's national telecommunication carrier, Telekom  Malaysia Berhad [Limited], he said, would invest RM670 million  for its local network and RM160 million for its international  network. It would also fork out RM500 million for switching  equipment, RM550 million for transmission and RM1.7 billion for  rural telecommunications he added. [passage omitted]    The minister said private telecommunication companies like  the ART 900 operator would invest RM800 million to provide high  quality services while Time Telecom is expected to spend RM2  billion to build its Telecommunications network. Malaysia  currently has two major local manufacturers of telecommunication  equipment, he said.    In view of strong growth in demand for telecommunication  services, we are encouraging joint-venture projects with  multinational manufacturers to produce or assemble  telecommunication equipment locally. Malaysia is strategically  placed to play this role, he said.    On the telecommunication networks and services in Malaysia,  Samy Vellu said that for the period 1991 to 1995, the government  had targetted more than 100 per cent increase in the number of  telephone subscribers to about 3.4 million.    In the subsequent five-year period (1995-2000), we hope to  push our basic telephone to 7.8 million (subscribers), an  increase by more than 4.4 million over the Sixth Malaysia Plan  period, he added.    Samy Vellu also offered the use of Malaysia's first  satellite, Measet I, to other Asia-Pacific countries on a  mutually beneficial commercial basis once it is launched into  orbit in 1995. He said Measat would provide economic and  commercial benefits to users for both fixed and mobile  telecommunication services such as telephone, telex, facsimile,  data, video conferencing and television broadcasting.</p>

In a brief televised statement, Mr. Oye-Mba described the  government's resignation as "natural" because "we are entering a  new political era," referring to the results of the 5 December  presidential elections which saw the victory of the head of  state.    Under the Constitution, the government must resign after the  swearing-in of the head of state.    Also today, President Bongo made known "his intention to  form  a new government very quickly and to call on all qualified  people without any political considerations."</p>

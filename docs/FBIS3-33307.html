When he inaugurated the Mexican-German Business Meeting in  Mexico City, Serra Puche asserted that the new Foreign  Investment Law is applicable for all international investors,  including the Germans, without any type of discrimination.    Serra Puche explained to the German businessmen that in the  years to come there will be another Mexico "with the capacity to  access other markets held by no other country in America. From  Mexico, there will be free access to American, Canadian, and  Central American markets," as well as the possibility of  entering North, Central, and South American markets without  paying duties, he said.    The official said foreign investments have broken all the  records in Mexico. He noted that the country received $15.6  billion in investments in 1993, while just in January 1994,  investments had reached $2.370 billion. He emphasized that  "Mexico has been gaining ground in the race to attract foreign  capital and to use its own savings."    German Economy Minister Gunter Rexrodt and Tyll Necker,  president of the German Industrial Confederation, support  Mexico's membership to the OECD as a full-fledged member. He  trusts that Mexico, in the short run, will become the  "bridgehead" in uniting Latin American countries to enable them  to join international development.    The German minister also asked the Mexican Government to  implement the Foreign Investment Law changes to expedite his  country's participation and to give preference to German  investors. He highlighted that no country has managed to take  such an important leap in such a short time as Mexico has, which  after several years of fiscal deficit has managed to obtain a  surplus and to decrease inflation.    German Minister Rexrodt recognized the importance of the  Mexican-German double taxation agreement, which will increase  Germany's commercial participation. German investment ranks  second in Mexico, a country that is Germany's second commercial  partner in Latin America with nearly 19 percent of the trade  volume after Brazil.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RASMUSSEN HAS ASTROS FOOLED; PADRES WIN, 5-3  </P> <P> Fooled 'em again.  </P> <P> Dennis Rasmussen sat in front of his locker beneath the Astrodome and smiled  late Friday after surviving eight innings of line drives and long fly balls and  balks and everything else that can happen to a pitcher who doesn't throw the  ball much faster than the average interstate speed limit. He smiled because  that kind of pitching in his season debut had just given the Padres a 5-3  victory over the Houston Astros in front of a paid crowd of 15,971.  </P> <P> "I'm not always able to do this," he said. "But I've always had to be able to  do this."  </P> <P> Fooled 'em again. Down the hall, Glenn Davis sat with his head in his locker,  smiling only at the wonder of it all. In the first inning with no outs and  runners on first and second, the Astros' power-hitting first baseman had  sharply grounded into a double play. In the third, with one out and a man on  first, he had flied out to center field. He had done this off weird pitches  from that guy with the awkward windup, and he couldn't understand it.  </P> <P> "It was the kind of night where you walk off the field wondering, 'How did that  guy beat you?' " Davis said "He didn't have anything overly spectacular. He's  just not over spectacular. He gives you something to hit . . . and then you  wonder why you don't hit it."  </P> <P> Hang on -- Davis was just getting started.  </P> <P> "I mean, I felt like I was all over that guy tonight. I would foul him off,  foul him off. And then he would get me. It just makes you wonder."  </P> <P> Hearing this, is it any wonder the Padres are now 2-2 and feeling good about  themselves again? Is it any wonder Rasmussen, allowed to be his funky self when  he came over from the Cincinnati Reds last year, went 14-4 with a 2.55  earned-run average?  </P> <P> Is it any wonder that the Padre pitching staff, which entered Friday still  looking for a starter to get them through seven full innings, finally found  that guy in Rasmussen? Although the game took nearly three hours, Rasmussen  lasted eight innings, allowing just two earned runs (three overall) on eight  hits with six strikeouts.  </P> <P> He was provided with the victory thanks to tie-breaking RBI hits in the sixth  by Benito Santiago (single) and Garry Templeton (double). And then it was saved  by -- who else -- Mark Davis.  </P> <P> Davis entered with a runner on first and one out in the ninth and offered a bit  of a scare, but nothing like Rasmussen. After allowing an RBI double by  pinch-hitter Alan Ashby, he retired Alex Trevino on a grounder before walking  Gerald Young. Then, on a one-and-two pitch, he fooled Rafael Ramirez into a  grounder to third base that turned into a game-ending double-play, giving Davis  his second save in two games.  </P> <P> But like Glenn Davis, Mark Davis wanted to talk about Rasmussen.  </P> <P> "He's got such deception," Mark Davis said. "He's got that nice slow delivery  and then, all of a sudden, the ball is on you."  </P> <P> "When you're like me," Rasmussen admitted, "you've got to mix it up."  </P> <P> And sometimes you've got to rely on help, which Roberto Alomar provided  spectacularly in the second inning. Well, maybe the word spectacular should no  longer be used in the same sentence as Roberto Alomar.  </P> <P> "What we saw him do tonight was great but . . . it doesn't surprise us, nothing  he does surprises us anymore," Tony Gwynn said. "What would surprise us is if  he doesn't win a Gold Glove."  </P> <P> It was the second inning. The Padres were up, 2-1, thanks to an error by Glenn  Davis on a grounder by Gwynn and an RBI grounder by Carmelo Martinez. The  Astros were coming back against Rasmussen; Bill Doran led off with a double and  moved to third one out later on Rasmussen's balk.  </P> <P> Rasmussen struck out catcher Craig Biggio. Up stepped good-hitting pitcher Rick  Rhoden, who had a lousy but perfect hit. He bounced the ball just to the left  of Rasmussen, who because of foot problems is not very mobile and had no chance  at it. The ball found a spot between the pitcher's mound and first, and it  appeared nobody had a chance at it and the run would score.  </P> <P> Except here came Alomar. He charged, dove at the ball, picked it up and threw  it before belly flopping on the carpet. It seemed to even stun first baseman  Jack Clark, who nonetheless made the catch for the third out.  </P> <P> "That could have been a turning point in the game," Gwynn said.  </P> <P> "I don't know what happened," Alomar said. "I know I made the play in the air,  my feet were not on the floor. I know it was a slow runner, and I had a chance  so I took a chance.  </P> <P> "But I'd like to see it again. I'd like to see how."  </P> <P> Nothing personal, but Rasmussen didn't really care how. Just as long as he  lived to pitch another inning. He had escaped the first -- which started with  consecutive Astro hits by Young (double) and Ramirez (RBI single) -- on Davis'  double play grounder. He escaped the second with Alomar. But he wasn't through  yet.  </P> <P> He gave up the tying run in the third after a fielding error by Alomar and an  RBI single by Billy Hatcher. But with runners on first and third, he got a  grounder from Doran.  </P> <P> Three innings later, in the sixth, he faced his final test after allowing  leadoff singles to Davis and Kevin Bass. So he retired Doran on a grounder, Ken  Caminiti on a popout and then struck out Biggio for the third time without  Biggio ever taking the bat off his shoulder, with a pitch that grazed the  outside of the plate.  </P> <P> "He was not handling the curveball very well, so I gave him the curveball,"  Rasmussen said.  </P> <P> So simple. And yet, and you can check with Glenn Davis on this, so defeating.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Injured pitcher Greg Harris (sore left rib cage) did not throw Friday and  according to Manager Jack McKeon, he will probably rest through the weekend. "I  don't want to ruin him now; I think we should just wait," McKeon said. It was a  frustrating afternoon for Harris. He arrived at the Astrodome on the team bus  at 5:15 p.m. only to learn that those scheduled for injury treatment are  supposed to arrive at least an hour earlier. His teammates chided him, partly  because he's a rookie, but also because he has already proven to be an  important part of the pitching staff. "They say I should have known better  about the treatment, but if I knew better, I'd be here," Harris said. "I've  just never been in this situation before. But I've taken enough grief about it,  so I'll be here next time."  </P> <P> Tim Flannery was still recovering Friday night from a dose of reality that hit  him Wednesday night with the death of a good friend, Laszio Nagypal, who had  been suffering from leukemia. Nagypal played a part in opening day for  Flannery, making him realize it wasn't such a big deal after all. Just before  Flannery learned he would be an opening-day starter for the first time in his  10-year Padre career, he made his last visit with Nagypal. It so upset Flannery  that he said he needed to drive around San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium for an  hour before going into the clubhouse to face the Giants. His friend, said  Flannery, taught him as much as any game could. "That last day, I was asking  him how he took it, how he stood the pain," Flannery recalled. "He looked at me  as best he could and said, 'You do it with your mind, you do it with your  mind.' It really makes you think. If he can handle all he went through, how can  I ever complain about anything?  </P> <P> "It's funny how life just goes on after we go. It goes on without us. It really  makes you think about yourself."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETS / JOHN CRUDELE: TRADERS' SETBACK MAY PORTEND A SLIDE IN STOCKS  </P> <P> The stock cartel is dying. And if the cartel dies, some experts think that it  could take the stock market with it.  </P> <P> That's the easiest way to sum up how some see the volatile events of the past  week in the equities market. At approximately 3:15 p.m. on Friday, July 20,  traders in stock index futures and their cartel cousins, the program traders,  lost control of the stock market that they had been manipulating skillfully  upward for many months.  </P> <P> The result -- the biggest and most frightening drop for the Dow Jones  industrial average in many months -- shocked the average investor.  </P> <P> It was clear by the middle of July that a significant shift was occurring in  Wall Street's attitude toward stocks. Fundamentals -- such as rising interest  rates overseas, the slowing U.S. economy, the savings and loan mess, and the  stalemate on federal deficit-reduction talks -- were once again important to  the stock market. These factors had been ignored for months, as Wall Street  traders became fascinated by the Dow's ability to rise in spite of all the bad  things that were happening.  </P> <P> Not everyone, of course, would agree that professional traders can control the  direction of the market. But in recent months, more and more experts have been  arguing that the influence of investment firms and their major clients who  trade stock index futures contracts has risen as the average investor conceded  control over the market.  </P> <P> And many professional traders seem to have become believers in what could be  called the "Myth of the Dow," which states that, even in an economic recession,  it is safe to own blue-chip stocks.  </P> <P> A footnote to that myth is that even if blue-chip companies did get hurt by a  downturn in the economy (a fact that many believers aren't even willing to  concede), the clique of program traders and stock index futures jockeys (the  cartel, for short) would still be able to keep this small group of stocks from  tumbling.  </P> <P> The belief in the ability of the program and stock index futures traders to  keep shares prices buoyant was dealt a severe blow that Friday. At the  beginning of the day's final hour, bullishness was rampant. Stocks were  supposed to go up in price, and the Dow was supposed to finally break through  the elusive 3,000 mark.  </P> <P> Even the New York Stock Exchange reported publicly that there were many more  "buy" orders for stocks in the last minutes before the expiration of the July  stock index futures and options contracts than there were sell orders.  </P> <P> But then something happened. The "buy" orders, which had produced a positive  imbalance for the market just minutes before, were suddenly withdrawn.  </P> <P> One explanation for the reversal was that very poor earnings reported by Texas  Instruments, the electronics company, had produced a quick change in sentiment.  But there was also talk around the stock index futures market that someone had  pulled a fast one.  </P> <P> The "buy" orders being reported to the NYSE, the gossip went, were intended to  be a trap. While the majority of the cartel's traders would be anticipating a  run-up in stock prices, the traitor in the group knew that wouldn't happen  because the buy orders were bogus. That sort of shenanigan would be enough to  sink any cartel.  </P> <P> But don't go burying the cartel quite yet. The ability of the Dow -- taking its  cue from stock index futures traders -- to recover half of its 105-point  decline by the end of trading last Monday will, undoubtably, allow the belief  in the cartel's invincibility to linger.  </P> <P> But the change from a trader-driven stock market to a market driven by  fundamentals would seem to be irreversible. And if the economy continues to  weaken, that means that stock prices are likely to decline a whole lot more in  the face of economic reality.  </P> <P> One shot of reality was delivered last week by the Treasury Department, which  reported that the United States had a budget deficit of $11.2 billion in June,  a month in which there is ordinarily a surplus. In June of 1989, for instance,  the surplus came to $7.8 million.  </P> <P> Reality also took the form of an increase in interest rates over the past week  in Japan, where inflation and an over-robust economy are problematic.  </P> <P> What that means is that the United States will have a very difficult time  getting its own interest rates down. And that hurts the chances of an immediate  pickup in the faltering American economy.  </P> <P> Even the pessimists on Wall Street don't believe that the stock market is  getting set for a big crash -- at least not at the moment. There was a general  belief last week that stock prices would be able to rally one more time before  getting clobbered for good.  </P> <P> When will Wall Street face its next crisis? Perhaps between Aug. 7 and 9, when  the U.S. Treasury will probably have to sell another record amount of bonds.  This could put more upward pressure on domestic interest rates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Consensus on What Oil Stocks Will Do  </P> <P> Even as the bulk of the stock market has been cooling off these past few weeks,  oil stocks have been burning. And that is a curious development, considering  that the price of oil is still considerably below what it was just five months  ago.  </P> <P> The reason is simple: Some important OPEC nations -- including the  ever-unpredictable Iraq -- seem serious this time about enforcing production  quotas. But haven't we heard that before? What if someone decides to  overproduce oil and drive down the price? Who's going to stop them?  </P> <P> As always, Saudi Arabia holds the key, energy experts say. But there is still a  question on Wall Street as to whether the Middle East's largest oil producer is  willing to stand up to overproducers. If it doesn't, oil costs will continue to  remain depressed, and the price of energy shares should dip.  </P> <P> Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Frank Knuettel, for one, is betting that  both oil prices and the price of energy stocks will be rising. He told clients  recently that oil could be $1.50 a barrel higher in the next few weeks. Oil  could, says Knuettel, climb even higher in the fourth quarter of this year.  </P> <P> Knuettel is telling clients to keep the faith. Hold onto those oil stocks for a  while longer.  </P> <P> But there is disagreement. Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland Inc. predicts that the  price of crude will rise only about half as much as inflation. So Gaines, who  specializes in oil shares, isn't buying any stock in oil companies or  oil-service companies.  </P> <P> But Gaines does like the shares of American oil refiners, because rising demand  for gasoline will make the limited number of refining facilities in this  country more valuable and profitable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Is U.S. Liquidity Really Drying Up?  </P> <P> The liquidity indicator within the U.S. money supply recorded its slimmest gain  ever in May, and that weak performance is sparking a debate among experts as to  whether the gauge is, or isn't, issuing a warning that bad things are ahead for  the economy.  </P> <P> While most people have learned to watch growth in the M1 money supply (checking  accounts, currency, etc.), M2 or M3 indicators, some experts these days are  staring at a figure that the Federal Reserve Board simply calls "L" for  liquidity.  </P> <P> L rose only 2.5% in May compared to the year-previous level. Prior to that, the  worst year-to-year monthly growth was 2.7%. And the liquidity indicator fell in  May to $4.88 trillion from $4.91 trillion in April.  </P> <P> Experts agree that, ordinarily, slow growth in this liquidity indicator means  that the nation's economy will weaken within the next few months. And a decline  in L of the magnitude experienced between April and May would be an even worse  omen for the economy.  </P> <P> But the thing that has the pros arguing this time around is whether the  sluggishness of L is showing up mainly because assets are being shifted around  as a result of the savings and loan crisis.  </P> <P> "It's a trend that bears watching, but I don't think the shrinkage in L  portends anything of grave consequence for the economy at this point," says  William Sullivan, Fed watcher at Dean Witter Reynolds.  </P> <P> The M2 measurement generally consists of overnight repurchase agreements, money  market mutual funds held by individuals, and various types of savings deposits.  M3 includes all of M2, plus large certificates of deposit, money market funds  held by institutional investors, term repurchase agreements and term Eurodollar  deposits. L includes all of M3, plus savings bonds, Treasury bills, and coupons  of 12-month maturities or less, bankers acceptances and short-term paper.  </P> <P> The experts who aren't worried about the level of liquidity say that, with the  closing of so many S&amp;Ls, jumbo CDs are apparently being rechanneled either  into money market mutual funds (included in M2), the stock market, the bond  market or into an account of the Resolution Trust Company.  </P> <P> Money being taken over by the RTC as part of its absorption of a thrift, or  being put into stocks and bonds, would simply not register in any Fed  measurements.  </P> <P> Thus, says this group of experts, this money would seem to simply disappear  from the system. And it could leave the impression that liquidity in the  monetary system was drying up.  </P> <P> Not everyone agrees that the slowdown in liquidity is benign.  </P> <P> "The S&amp;L crisis is part of it," says John Williams, an economist with  American Business Econometrics Inc. in Ridgewood, N.J. "But there is more to it  than that. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan would not have lowered interest rates to  avert a credit crunch," claims Williams, if he weren't concerned about  illiquidity in the monetary system.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH, 17, MUST FACE CHARGES IN ALABAMA  </P> <P> A judge on Thursday ordered a 17-year-old prisoner sent back to Alabama to face  a murder charge and possible death sentence, rejecting claims that the move  could violate this city's ban on capital punishment.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Stephen F. Eilperin said that turning down Alabama's  extradition request would make the District of Columbia ban "into national  policy and turn the district into a haven for persons wanted by other states on  capital charges."  </P> <P> Eilperin gave Alabama authorities until May 1 to pick up the defendant.  </P></p>

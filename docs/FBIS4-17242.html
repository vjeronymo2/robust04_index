			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Peacekeeping Troops in Georgia May </F> Be Russian Only"]    [Text] It has become known that yesterday's consultations  in Moscow between representatives of Georgia and Russia looked  at the composition of international peacekeeping forces in  Georgia. In the view of one of the participants in the  consultations, who wished to remain anonymous, the peacekeeping  forces will be fully manned by Russian military men, but will be  under quadripartite control of the United Nations, CSCE,  Georgia, and Abkhazia.</p>

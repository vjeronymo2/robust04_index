			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: UBS takes over assets of regional Swiss bank UNION Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the largest Swiss bank, has taken over the SFr2bn (Dollars 1.40bn) in assets of one of the country's largest regional banks, Bank EvK, Ersparniskasse von Konolfingen. The takeover is the second in the Swiss banking sector this week, and part of the long-expected consolidation of Switzerland's more than 600 banks. The process appears now to be accelerating because many smaller banks, including Bank EvK, are being squeezed by the recession and especially by the slump in the Swiss property market. On Monday, Banque de l'Etat de Fribourg said it was taking over Banque de la Glane et de la Gruyere, a bank with SFr250m in assets. UBS said EvK was, on the whole, a good bank without fundamental problems, but it had to make special provisions on bad loans last year of about SFr70m and that left it with insufficient capital and reserves to comply with the Swiss Federal Banking Commission's stiff requirements. Bank EvK, based in Grosshochstetten, near Bern, first got into trouble last October following the sudden closure by the Banking Commission of another local bank in the Bern region, Spar und Leihkasse Thun. Shock over this unprecedented step by the authorities drove many people to withdraw their savings from other regional banks, including Bank EvK. At the time, UBS provided a liquidity guarantee and both banks hoped that would enable it to overcome its problems. UBS will integrate Bank EvK's head office, nine branches and 140 employees into its own domestic network immediately. Some branches could be closed following a review of their operations. It is the third regional bank that UBS has taken over in the past two years, and the bank expects to absorb others in the future.</p>

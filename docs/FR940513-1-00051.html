			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Q is not convinced that the market for surplus-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies is substantial enough to warrant such legislation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests that B provide information on the amount and types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risks covered by surplus-line companies. After the meeting, B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has employees of Z prepare estimates of the percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property and casualty insurance risks handled by surplus-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies. B sends the estimates with a cover letter that simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refers to the enclosed materials. Although B's follow-up letter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Q does not refer to specific legislation or reflect a view on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such legislation, B's letter supports the views reflected in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier communication. Therefore, the letter is a lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication and Z is influencing legislation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose for engaging in an activity_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose or purposes for which a taxpayer engages in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity are determined based on all the facts and circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Multiple purposes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a taxpayer engages in an activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both for the purpose of making or supporting a lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication and for some non-lobbying purpose, the taxpayer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must treat the activity as engaged in partially for a lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose and partially for a non-lobbying purpose. This division  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the activity must result in a reasonable allocation of costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to influencing legislation. See &sect;1.162&hyph;28 (allocation rules for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain expenditures to which section 162(e)(1) applies). A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer's treatment will, in general, not result in a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation if it allocates to influencing legislation_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Only the incremental amount of costs that would not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been incurred but for the lobbying purpose; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) An amount based on the number of purposes for engaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in that activity without regard to the relative importance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Presumption of non-lobbying purpose.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to a lobbying communication is engaged in for a non-lobbying purpose prior to the first taxable year preceding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxable year in which the communication is made, the activity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumed to be engaged in for all periods solely for that non-lobbying purpose. The Commissioner can rebut this presumption in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part by establishing that the activity was also engaged in for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying purpose. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to an activity engaged in for multiple purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Presumption of lobbying purpose.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to a lobbying communication is engaged in during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same taxable year as the communication is made or the immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preceding taxable year, and is not within the presumption in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the activity is presumed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in for the sole purpose of making or supporting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying communication. A taxpayer can rebut the presumption (in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whole or part) by establishing that the activity was engaged in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (entirely or partially) for a non-lobbying purpose. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(2) of this section relating to an activity engaged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in for multiple purposes. If, during the same taxable year, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer commences an activity that relates directly to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject matter of specific legislation (then in existence) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes a lobbying communication with respect to that legislation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is expected that the taxpayer generally will be unable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebut the presumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Activities treated as having no purpose to influence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A taxpayer that engages in any of the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities is treated as having done so without a purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making or supporting a lobbying communication_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Prior to evidencing a purpose to influence any specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation referred to in this paragraph (c)(5)(i) (A) or (B) (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar legislation)_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Determining the existence or procedural status of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific legislation, or the time, place, and subject of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing to be held by a legislative body with respect to specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Preparing routine, brief summaries of the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Performing an activity for purposes of complying with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of any law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Reading any general circulation publications or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viewing or listening to other mass media communications available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the general public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of this paragraph (c) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illustrated by the following examples:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In 1995, Agency F issues proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to the business of Taxpayer W, a calendar year taxpayer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no specific legislation during 1995 that is similar to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulatory proposal. W undertakes a study of the impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations on its business. W incorporates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results of that study in comments sent to Agency F in 1995. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996, legislation is introduced in Congress that is similar to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulatory proposal. W writes a letter to Senator P stating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it opposes the proposed legislation. With the letter, W  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encloses a copy of the comments it sent to Agency F. W's letter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Senator P refers to and reflects a view on specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation and therefore is a lobbying communication. Because W  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used the results of its study of the impact of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations in its letter to Senator P in the taxable year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the taxable year the study was conducted, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumed under paragraph (c)(4) of this section that W engaged in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the study for the sole purpose of making or supporting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lobbying communication. Based on these facts, however, W can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebut the presumption entirely by showing that its sole purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for undertaking the study was to comment on the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In the ordinary course of its business, Taxpayer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Y, a calendar year manufacturing company, regularly keeps records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of electricity consumption in its manufacturing process. Y has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kept such records since 1970, the year in which Y began business,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to track the cost of its manufacturing process. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995, the governor of State Q proposes a budget that includes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales tax on electricity. Using its records of electricity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption, Y estimates the additional costs that the budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal would impose upon its business. In the same year, Y  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writes to members of the state legislature and explains that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposes the increased sales tax. In its letter, Y includes its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate of the costs that the sales tax would impose on its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business. The letter is a lobbying communication (because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refers to and reflects a view on specific legislation, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governor's proposed budget). Both the recordkeeping activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the activity of estimating additional costs under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed sales tax relate to the lobbying communication because Y  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used the records to make the estimates, and Y used the estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in its opposition to the governor's proposal. However, Y had a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-lobbying purpose for keeping the records and engaged in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity prior to the first taxable year preceding the taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year in which it made the lobbying communication. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is presumed that Y  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kept these records solely for a non-lobbying purpose during all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods. Based on these facts, the Commissioner cannot rebut the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumption. In contrast, it is presumed, under paragraph (c)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section, that Y estimated the additional costs it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incur under the proposal solely to make or support the lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication, because the activity commenced in the same taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year as the lobbying communication was made. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facts, because Y estimated its additional costs under the budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal to support the lobbying communication, Y cannot rebut  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the presumption as it relates to this activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

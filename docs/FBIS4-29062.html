			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  has instructed his senior advisers to help implement an  information highway which could create a 123 trillion yen market  and 2.43 million new jobs, government officials said Wednesday  [15 June].    They said the information highway project calls for setting  up a nationwide optical fiber network to connect every Japanese  home by 2010, as recommended in a recent report by an advisory  panel to the posts and telecommunications minister.    Hata told reporters Tuesday night his cabinet hopes to  establish an in-house research organization because bureaucratic  red tape has prevented speedy work on the subject.    In testimony before the House of Representatives Budget  Committee on Tuesday night, Hata said he is aware of criticism  that Japan lags behind the United States and other countries in  proceeding with its own information highway project.    He said he wants the nation's private sector to fully  participate in the project, which could be a Japanese version of  the U.S. information superhighway launched by Vice President Al  Gore.    A high-ranking government source said the Hata cabinet plans  to open the in-house research arm within this month or by early  July at the latest.    Members of the new group will include the prime minister,  the  chief cabinet secretary and posts and telecommunications and  trade ministers, the source said.    Hata told reporters on Wednesday morning his administration  will get advice from the private sector although the new group  will not have private sector people as members.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 18 Jan (PL) -- President Sixto Duran-Ballen  today canceled his visit to Peru scheduled later this week  because of diplomatic difficulties that have arisen in recent  days between the two countries.    Sources close to the president told PRENSA LATINA that the  president decided a few hours ago to cancel his trip to Lima,  Peru, and that -- for the time being -- no date has been set for  his meeting with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.    Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes recently said that  Duran-Ballen's trip to Lima was subject to some diplomatic  details that were being worked out, inasmuch as this was a very  complex trip because the topics to be discussed were very  delicate.    One week ago, Fujimori told Ecuadoran newsmen that he was  waiting for Duran-Ballen with open arms, but only to discuss  topics on integration and economic cooperation and that he would  not talk about the so-called "border conflict."    Diplomatic sources feel the Peruvian president's remarks and  negative reaction from various public sectors prompted the  Ecuadoran president to cancel his trip.</p>

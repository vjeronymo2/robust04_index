			<p>BFN     [Text] Lodz, June 20--The low turnout in Sunday's local  government elections is a defeat of all political forces in  Poland, but the greatest defeat was suffered by the church,  according to deputy head of the Social Democracy of the Republic  of Poland (SDRP) Leszek Miller.    "The church has mobilized all its strength, this time it put  everything in the balance, (...) but it failed to mobilize such  masses of voters to go to the ballot box it counted on. I  believe this is the expression of disagreement of many believers  to a politicized role the church has recently sought to play in  Poland," Miller told journalists in Lodz on Monday.    Miller thought that the outcome of the elections offers a  chance for political stability in Poland. It will be possible  to keep the election and political timetables--presidential  elections in over a year, next local government elections in  four years, and parliamentary elections in less than four years.  He added that the elections must have convinced all politicians  and all Poles that the "road to a civic society will be arduous,  difficult and long."</p>

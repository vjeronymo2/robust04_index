			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. DRUG WAR: A LOSING BATTLE?;  </P> <P> CRIME: DESPITE RECENT SEIZURES OF TONS OF DRUG AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LOCAL  AUTHORITIES CONCEDE THAT IT'S STILL CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL ON THE STREETS.  </P> <P> Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates proudly says that recent drug seizures have  removed "60 million doses" of cocaine from circulation and have relieved drug  traffickers of several million dollars, but even he is reluctant to say just  what impact such large-scale raids have on the cocaine trade.  </P> <P> "We've had input from some of our people on the street that occasionally  they've seen the price of cocaine go up in the last month or two," Gates said.  "Obviously, we're having an impact. But we don't know how to quantify it at  this point. I don't think we can say the price of cocaine is going up yet."  </P> <P> Capt. Tim Simon, head of the county's Regional Narcotics Suppression Program,  said the drug bust announced Thursday would have little effect on the street  price of cocaine in Orange County because the drug network that was broken up  after a six-month investigation was set up to distribute large quantities of  cocaine across the United States, not small amounts within the county.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, narcotics officers from local police agencies say they have seen  little or no change in the street price of cocaine since it fell from a steady  $100 a gram a few years ago. And while the wholesale price of a kilogram (2.2  pounds) of cocaine has gone up somewhat in the past year or so, it still costs  only one-half to one-fourth of the price several years ago.  </P> <P> "It used to be that it cost $100 a gram on the street, no matter what the  wholesale price was," said Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Tom Boylan. Now, a gram can  cost as little as $20 or as much as $80, he said. "It depends on so many  things, including how much it's cut down."  </P> <P> Wholesale prices of cocaine have increased somewhat, ranging between $13,000  and $18,000 a kilo -- or 5% to 20% more than last year -- but are still far  less than the $45,000 a kilo commanded a few years ago or the $65,000 of the  1970s. But the price increase is not enough to convince Boylan that the higher  prices are the result of drug seizures.  </P> <P> "I'd like to think the impact we're having has driven it up some, and that may  be the case," Boylan said. "If we saw a tremendous increase, then you'd know.  If we go back up to $30,000 a kilo, there would be no question about it."  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Lt. Vince Howard said that his narcotics officers are also  seeing a small increase in the wholesale price of cocaine, but no real change  in the street price of $50 to $60 a gram.  </P> <P> "We like to think that we're making a big difference, but they seem to be  replacing it as soon as we take it away," Howard said. "We're not going to  really stop it, when they've got 20 tons stored in a warehouse, until all those  people quit using it."  </P> <P> J.D. Miles, head of the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement in Orange County,  was more positive about the impact of the recent seizures.  </P> <P> Miles estimated that the wholesale price of a kilo of cocaine has increased  from $10,000 to $18,000 over the last year. Demand for the drug has leveled  off, he said, while seizures have reduced the supply.  </P> <P> "We are making some sort of dent here," Miles said. "Certainly, the seizures of  dope and money are having a small effect."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Dan Weikel contributed to this report.  </P></p>

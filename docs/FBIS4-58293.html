			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 25  April publishes on pages 14 and 15 a 2,200-word investigative  report by Wa'il al-Ibrashi under the headline: "Top Secret and  Published for the First Time." "Arrest of a Kuwaiti in Cairo on  Charges of Financing Terrorism, and Search for Saudi Arms  Dealer." Under this banner headline, the writer says that on 1  April the State Security Investigations Department arrested a  Kuwaiti called 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mujaybil in a furnished  apartment and took him for questioning on charges of "financing  terrorism and supporting the extremists." During his  interrogation, al-Mujaybil said that he is a member of an  officially registered Kuwaiti society called "the Society for  the Revival of Islamic Heritage." This society is headed by  Shaykh Khalid Sultan Bin-'Isa and is managed by Shaykh 'Abdallah  al-'Atiqi. He said he came to Egypt a few days ago to extend  some aid to a number of benevolent enterprises in Egypt.    Egyptian security sources, according to the writer, have  denied the story that al-Mujaybil came to extend aid to  benevolent enterprises, saying that he was arrested red-handed.  He was arrested in Cairo after several days and not when he  arrived. The investigation sources revealed that a member of an  extremist group who was under surveillance and owns a printing  press for printing and publishing religious books and leaflets  was seen more than once meeting with the Kuwaiti 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-Mujaybil immediately after the latter's arrival in Cairo.  When the security forces stormed the house of the printing  press owner, they discovered a check for a large sum of money  paid to him by 'Abd-al-Rahman al- Mujaybil, as well as large  sums of foreign currency. Al-Mujaybil claimed under  interrogation that he gave the check to the printing press owner  to pay for printing a book because the cost in Egypt is less  than any other place, and that his relationship to the man is  purely professional. However, the security authorities were not  convinced and the investigation is continuing.    Meanwhile, the writer continues, the security authorities in  Egypt and in more than one Arab country--such as Algeria, Yemen,  and Jordan--are looking for a Saudi arms dealer called Nasir  Mashhur al- Ruwayli, classified as the "most dangerous arms and  drug smuggler across Arab borders." He uses drug smuggling to  conclude arms deals. He smuggles these arms to Arab countries  where there is intensive extremist activity, particularly Egypt,  Algeria, Yemen, and Jordan. The writer says that al-Ruwayli is  wanted in Saudi Arabia and several other Arab countries.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: SARANDON TO DON APRON AGAIN FOR 'THELMA AND LOUISE'  </P> <P> SUSAN SARANDON has again put on her apron for the upcoming film "Thelma and  Louise." She'll play opposite Academy Award-winner Geena ("The Accidental  Tourist") Davis. Sarandon is a lunch counter waitress, Davis a housewife in  Ridley Scott's MGM/Pathe thriller.  </P> <P> Susan's gritty and sexy performance as a hamburger-handler in the movie "White  Palace" may see her vying for an Oscar in 1991.  </P> <P> By the by, the little diner in the movie has already become a popular St. Louis  eatery. Universal spruced it up from its original state for the movie, and the  owners changed its name from The Super Sandwich Shop to The White Palace.  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD'S ALL aflutter. Mr. Blackwell, infamous for his wounding  worst-dressed list of celebrities, has been handpicked to become the Beverly  Hills Post newspaper's new gossip guru.  </P> <P> He is expected to deal with his subjects in an even more caustic manner than he  deals with his fashion victims. Mr. Blackwell himself says: "We must warn you  that this column could be habit-forming and slightly dangerous to your nerves."  </P> <P> TONIGHT, when Elizabeth Taylor speaks at the AIDS Masquerade Ball at the  Waldorf in New York, some of her remarks will be in tribute to the late Malcolm  Forbes. He was her good friend and escort to last year's Masquerade and donated  millions of dollars to the fight against AIDS.  </P> <P> MANY WILL recall Chicago aviation heir Michael Butler. He was on the verge of  going bust back in the '60s when he invested what was left of his inheritance  in a hippie musical called "Hair." The rest is history.  </P> <P> But now Michael, who cut a wide path through the International Set, is said to  be down to his last couple of thousand bucks. He is 64 years old and has, in  his time, been wed to at least three women -- one of whom, Robyn, is now  married to millionaire banker Rupert Hambro.  </P></p>

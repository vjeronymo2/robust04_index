			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATIONS TO SETTLE MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> With respect to your article concerning Arab-American reaction to the crisis  (Part B, Aug. 25):  </P> <P> I know that many immigrants have come to America after having suffered greatly  and that they desire the peace, freedom and security that our country has to  offer. I welcome these people with all my heart.  </P> <P> However, I believe I speak for many Americans when I say that any immigrant who  supports Hussein in his confrontation with the U.S. deserves to be deported.  More personally, I find it extremely offensive and inhumane that anyone would  complain of American soldiers eating bacon in the Arabian desert, and not  complain of the detention of thousands of Westerners in Iraq by the genocidal  Hussein dictatorship. What would happen if our hostages complained of Hussein's  policy in Iraqi newspapers?  </P> <P> JOHN D. MILLER  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

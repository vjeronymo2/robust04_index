			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Budget test in Hungary after party purge: Nicholas Denton reports on Prime Minister Antall's political options as ousted far-right MPs move to form a new party HUNGARY'S far right has made its long-awaited appearance in the open political arena. 'National-Christian' MPs yesterday began to turn their Hungarian Justice grouping into a parliamentary party after Mr Istvan Csurka and three other right-wing leaders were stripped of membership of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the leading party in the ruling coalition, at the weekend. Mr Csurka claimed yesterday that 17 MPs had signed up to the new party. Their defection from the Forum would reduce to single figures the parliamentary majority of Mr Jozsef Antall, the moderate conservative prime minister. The populist leader warned Mr Antall he was 'playing with failure'. The first round of the game will come with the vote on emergency austerity measures to reduce the public sector deficit to 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product this year and put it on course for 5.6 per cent in 1994. The measures, part of a supplementary budget and essential if Hungary is to secure a credit agreement with the International Monetary Fund, were placed on the parliamentary agenda yesterday. In the budget vote Mr Antall has also to contend with the restlessness of the party's two coalition partners. The Smallholders party is riven internally, and the Christian Democrats have taken to calling themselves the 'internal opposition'. The government is reduced to banking on supporters' reluctance to force early elections at a time when opinion polls say the Forum would lose with a meagre 10 per cent of the vote. The prime minister has played on these fears by appearing to rule out a minority government and Mr Ivan Szabo, the finance minister, says that a defeat on the budget would lead to a government crisis, bringing forward elections due in May 1994. That, however, for the time being remains something to concentrate minds. Mr Antall wants a full term to back his proudest boast: that his is eastern Europe's longest lasting and most stable administration. But even if parliament acquiesces the public may not. The imposition of value-added tax on food provoked hunger strikes last year and the new budget plan proposes an increase in the rate to 10 per cent from 6 per cent. Nor does it appear that economic recovery could sweeten the pill. Recession in western Europe has depressed exports and the finance ministry recently announced that GDP, far from growing by up to 3 per cent as forecast, may in fact drop by that amount. But Mr Csurka's support may turn out to have been more imagined than real. An unexpectedly large majority of the Forum's national delegates meeting at the weekend voted to expel Mr Csurka, and some of his 29-strong Hungarian Justice grouping have slipped back into the moderates' fold. Turnout was also poor at a nationalist demonstration last week against the Trianon treaty, the 1920 peace settlement which cost Hungary two-thirds of its territory and left 3m Hungarians in neighbouring countries. The jettisoning of the far right allows the Forum to 'open a broad gate to society and public opinion', in Mr Antall's words. An aide believes that the appearance of a party on the right at least defines the Forum as the political centre. Political virtue may therefore earn its reward but officials hope that fiscal virtue, may also bring electoral compensations. Mr Szabo believes Hungarians will not go down the way of 'demagogues who build a broad and comfortable road that leads to hell'.</p>

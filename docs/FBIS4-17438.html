			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 22) TURAN -- Last night Armenian troops  continued attacking along the entire frontline, reports the  press centre of Azerbaijan Defense Ministry.    The Armenian army attacked the southern section of the front  (Fizuli-Beylagan) three times. The Azeri army managed to  liberate the village of Ashagy-Abdurakhmanly and several  strategically important heights. During the fighting three of  Armenia's tanks and one military personnel carrier were  destroyed and several dozens of Armenian soldiers were killed.  The Azeri army captured five machine-guns, one flame-thrower  cluster, four grenade discharger cups, and dozens of sub-machine  guns.    Fierce fighting in the eastern direction (Agdam-Terter) of  the front took place throughout the night where the Armenian  army tried to break through the defense of the Azeri army. But  attempts by the Armenian army failed since the Azeri army was  subject to fire upon the position of Armenian troops in this  direction. Approximately 50 Armenian soldiers were killed in  this section of the front.    This morning the Armenian army fired upon the village of  Tap-Karakayully of the Geranboy region.    At the same times border posts of the Azeri army in the  Tauzskiy region were subjected to fire from the Idzhevanskiy  region of Armenia.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Court clears EU path on trade accord The European Court of Justice yesterday paved the way for EU ratification of the Uruguay Round trade accord before the year-end deadline by ruling on a dispute between the Commission and member states. In a long-awaited pronouncement, the court ruled that the Commission will have to share responsibility with member states for negotiation in certain trade areas, such as transport, services and intellectual property rights. The ruling supports the argument made by member states that the Commission's existing authority does not extend to these areas, which will come to the fore in future trade negotiations under Gatt's successor body, the World Trade Organisation. Although the court's verdict was interpreted as a setback for the Commission, Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, said: 'We now have a clear basis on which we can all work together in Europe both to ensure that the WTO enters into force on time, with full European participation, and to ensure that Europe plays a strong role from day one in shaping the agenda for the WTO itself.' The Commission had argued that the Uruguay Round accord should be ratified under those articles of the Rome and Maastricht treaties that give it exclusive authority to negotiate on trade. The full implication of the court's opinion will take time to digest but the Commission highlighted a number of points yesterday. Trade in goods will continue to fall completely within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission. This includes trade in nuclear goods and in coal and steel products. Cross-border services such as telecommunications, audio visual, and financial services that are transmitted electronically across frontiers are analogous to trade in goods, and therefore fall under the jurisdiction of the Commission. Other types of services which imply movement of people or establishment within the community - for example, when a third country company sets up a subsidiary - will be a shared responsibility. In intellectual property rights jurisdiction remains with member states, other than in the case of counterfeit goods crossing borders. The court added the community may be called on to act in any case where there was a direct repercussion on the functioning of the common market. The Commission and the member states will now have to decide on the best way to proceed. An EU official said yesterday that the parties would need a code of conduct as a basis for negotiation, but added that an original code - drawn up by the German government and the Commission - was now out of date and that a new one would have to be considered. 'There has been agreement that some sort of code of conduct will be needed, but there is not yet a unanimous view of what sort of code. We have to look at the court decision and decide what sort of rules are appropriate,' the official said. All 12 national parliaments must now ratify the Uruguay Round deal before the end of the year. Three countries - Greece, Germany and the UK - have already ratified the accord setting up the WTO and its annexes containing the specific agreements negotiated under Gatt on areas such as agriculture, textiles and telecommunications. EU foreign ministers have also sent the accord to the European Parliament to press on with its own ratification procedures.</p>

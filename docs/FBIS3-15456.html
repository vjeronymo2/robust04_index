			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Sharov report under the "Pertinent Remarks" rubric: </F> "Will Justice Remain on Rutskoy's Side?"]    [Text] The Lefortovo prisoners are free. But people in  the president's entourage are today making desperate attempts to  rewrite the State Duma's decree on political amnesty -- which,  incidentally, was adopted by an absolute majority. Some call  this decision "political madness," others try to frighten us by  talking about "the beginning of civil war," while still others,  taking advantage of the opportunity, seek to heap all the blame  for the events of last October exclusively on the defenders of  the House of Soviets.    But what do the people, the selfsame people in whose name  statements are often made, the people whose voice they do not  want to hear, think about this?    For more than a month now my heart has been wracked by these  two huge files of readers' letters. They convey the  penetratingly clear voice of hundreds of people. And not to  heed this voice, to "file it away" in the archives, would mean  to forego conscience and honor, cowardly to evade direct  questions which require equally direct answers: These letters  are in defense of the prisoners held in Lefortovo, and the  overwhelming majority are about Rutskoy. These hundreds of  messages include 23 collective letters, and very many family  letters; there are also some which are signed by all (all!) the  inhabitants of a village or members of a labor collective.  There are only two letters which condemn the vice president's  actions. There was nothing even close to such a phenomenon in  the times of the hounding of B.N. Yeltsin.    "Dear Editors! This letters comes from the inhabitants of  the village of Zhdanovka and the village of Maresovo in  Krasnooktyabrskiy Rayon, Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast. We often read  reactions to the events of 3-4 October on the pages of your  newspaper. We support the actions of A.V. Rutskoy and  parliament. We believe that the actions of the president and the  government were provocative. The shelling of the `White House'  by heavy artillery was really quite inhuman. Thus we are on the  side of those who are calling for the liberation of A.V. Rutskoy  and all the prisoners of Lefortovo. Let the real culprits  suffer punishment...."    It is signed by:    Yu.N. Dydykin, teacher; L.V. Dydykina, teacher; N.A.  Fomichev, welder.... Fifty-five signatures in all.    Another letter is from the village of Dubrovka in  Maslyaninskiy Rayon, Novosibirsk Oblast. The letter, which  carries the message "We are with you!" is signed by as many as  73 people. A third letter, which carries 52 signatures, sent by  workers and technical and engineering personnel of the  "Armizonagropromsnab" AOOT [expansion unknown], Tyumen Oblast,  reads: "We demand the release from custody of A.V. Rutskoy,  R.I. Khasbulatov, and the other deputies held in jail. Every  self-respecting person would have acted in the same way in their  position."    Geographically, the writers of collective letters come from  all over Russia: Bryansk, Rostov, Smolensk, Volgograd, Ryazan,  Belgorod, Kaliningrad, Chelyabinsk, Tambov, Leningrad, and Kursk  Oblasts; Altay and Kuban; the Republics of Komi and Chuvashia.  Participants in the Great Patriotic War and veterans of  agricultural production V.S. Belashov, N.T. Zasoba, and M.A.  Mironenko from Rostov-na-Donu write: "We are with you,  Aleksandr Vladimirovich [Rutskoy]. Don't lose courage and  steadfastness. All honorable people are on your side. Demand  that you be given the opportunity to appeal to the people and  tell them the truth about the October events. Sooner or later  retribution will befall those who ordered the tanks to open  against unarmed people. Despite everything, the people will  recognize those `heroes' who sold themselves for dollars, who  opened fire on their own parliament, and beat up deputies.  Whatever happens, history will tell the truth and put everyone  in their proper place."    Yes, history will undoubtedly tell the truth and give  everyone their just deserts, when the many hidden springs which  prompted the bloodshed in the center of Moscow are declassified  and made public. This will not be tomorrow, or even the day  after tomorrow. But there is no doubt that this will happen --  our readers are absolutely right on this account.    I think that the nearer the presidential elections draw, the  more pressingly and vociferously the problem, which I would  conditionally call "the Rutskoy question," will arise. The  ruling team will do their utmost to limit the former vice  president's activity as much as possible and to prevent him from  running for president. The opposition will feverishly seek a  national leader on whom to place its major stake.    On whom will this choice fall? On Baburin? An extraordinary  and attractive figure without a doubt. But I think that, in  view of his youth, his moment of glory still lies ahead. On  Svetlana Petrovna Goryachevaya? But she, I think, will not want  to soil her shining conscience and clean hands in politics any  further. There is Gennadiy Zyuganov, the pragmatic and powerful  leader of the Communist Party of Russia, who has grown before  our very eyes into a major political figure, with whose opinion  even the "hawks" on the democratic wing have to reckon. But  Communists have been so tarnished and discredited in the eyes of  the public, that years will be required to melt the ice of  distrust and wariness. On Zhirinovskiy? But no self-respecting  left or center party will want to have dealings with the  impulsive and unpredictable leader of the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia (we have already tried "unpredictables").    I venture to suggest that the stake will be placed on  Rutskoy. He will "satisfy" the patriots and statists -- the vice  president's recent statements give them no reason to doubt his  "reliability." The Agrarians and Travkin's party undoubtedly  find him attractive. The depoliticized Army will probably vote  for him so as to rehabilitate themselves, so to speak, for  participating in the shelling of the House of Soviets. I think  that even the Communist Party has already forgotten Rutskoy's  schismatic stance in the early days of the Russian Federation  Supreme Soviet, and will back him for the sake of achieving  their strategic goals. Women, and also veterans, will  undoubtedly vote for the young and likable Hero of the Soviet  Union and general.    But Rutskoy's biggest support could be the people,  who did not attach themselves to any of the dwarfish or more  massive parties, but kept their sense of compassion for a man  who had been mistreated -- there is always a peculiar sympathy  for the persecuted in Rus (does not the coming to power of the  current president also illustrate this?). I think that voters  will forget Rutskoy's excessive hotheadedness and emotionalism  -- he had plenty of time in Lefortovo to cool his ardor, to  soberly reflect on his views and actions, to "settle down" once  and for all and mature into a major political figure.    Especially today Rutskoy must be viewed in two dimensions.  The 1991 model of Rutskoy the wounded hero, and the Rutskoy of  today. The past three years have been for him not simply a time  of getting to know the corridors of power, not simply a  political academy -- the three past years, for him as perhaps  for no other, have contained enough events and trials to last  others a lifetime.    Let us recall that it was not without the aid of Rutskoy,  who  split the communist faction in the Congress of People's  Deputies, that B.N. Yeltsin became chairman of the Supreme  Soviet. Having become vice president, Rutskoy zealously served  his boss, but then made a sharp retreat. Let me remark that  this retreat came at the time of the beginning of drastic  reforms which cast Russia into the abyss of the severest crisis.  The evolution of Rutskoy's views and actions took place in  parallel with the evolution of the majority of the people, who  have entirely lost faith that the reforms promise them work,  peace, and sufficiency. In other words, in these troubled times  Rutskoy, in his world outlook and actions, as it were reflected,  upheld, and defended not so much his own position, as the  position of the majority of the people, and not the so-called  capital electorate. That is to say, he showed himself to be  not above the voters, but with the  majority of his voters. And it is probably this which  explains the fact that it is above all the ordinary people that  have come to his defense.    Now that Rutskoy is free, people -- but this time people in  the investigative and judicial organs -- will probably begin to  speak again about his imaginary millions in a Swiss bank  account, and the initiative in completing the investigations  will belong, not to the masters of fabricating falsehoods this  time, but to Rutskoy himself. The exposure of the authors of  falsifications, the furor which will be raised in the mass  media, will undoubtedly help to foster his image.    Let us not forget either another major trump card which he  will undoubtedly use, and which no other aspirant could possibly  hold. After all, it was he, Rutskoy, who was the first of the  president's entourage to affirm the perniciousness of the chosen  course; it was he who warned that the "Chicago kids" would bring  Russia to ruin, it was he who lifted the curtain on the  corruption that has embraced the upper echelons of power -- it  was for this, in point of fact, that he was initially slandered  and ridiculed, and then removed from the political stage as an  actor displeasing to the ruling regime, one who knew too much.    In focusing attention on Rutskoy as the potential leader of  the organized opposition, I by no means rule out other  candidates. These could even include the current State Duma  Speaker I.P. Rybkin, or someone else, perhaps as yet unknown to  the broad mass of political commentators. For the time being I  am reflecting only on possible candidates.    It is entirely possible that the opposition will fix its  choice on V.D. Zorkin, whose civic and political standpoint in  many ways absorbs the views and aims of those who are  simply dissatisfied with the progress of reforms, and  those who decisively disagree with their content.    In view of the Russian mentality, Zorkin, like Rutskoy, has  many chances of victory, if, of course, he agrees to take part  in the presidential elections. He is a faithful servant of the  law and a tireless defender of the Constitution who is "sick of  cringing" to the present authorities. He in no way compromised  himself or blackened his reputation in the events of October; by  nature and by upbringing he is a peacemaker, inclined to speak  and find compromises in crisis situations. Moreover, he was  humiliated and persecuted. But, in comparison with Rutskoy,  Zorkin is a great diplomat, a more sensible and balanced  politician, and, let us not forget, a highly experienced lawyer.    It seems to me that the ideal scenario would be for them to  enter the elections in harness. This is not a case of the  "fiery steed" and the "timid doe" hitched to the same wagon, but  rather, two horses who wish to haul the heavy burden of Russia's  difficult problems from the abyss.    Undoubtedly, this does not exhaust the list of potential  presidential candidates. There is no doubt that Vladimir  Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] will put forward his candidacy, though  his daily plunging popularity hardly leaves him any hope of  victory, especially since a major split will probably occur in  the liberal democrats' camp.    The current prime minister will most likely stand. But his  chances will, in my view, also be slim, since hitherto unknown  facts about the October events, which will by no means be to his  advantage, will emerge during the preelection wrangles. Nor  will the ever-deteriorating economic background, the growth of  prices, and the mass impoverishment of the people, work in his  favor.    We could see other well-known names also on the list of  aspirants to the post of president. Shakhray's move away from  democrats like Gaydar, Chubays, Ponomarev, and Yakunin, who have  failed and compromised themselves, his attempt to glide along  the "center," and his statement on the need to free the  Lefortovo prisoners, are nothing less than the start of his bid  for the presidency, an effort to stake out for himself political  territory for the future. Experienced in palace intrigues, a  man who knows how to look ahead, and who is flirting with the  regions, Sergey Mikhaylovich is clearly seeking to undermine the  vigilance of the Russian people.    Without a doubt, the economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy -- author  of the once-sensational "500 days" program -- will also make a  bid for power. The democrats are already today trying to  convince us all that there is no more popular man in Russia than  Yavlinskiy, and thereby an attempt is already at this early  stage being made to pave his way to the coveted office. Oh,  this made-to-order sociology! I would like to believe that  Yavlinksiy's name is well known to the inhabitants of a small  town or rayon center, let alone a village. Alas, the name of  this undoubtedly clever person, who, however, apart from  composing projects, has not yet managed to do anything specific,  means little to them.    There is also another undoubtedly brilliant personality in  the country, who today has been undeservedly thrust into the  backwaters of public life -- Yu.V. Skokov, the current chairman  of the Federation of Russian Commodity Producers. It is hard to  explain why he is out of favor with the powers that be, but it  is even harder to explain why he is himself deliberately keeping  to the shadows. Is this a subtle game? A tactical ruse: Let  the irreconcilables "slug it out," and the enfeebled collapse?  Time will answer these questions.    Here is the game of patience that is being played. There  can, and probably will, be other names in this pack of  candidates. Yegor Gaydar, on whose altar the main efforts and  votes of the democrats will be placed, will not fail to try his  hand, I think. It goes without saying that he has acquired huge  public influence, plus there is his fine political education and  lofty intellect. That experienced administrator, Moscow Mayor  Yu. Luzhkov, also has chances of fighting for the highest state  post. Indeed, even the current president could, as they say,  shake his grey locks. But when it comes to the degree of broad  renown and popular trust enjoyed by future candidates, the name  of Rutskoy is today on everyone's lips. The numerous letters to  the editorial offices are also, incidentally, a confirmation of  this.    The fact that the authors of these letters are not members  of  the liberal intelligentsia or the capital's "gilded youth"  trading in the kiosks strikes me as important; they are people  remote from group or party prejudices; people of action.  Perhaps this is the voice of reason and justice?    "Justice will remain on Rutskoy's side!" -- this is how M.  Zimin, labor veteran of the Lenin Kolkhoz in Vladimir Oblast's  Muromskiy Rayon headed his letter to the editorial offices.  Whether this will be the case or not, time will tell. We have  not long left to wait.</p>

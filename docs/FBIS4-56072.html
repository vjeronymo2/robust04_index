			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] Throughout last night and this morning chetnik  artillery has been pounding the Bihac area. From their  strongholds in Veliki (Radic), and Grabez, the chetniks have  been shelling parts of this UN protected zone with howitzers and  mortars, and trying to conceal this behind the [words  indistinct] conflict caused by Abdic's traitor clique.    Dozens of shells were fired overnight at the outskirts of  Bihac, while the defense lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski  plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Grabez have been under continuous mortar  fire. In decisive counterattacks, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  5th Corps has recaptured some of the territory on the plateau,  inflicting heavy losses on the chetniks in manpower, and  capturing a large amount of ammunition and equipment. This must  have been the reason for the start of the chetniks' bestial  shelling of civilian targets, which also served as a sign to the  Kladusa traitor paramilitaries to intensify their own attacks on  the areas of [word indistinct], Pecigrad, (Liskovac), and  Todorovo.</p>

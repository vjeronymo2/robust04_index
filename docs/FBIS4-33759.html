			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 7 Jun (PL) -- Colombian Ambassador to Cuba  Ricardo Santamaria said in Havana today that Colombia is  organizing a conference for private businessmen to study future  investments in Cuba, and he added that Cuban ministers and other  ranking officials will be invited.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Santamaria explained  that  the Colombian Economic Development Ministry is preparing to hold  this meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota in July. With this in mind,  Colombian companies interested in trade and investment with the  island are being consulted.    This important meeting, along with the great progress  achieved in relations between the two Latin American nations  during the past few months, will provide greater knowledge of  investment possibilities, existing legislation, and other  important details concerning Cuba, the diplomat said.    Santamaria said: The idea is to hold frank, direct  conversations between businessmen and Cuban officials,  especially representatives of businesses accepting foreign  capital, because we believe that in tourism, trade, and some  industrial fields there are still areas to be explored.    The talks in Santa Fe de Bogota will be held independently  of  any agreements already reached by Colombia and Cuba, as well as  independently of the specific advances made during visits by  nine Colombian delegations that have traveled to Havana in  recent months.    The ambassador also stressed the work done by joint  commissions in areas such as education, sports, culture,  science, and technology, which have resulted in a number of  agreements, including agreements between universities in the two  nations and the corresponding heads of sports organizations.    Regarding tourism, Santamaria noted the recent participation  of Colombian tour operators and Prospero Carbonell, the  president of Colombia's National Tourist Corporation, at the  tourism convention in Varadero. He also highlighted the  negotiations concerning the sale of multiple destination  packages and other types of excursion packages.    Colombian businessmen have already signed agreements with  Cubanacan Corporation, which will lead to the construction of  new hotels on the beaches of Varadero and Santa Lucia -- the  latter of which is located in the central province of Camaguey  -- and to the joint management of the Yagrumas Hotel on the  outskirts of Havana.    In another segment of the interview, Santamaria discussed  the  Colombian people and government's satisfaction with Colombia's  recent designation as the site of the upcoming Nonaligned  Movement summit and, consequently, its assumption of the  presidency of the organization in 1995.    Santamaria said: We view this as a recognition of Colombia's  international policy and as an important challenge to the nation.    Reviewing the responsibilities that will accompany this  designation, the head of the Colombian mission in Cuba stressed  the importance of coordinating the actions of the 110 countries  that comprise the Nonaligned Movement.    The new Colombian Government, which will begin its mandate  on  7 August, will take on this enormous task, together with the  entire nation, in light of the important role of the nonaligned  nations in the new international scene, Santamaria concluded.</p>

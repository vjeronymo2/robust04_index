			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Borderline cases - The pros and cons of becoming a national law firm The Norton Rose/M5 group of English law firms recently surprised the legal services market by deciding not to merge its operations into a single national partnership. The trend in recent years has been to extol the merits of national law firms, such as Eversheds and Leeds-based Dibb Lupton Broomhead, which say their geographic spread and structure make them more flexible to client demands. But a review carried out by the Norton Rose/M5 group revealed no 'business case' for merging its seven firms. According to Mr Peter Smith, the group's chief executive, clients of the individual firms could see no significant advantage in their lawyers becoming a national partnership with offices in the main commercial centres of England and Wales. What mattered to them was the continuation of the relationship they had built up with a law firm or individuals within it. The question is whether this finding was specific to the Norton Rose/M5 group, or whether it is the typical reaction of business clients. Mr Barry O'Meara, deputy group solicitor for ICI, the UK chemicals group, says that whether a firm has a national network of offices is not a factor in choosing outside lawyers. Two years ago ICI 'outsourced', or contracted out, its litigation and conveyancing work. For the litigation side, it needed a firm well represented in the north of the country - which is ICI's heartland - and in London, Mr O'Meara says. It chose Hammond Suddards of Leeds. For conveyancing, the company's view was that, while most of the work was in the north, it could be done from anywhere. It chose City solicitor Field Fisher Waterhouse. The rest of the group's company and commercial work is handled by the in-house team. Only for specific jobs, such as the Zeneca demerger, would it instruct outside lawyers. In such cases, its policy is to instruct the best firm for the job. For the demerger, ICI used Linklaters &amp; Paines. Similarly, Ms Gillian Budd, group senior legal adviser at Cadbury Schweppes, the food and drinks group, can see no significant advantage in a law firm having a national network. Her company would not choose a law firm just because it had one. The different divisions within Cadbury Schweppes tend to use lawyers they know at a local level. Mr John Elliott, a senior legal adviser at 3i, the UK's largest venture capital company, says he believes some national law firms 'overestimate the importance to clients of their networks'. Nevertheless, it can be a factor when choosing a firm, says Mr Peter Bevan, British Petroleum's group general counsel, but it is not usually decisive. On rare occasions, BP has used a firm because of its spread of offices, but in general the company's worldwide policy is to choose firms for specific jobs. According to Mr Julian Collins, solicitor to the British Coal Pension Funds and chairman of the Law Society's commerce and industry group, there is no significant demand from commerce and industry for the legal profession to follow the accountancy model and set up national networks. Such comments suggest the Norton Rose/M5 decision not to merge its firms was a sound one. While its group relationship allows the individual firms to co-operate in training recruitment, exchange of information and in marketing at an international level, there seems to be no demand for a single partnership. However, there may be demand for firms that offer high-quality services on both sides of the Scotland/England border. By failing to include Scotland in their networks, the existing English national law firms may have missed a trick. Scotland is a distinct jurisdiction. Although most company and commercial law is the same as in England, differences in litigation, property and bankruptcy laws may have dissuaded a number of English firms from focusing on the Scottish legal market. Scottish firms have not been slow to recognise the potential demand for services in both jurisdictions, but few are big enough to do so, or prepared to risk losing referral work from English firms by competing south of the border. McGrigor Donald of Glasgow may be the exception. A number of Scotland's leading commercial firms do have offices in London, but in the last five years McGrigors has built its City office into a full-service operation. This arguably makes it the only true full-service national law firm in the UK. According to Mr Robert Glennie, the partner in charge of the London office, its strategy of building a full-service operation in London is beginning to pay dividends. He cites the firm's role in helping to turn round Scottish Metropolitan Property, Scotland's biggest property investment company, as an example of work which could not have been done by any other law firm in the UK acting on its own. Two and a half years ago, ScotMet was on the brink of collapse, having reported an unexpected pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.37m, including a write-down of Pounds 9.4m on a site in Bournemouth, Dorset, and incurred a Pounds 2.2m cost on renegotiating banking covenants. The loss followed a badly timed increase in the company's property development activity, particularly in the south of England. At the beginning of 1992, Mr Gordon Milne, the company's long-serving managing director, stepped down and was replaced by Mr Scott Cairns. Mr Cairns announced a strategy of returning the company to its core activity of property investment, and set about reducing ScotMet's borrowings, which stood at Pounds 201m in September 1991 - a gearing ratio of 140 per cent. After renegotiating the company's banking facilities and executing a controlled programme of property disposals, ScotMet has achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.1m in the six months to February. Company borrowings, which had already been reduced to Pounds 144.9m by August last year, had fallen to Pounds 67.9m. This was thanks largely to the sale last October of Saltire Court, a prestige office development in the centre of Edinburgh, for Pounds 53.1m - a Pounds 6.5m surplus on book value. In November, the company entered into what Mr Cairns called a 'voluntary refinancing' with a one-for-three rights issue to raise approximately Pounds 26.8m. It is now back on the acquisitions trail. In March, it announced the purchase of McNeils, a private company with a portfolio of retail investment properties in Berwick-upon-Tweed, for about Pounds 4.5m. Thanks to its London office, McGrigors was able to provide a complete service for ScotMet, says Mr Glennie. Five years ago, any work in England and Wales for ScotMet was handled by Linklaters &amp; Paines. This ability to provide overall legal services within the UK has proved attractive to retail companies. McGrigors now handles all the UK employment and litigation for Gap, the US clothes retailer; it acts for the Sock Shop chain; and has picked up all UK banking and property work for Seagrams, the drinks company. While there may be no 'business case' for national law firms in England and Wales alone, firms might be wise not to ignore the opportunities that the provision of legal services throughout the UK could bring.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Last try for power by former Thai PM THE FORMER Thai prime minister, Mr Chatichai Choonhavan, showed he has lost none of his flair for the unexpected by announcing the creation of a 90-seat party late on Friday night. However, the merger of four opposition parties with a party in the ruling coalition government appeared to have already run into trouble yesterday as key members of Mr Chatichai's party angrily rejected the scheme. The initiative is widely seen as the ageing disco-loving Chatichai's last desperate tilt at the premiership, risking severe damage to his own Chart Pattana (National Development) party for the sake of inconveniencing the government. 'Chatichai knows that at his age he can't wait two or three years for the next election - but this smacks of desperation,' said the political analyst of a western embassy. The 73-year-old Mr Chatichai - who was ousted by a military junta in February 1991 - has endured a year in opposition without being able seriously to trouble the five-party coalition government despite repeated criticism of prime minister Mr Chuan Leekpai for cautious and lacklustre leadership. The new 90-seat strong political party is supposed to take over the name of the current Social Action party which seems certain to be kicked out of the ruling coalition. The 21-member strong Social Action party was only brought into the coalition to shore up the thin five-seat majority of the four 'angelic' parties who opposed a military junta's domination of politics and subsequently won last September's pivotal general election.</p>

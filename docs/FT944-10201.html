			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bologna banks get go-ahead for merger The Bank of Italy yesterday gave the go-ahead to a proposed merger between two Bologna banks - Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) and Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (Carisbo) - giving them a head-start over Credito Italiano's rival plan to take control of Rolo. The central bank, which supervises the fragmented Italian banking sector, is still considering Credito Italiano's plan to bid L2,000bn (Dollars 1.27bn) in cash for a 48 per cent stake in Rolo, to add to the 2-3 per cent it already owns. The Bank of Italy was not expected to reject the planned merger between Rolo and Caer, Carisbo's holding company. Earlier this year, it approved a similar plan for an alliance between the two companies, which was then shelved. However, Rolo is bound to argue that the decision gives it a defensive advantage over Credito Italiano. The Bologna bank plans a shareholder meeting on December 19 or 20 to vote on the merger, and it is also preparing to attack Credito Italiano's preliminary bid plans on legal grounds. Meanwhile, Credito Valtellinese, a small northern Italian bank, announced plans to take control of Credito Artigiano, a Milan-based bank in which it has a 20 per cent stake. Valtellinese said it would pay L146.3bn for a 29.27 per cent stake held by Artigiano's majority shareholder, Fondazione Vismara, and offer to buy up a 1.73 per cent from another shareholder to take control.</p>

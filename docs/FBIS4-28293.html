			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a foreign news report, in his recent  interview with NBC television, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry made  dangerous and warmanic remarks that a preemptive strike against  North Korea remains an option.    Perry unhesitatingly made such warmanic remarks at a time  when the United States and its followers are attempting to  impose undisguised sanctions under the pretext of our  nonexistent nuclear issue. This is an unpardonable criminal act  which will lead the situation to the door of war [chonjaengui  munogwie kkaji]. This clearly shows that the U.S. military  action to crush [apsal] us has now entered an adventurous stage  for carrying out a real warfare. [silchonul pyolchinun  mohomchogin tangye].</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina devoted  today's session almost completely to the military situation in  Gorazde. Military and political measures have started and are  continuing with a view to stopping the offensive on Gorazde.    Last night, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency  of  the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, had a telephone conversation  with Victor Jackovich, U.S. ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina,  who is in Washington at the moment, and U.S. special envoy  Charles Redman. Contact has been established with U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, who will inform U.S. President Bill  Clinton about the (?Serbian)-Montenegrin offensive at Gorazde.    Contact has been established with Akashi, special envoy of  the UN secretary general, as well as with General Rose, UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They  were invited to come to Sarajevo. Gen. Rose is expected to come  today and Akashi is expected to come tomorrow.    At the demand of Bosnia-Herzegovina, consultations of the  members of the Security Council were held last night. It is  worrying that reports by some UN observers present the situation  in Gorazde in an entirely different light. According to them,  the situation is not serious and even less critical.    Considering this, the head of our mission to the United  Nations was told to demand an urgent Security Council session  and call attention to a possible manipulation of the Council by  some of its officials, something that may be very dangerous for  further development of the situation in Gorazde. It will be  demanded for Gen. Rose to visit Gorazde without delay and  establish the real situation on the spot. It was decided that  Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic send letters to chiefs of  a number of states in which he will acquaint them with the fact  that the attacked region was proclaimed a security zone under UN  protection by Resolution 824 of the Security Council.    In the opinion of the Presidency of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the offensive on Gorazde, as well as some  political games obviously linked with that offensive, may  represent a form of pressure on our side to renounce its just  and principled demands to be given back occupied territories.  In any case, the attack on Gorazde and Bihac, as well as the  continued ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian Krajina, are  seriously endangering the peace process that has been started in  the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Presidency is warning the public that all these sad  facts  in the field show that the war unfortunately is not over. The  Presidency has been doing and will do everything in its power  with a view to reaching a just peace as soon as possible.  However, these efforts are obviously not met with good will by  the opposite side that has started this war in the first place.  Therefore, both our Army and our citizens must be ready for any  contingency.</p>

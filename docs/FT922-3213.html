			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Writedowns hit net at James Hardie JAMES Hardie Industries, the Australian building products group, yesterday announced a 92 per cent reduction in net profit, to ADollars 5.9m (USDollars 4.5m), for the year to the end of March. Sales were ahead 4.6 per cent to ADollars 1.3bn. The reduction in net profit was caused by an abnormal loss of ADollars 73m following a decision to write down the value of intangible assets and the group's investment portfolio. Mr David Say, managing director, said the writedown followed plant closures caused by rationalisation, and the introduction of a revised accounting standard on the valuation of assets. CSR, the building products and sugar group, recently announced a net loss of ADollars 385m after writing down plant, equipment, goodwill and trademarks by ADollars 558m to comply with the revised standard. The abnormal loss at James Hardie was dominated by a ADollars 57m provision against the cost of closing three fibre cement plants in Australia. The group also wrote off ADollars 37m against a US cement plant, ADollars 15m against intangible assets, and ADollars 19m to bring investments into line with market values. The write-offs were partly offset by a ADollars 56m abnormal gain from the sale of James Hardie's 45 per cent shareholding in Spicers Paper late last year. The board cut the final dividend by 25 per cent to 6 cents, partly franked, making a total dividend for the year of 12 cents, compared with 17 cents the previous year. Mr Say said the group would restore the dividend as soon as profits improved. However, there were only patchy signs of recovery, and the outlook for the current year was unclear.</p>

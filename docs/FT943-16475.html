			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Chinese premier aims at German trade deals Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, arrived in Germany yesterday at the start of a six-day visit likely to focus on boosting bilateral trade, Reuter reports from Bonn. Mr Li, travelling with more than 30 officials and businessmen, will hold talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He will also meet Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, and German business leaders. During the visit, the two sides are expected to sign accords on co-ordinating German and Chinese efforts to develop China's railway network and the transport and telecommunications sectors. Mr Li will also travel to eastern Germany, including Berlin, and to Munich. There has been little sign in Germany of the controversy which dogged Mr Li in Austria, where Vice-Chancellor Erhard Busek refused to see him in protest at China's human rights record, and demonstrations were banned. However, German human rights groups have called several protests, including one in Bonn today. Some members of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic party, including Mr Heiner Geissler, a leading liberal, and Mr Horst Eylmann, chairman of the parliamentary legal committee, yesterday urged Bonn not to let Mr Li forget human rights. They noted in a statement that Mr Li was widely seen as responsible for the bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests on Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. 'The talks must not only be about economic co-operation; above all there must be demands for human rights in China to be respected,' the statement said. But Mr Heinrich Weiss, chairman of the China section of the Federation of German Industry's East Europe Committee, said human rights and trade should not be linked. 'You can't use the one to force the other,' he said on German radio. He said China's record would automatically improve if it was bound into the international community through trade links.</p>

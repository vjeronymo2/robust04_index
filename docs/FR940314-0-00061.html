Residual second- and third-class mail must be prepared under an option in 4.2 and 4.3. Residual First-Class Mail must be prepared under 4.2 and 4.3, or 4.4, or 4.5, except that preparation may be finer than those standards, by agreement between the mailer and the entry post office for multiple acceptance times. All residual mail must be presented under 4.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> 4.2&blank;AADC Residual Preparation Options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Residual second- and third-class mail must be prepared under one of these options and in accordance with 4.3. First-Class Mail may be prepared under one of these options and 4.3 if not prepared under 4.4 or 4.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Separate AADC Preparation. Residual mail is trayed separately from qualifying mail. Groups of 10 or more residual pieces to an AADC area in L804 are placed in AADC trays and mixed-AADC trays. AADC trays are required if there are enough pieces to fill a tray, but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. Residual pieces in mixed-AADC trays and in less-than-full AADC trays must be prepared and labeled as AADC packages. Remaining groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed in separate working trays. Packages and trays must be prepared under 4.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Intermixed SCF/AADC Preparation. Some residual mail is trayed with qualifying mail. Groups of 10 or more residual pieces to the same AADC area in L804 are packaged by AADC and placed in AADC trays (with qualifying mail) and in mixed-AADC trays. AADC trays are required if there are enough pieces to fill a tray, but less-than-full AADC trays are permitted. AADC trays containing only residual AADC packages are allowed. Mixed-AADC trays are limited to residual AADC packages. At the mailer's option, residual mail may be packaged by 3-digit ZIP Code and placed in SCF trays (remaining pieces sorted by AADC). A less-than-full tray for the origin SCF containing only residual packages is allowed. Remaining groups of fewer than 10 pieces to an AADC are placed in separate working trays. Packages and trays must be prepared under 4.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> 4.3&blank;AADC Residual Preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subject to 4.1 and 4.2, residual mail must be prepared as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.

Packages of fewer pieces not permitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Working: required grouping of pieces by AADC (use L804) in working trays. Packaging required only in a less-than-full working tray as follows: prepare as few packages as possible, each not more than 6 inches thick, without regard to AADC breaks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

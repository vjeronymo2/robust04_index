			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Canary Wharf sale may face 2-year delay CANARY Wharf may not be sold to investors for two years, whether or not the Jubilee Line extension to London's Docklands is built. That was the warning given yesterday by Mr Stephen Adamson, a partner in accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, who in May was appointed one of the joint administrators of Canary Wharf under UK insolvency procedures. However, no decision on whether to build the Pounds 1.6bn Underground line extension was taken yesterday at a meeting of the government's special Docklands committee under Lord Wakeham, leader of the House of Lords, Some government departments argue fiercely that the project should go ahead, although the Treasury still needs to be convinced that the extension should be built. One government employee said that 'the odds on it being built' had improved slightly. Mr Adamson said: 'If the Jubilee Line is built, we could restructure the project (involving the sale of all or part of it) within two years'. If the government decides not to build the line, as officials say is likely, Mr Adamson cannot say when a sale of the development will take place. He also said that Canary Wharf's 11 commercial banks, who have lent Pounds 576m to the development, are unlikely to receive any repayments until 1998 unless an investor can be found to inject new funds. 'The banks would start to get repaid in 1998 from funds generated by letting the estate,' Mr Adamson said. 'Repayments would continue till 2006.' Whether or not the Jubilee Line extension is built, as soon as the government makes a decision the administrators will move rapidly to reorganise Canary Wharf's corporate structure. A new company will be set up, with the administrators as its shareholders, which would take control of assets and take on responsibility for letting office space. This would have the effect of giving confidence to potential tenants that they are negotiating with a well-capitalised company. Banks would inject funds into the new company to ensure that it has sufficient resources to maintain services at Canary Wharf and provide incentives to attract potential tenants. If the Jubilee Line extension is built, the banks have agreed to provide Pounds 30m of funds to meet these needs over the next three years. The banks have offered Pounds 395m towards the Pounds 1.6bn Jubilee costs. Mr Adamson said yesterday that, if the government decides that their offer is unacceptable, he would like the opportunity to revise it. The Treasury is unhappy that the first offered payment of Pounds 98m is conditional on more than 2,000 Department of Environment civil servants being moved to Canary Wharf. Mr Adamson recognises that the banks are unlikely to remove this condition from their offer. However, he wants to try to get some or all of the money from outside investors: 'I would not be averse to going around with a begging bowl,' he said. His colleague, Mr Nigel Hamilton, was pessimistic: 'It's a lot of money,' he said. Mr Adamson also disclosed that the administrators are in dispute with Chemical Bank, the big American bank, about its right to cancel an agreement to rent 225,000 square feet of space at Canary Wharf. Chemical Bank said last month that it had decided to move its offices to Alban Gate in the City rather than to Canary Wharf. Mr Adamson said he hoped to come to an agreement with Chemical Bank for a 'lower amount'.</p>

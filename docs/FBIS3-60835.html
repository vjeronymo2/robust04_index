			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 25 Dec -- A source at the General People's  Committee for Unity denied reports circulated by some mass media  on the recent (?visit) to the Great Jamahisriyah by Dr.  (?Usamah) al-Baz, first under secretary at the Egyptian Foreign  Ministry and director of the Egyptian president's office for  political affairs.    The source confirmed that these reports were [word  indistinct] untrue, and (?consequently) the mass media reports  circulated about the issues discussed within this sphere were  baseless.    As for the Lockerbie issue, the source said that Libya has  nothing to say about this issue, particularly [words indistinct]  Libya's innocence in it.    In connection with the so-called al-Kikhya [Libyan  opposition  leader who disappeared in Egypt], the source added that Libya  has nothing to do with him, and it looks as if he were a victim  of accounts settled with (?quarters) of the stray dogs he dealt  with. He held foreign nationality, and his connection with Libya  was severed years ago. He was not of Libyan origin but from a  Turkish family which settled in Libya, and we thought that he  had gone back to his country after the establishment of  (?people's) power in Libya and after the people started to  govern themselves, especially since he was from a family [word  indistinct] which controlled the Libyan people [word indistinct].</p>

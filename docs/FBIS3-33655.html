			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Excerpt] A seminar on democracy and human rights  organized by the Center for the Protection of Liberties,  identified with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP], has, for the first time ever, decided to  establish a committee in the territories to monitor human rights  violations against Palestinians by fellow Palestinians.    Presenting the idea, Dr. Mahmad Jadallah, one of the most  prominent DFLP activists, said that in view of the feared human  rights violations against Palestinians not only by Israel but  also by the Palestinian national government that will be  established in the territories, "someone must try to stop  irregularities and violations of human rights by Palestinians,  even if this is only done by words."    The seminar, held yesterday at the al-Watani Hotel in East  Jerusalem, dealt with issues on the current agenda of  Palestinian society involving its fears with regard to the  future. Among other things, the participants discussed  relations between the individual and the Palestinian government  that will be established in the territories, the status and role  of human rights watch organizations in relation to that  government, the status of Palestinian women, and the proposed  constitution for the Palestinian government.    In the discussions, sharp criticism was leveled at the PLO  leadership for signing the Oslo agreement; for its lack of  awareness of the need to teach democratic values in schools and  other institutions; and for other negative phenomena in the  territories, such as the murder of innocent people.

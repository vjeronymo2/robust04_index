			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Markets: All eyes on the yen - Global Investor Tokyo had everything last week: the country that once set global standards for political stability saw the resignation of its third prime minister in a year; his successor turned out to be the first socialist in the office for nearly fifty years; and the government he formed on Thursday is perhaps the oddest coalition of unlike minds ever to sit in cabinet together. And despite all that the yen finally reached parity with the US cent. The markets paid little heed to the country's increasingly surreal political developments, but the yen was another matter. Attention was focused on the Bank of Japan, which spent more than Dollars 10bn in an attempt to prop up the dollar. The BoJ does not wish to ride to the US currency's rescue with an interest rate cut. This week the Japanese bond market is nervously awaiting the outcome of the struggle between the bank and the currency markets. Behind the bank's reluctance to raise rates is a belief that the yen's strength is a temporary phenomenon. It has repeatedly argued that the economy is recovering from the recession. Favourable figures for first quarter GDP growth seemed to support that view. If the recovery continues, the Japanese trade surplus, the key to the dollar's difficulties, will decline as imports recover. Inflation, though not an immediate risk, is still around the corner, says the bank. The bond market has shared the BoJ's analysis. Bond prices have slumped since the start of the year. Even last week, as the dollar fell, bond prices eased again slightly, and the yield on the 10-year bellwether bond reached a one-year-high at 4.6 per cent. But there are two reasons to be sceptical about the bank's prognosis, and to be bullish on bonds. Unlike other currency crises this one is less about speculative flows in the yen's favour and more about real economic flows. The Japanese economy is running huge surpluses on both its current account and its capital account. Though the current account surplus shrank slightly in the first quarter - down from Dollars 32bn to Dollars 30bn - it was more than offset by the capital account, which recorded a surplus of Dollars 47bn in the first quarter, against a deficit of Dollars 6bn in the first quarter of 1993. Investors have been pouring money into Japanese assets as other countries' stock markets have plunged. Though this cannot be sustained in the long term, it explains why demand for yen is so strong. The recovery is far from guaranteed, especially with the yen obstinately high. Consumer spending is recovering anaemically. The current account surplus represents the excess of domestic savings over domestic investment, and while savings are falling slightly, investment is still in deep decline. Moreover, despite the central banker's typical caution, inflation is non-existent in Japan. International pressure will intensify for a monetary easing. Though the dollar's difficulties are global, it is the US-Japan bilateral trade relationship that is the greatest source of its weakness. A further cut in Japanese rates would assist the economy and reduce the imbalance. Equities While the rest of the world's bond and equity markets have moved in tandem this year, Japan's have become uncoupled. The country is at the stage of the business cycle where the two can, for a while, move in opposite directions, as investors believe the as-yet-unrealised profits recovery will offset the impact of higher interest rates. So far this year, the Nikkei has been driven upwards almost exclusively by foreign money. In the first three months of the year, foreign net purchases of Japanese equities were greater than in the entire previous two years. Domestic investors remain uninterested. But in the past two months, the flow from abroad has dried up, and foreigners became net sellers in May, tempted by profit-taking. And no wonder. The wise investor who exchanged US dollars for Japanese equities on December 31 last year would have gained more than 30 per cent in the six months since, as equities have risen by 20 per cent and the yen has climbed by 10 per cent. The even wiser investor who liquidated UK equities in order to buy the Japanese stocks would have made a total opportunity gain of more than 40 per cent. With that sort of profit in six months, the foreign-led charge looks like fading. Optimists are pinning their hopes on domestic investors to take up the slack. But if they continue to stay away it is hard to see where the market's gains are coming from. Too many of the institutions had their fingers burnt last summer, when, having missed out on a similar Nikkei rally in the first half of the year, they plunged in late only to find the market drop through the floor for the rest of the year. Individual investors, the motor behind much of the market's ascent in the so-called 'bubble years', are still too shell-shocked by the subsequent collapse to venture away from safety of their deposit accounts. Even if there were a further cut in interest rates, it is unlikely that savings rates can fall much lower, and it is unlikely that individuals would be be tempted back into equities. Banks Japan's banks have made strenuous efforts recently to convince investors that the worst of their difficulties are over. This year they are claiming that an aggressive policy of writing off bad debts in the past two years has paid off. More than half the main 'city' banks claimed that their total problem loans had peaked in the year to end-March. One of the few problems they face which is not of their own making is the regulatory approach of the Ministry of Finance. Concerned about the effect of tax-deductible provisions on fiscal revenues, the MoF has in the past taken a miserly view of provisioning, requiring banks to justify in detail every loan they plan to write off or provision. But the MoF has now confirmed that in the past few months it has taken a more liberal approach to bad debt provisions, and banks' write-offs are expected to increase sharply this year. Banks' declared problem loans are, however, only a proportion of the total, since they do not include loans to companies in trouble which have not actually defaulted. Nonetheless, the MoF's new-found leniency will improve the longer-term earnings outlook for the stronger banks.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total return in local currency to 2/6/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               % change over period                   US   Japan   Germany   France   Italy      UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week            0.08    0.04      0.09     0.10    0.15    0.09 Month           0.36    0.18      0.43     0.47    0.64    0.42 Year            3.63    3.19      6.56     6.19    9.50    5.81  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week           -0.65    0.61      0.01     0.53   -0.01   -0.15 Month          -0.01   -0.85     -0.39    -0.32   -1.87    0.44 Year           -0.76    5.43      5.05     3.70    9.81    2.58  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week           -1.38    0.19     -0.25     0.56   -0.90   -0.28 Month          -0.56   -2.69      0.18    -0.78   -3.25    0.74 Year           -3.67    5.86      2.79     1.02   10.15    0.63  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week            -1.1    -0.5       0.0     -1.7    -3.1    -0.7 Month           -2.3    -0.9      -4.0     -6.5    -7.2    -1.7 Year             1.1     7.6      19.0      3.1    27.0     5.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

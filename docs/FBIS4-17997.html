			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Glazovskaya and </F> Mikhail Kalmykov]    [Text] Ashkhabad 29 April TASS -- The central event of the  French President Francois Mitterand's visit to Turkmenistan was  a treaty on friendship and cooperation between the two countries  signed on Thursday evening, the treaty laid the foundation to  further development of Russo-Turkmen contacts.    Besides, intergovernment agreements on cooperation in mutual  protection of investments and cultural exchange were signed  between foreign ministries of the two countries. A document on  preventing double taxation was coordinated by the two sides as  well.    During the talks the sides discussed a wide range of  problems, paying particular attention to the situation in the  Central Asian region and primarily, in Tajikistan and  Afghanistan.    Turkmen officials have reiterated their position of  non-interference into regional conflicts. They believe that the  Afghan and the Tajik people can decide their fates themselves.  The Turkmen side believes that Tajikistan needs national accord  and consolidation. Any attempt to impose any variant from the  outside might worsen the situation, said Boris Shikhmuradov,  vice-premier of the Turkmen government in an interview with  ITAR-TASS.    "We do not join coalition forces for the maintenance of  peace  in Tajikistan. We proceed from the assumption that there is no  external enemy there," Shikhmuradov said. "Present clashes on  the Tajik-Afghan border is not the cause, but rather the  consequence of internal instability in Tajikistan," the Turkmen  vice-premier said, adding that the Tajik point of view was  brought to the notice of the French side.    France expressed satisfaction over the fact that despite a  difficult situation in the vicinity of its borders Turkmenistan  managed to preserve a certain balance of interests, a balance of  forces. France looks upon stable Turkmenistan as a  peace-keeping factor in the region.    For its part, Turkmenistan regards the French president's  visit as a sign that the country is prepared to make its  contribution to regional peace-keeping activities.    During the talks the sides discussed joint economic projects  in spheres of priority importance for Tajikistan, including the  development and transportation of oil and gas. Turkmenistan  believes that having won the financial and technological support  of French companies, it will soon turn into one of the leaders  of the world energy exports.    The completion of the central Asian tour made by the French  president heralds doubtless success of the Uzbek and French  diplomacy. It was announced in Ashgabat that France would soon  open its permanent diplomatic mission there which was  persistently requested by the Turkmen leader.</p>

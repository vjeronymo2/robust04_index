			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> It's a sign of the times that Nordstrom department stores has been solemnly  promising in its advertisements that "you won't find any Christmas trim in our  stores until after Thanksgiving is over."  </P> <P> The Alliance for Survival is holding a different kind of Christmas toy party in  Santa Monica on Saturday (well, it is two days after Thanksgiving.)  </P> <P> At noon, the other Santa -- Claus -- will pull into Palisades Park, at the  corner of Ocean and Colorado avenues, and give away teddy bears to anyone who  turns in their war toys to him.  </P> <P> It's the kids' version of L.A. City Councilman Nate Holden's offer to buy back  the automatic rifles of area residents earlier this year.  </P> <P> The week before the recent opening of "Back to the Future Part II," time played  some tricks off screen.  </P> <P> First, a giant billboard digital clock on Sunset Boulevard that was counting  back the hours to the film's opening stopped a few days early and had to be  repaired.  </P> <P> Then, writes attentive viewer Joyce Clark Shults, the night that NBC played the  original "Back to the Future," it followed up with "a promo on the 11 o'clock  news for the Carson and Letterman shows with film clips from the previous  night's show (which I had seen). Whoever was in charge must really have got  sucked into the movie."  </P> <P> Ever wonder why Pacific Bell shed the term "information" for 411 calls in favor  of "directory assistance"?  </P> <P> The company says the problem was that it was often being asked, not for  telephone numbers, but for general information.  </P> <P> For instance, three of the more memorable questions thrown at operators were:  </P> <P> "How deep do you bury a dog?"  </P> <P> "How do you cook a roast?"  </P> <P> "What beats five-of-a-kind and a Royal Flush?"  </P> <P> Cannes, France, is the sister city of Beverly Hills -- what a glamorous family  -- and to celebrate the relationship, Mayor Michel Mouillot flew over here the  other day.  </P> <P> He attended a Beverly Hills City Council session, at which lawmakers wore  formal attire in honor of the occasion. Afterward, everyone trouped off to a  gala at the Beverly Wilshire that featured such celebrities as George Lazenby,  the one-movie James Bond, and Arthur Kassel, owner of the Beverly Hills Gun  Club.  </P> <P> "Zsa Zsa was there, mingling with the crowd," reported publicist Michael Sands.  </P> <P> Perhaps she was lobbying for a special showing at the next Cannes Film Festival  of her unforgettable 1959 hit, "Queen of Outer Space."  </P></p>

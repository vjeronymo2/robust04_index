			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hartons losses deepen to Pounds 5.4m Hartons Group, which through its VT Plastics division distributes plastic sheet and film, was hard hit by recession in its main markets of the UK and Europe and announced losses before tax more than doubled from Pounds 2.14m to Pounds 5.36m in the year to December 31. Turnover fell to Pounds 92.9m (Pounds 129m) and there was an operating loss of Pounds 918,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 3.42m in 1990. Interest charges fell to Pounds 2.99m (Pounds 4.33m) because of reduced borrowings. But exceptional items of Pounds 1.22m, the cost of further rationalisation, were unchanged. The company's North American distribution business was sold in July last year, leading to an extraordinary loss of Pounds 617,000. Losses attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 2.8m) and there were losses per share of 8.1p (3.6p). No dividend is proposed.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (16): Changing the climate of ideas - The country's central bank, the People's Bank of China As China becomes a market economy, albeit a 'socialist' one, it needs a proper central bank. What it has, instead, is the People's Bank of China. If the latter is to become a less unsatisfactory institution, major reforms must be made to its internal structure. But changes are needed still more to the public finances, to the operation of local government and state-owned enterprises, to the financial system and, not least, to the climate of ideas about monetary policy. According to World Bank calculations, China's consolidated fiscal deficit has run at an average rate of between 5.2 and 6.2 per cent of gross domestic product over the past seven years. Moreover, the PBC has been financing about 60 per cent of this. In 1993, total gross lending by the PBC to the financial system, largely for so-called 'policy-lending', reached 8.5 per cent of GDP. While central bank financing on this scale is incompatible with monetary stability, alternatives involve raising taxes, lowering spending, or raising money in more costly ways. Almost as important as the size of monetary financing is the loss of central control over credit expansion, largely a result of administrative decentralisation. Local government-led excess demand tends to be accommodated by the expansion of planned credit ceilings, which leads, in turn, to higher levels of PBC lending. Because government (at all levels) is so dependent for financing on the PBC's printing press, the authorities have also had to restrict the financial liberalisation that would allow the emergence of more competitive alternatives to cash and bank deposits. This, however, creates yet another obstacle to central bank reform: the lack of sophisticated securities markets, which would permit monetary policy to operate other than disruptively, through overall credit ceilings. This need to impose credit rationing is increased by the persistent tendency to keep interest rates low. PBC loans are subsidised to different degrees below the base interest rates for bank loans, themselves low. Moreover, rates of interest tend to be furthest below inflation when the latter is high, which is precisely when credit growth needs to be curbed. The consequence is chronic excess demand for credit, exacerbated by the lack of a credible bankruptcy constraint on state enterprises and local government borrowers. It has been estimated that more than half of the PBC's loans are not repaid. In 1993, concern about overheating and excessive lending led to centralisation of all authority for PBC lending and allocation of credit quotas in Beijing. In a country as vast as China, however, such centralisation must be temporary. When it is relaxed, so ineluctably is monetary control. Better monetary control and improved banking supervision depend on making the state banks more autonomous and commercially minded. Similarly, monetary policy will remain a blunt instrument, so long as China's financial markets remain undeveloped. If that is to be allowed to change, however, public finances must improve, which depends, in turn, on the success of current fiscal reforms, on cleaning out the Augean stables of loss-making state enterprises and on disciplining the 'investment hunger' of local government. But before all else, people in authority need to appreciate the inflationary risk of continued monetary financing of the consolidated budget. At present, many policy-makers and analysts are not only insouciant about inflation, but are unwilling to recognise its underlying monetary causes. The hope has to be that they do not end up learning their lesson the hard way.</p>

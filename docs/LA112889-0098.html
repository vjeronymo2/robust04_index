			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADOR MISSILES ARE ON BUSH'S SUMMIT AGENDA  </P> <P> President Bush will tell Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their summit  conference this weekend that the deployment of surface-to-air missiles in El  Salvador "is a dangerous escalation" of the conflict there, the Administration  said Monday, suggesting that Central American conflicts threaten improved  superpower relations.  </P> <P> At the same time, the President's spokesman indicated that because of reforms  in Eastern Europe, the President would be prepared to discuss even deeper cuts  in East-West troop strength in Europe than he had previously recommended.  </P> <P> As Bush began his final days of preparations for the weekend meeting aboard  Soviet and U.S. warships in the Mediterranean off the coast of Malta, his  Administration is tugged in opposite directions: U.S. officials are upbeat as  they look at the dramatic movements toward democracy in Eastern Europe, but  they are speaking harshly about the impact that leftist operations in Central  America are having on U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> On Saturday night, a senior Soviet diplomat was summoned to the State  Department, where Robert Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political  affairs, delivered a protest over the alleged shipment of missiles from  Nicaragua to El Salvador, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said  Monday.  </P> <P> And, she said, Bush would raise the issue with Gorbachev "in the strongest  terms," telling him, in effect, "you obviously have influence with these people  (in Nicaragua) -- use it."  </P> <P> A Cessna airplane carrying anti-aircraft missiles, most of them Soviet-made,  crashed in El Salvador on Saturday. The U.S.-supported government of El  Salvador says that the flight originated in Nicaragua and was intended to  supply leftist guerrillas.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater raised the possibility that Bush  would propose that the United States and the Soviet Union embark on deep cuts  in the number of troops they have stationed in Europe. He said that in  preparation for the summit, as well as for the budget recommendations he will  make early next year, "the President and his top advisers are considering a  wide range of military options that involve a number of different force levels  and a number of different estimates of budgetary reductions."  </P></p>

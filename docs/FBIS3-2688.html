			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by staff news team: "Latest Amendment to </F> Li Peng's Report"]    [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- Premier Li Peng's  government work report has been prepared since the end of last  year. The original draft was amended several times. By  extensively soliciting views from all quarters, it became a  draft that reflects all their views. A few days ago, the report  was issued to members of the National People's Congress [NPC]  and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who  would be attending the sessions. It should be noted that there  were four new additions to the work report when when Li Peng  read it today.    First, there were the contents on helping the poor, which  read: "Conscientiously carry out the poverty assistance plan.  The plan is intended to help poverty-stricken areas --  especially former liberated areas, minority nationality areas,  and border areas -- solve the problem of food and clothing for  some 80 million people and to help them out of poverty in the  seven years from now to the end of this century. This is the  unshirkable duty of governments at all levels. We believe that  this plan surely will be ardently supported by people across the  country." This was inserted into the paragraph on agriculture  and the rural areas in the second part of the work report and  obviously was related to the National Poverty Assistance  Conference, which preceded the NPC session. One can see from  this that the central authorities have attached more importance  to the issue.  <H5>  Regulating the Widening Income Gap </H5>   Pertinent to the above were the added remarks regarding  improving the people's living standards in the second part of  the work report, in light of the widening gap between rich and  poor in China today. They read: "In the meantime, it is  necessary to carry out necessary regulation of the excessively  widening income gap through a policy of rational distribution  and the regulatory role of tax revenue."    Exactly 100 characters were added to the paragraph on the  Hong Kong issue in today's work report, namely: "In keeping  with the Basic Law and the decisions of the NPC standing  committees, the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region [SAR] has begun its work. Its tasks are formidable and  its responsibilities are great. I hope the PWC will unite Hong  Kong compatriots to the greatest possible extent and will make  all good preparations for setting up the Hong Kong SAR and its  first government and legislature in such a way that it will live  up to the expectations and earnest trust of people across the  country."    The emphasis of the remarks naturally stresses the work of  the PWC and surely will draw the exceedingly great attention of  the Hong Kong community and media. Here one can see the Chinese  Government's firm position on the British uncooperativeness and  confrontation.  <H5>  On the Human Rights Issue </H5>   In today's work report, the largest proportion and weight  were added to the paragraph on human rights, in that the  following remarks were added in the last paragraph of the  seventh part (on diplomacy): "China attaches importance to  human rights and is willing to participate in discussions on the  human rights issue with the international community on the basis  of mutual equality. However, it never allows anyone to interfere  with China's internal affairs on any pretext. The Chinese  Government supports the UN Human Rights Commission in its recent  denouncement of some countries that exert pressure on developing  countries.    "Deputies, I am going to announce to every one of you a  piece  of information which I have just received. Last night, the UN  Human Rights Commission once again voted against and thwarted an  anti-Chinese resolution proposed by some countries! This fully  demonstrates that there is no popular support for the use of the  human rights issue against China. Here, on behalf of the  Chinese Government and people, I express my heartfelt to the  various countries that uphold justice and that support China!"    We can say this was China's good counterattack against the  pressure and interference of the West over the human rights  issue. It was made on just grounds and it was reasonable and  restrained. It also demonstrates the poise of a great country.</p>

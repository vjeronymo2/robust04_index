			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FACTORY ORDERS FALL 1.3% IN JANUARY  </P> <P> Factory orders fell 1.3% in January in the largest decline in five months as  transportation orders, mainly for defense goods, were cut back, the Commerce  Department said today.  </P> <P> Excluding volatile defense orders, factory orders edged up 0.2% in January, the  department said. The $3.1-billion decline in factory orders was the first since  a 1.9% drop in September and was in line with most analysts' predictions. It  brought the level of orders in January to $235.8 billion, adjusted for seasonal  changes.  </P> <P> For all of last year, factory orders gained 9.7% over the previous year, when  they rose 7.1%. But volatility in the defense and transportation categories can  cause wide fluctuations in factory orders from month to month.  </P></p>

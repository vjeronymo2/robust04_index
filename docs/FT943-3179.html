			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Observer: Tactical retreat Sounds as if one very important person is going to be missing from today's junkets following the loan-signing in Warsaw of Poland's debt reduction deal  -and it is not Citibank's Bill Rhodes. Polish president Lech Walesa has cried off, citing a previous engagement in Poznan where he is due to fire the closing shot in the first ever Nato manoeuvres on Polish soil. Some western bankers are miffed since the president's diary seems remarkably empty today. He's not due on parade in Poznan till tomorrow. Could it be that Walesa is playing safe and distancing himself from a deal which could turn out to be a mite too generous to the banks? Much more likely is that he is desperate to get Poland into Nato and doesn't want to do anything to upset the Nato high command. Bankers are much more expendable.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We are ready to conduct a dialog with various  political forces, both left and right, in the new parliament,  former Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma stated. At a  press conference devoted to problems related to forging a  parliamentary faction of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms  [MBR], he said he is ready to cooperate with all parties and  movements, but only on issues of mutual interest. In this case,  Leonid Kuchma noted, I do not rule out negotiations with  Vyacheslav Chornovil. In the recent election, the former prime  minister said, those who bet on Ukraine's self- isolation  failed. Speaking on the country's economic situation, the MBR  leader noted that the West is right in calling Ukraine Central  European Columbia. Without privatization and the complete  restructuring of the country's economy, Western capital will not  come to us. The United States of America, Leonid Kuchma said,  will not give Ukraine a penny until it makes sure that Ukrainian  economy is stable and receives guarantees for the capital  invested into it.</p>

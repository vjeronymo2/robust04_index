			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Second 'futures-type' offering from Citibank Citibank has launched its second offering of bonds with an embedded futures fund programme to enhance returns. The structure is designed to attract investors who are not comfortable with buying, or not allowed to buy, futures funds outright. Futures funds, which are highly leveraged, can offer much higher returns than conventional investments over the long-term, but are also much more volatile, and can fall rapidly. The concept is similar to a guaranteed fund. Around 80 per cent of the proceeds of the offering is used to buy securities issued by AAA-rated supranational and financial institutions, while the remaining 20 per cent is invested in a multi-adviser trading account operated by Kenmar Global Strategies, a trading manager. The programme, which has been operating since 1985, has had an annual compound rate of return of approximately 40 per cent. The notes are designed to pay a fixed minimum coupon which declines over the life of the issue, as the gains from the trading programme kick in. There is also a maximum coupon level. Any cumulative net trading gains are retained in the trading account to be reinvested and potentially to enhance the capital value of the notes. The three new issues (Keynote US Floating, Keynote US Fixed and Keynote D-mark), totalling Dollars 150m equivalent, are structured as Eurobonds.</p>

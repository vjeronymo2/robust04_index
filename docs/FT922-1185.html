			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: Stress must be seen in the social context Sir, Jenny Cozens' 'How stress can make you tick at work' (Management, June 19) is an informative account of developments of psychologists' work on stress. However, as in much work on stress, she neglects contributions from other disciplines such as sociology. The renewed emphasis on the individual as a source of stress is not only symbolic of 1980s individualism but, more important, consistent with psychological analysis which considers individual psychology without an understanding of social context. There is no recognition of the relationship between the subjective experience of stress and the social conditions which may give rise to it. Instead we are offered so-called 'objective' measurements such as heart-rate or a discussion of personality variables. Dealing with stress at work through the use of workplace counselling services and stress management courses is commonplace in North America. Increasingly, such facilities are being introduced in British work organisations. Although employees may derive some genuine benefit from these facilities, it is important to recognise their implications. By focusing on the individual, questions of the structure and organisation of work are made into personal problems. Psychologists would help employees more if they were to counter rather than reinforce the prevalent but dangerous belief that some people 'naturally' cope better than others.

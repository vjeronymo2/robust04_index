			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Overhead Electric Lines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (d)(8)(i) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that logging operations near overhead electric lines be done in accordance with the requirements of 1910.333(c)(3). The proposed rule repeated some of the requirements of 1910.333(c)(3). The pulpwood logging standard did not contain any provision regarding overhead electric wires. All State logging standards contain restrictions regarding felling near power lines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment was received addressing minimum clearance from overhead lines (Ex. 5&hyph;34). This commenter suggested that when the line voltage is unknown and other information indicates that the line is obviously high voltage, a minimum clearance of 20 feet must be maintained from the line until the line voltage is established by the electrical system operator. The separation distance recommended by the commenter would provide clearance that would only be warranted by a 350 KV line. OSHA believes that maintenance of that great a separation distance is unnecessary in this rule. High voltage lines of this order of magnitude are usually on tall transmission towers, therefore it is highly unlikely any employee would come in contact with the line or have any means of getting near the line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that 1910.333(c)(3) adequately spells out the precautions and clearances that must be taken when working near overhead lines. OSHA finds nothing indicating that logging is different from the rest of general industry, therefore, the Agency does not believe a special provision is necessary to address the logging industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (d)(8)(ii) OSHA is requiring the employer to immediately notify the power company when any felled tree comes into contact with a power line. This provision also requires each employee to remain clear of the area until the power company advises there are no electrical hazards. OSHA has adopted this provision from the proposed standard. OSHA did not receive any comments on this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Flammable and Combustible Liquids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (d)(9) of the final rule, OSHA is including requirements for the safe handling and use of flammable and combustible liquids. As was proposed, the final rule requires such liquids to be stored, handled, transported and used in accordance with subpart H of Part 1910.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters opposed this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;34). One commenter stated:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> After carrying a 40 pound saw, lunch, water, wedges and wrenches, the last thing the timber faller wants to add is more weight. So when he goes to carry fuel and oil it's normally carried in labeled plastic containers, generally in sizes not exceeding two quarts. To carry fuel in approved containers would do nothing more than add back injuries to the statistics (Ex. 5&hyph;7).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response, OSHA points out that there are approved plastic storage containers available in small sizes, such as two quart containers. Nothing in the final rule or subpart H of part 1910 prohibits employers from using small plastic storage containers, provided they meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.106. Further under 29 CFR 1910.106, the maximum allowable size of approved plastic fuel container is one gallon. OSHA does not believe that carrying one gallon or less of fuel in a plastic container will substantially increase back injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that flammable and combustible liquids not be transported in the driver's compartment or in any passenger-occupied area of a machine or vehicle. OSHA is aware that pick-up trucks are often used to transport employees to a logging work site. Transportation of flammable and combustible liquids in the passenger compartment of these vehicles exposes the driver and passenger to fire and explosion hazards and is not a safe practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (d)(9)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring that each machine, vehicle and portable powered tool, such as chain saw, be shut off during refueling. OSHA has added this requirement because it believes that when handling flammable and combustible liquids, it is essential to eliminate sources of ignition. The requirement to shut off the engines of motor vehicles when they are refueled is mandatory in most states and is clearly posted in service stations. Because OSHA believes that it is essential to minimize the sources of ignition when refueling vehicles, the Agency has retained the requirement as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (d)(9)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that flammable or combustible liquids not be used to start fires. The proposed rule contained a requirement that chain saw fuel not be used to start fires. While several commenters supported this requirement (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92), other commenters, including the State of Washington, opposed the provision (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;66). They said that loggers would use whatever material they have to start a fire rather than losing production time to return to a vehicle to obtain materials. In addition, the State of Washington said they were not aware of any injuries occurring as a result of this practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

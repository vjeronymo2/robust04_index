The latent debt must somehow be funded in the future, said  Kazuhiko Takeshima, deputy director general of the ministry's  budget bureau. Fiscal 1994 ends in March 1995. He was replying  to questions in the Finance Committee of the Diet's House of  Representatives.    The debt includes 26 trillion yen in borrowings from  Japanese  National Railways Settlement Corp., and unspecified sums from  local governments and from government-sponsored medical  insurance programs, Takeshima said. Such debt results mainly  from deferred regular fund allocations in budgets, and the  ministry has been using this technical accounting method in  budgets over the past years to avoid issuing deficit-covering  bonds amid tough revenue conditions.    In the fiscal 1994 budget package, now awaiting Diet  deliberations, the ministry is to issue some 3 trillion yen  worth of deficit-covering bonds to finance planned tax cuts, but  is also using the method to avoid excessive bond issuances.    Meanwhile, the outstanding balance of official national  long-term debt is estimated to reach 261.8 trillion yen at the  end of the new fiscal year, Takeshima said. He said 201  trillion yen is from issuances of government bonds, and the rest  is borrowings mainly from the special budgetary account on  postal savings.    He said the balance of local government bonds is expected to  reach 77 trillion yen.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Aideed to attend talks Somalia's most powerful warlord, Mohammed Farah Aideed, gave a big boost to peace hopes for his shattered country yesterday by ending a boycott and flying to talks with his main rival, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa. Gen Aideed, who had said he would not attend because he feared the United Nations or the US might arrest him, arrived in Ethiopia aboard a US aircraft for talks that will include his arch-foe, Ali Mahdi Mohammed. A UN spokesman in Somalia told reporters Gen Aideed agreed to attend the talks after the US, whose troops had scoured Mogadishu to try to arrest him, assured him his life would not be in danger.</p>

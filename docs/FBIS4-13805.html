			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Muhammad </F> al-Hinnawi in Tel Aviv; date not given]    [Text] [Al-Hinnawi] Have there been contacts between you  and 'Arafat following the recent acts of violence? Do you  believe that more acts of reciprocal violence will adversely  affect the peace process?    [Rabin] I believe that the Israeli Government and its prime  minister and the PLO and its chairman Yasir 'Arafat must pursue  two parallel courses simultaneously. The first course is to  focus on the negotiations to reach an agreement on the  Gaza-Jericho First accord. This, in my opinion, is the best  response to the enemies of peace from among the Israelis and  Palestinians. The second course is that when a mistake is made  either by the Israelis or the Palestinians, such as an act of  violence or terrorism, especially if it is directed against  innocent people, we must show [sentence incomplete]. For  example, the Hebron massacre, which was committed by a mentally  disturbed Israeli murderer, is as serious as the attack on the  bus that was carrying innocent Israelis. Both the Palestinian  and Israeli sides must show that we have reached a point in  which we are trying to resolve the conflict by negotiations and  not by violence and terrorism. I myself did not listen to the  shouts of the demonstrators in Israeli towns after the brutal  acts which Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out in Afula and  Hadera. I explained to the Israeli public that we will continue  the negotiations without delay or postponement.    The PLO suspended the talks with Israel for a month  following  the Hebron massacre. A number of Israelis asked me why they  stopped the talks after the Hebron massacre and we did not halt  them after the terrorist attacks against us. My answer was that  I am doing what I believe to be correct.    I explained this stand of mine in my telephone conversation  with Chairman 'Arafat. I believe if we want to give a real  response to the enemies of peace, we must show them that we can  reach an agreement and implement it. Any terrorist activity and  any act of violence against Israeli and Palestinian citizens  aims at obstructing the attainment and implementation of an  agreement. In the telephone conversation I explained to 'Arafat  that we will continue the negotiations as scheduled on Sunday  despite the terrorist acts. Our delegation will leave for Cairo  to resume the talks on Monday. You might ask me why the talks  were postponed from Sunday to Monday. My answer is that the  postponement was in response to a request from the Palestinian  side.    [Al-Hinnawi] Will an agreement be signed in Cairo between  the Palestinians and Israel before the end of April and during  the upcoming tour of the U.S. Secretary of State to the region?    [Rabin] In accordance to what was agreed upon in Cairo in  December, we must take into consideration that if we do not  prepare well for the upcoming meeting, it will mean failure.  And failure means frustration and disappointment. Therefore,  in the last meeting in Cairo we agreed on the following:    1. Whatever is agreed upon will be written down and  initialed.    2. Matters on which no agreement is reached will be  divided into two parts:    A. Topics necessary for inclusion in the agreements that  precede the implementation.    B. Topics that we will continue to discuss but that are  not in existing agreements; these are topics that will not  prevent us from implementing the agreement. This is how we are  working. I believe we have reached agreement on most solutions  and basic points. Anything on which agreement is reached and  which is signed must not be reopened for discussion. For  example, the Declaration of Principles that we signed in  Washington and the Cairo agreement and the maps appended to it  will not be reopened for discussion. If we do this, we will be  going around in a vicious circle. We have already wasted a lot  of time discussing matters on which agreement had been reached  in the previous two agreements.    [Al-Hinnawi] Certain reports say that if no agreement is  reached by the end of this month, you will implement what was  actually agreed upon.    [Rabin] We must sign an agreement that it is possible to  implement. In other words, when we hold negotiations over peace  with an Arab state, the agreement should be clear. Our  negotiations must revolve around the meaning of peace, the issue  of borders, the security arrangements, the stages of the  implementation of the agreement, and whether the various stages  will overlap in a way similar to what happened with Egypt.    But what we are trying to do with the Palestinians is  peaceful coexistence without division or clear lines, because  there are no dividing lines. For example, as regards the route  between Gaza and Jericho and which falls within Israel's  borders, we must allow the Palestinians to use this route. We  must, therefore, agree on the security arrangements concerning  this point. This is more difficult than reaching a peace  agreement with Jordan, Lebanon, or even Syria. The agreement  with the Palestinians is a temporary one, for self-rule. We  have approved many of the Palestinians' demands because we don't  want to waste time in search of this or that change.    [Al-Hinnawi] Did you start any unofficial secret talks with  Syria as you did with the PLO far from the press and spotlights?    [Rabin] As far as I recall, we tried to arrange a quiet  meeting with the Syrians. But they refused. I believe that  without a quiet and unannounced meeting, it would be difficult  to reach an agreement. Recent history explains this. Since  1977, no agreement has been reached without holding unannounced  preliminary contacts. Even President Anwar al-Sadat's visit to  Jerusalem could not have been made had it not been for the  unpublicized preliminary talks between al-Tuhami [an adviser to  al-Sadat] and Moshe Dayan in Morocco during the summer of 1977.  It was a long time before the majority of the Israeli cabinet  members knew about these talks. The same thing happened with  the other Arab countries. Let me say frankly, it would have  been impossible to reach agreement with any Arab state and the  PLO without the secret talks that preceded the publicized talks.    [Al-Hinnawi] Does the long calm on the Syrian front mean  that  Syria is fully concerned with peace and that President al-Asad  is fully prepared for peace? And do you believe that Syria  could accept something less than Egypt accepted during the  complete withdrawal from the Egyptian territory? And is it  conceivable that a government led by you could refuse to sign an  agreement with Syria similar to that signed between the Likud  and Egypt?    [Rabin] Let me tell you the real difference between the  Egypt-Israel peace process and the situation between Syria and  Israel. As regards Egypt, President al-Sadat took an extremely  courageous step when he came to Israel. He managed to convince  the Israeli people that there is an Egyptian leader who decided  not to continue the war and confrontation and to get involved in  the peace process and negotiations without this changing Egypt's  view regarding the achievement of peace.    President al-Sadat did 80 percent of what was expected from  the Israeli Government and the prime minister of that time in  order to convince the Israeli people to pay the price of peace.  The Israeli people hold the same feelings toward President  Mubarak, who has for 12 and half years of the 15-year old peace  between Egypt and Israel been safeguarding and promoting the  peace process.    But President al-Asad has not done even one percent of what  Egypt has done to establish peace. He did not even declare  frankly his desire for peace. I agree with you that there are  no acts of aggression on the Syrian-Israeli front. But had it  not been for Syria's help, the 10 Palestinian rejectionist  organizations led by Ahmad Jibril, Hawatimah, Habash, Abu-Musa,  and others or even Hizballah would not be able to do what they  are currently doing. Syria talks peace and at the same time  allows these organizations to attack 'Arafat and the PLO because  of their negotiations with Israel. Syria is not only hosting  these organizations, but it also allows them to operate in  Lebanon. Therefore, although Syria is not directly involved in  acts of aggression against Israel, it has made it possible for  them to act. These organizations would have never been able to  act had it not been for Syria.    [Al-Hinnawi] Very well, Mr. Rabin. You said that when  President Anwar al-Sadat came to Israel he did 80 percent of the  Israeli Government's work, because he persuaded the Israelis  that he was serious about peace. What if another Arab leader,  President Hafiz al-Asad for example, were to visit Israel?  Perhaps you would later conclude that he failed to impress the  Israeli public with his seriousness about peace?    [Rabin] It is not necessary for al-Asad or anyone else to  come to Israel. Let me tell you something. Why have I  insisted that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations take place in  Cairo and not Washington? To avoid publicity.    Another thing. We believe that Egypt has done so much and we  appreciate that. We appreciate what President Husni Mubarak and  his government are doing to help the two sides, quietly and  backstage.    When Syria went to the Washington talks, the talks were  conducted on a relatively small scale. However, every  journalist expected a statement to come out of every meeting.  This is not the best way to work things out. The talks should  begin unofficially, quietly, and away from the media.    I would not call for a meeting between me and President  al-Asad tomorrow. Such a meeting would not be useful without  quiet preparations.    [Al-Hinnawi] Reports speak of rapprochement between Israel  and a number of Arab countries. Can you clarify the picture for  us a little?    [Rabin] I believe that peace between Egypt and Israel is  what  broke the ice between Israel and Arab countries. Undeniably,  Egypt is the largest and most important Arab country. In my  modest opinion, Egypt has proved that peace can be achieved and  maintained.    Another thing. When I took over as prime minister, the  Madrid Conference formula was already in place. We did nothing  to change that formula, but sought to create another channel.    We figured that the two keys to peace in the region are in  the hands of the Palestinians and the Syrians. Jordan wants to  be out in front [as published]. Lebanon does not want to do  anything without Syria's approval.    We studied the situation and reached the conclusion that it  is better to begin with the Palestinians on the basis of two  conditions; one is mutual recognition and the second is a  statement of principles. We made a historic change in our  policy toward the PLO. This change was based on the conditions  we agreed upon and later the letters of mutual recognition  appended to the Declaration of Principles.    Once we moved toward implementing the Declaration of  Principles, the ball started rolling. For example, the  multilateral talks of the Water Committee will begin in Muscat,  Oman, today. Early next month, the Arms Limitation Committee of  the multilateral talks will meet in Qatar. This would have been  unthinkable only a year and half ago. We have begun to see  change and its continuation depends to a large extent on the  Palestinians and the Syrians.    As for Morocco, it has a large Jewish community. Actually,  there is unofficial normalization between Morocco and Israel.  Israeli citizens can go to Morocco to try and improve economic  ties between the two countries. Israeli tourists are also  allowed into Morocco.    You must not forget that, in 1977, King Hassan helped  organize a meeting between senior Egyptian and Israeli officials  in Morocco, a meeting that helped set the peace process in  motion. Although there are no diplomatic ties between Israel  and Morocco, relations between us are good.    Our relations with Tunisia may not be quite as good as those  with Morocco. But the mere fact that the PLO leadership is  located in Tunisia and that many Israelis, particularly  journalists, go there is a measure of the level of relations  between the two countries.    [Al-Hinnawi] Do you believe that Russia still has a part to  play in the peace process?    [Rabin] Russia is one of the two countries sponsoring the  peace talks. I will visit Moscow on 24 April to meet President  Yeltsin. Chairman 'Arafat will also visit Russia to meet Yeltsin  on 18 and 19 of this month.    [Al-Hinnawi] Is there not a possibility of a meeting between  you and 'Arafat in Moscow?    [Rabin] I do not think so.    [Al-Hinnawi] Is U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's visit to the region at the end of this month  linked to the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement?    [Rabin] I do not think so. If we can reach an agreement  during this time, it will be good. Christopher is coming to the  region basically to give a boost to the multilateral talks.    [Al-Hinnawi] I would like to convey to you a message from  the  people of Gaza. I was there last week and saw for myself the  extent of the people's suffering as a result of sealing off the  Gaza Strip. The people in Gaza say that the recent acts of  terrorism did not come from Gaza. The Israeli Army and police  are imposing a security cordon around the city. Supplies of  medicines and oxygen necessary for surgery have stopped and  students are not going to their colleges and workers are not  going to work. Will this continue?    [Rabin] This is untrue. I know nothing about the stoppage of  medicine and oxygen supplies. I gave orders to supply the Gaza  population with their needs. The territories were sealed only  for those who come to work in Israel.    [Al-Hinnawi] Soldiers order drivers of vehicles carrying  oxygen and heading for the Gaza Strip to go back.    [Rabin] There is absolutely no need for such measures. Even  in Jerusalem we made special arrangements for doctors, nurses,  and workers in Palestinian hospitals and Palestinians working  for international organizations to go to work. All these  workers obtained licenses enabling them to go to work. The same  thing applies to Gaza.    [Al-Hinnawi] The Palestinians in Gaza are wondering why the  Israeli Government is taking these measures right before its  withdrawal and before the Palestinian authority undertakes its  mission. Are these the good-neighborly relations that Israel is  talking about? Israel is giving the worst picture of the future  neighborly relations it is seeking.    [Rabin] Yes, but you must not forget that I do not know who  will carry out the next terrorist operation.    [Al-Hinnawi] But you, Mr. Prime Minister, are meting out  collective punishment that is harming innocent people.    [Rabin] I have no option but to continue sealing off the  occupied areas in order to know what is going on and then to  decide what I can do.    [Al-Hinnawi] Despite the security cordon imposed on the Gaza  Strip, numerous acts of violence occurred recently. The  Palestinians in Gaza are wondering about the use of this  security seal.    [Rabin] You do not know the number of operations that have  been foiled as a result of sealing off the territories. I told  the Israelis that even after the territories were sealed off we  could not completely prevent terrorist operations. In  Jerusalem, for instance, the Palestinians used a vehicle with  Israeli plates and were able to move in all parts of Israel. In  certain areas the Israelis and Palestinians are only meters away  from each other. There are no walls and we do not want walls. I  would like to tell you as a fact that there are Israeli  businessmen who have received Palestinian workers in the heart  of Israel for months without obtaining a permit. We cannot  search every house. In the two cases involving killing and  violence, we found out that two Palestinians from Khan Yunus had  been in Israel since December. The real problem is that the  situation was so aggravated because of the Hebron massacre that  certain members of terrorist organizations were aroused to the  point that they decided in a moment of extreme anger to wield  knives and hatchets to attack Israelis. Regrettably, no device  has yet been invented to reveal man's inner intentions.</p>

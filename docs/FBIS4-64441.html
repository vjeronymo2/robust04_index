			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome (DPA) -- The talks conducted by Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl with Cardinal State Secretary Angelo  Sodano in The Vatican on Tuesday [3 May] focussed on  possibilities for cooperation in the search for a peaceful  solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Other issues discussed in the  meeting with the "head of government" of the church state were  the enlargement of the European Union, and the role of United  Nations in international hotspots, Vatican Spokesman Joaquin  Navarro-Valls said. Bilateral issues, such as the relationship  between the church and state in the FRG were also broached.    Kohl, who is due to return to Bonn on Tuesday night, asked  Sodano to convey to Pope John Paul II his best wishes for  recovery on behalf of the Federal Government. Originally, the  chancellor was scheduled to meet the pope, but the private  audience had to be canceled due to the church leader's hip  operation on Friday.    Upon his arrival in Rome on Monday night, Kohl paid tribute  to John Paul's role in the reshaping of Europe. The pope made  "an essential contribution to overcoming totalitarianism and the  division of Germany and Europe," Kohl said at a reception in the  German Embassy in the Vatican.</p>

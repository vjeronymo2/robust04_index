			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LUFTHANSA WON'T BAN SMOKING  </P> <P> Fear of in-flight clashes between militant smokers and nonsmokers has prompted  Lufthansa to drop plans to ban smoking on domestic flights, the airline said  today.  </P> <P> The national German carrier had planned to ban smoking on its flights with the  start of its winter schedule Oct. 28.  </P> <P> But Lufthansa said passenger reaction to its plans had been "extremely  divided," although a majority of smokers had indicated their willingness to  accept the ban.  </P> <P> But since federal lawmakers decided not to pass no-smoking legislation, barring  smoking on flights could lead to "polarization and confrontations among  passengers," the airline said. It said it could not allow passengers and cabin  crews to be involved in such situations.  </P></p>

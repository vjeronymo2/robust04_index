			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / France and Maastricht: Lyons ponders looming vote FRANCE'S second most important city has, for four years, been busy touting itself as the best compromise site for the planned European Central Bank (ECB). But the question now for the Lyonnais, days away from the referendum, is whether they can bring that prospect any nearer by helping approve Maastricht, the treaty basis for the ECB. 'The advantage of Lyons would be that the bank would not be as exposed to political pressure of any government, as it would be if it were placed in a capital city,' argues Mr Jean Chemain, director of Lyons' chamber of commerce. 'Nor would it give an unfair advantage to any of Europe's major financial centres over the others, as it would if the bank were sited in Frankfurt, London, or Paris,' he adds. The ideal political scenario for Lyons' promoters would be a geographical split. Their city, sitting right in the middle of the Community, would get the headquarters of the ECB whose operational arm would go to a world-level money centre such as London. But first, of course, the Maastricht treaty must win French approval in Sunday's referendum. This is unlikely if a cosmopolitan city such as Lyons, and its surrounding Rhone-Alpes region where foreign companies employ no fewer than 80,000 people, cannot muster a sizeable majority in favour of the European union treaty. Mr Bruno Charmasson of Le Progres, Lyons' main newspaper, sees a problem. 'The response of Lyons should be Yes in the referendum, but the city has traditionally had a higher anti-Mitterrand vote than the national average,' he says. The chances of a Lyonnais majority for Maastricht depend crucially on voters keeping European and national issues separate in their minds. A further local complication is that the local neo-Gaullist RPR is pretty solidly anti-Maastricht, though the party is somewhat weakened by the defection of the city's pro-treaty mayor, Mr Michel Noir. However, this week saw a closing of the pro-Maastricht ranks elsewhere in the opposition, when for the first time in eight years Mr Raymond Barre, the Lyonnais former prime minister, shared a platform with his former presidential boss, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing. The pair had parted on bitter terms after the Mitterrand victory in 1981. But at a recent rally in suburban Lyons, they made common cause to plead the case for a Yes to Maastricht which, as Mr Giscard d'Estaing stressed, should in no way prevent voters saying No to the Socialist government in next March's legislative elections.</p>

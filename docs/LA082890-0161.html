			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DALLAS DRAFTEE SMITH TURNS CRIME STOPPER  </P> <P> Dallas Cowboys first-round draft pick Emmitt Smith, currently a contract  holdout, has become a crime stopper.  </P> <P> Smith, who re-enrolled at the University of Florida last week because the  contract stalemate has put his NFL career on hold, chased down two students who  allegedly damaged a Florida player's car.  </P> <P> Smith held the students in a double headlock until campus police arrived,  Orlando Sentinel columnist Larry Guest reported.  </P> <P> The incident occurred about 2 a.m. Saturday. Guest said campus police and those  close to Smith gave this account:  </P> <P> Upon arriving at the athletic dormitory where he is staying with a former  teammate, Smith discovered two students jumping on the hood of tight end Kirk  Kirkpatrick's Corvette.  </P> <P> Smith used his car phone to call university police. When the students bolted,  Smith chased them down a narrow one-way street and past the campus chapel,  overtaking them behind the women's gym. He took them back to his dorm building  just as an officer arrived.  </P> <P> The students were cited for trespass and criminal mischief.  </P></p>

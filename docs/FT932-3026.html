			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Male claims of discrimination in job market increase sharply SEX discrimination complaints at work soared by nearly two-thirds last year. For the first time, men formed a large proportion of those claiming companies were biased in their hiring policies. The Equal Opportunities Commission, which published its 1992 annual report yesterday said there had been a 64 per cent increase over the previous year in complaints about workplace discrimination. The most common allegations concerned recruitment, terms and conditions, and sexual harassment. Of the 1,253 complaints to the commission about companies' hiring policies, 40 per cent had been from men, said the EOC. Ms Valerie Amos, chief executive, said the recession had made men 'much more aware of their rights'. Those men complaining about being turned down for jobs were typically aged 55 to 60 and redundancy victims. High male unemployment and greater opportunities in service-sector industries had driven men to seek jobs in traditionally female areas of work, said the EOC. Analysis of information gathered from about 400,000 employers by the Department of Employment, published last month, indicated that in 11 UK areas, women were now more likely to go to work than men, although nearly half of jobs done by women were part-time. Separate government figures show there are almost as many women in the workforce as men. The commission warned companies not to discriminate against men applying for traditionally 'women's' jobs after a 50-year-old man was turned down for a post in a children's nursery last year. He later won Pounds 600 at an industrial tribunal. Overall, the commission reported a 47 per cent increase, to 13,320, in the number of inquiries over the past year. The 'discriminatory practices of many employers who are shedding labour during the recession undoubtedly added to the EOC's load,' says the annual report.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Dollars sets opening low The dollar set a post-war opening low in Tokyo early today of Y96.51 despite reports of intervention by the Bank of Japan. Earlier it had lost ground in New York as stock and bond markets fell sharply after a report showing stronger-than-expected price pressures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 44.75 points to close at 3,863.37 and the 30-year Treasury bond fell almost a point. Page 4; US stocks, Page 41</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pension reform report delayed MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, announced yesterday that the conclusion of the review he set up into pension law after the raiding of Maxwell funds has been delayed by three months until September. The hold up, caused by the volume of evidence the inquiry has received, will lead to a corresponding delay before the government announces which of the review's proposals it intends to accept. Legislation on pension reform in the session of parliament starting in October is now ruled out. Instead, the government will probably introduce a pension reform bill in the 1994-95 session. Mr Lilley could decide to delay his plans for equalising male and female state retirement ages - currently expected in the next session of parliament  -by a further year so they can be included in the same bill. It still seems probable, however, that pensions equalisation will be introduced separately, if only because of the size of a joint bill. A final decision on the timing of legislation will depend on the competition between departments to win slots in the already-crowded legislative programme. Mr Lilley said the extra time for the Pension Law Review Committee had been requested by Professor Roy Goode, the committee's chairman, who is analysing the contents of 1,700 written submissions, seven days of hearings and three public meetings. Last June Mr Lilley told MPs that the inquiry would report within 12 months but his announcement yesterday extends the deadline until September 30. A period of consultation will follow before the government's legislative proposals are announced. Prof Goode said the committee had been working 'strenuously' to meet the deadline but now had a 'a much clearer picture of the range and complexity of the task'.</p>

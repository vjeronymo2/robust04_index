			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Zhang Bangdong (1728 6721 2767) and </F> reporter Zhou Zhifang (0719 1807 2455)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Chinese People's  Liberation Army [PLA] has achieved phenomenal success in  promoting military contacts with foreign countries over the past  one year. In addition to creating a new situation for exchange  with foreign countries, it has also contributed positively to  developing Chinese diplomacy and expediting the modernization of  the Chinese Armed Forces.    In 1993, Chinese Armed Forces received over 1,300 members of  120 military delegations and groups from more than 40 countries,  and sent more than 60 delegations and groups to visit 36  countries. During the same year, naval vessels and over 2,300  officers and men from Russia and three other countries visited  China, and the Chinese naval vessel, the "Zheng He," visited  Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Thailand.    Chinese Armed Forces continued to maintain relatively  high-level contacts with armed forces in neighboring countries  last year. The frequent exchange of visits by ranking officers  has contributed positively to promoting good neighborliness.  Chinese Armed Forces increased contacts and broadened exchanges  with armed forces of certain countries with which contacts had  been infrequent or disrupted. The establishment of contacts  with the armed forces of countries with which military contacts  were reestablished not long ago has enhanced mutual  understanding and friendship.    Chinese Armed Forces' specialized technological exchanges  with foreign armed forces were even more active. Some PLA  delegations and groups went abroad on study and inspection  tours, and for advance studies or technical training; and the  Chinese PLA also received many foreign delegations and  specialized technology groups. During the specialized  technological exchanges, Chinese Armed Forces and their foreign  counterparts shared with one another their experiences about  military construction and military science and technology, and  these exchanges have promoted understanding, developed  cooperation, and helped each other improve.    To display Chinese Armed Forces' successes in  revolutionization, modernization, and regularization, Chinese  Armed Forces and colleges opened to foreign visitors have been  making active efforts to improve their reception for foreign  visitors and they have acted as showcases exhibiting the bearing  and high morale of the Chinese Armed Forces.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "The Pajama Game" (1957), directed by Stanley Donen and George Abbott. 101  minutes.  </P> <P> No rating. The plot is frivolous and obvious, the acting hammy, and much of the  dialogue outright dumb, but who cares? This musical, starring Doris Day and  John Raitt, is buoyed by Richard Adler/Jerry Ross songs and Bob Fosse  choreography. And it's good clean American fun. DOUG LIST  </P></p>

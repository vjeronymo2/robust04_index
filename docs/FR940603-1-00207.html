Notwithstanding any certificate which may have been given by the Owner or the Engineer, if any materials, equipment (except owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship which does not comply with the requirements of this Contract shall be discovered within one (1) year after Completion of Construction of the Project, the Bidder shall replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy any such defective workmanship within thirty (30) days after notice in writing of the existence thereof shall have been given by the Owner. If the Bidder shall be called upon to replace any defective materials or equipment or to remedy defective workmanship as herein provided, the Owner, if so requested by the Bidder shall deenergize that section of the Project involved in such work. In the event of failure by the Bidder to do so, the Owner may replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy such defective workmanship, as the case may be, and in such event the Bidder shall pay to the Owner the cost and expense thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> ARTICLE III_PAYMENTS AND RELEASE OF LIENS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.

Within the first fifteen (15) days of each calendar month, the Owner shall make partial payment to the Bidder for construction accomplished during the preceding calendar month on the basis of completed Assembly Units furnished and certified to by the Bidder, recommended by the Engineer and approved by the Owner solely for the purposes of payment: Provided, however, that such approval shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials. Only ninety percent (90%) of each such estimate approved during the construction of the Project shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder prior to Completion of the Project: Provided, however, that at any time after work, which, in the sole determination of the Engineer, amounts to fifty percent (50%) of the Maximum Contract Price has been completed, the Owner may elect, in lieu of paying ninety percent (90%) of each such subsequent estimate, to pay each such subsequent estimate in full. Upon completion by the Bidder of the construction of the Project, the Engineer will prepare a Final Inventory of the Project showing the total number and character of Assembly Units and, after checking such Inventory with the Bidder, will certify it to the Owner, together with a certificate of the total cost of the construction performed. Upon the approval of such certificates by the Owner and the Administrator, the Owner shall make payment to the Bidder of all amounts to which the Bidder shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid: Provided, however, that such final payment shall be made not later than ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project, as specified in the Certificate of Completion, unless withheld because of the fault of the Bidder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

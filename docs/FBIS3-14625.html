The statement says that Algeria, its representation, and  consulates are today, more than at any other time, keen to hear  the concerns of the Algerian expatriate community.    The embassy views the expulsion order by absolute necessity  to be a measure which will lead to confusion in peoples' minds.    In the same statement, our embassy in Paris renews Algeria's  commitment to protect its subjects. It believes it is necessary  to recall ties of cooperation and interests between it and those  countries close to it.    The statement says that any attempt which is likely to lead  to the belief that the dignity of citizens could be the subject  of a misunderstanding is simply unacceptable. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said higher taxes probably will  be part of a bipartisan compromise budget plan in 1989. Michel said he does not  believe that spending can be cut enough to meet deficit limits set by law. "I  don't know that there is that much flexibility," he said. "I suspect (tax  increases) may be part of the answer." Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole  (R-Kan.), on the other hand, said he takes at face value President-elect George  Bush's stated opposition to a tax hike. Dole said: "I didn't coin the phrase  'read my lips,' but I think (Bush) means it and I don't see any give in that  area at this point." Michel and Dole were guests on ABC-TV's "This Week With  David Brinkley."  </P></p>

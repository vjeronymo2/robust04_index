			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Yorkshire TV faces fresh licence battle WHITE Rose Television, the defeated bidder for the Yorkshire television franchise, has called formally on the Independent Television Commission to revoke Yorkshire Television's licence. White Rose claims that Yorkshire will be unable to fulfil its programme promises because of its high bid and the fact that since the licence was awarded competition has increased and the advertising recession has continued. White Rose, which bid Pounds 17.4m to Yorkshire's Pounds 37.7m, has made its 100-page submission to the ITC backed by counsel's opinion under section 18 of the 1990 Broadcasting Act. The section says a licence can be revoked before it comes into effect if the ITC has reasonable grounds for believing that the promised service will not be provided. In a letter to Sir George Russell, ITC chairman, White Rose chairman Mr Richard Hanwell says: 'We all recognise the quality of YTV's proposed service - however, it is now certain that this service will never be delivered because of that company's impossibly high bid.' Yorkshire, in which Financial Times owner Pearson has a 20 per cent stake, said: 'Yorkshire has been advised that there is no legal basis for White Rose's submission and it is totally without merit.' White Rose estimates that Yorkshire will have to pay 36.5 per cent of its net advertising revenues to the government next year. The Yorkshire case, based on cash rather than percentages, is that next year the company is likely to have a gross cash margin of more than Pounds 90m after payments to the government.</p>

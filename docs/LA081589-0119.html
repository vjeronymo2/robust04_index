			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEW;  </P> <P> 10,000 MANIACS VISIT SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> Natalie Merchant, ravishing lead singer and lyricist of the equally ravishing  rock quintet 10,000 Maniacs, is in many of her songs a consignor in concern --  a musical merchant of angered consideration for the poor, the dispossessed, the  enslaved, abused children, American Indians, Nicaraguans, veterans,  what-have-you.  </P> <P> Latest cause: the future hearing-impaired.  </P> <P> "Shouldn't you be wearing your earplugs?" she asked a security guard standing  in front of the stageside speakers during a show early Sunday evening at the  Santa Barbara County Bowl -- the opening of a five-show Southern California  swing for the band. Said guard indicated that he liked the music too much to  obstruct his ear canals.  </P> <P> "You like the songs? As much as I like the songs, I wouldn't stand there  unprotected," she said. The guard dutifully put them in. "Just concerned about  your safety," Merchant added with a smile, tongue seemingly not very far in  cheek at all.  </P> <P> If such a penchant for maternal heedfulness suggests that Merchant is some kind  of rock 'n' roll mother figure, nothing could be further from the truth: What  didacticism there is in her bears the angry imprimatur of unspoiled, youthful  idealism carried on and branded into a wide-eyed, tenderhearted, liberally  world-conscious adulthood that's plenty risky enough.  </P> <P> And in the redoubtable 10,000 Maniacs, she has a world-class band to push her  into still graceful fits of seeming physical abandon. Much as she hates to hear  this kind of stuff, she could just be the (gag) sex symbol for a generation,  the one that sorta identifies with "thirtysomething" but hates its apologetic  gentility, the one that wants some juice-churning intestinal fortitude with its  prettiness.  </P> <P> Letting the easily distracted and prone-to-informality Merchant sing for a  California audience in broad daylight could have been a mistake. Sunday's set  began shortly after 6 with the group's strongest song, the child-abuse ditty  "What's the Matter Here?" Merchant was operating by rote at best, thanks to the  sun in her eyes. The number was redeemed only by a rabid solo by guitarist  Robert Buck that took the tastefulness of the recorded version and turned it  inside out -- a sign of terrific things to come.  </P> <P> Once Merchant became shaded later, her performance took better shape even as  she still spent much of the set nonchalantly observing the sort of things she  doesn't usually get to in the dark -- the dozens of fluorescent pink T-shirts  among the largely shorts-clad crowd, the way certain members of the crew at the  sound board dance.  </P> <P> "Ooh, I see that little boy up there showing his belly to his sister," she  cooed at one point, then apologized for making them self-conscious: "Didn't  mean to embarrass you."  </P> <P> Self-consciousness is not a problem of Merchant. She was motionless enough in  the early portions of the set, befitting her adjustment to the setting, but  eventually let go with the violent, balletic twists for which she's known,  joyful pirouettes that really do complement emotional turns in the faster  songs. (This isn't Stevie Nicks we're talking about.) And she was loose enough  to exclaim "oops" by the time she hit a sour note in a closing solo piano  medley.  </P> <P> Her lovely voice with the impossible-to-place accent could sing the proverbial  Yellow Pages and be believable, but is much more so in the service of a protest  song such as "Please Forgive Us," a plea of ignorance of Oliver North and the  likes addressed to a blood-spattered Central America. It was honey in the  soothing "Trouble Me" and venom in the spiteful "You Happy Puppet," which she  sang wearing a massive, ugly costume.  </P> <P> The evolution of 10,000 Maniacs from an R.E.M.-like groove-oriented folk-rock  band to a more pop song-oriented format has been both commercially and  aesthetically agreeable, but in concert, the group was able to find a fire that  the recorded mix doesn't usually allow. "Headstrong," a recent track in which  the band is mixed too low on album, was as noisy and beautifully distorted as  you'd hope live.  </P> <P> And not enough can be said in commendation of Buck, whose mostly gentle but  occasionally buck-wild stylization subtly incorporates everything from  surf-guitar tones to flamenco and who spends an inordinate amount of time  squeezing out notes from the high end of his guitar neck, making for unusually  bright tones even in minor keys.  </P> <P> 10,000 Maniacs plays the Greek Theatre tonight and Wednesday, with further  Southland dates Friday at Irvine Meadows and Saturday at San Diego's Open Air  Amphitheatre. Camper Van Beethoven, a somewhat goofier but equally hard-hitting  and worthwhile combo, opens all the shows.  </P> <P>  10,000 Maniacs and Camper Van Beethoven play rock Friday at 8 p.m. at the  Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. Tickets: $20.50  and $22.50 (plus $5 for parking). Information: (714) 855-6111.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: HE'S GOT THE WHOLE TOUR IN HIS HANDS  </P> <P> When young John Cook decided to come out on the golf tour, the game could  hardly wait. Sponsors drooled.  </P> <P> Handsome, blond, slim, he was as photogenic as a Hawaiian sunset. He had this  great, gorgeous looping swing. He could putt an acorn into a shot glass. He had  steady habits, he loved the game. Golf couldn't believe its good luck.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf, no less, went to work recruiting him to play at  their alma mater, Ohio State, although he had grown up in Southern California.  He led the school to the NCAA championship, as they knew he would.  </P> <P> He won the U.S. Amateur. He was a finalist another time. He won the World  Junior. If he had a flaw in his game, no one found it.  </P> <P> He won a tournament -- the Crosby -- before he had been a pro for a year. He  won the Canadian Open. He was way up on the money list. Hall of Fame, here I  come.  </P> <P> Then something happened to Cook's tour to the top. He became erratic. The club  seemed loose in his hands. The once crisp irons wobbled. The tee shots dived  and sank. The scores soared.  </P> <P> "Tournament nerves," the wise guys said. The kid found out the game wasn't all  birdies and pars. The ball didn't have to go into the hole.  </P> <P> John Cook thought it was something else. His hand felt funny, as if there were  a bag of loose marbles in there.  </P> <P> The doctors reassured him. A little tendinitis, they told him. Whatever was  wrong wasn't in the hand. Just hit through it, they advised.  </P> <P> John did. For seven years. He tried to keep up with the tour one-handed. Golf  is tough enough with two.  </P> <P> He played just brilliantly enough on occasions to cast doubt on his insistence  that he was spotting the field one whole hand.  </P> <P> "It's all in his head," they whispered. "The doctors said so."  </P> <P> So, the conclusion was, the game was just too tough for another fancy young  college boy shot-maker. You need more than blond hair and purple slacks and a  nice left-to-right fade to keep up in this game. Well of course you do. You  need a right hand, too. Even Mike Tyson needs that.  </P> <P> John Cook really didn't have one. But he had a tough job convincing the tour  when he won $333,184 in 1987. How can you do that with your left hand?  </P> <P> John Cook did. He led the tour in aspirin. He soaked his hand in the shower. He  squeezed rubber balls. If it was all in his head, how come his knuckles swelled  up?  </P> <P> He finally began to notice that his right hand would bubble up like a saucepan  of water on a hot stove.  </P> <P> "I thought to myself, 'Hey! Cysts don't move! They stay in one place and get  hard,' " he said.  </P> <P> John's right hand got so he could play "Lady of Spain" with it. It wasn't a  hand, it was castanets. Unfortunately, you couldn't play golf with it.  </P> <P> The X-rays kept revealing nothing. His golf game was the only thing fractured.  Maybe it was the grip. Maybe it was the guy.  </P> <P> The facts of the matter were, John Cook had all but shattered his hand hitting  a ball off a tree root in the Inverrary tournament during his third year on  tour in 1982. He was trying to play golf with a hand that he could hardly eat  with.  </P> <P> The human hand wasn't hinged to beat down on hard ground -- or tree roots --  with an iron club on a steel shaft. It can be like punching a concrete wall.  </P> <P> Cook finally took the problem to Dr. Steven O'Connell at the Eisenhower Medical  Center, the facility that is, ironically, the major beneficiary of the annual  Hope Chrysler Classic.  </P> <P> It was discovered the bone fragments were in John Cook's hand, not his head,  after all. The reconstructive surgery was delicate. The doctor made no  promises.  </P> <P> "What he did say was that it would not be worse than it had been," Cook says.  </P> <P> Even that was good enough for him. But it turned out to be a great deal better.  First, though, Cook had to take almost an entire year off the tour. "It was  great," he says. "My kids had a father, my wife had a husband, I had a home  life. But it also made me appreciate how lucky we were to have the tour to make  our living. Everyone should have an opportunity to step back and see where he  is."  </P> <P> Fortunately for Cook, the tour recognizes the wear and tear that high stakes  golf imposes on the system. Ordinarily, if a player has a year in which he wins  no money -- actually John ended up 172nd on the money list in '89 -- or not  enough money, he is off the tour. But in the case of a medical emergency, he  keeps his place in line.  </P> <P> So, the Cook didn't crumble.  </P> <P> "I wondered how effective the surgery would be with the bone chips gone and the  healing process over," Cook says. "So I entered the Kapalua tournament, hoping  only that I could break 80. I actually broke par. Then I went to the Royal  Melbourne and was actually in the hunt."  </P> <P> Punching with both hands, John Cook was able to put Indian Wells on the ropes  in the Hope Classic's opening round Wednesday. He was finally able to mount a  two-fisted attack.  </P> <P> You might say he landed a series of right hands to the tournament's jaw when he  followed up his opening-round 65 with a second-round 68, which kept him in a  tie for the lead and put him solidly into the category of the fighter of whom  they used to say, "He can hurt you with either hand -- but kill you with both."  </P></p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Bonds: Doubt keeps issuers away New issuance in the Eurobond market ground to a halt yesterday as continued uncertainty in the secondary markets pushed issuers and investors back to the sidelines. A news agency report from New York that Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, was considering a global bond offering of Dollars 1bn or more enlivened the market in the afternoon. Although the Hanson rumour has surfaced before, the report came as a surprise to most London-based syndicate managers yesterday. Hanson declined to comment on the report. Some syndicate managers say the rumour may have been triggered by news that Quantum Chemical Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hanson, planned to redeem some more bonds. Hanson said the redemption of these bonds would complete the refinancing of all Quantum's public or privately-placed debt, and bring to Dollars 2.5bn the amount of such debt it will have redeemed or repurchased since it was acquired by Hanson. Quantum plans to redeem, on May 22, all of its 6 per cent subordinated exchangeable debentures due May 2011. Calculated on principal amounts, there are currently Dollars 46.3m of debentures outstanding. Elsewhere, Halifax Building Society took advantage of investor demand to increase Wednesday's offering of capped floating-rate notes, to Pounds 150m from an original amount of Pounds 100m. The four-year notes were trading at 99.52 yesterday afternoon, up from a re-offer price of 99.50.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ACTION! Ronald Reagan made an extended pre-presidential visit to Orange County  in 1942, to make "Juke Girl" with Ann Sheridan. . . . Garden Grove stood in for  Florida in this forgettable melodrama, with Reagan and Sheridan playing farm  workers caught up in a murder. . . . Reagan returns Nov. 2 and Nov. 5 to  campaign for GOP candidates and a get-out-the-vote effort. Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

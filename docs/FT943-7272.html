			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's After years of ruinous losses it is some comfort that business now being written at Lloyd's of London is expected to be profitable. But the Pounds 800m profit for the 1993 year of account forecast by Chatset, the independent forecasters, would hardly be a cause for celebration. A return of less than 10 per cent of market capacity - the long-term target set in Lloyd's business plan - would be a disappointing outcome for a year which saw few natural catastrophes and premium rates at their peak. While the weather has also been kind this year, rates are already softening. Neither does this headline forecast include reserves which will have to be set aside against asbestosis and pollution claims on policies written years ago. While the eventual level of liabilities depends on events in the US Congress and courts, it is likely that reserving will fall from the Pounds 1.4bn set aside last year. If Chatset's estimate of Pounds 500m proves correct, though, there would be precious little left over to make up for the losses of the previous five years. The individual Names which back the market must therefore hope that Chatset has underestimated the eventual level of underwriting profits and overestimated the need for additional reserves. Although corporate capital was not admitted in time for the 1993 year of account, investors in quoted Lloyd's funds would also prefer to see a higher profits peak. Investment returns this year look like being especially poor, so the onus is more than ever on the underwriters to show a decent profit.</p>

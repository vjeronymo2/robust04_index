			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUND &amp; VISION: NENEH CHERRY'S 'MANCHILD' TOPS AMONG MUSIC VIDEOS  </P> <P> "I believe in miracles, words in steady doses," proclaims Neneh Cherry in  "Manchild," the top video entry in this month's Sound &amp; Vision, and indeed  there's something near-miraculous about how her seamless, sexy, mature mix of  pop and rap has been captured on film this time out. Rap also figures at the  bottom of our roundup -- in which music video clips are rated on a 0-100 scale  -- in the sexist form of LL Cool J, who proves himself in his latest tune more  child than man.  </P> <P> CLIPS PICKED TO CLICK:  </P> <P> Neneh Cherry's "Manchild." (Director: Jean-Baptiste Mondino.) Nothing less than  one of the most visually arresting video clips ever produced, illustrating one  of 1989's truly great singles, an accusatory yet compassionate balladic  broadside. In keeping with the theme of the song, which is directed at a  full-grown man who has a little more growing up to do, the camera slowly rocks  back and forth throughout the clip, as if mounted on a swing set like the one  seen in the background on the beachside playground. The camera stops moving  only during the portions of the song when Cherry -- who is cradling her infant  son through much of it -- stops singing and starts to rap. Using eye-popping  visual trickery in the pursuit of thematically relevant imagery, this is a  likely 1990 award winner and a must-see. 94  </P> <P> Concrete Blonde's "Happy Birthday." (D: Jane Simpson.) This cheerful-sounding  song, one of the year's catchiest, is really about an unhappy birthday, but  Johnette Napolitano -- writing about spending the night of her own 30th at home  alone -- is following in the great rock 'n' roll tradition of making feeling  bad sound good. It's the best pop birthday song since the Beatles took a crack  at it, and a little more substantive, too. The fine video is very much in the  same anti-depressant, celebratory spirit, as Napolitano alternately knocks  around her Silver Lake apartment in her pj's or kicks balloons around while  fronting her ace band, with some clever animation thrown in for good measure.  80  </P> <P> The B-52's' "Love Shack." (D: Adam Bernstein.) On the mindless fluff front, the  comeback of new-wave vets the B-52's has been one of the season's more welcome  returns, with the ascension of their "Love Shack" up the singles charts  certainly good news for the Top 40. This bouncy clip finds the immaculately  colorful band rolling down the sunny Georgia highway to set up at the Shaque  D'Amour, a wonderfully mythic place where old and young of all shapes and  colors (but "no fools allowed") can bump and grind to their hearts' content in  the middle of the day. Sharp photography and editing help make it seem like  even more of a Shangri-La. Anybody got an address on this place? 79  </P> <P> WORTH A LOOK AND A LISTEN:  </P> <P> U2's "All I Want is You." (D: Meiert Avis.) The four horsemen of U2 make only  cameo appearances in this black-and-white tale of a circus dwarf's unrequited  love for a trapeze artist. It gets all unnecessarily weird toward the end, a  funeral scene in which it's impossible to figure out which character is dead.  But this still remains one of U2's more interesting videos, for what is one of  the band's most inherently cinematic songs; neither the video nor the single  have received much U.S. airplay, however. 69  </P> <P> Exene Cervenka's "Leave Heaven Alone." (Director: Modi.) Cervenka's folkish  song is a heartfelt plea for mankind to refrain from filling the heavens with  the weapons of destruction, now that the Earth itself has been all mussed up;  the video uses obvious but affecting footage of the environment and its  spoilage to cement the point. 67  </P> <P> Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation." (D: Dominic Sena.) Somehow, Sound &amp; Vision  wonders if Jackson's world-uniting vision of a "nation without geographical  boundaries . . . united by music and dance" is the sort of utopia that'll leave  out those of us too old, too uncoordinated or too busy being activists to cut a  rug. In any case, the baker's dozen of hot hoofers seen in this  well-choreographed piece of noir-lit film certainly can. And unlike most  directors of dance videos, Sena occasionally lets the camera stay on Jackson  and company long enough for us to actually see what kinds of steps they're  doing. 67  </P> <P> Tom Petty's "Runnin' Down a Dream." (D: Jim Lenahan.) Dreaming Tom returns to a  surreal Wonderland, as visited in that great old clip for "Don't Come Around  Here No More" -- only this time it's animated, in black and white, and he's  Alice, not the Mad Hatter. 65  </P> <P> Fine Young Cannibals' "Don't Look Back." (D: Kevin Godley.) Plenty of nifty  visual trickery going on here -- just enough to distract us for several minutes  from the fact that motionless singer Roland Gift is as uncharismatic a  performer as he is a handsome man and gifted vocalist. 58  </P> <P> Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire." (D: Chris Blum.) The title may be a  heavy reference to original sin, or then again it may be as meaningless as the  string of unrelated cultural icons of the baby boom era that Joel reels off.  The video improves on the song somewhat with an amusing portrait of a nuclear  family passing through its kitchen over the decades. But being a distraction  there in the corner, looking too cool for school in his shades, is Billy J.,  acting all tense and pent-up like maybe this audio/visual parade of '50s-'80s  touchstones is going to make his sensitive artist's soul explode in spontaneous  combustion. To which one might suggest: If you can't stand the heat, get out of  the kitchen. 50  </P> <P> GAMMA RAY ROT:  </P> <P> Donny Osmond's "Sacred Emotion." (Director: Michael Bay.) While grown-up Donny  does his very best George Michael under a scorching midday sun, a buncha models  -- sweaty beefcake and sweet-thang cheesecake alike -- build a structure from  scratch on the Bonneville Salt Flats. It's like a symbolic modern retelling of  the story of the Mormons settling in Utah, as choreographed by Vogue or GQ. 23  </P> <P> Bon Jovi's "Living in Sin." (D: Wayne Isham.) Bon Jovi's paean to secretive  teen sex blooms forth in video with a full-scale narrative detailing this  underage couple's tryst at a motel, as tragically cut short by the girl's  party-pooping parents. Before the interruptus, shots of the groping,  love-struck youngsters are intercut with shots of the fat, unhappy parents  getting ready to settle into separate beds. If only there were some irony  intended there -- say, the suggestion that someday these hormonally stricken  teens will get married and turn into their parents, as we all know they will --  but there can be no such irony in a genre founded on the proudly immoral  feeling morally superior to their elders. 1  </P> <P> LL Cool J's "Big Ole Butt." (D: Paris Barclay.) The state of faithfulness has  come to this: "Lisa got a big ole butt / I know I told you I'd be true / But  Lisa got a big ole butt / So I'm leaving you." Complete, of course, with visual  illustrations of the lyrical sentiment from more than one hip-heavy Lisa. The  decline of Western civ continues. 0  </P></p>

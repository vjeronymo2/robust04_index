			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) "will never take any military  actions first" as its weapons are defensive, said an editorial  carried by the official newspaper NODONG SINMUN today.    The DPRK's peace-loving position and policy are "generally  recognized by the international community," said the editorial,  affirming that the fundamental mission of the DPRK armed forces  is to "defend state sovereignty and security" and is totally "of  a defensive nature."    The U.S. charge that the DPRK would first launch military  actions is an insult to the DPRK's peace-loving policies and  also an attempt to slander the defensive nature of the DPRK's  armed forces, said the editorial.    It said that the U.S. charge was aimed at justifying its own  military adventures.    Criticizing the U.S. and South Korea for having been  gradually increasing military threats to the DPRK, the editorial  said that the DPRK people and army would not bow to any powers  and are now closely following U.S. military moves.    On Monday, two U.S. Navy transport ships carrying six  Patriot  missile batteries arrived in the southeastern port of Pusan in  South Korea and the missiles are expected to be deployed at  military bases in South Korea by April 29.    The DPRK has strongly opposed the deployment of Patriot  missiles in South Korea, saying that the missiles are to be used  for offensive purposes.    A row erupted earlier this month between the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the DPRK over the inspection of  the latter's nuclear sites.    The Vienna-based IAEA claimed that Pyongyang rejected full  inspection while the DPRK said that it had met the IAEA's  demands.</p>

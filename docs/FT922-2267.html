			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Kazakhstan and Oman sign oil pipeline deal KAZAKHSTAN and Oman yesterday signed a consortium agreement to build an oil pipeline to permit the former Soviet republic to export crude from its Tengiz oilfield. The consortium, in which each government has a 50 per cent share, will design, finance and build the pipeline, which is expected to have an eventual capacity to export 1.5m barrels a day from Tengiz. Omani consultants say they have identified eight possible routes for the pipeline, which is expected to take three years to complete at a cost, depending on the route, of between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1.6bn. The consortium will subcontract most of the construction work. The consortium, into which other members may later be admitted, establishes only the structure to create a means for Kazakhstan to export oil from the Tengiz field. A decision to proceed with the pipeline will depend on reaching agreement with countries including Russia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Iran and Turkey which the pipeline may cross. Oman's partnership with Kazakhstan arose through its aid in helping the republic negotiate with Chevron, the US oil company, a deal signed in May this year to develop the Tengiz field. Tengiz is believed to hold reserves of between 6bn and 20bn barrels of oil. The skill of the Gulf sultanate at low-key diplomacy and its good relations with all countries over which an pipeline may cross also helped cement the agreement.</p>

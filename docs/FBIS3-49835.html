			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zoltan Kabok] </F>   [Text] Representatives of the government of the Republic of  Croatia, led by Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, today  met members of the Club of Deputies of the Serbian National  Party [Srpska Narodna Stranka, SNS].    The political issue of settling the Serbian problem in  Croatia was the main topic of the discussion, at which the  assembly SNS deputies presented their remarks and expressed  pleasure at the end of the meeting, saying that only through  such meetings a solution can be found in joint work. The  implementation of the constitutional law on human rights and  liberties, rights of ethnic communities and national minorities,  the issue of education, election of Serbian minority  representatives to the Chamber of Counties of the Croatian  Assembly, appointment of Serbian minority representatives to  some positions in county councils, protected areas, the future  of local authorities -- these are but a few questions that the  assembly deputies of Serbian nationality consider decisive for  the return of trust in the institutions of the system. After  representatives of relevant ministries had spoken, Croatian  Prime Minister Nikica Valentic said this about the mentioned  problems:    [Begin Valentic recording] Without any political demagogy I  can completely openly say here that Croatia must build two  criteria: First, it has to build a democratic state; it is  well-known that in such a state all citizens must enjoy equal  rights, because a state that does not guarantee that cannot be a  state in the European sense of the word. Consequently, Croatia  must be a democratic state and that is the fundamental intention  of our government, and second, Croatia must be an economically  strong state. [end recording]    [Kabok] Expressing obvious pleasure at the end of the  meeting, the SNS assembly deputies once again stressed that all  Serbian problems must be resolved exclusively within the  Republic of Croatia.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Pepkor advances 17% in tough trading environment PEPKOR, South Africa's largest mass-market retailer, overcame a difficult operating environment to record a 17 per cent increase in earnings per share for the year ended February. With Tradegro, acquired in October 1991, included for 12 months for the first time, turnover jumped by 70 per cent to R7.8bn (Dollars 2.4bn). Operating income was 26 per cent higher at R267.3m and pre-tax profits were 30 per cent ahead at R252.2m. Mr Christo Wiese, chairman, said the past year had been one of the most difficult ever for the South African economy. This had caused problems at Cashbuild, the building materials unit, and slowed the rate of growth of Pep, the clothing retailer. However, the Checkers supermarket chain returned to profit sooner than anticipated and Stuttafords was trading well. Mr Wiese said the past year had been mainly one of restructuring and consolidation - combining Shoprite and Checkers, the two food operations. He said trading conditions were unlikely to improve in the short term, but he expected 'acceptable results' in the coming year.</p>

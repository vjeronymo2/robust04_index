			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Row over bombers deepens Ukraine rift with Russia RELATIONS between Ukraine and Russia suffered a fresh blow yesterday with a squabble over ownership of military hardware. Mr Viktor Batiuk, head of the international organisations department of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, said Ukraine had taken over a division of long-range bombers in retaliation for the flight to Russia of Russian airforce pilots in military aircraft based in Ukraine. The republic's president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, has demanded an official explanation from Moscow about the flight of the pilots in six Su-24 bombers. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the defence minister of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), said yesterday the aircraft had flown to a military airbase near Smolensk and that the pilots would remain in Russia. 'A comrade is coming here so we can talk about the planes,' he said. He made no specific comment about Ukraine's move to take over the 21 bombers based at Uzin, even though they are part of the strategic forces which the 11 Commonwealth states agreed should remain under joint command. But he said the fact that the unit commander had sworn allegiance to Ukraine did not mean a section of the strategic forces now belonged to the republic. Mr Volodymir Belashov, a Ukrainian Foreign Ministry official, said Kiev's position was that the hardware itself should belong to Ukraine but that the nuclear weapons they carried would belong to the commonwealth. Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is opposed to commonwealth leaders' decision to allow for separate republican armies, nevertheless predicted that the former Red Army would ultimately splinter into republican forces. He said the break-up should be conducted in a 'civilised manner since we call ourselves civilised people'. Asked about reports that a military joint venture had sold military hardware based in Ukraine, he said the armed forces had been authorised by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to engage in commercial activity. As commander-of-chief of the commonwealth armed forces, Marshal Shaposhnikov said his room for decision-making was complicated by the fact that he had eight republican masters for conventional forces and 11 for strategic forces. But he also stressed the importance of protecting the commonwealth 'like a fragile baby' so it could survive the difficulties of its early stages. Turning to fighting in the Trans-Caucasus, he warned that unless Armenia and Azerbaijan found a peaceful solution to their conflict over land, he would press for the withdrawal of all commonwealth troops from the area. He said he would not tolerate officers and their families becoming targets. Reuter adds from Moscow: A top aide to President Boris Yeltsin warned yesterday that a break-up of the commonwealth would provoke a military coup. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, Russian deputy prime minister, issued the warning to members of his parliament in Moscow. 'I think that both politicians and deputies realise one clear thing - the collapse of the commonwealth now is a 103 per cent (guarantee) of a military coup d'etat.' TWO nuclear-powered submarines of the US and former Soviet navies collided in Arctic waters off northern Russia last week, it was disclosed yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Moscow said it would protest to Washington over the incident, which it claimed took place in Russian territorial waters. Interfax news agency quoted a report by the navy of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as saying the US submarine, which was identified by US officials as the Baton Rouge, was in Russian waters illegally. 'The fact that a foreign submarine was operating secretly in our waters can't help but provoke justified concern in the Russian leadership,' it quoted the report as saying. A US official travelling with Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, in Guatemala yesterday confirmed the incident but said the submarine from the CIS had hit the Baton Rouge.</p>

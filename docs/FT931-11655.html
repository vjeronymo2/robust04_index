			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Rabin faces up to impasse on deportees: Decision by Israeli PM amounts to big reversal THE announcement by Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin last night that Israel will take back 100 of the 400 Palestinians it dumped unceremoniously on a bleak Lebanese hillside in mid-December was his first public acknowledgment that the expulsions had, in international terms at least, seriously backfired. There is no guarantee that the steps announced by Mr Rabin will resolve either the immediate plight of the stranded deportees, who are likely to reject them as inadequate, or the threat hanging over the Middle East peace talks. But they amount to a significant reversal by Mr Rabin. Since, in his dual role of prime minister and defence minister, he virtually bounced his Labour-led government into approving the controversial expulsions, many ministers had let it be known they felt the decision was a serious miscalculation from which some diplomatic escape should be sought. However Mr Rabin continued to insist, in his characteristic growl, that there was no going back on what he said was a decisive blow against Islamic fundamentalists waging a violent campaign in Israel and the occupied territories against the Middle East peace process. He was buoyed by the unanimous approval of the expulsions handed down by the Israeli High Court last week. The court decision, however, simply acted as the signal for a veritable barrage of pressure from the Clinton administration for concessions which would defuse growing international calls for action by the United Nations security council to enforce Resolution 799 demanding the immediate repatriation of the Palestinians. President Bill Clinton had expressed himself during the election campaign and through several of his foreign policy appointees to be a good friend of Israel. But the prospect of having to cast the first US Security Council veto in more than two years in Israel's favour, and of perhaps seeing the Middle East peace negotiations expire so soon after taking office, was clearly not something relished by Mr Clinton or by Mr Warren Christopher, his secretary of state. By yesterday, Mr Christopher and Mr William Harrop, the US ambassador in Tel Aviv, had talked Mr Rabin round to offering a compromise. Mr Rabin said Israel had to establish 'an infrastructure of understanding' with the new US president. Mr Rabin has almost certainly achieved that. Within minutes of his announcement, Mr Christopher said any further action by the UN against Israel was unnecessary - even counter-productive. The US has pledged to work to get all the Arab parties - including the Palestinians - quickly back to the peace table. But it was by no means certain that the obstacle the expulsions placed in the way of the 15-month-old peace talks had been removed. For a start, the deportees themselves, mostly sympathisers of the Hamas fundamentalist organisation which opposes the negotiations, said they would accept nothing short of full implementation of Resolution 799. This puts the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which backs the talks, in a difficult position. The secular PLO, to which the Palestinian negotiating team from the West Bank and Gaza owes allegiance, is a bitter opponent of Hamas. Many of its leaders may well support a return to negotiations. But it will be very difficult for them as long as Resolution 799 is not fully implemented. Mr Rabin faces another problem among his own people. Israelis overwhelmingly supported the expulsions, but now the government has been seen to weaken its stance in the face of international pressure, undermining the perceived security benefits.</p>

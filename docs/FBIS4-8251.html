			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 11 (BTA) -- A failure of the general  strike organized by the Confederation of Independent Trade  Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) is out of question, KNSB leader Prof.  Krustyu Petkov told DAILY NEWS and foreign correspondents today.  According to Prof. Petkov, this is the most appropriate time to  strike. Only shock forms of action and pressure on the  government can awaken Bulgarian politicians from their current  slumber, Prof. Petkov said.    The KNSB, one of the two major trade union amalgamations in  this country, decided to resort to a general strike on April 4,  1994, scheduling it for May 17. It has been provided for  staggered strike actions to start already on April 13. The  management of about 200 enterprises across the country will  receive strike declarations already this week, Prof. Petkov  said. In two-thirds of the enterprises there will be joint  strike actions with the other major trade union amalgamation in  this country -- Podkrepa, the KNSB leader told journalists. Two  enterprises are already protesting, he added. Protest actions  will first start in the mechanical engineering branch, the  military industrial complex, the electronic industry and the  food processing industry, the KNSB leader said. KNSB structures  cover 55-60 percent of Bulgaria's employed active population,  according to Prof. Petkov.    A protest rally has been scheduled for April 14 in Sofia.  The KNSB member federations will start strike actions on May  14. According to Prof. Petkov, KNSB has received proposals from  some political forces for joint strike actions, but he declined  to comment or provide further information. The KNSB is planning  to accompany the general strike with a civic boycott of prices  and tariffs imposed by state-owned monopolist enterprises.    KNSB demands an agreement with the government envisaging  compensations for the latest drastic drop in incomes. The trade  union calls for bringing wages, pensions and social benefits in  line with the real cost-of-living rises. KNSB insists on a  temporary price freeze for staple goods and services. It urges  that a state programme for stabilization of the foreign exchange  and financial market be adopted. The union will call off the  strike if Prime Minister Berov takes part in the official talks  and gives guarantees that the trade union's demands will be met.  Prof. Petkov did not specify what kind of guarantees KNSB  expected. In his view, the strikers would score a  "supersuccess" if parliament passed a decision obliging the  government to meet the trade union's demands.    KNSB will seek support from the European Trade Union  Confederation, the International Confederation of Free Trade  Unions and national trade unions in Europe. KNSB sets great  store by the principled position of the organizations and the  possibility to exchange experience rather than by financial  support, Prof. Petkov said today.    KNSB demands have the backing of leaders of the  extraparliamentary Bulgarian Social Democratic Party and the  Civil Alliance for the Republic. The Socialist Party's  leadership linked its support to the condition that no political  demands be made. KNSB and the Socialists will be holding  consultations on a weekly basis. The trade union leadership  will meet other political forces as well.</p>

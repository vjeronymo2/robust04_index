			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: France Whatever the destiny of the franc this week, the Paris bourse seems convinced it will be a case of reculer pour mieux sauter. With the CAC-40 touching new highs, investors are already anticipating that interest rates will be cut by one means or another, sparking recovery. The underlying fundamentals of the French economy appear strong. Over the past decade, French industry has established a fine record of productivity improvements with manufacturing labour costs now set at about 60 per cent of those in Germany. Inflation remains below 2 per cent. France's balance of trade is strong. Yet, as in the UK, the Paris market may have a long wait before the revival of corporate earnings meets stock market expectations. The franc fort policy has inflicted severe damage on parts of the French economy as shown by the remorseless rise in unemployment to 11.6 per cent. French GNP may decline by as much as 1 per cent this year with corporate earnings slipping by 10 per cent. French industry has lost swathes of market share to competitors in 'soft' currency countries. Domestic demand has been depressed by rising unemployment and high real interest rates. The fragility of the French banking system, largely reflecting the precarious state of the Paris property market, will prove a further restraint.</p>

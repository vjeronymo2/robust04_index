			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by William Cespedes from Washington, DC; from the </F> "Radio Reloj Newscast"]    [Text] Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus was hurt  after his hopes to become OAS secretary general were dashed.  Niehaus said the Inter-American system had committed another  injustice against Costa Rica. The pressures exerted against the  small countries were the main element that kept Costa Rica's  40-year-old hope of becoming OAS secretary general from coming  true. In 1954, former Costa Rican President Otilio Ulate Blanco  was also defeated when he ran for the post of OAS secretary  general. On this occasion, the excuse was the OAS needed a  former president, and the big countries, headed by the United  States, nominated Colombian President Cesar Gaviria.    Foreign Minister Niehaus said the attitude assumed by some  of  the small countries in light of those pressures was the main  element of the defeat.    [Begin Niehaus recording] We did have a big problem with  four  Caribbean banana-producing countries. This problem has been  present for some time, but it was used within the last few days  to separate us and break the vote. We have had a very clear  position regarding the banana issue. We are working on this,  and, as far as I know, an agreement was reached in Brussels.  This was done, however, without disregarding our national  interests. Our country was interested in promoting my  candidacy, but it could not do it at the cost of other  interests. On different occasions I told the banana-producing  countries our position was one of finding solutions that would  not affect the Caribbean or our interests; we talked based on  this issue.    Surprisingly enough, since 25 March, when the last  successful  contacts were made, these countries started talking about the  Central American position. They started saying not only Costa  Rica but other Central American countries were against them.  What each country does is its own business. We cannot meddle  in what Guatemala, Panama, or Honduras do about this. This  began to sound like excuses, but they never told us they were  going to break the commitment; this happened only today.    Yesterday during the Caribbean Common Market-Central America  meeting support for Costa Rica was reiterated, but those four  countries said nothing. Those countries are St. Lucia, St.  Vincent, Grenada, and Dominica. Those countries remained  silent, so I asked them if they authorized me to tell the press  everything was all right and that nothing had changed. One of  them, St. Lucia, said he had not talked about this. I told him  I was not talking about a specific problem, rather, the vote,  and he said yes. I then met with you and told you all was fine,  but there was an underlying problem.    Last night I was told a meeting was going to be held and  very  faithful and serious countries, countries firm to their  commitment, such as Jamaica, Trinidad-Tobago, Barbados, and  Bahamas, said they would do all in their power to fix the  situation.    Shortly before the voting began the St. Lucian ambassador  came to see me and said there were four countries that were not  happy with Costa Rica's banana policy. I told him I did not  know why they were unhappy, because the Costa Rican president  had been quite clear about this situation. Well, he said, let's  wait and see what happens. At no time did we say--and this is  all rumor--Guyana would not support me; quite the contrary,  yesterday the foreign minister clearly told me he would support  me. Today he told me he was told to vote against. Well.    There was one Central American dissident. I do not want to  mention the name because I do not wish to harm bilateral  relations. [end recording]    These were statements by Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus at  the Costa Rican Embassy in Washington after studying the results  of the election in which he was defeated by Colombian President  Cesar Gaviria. According to versions heard throughout the  diplomatic media in Washington, DC, Panama was the Central  American country that at the last minute changed its vote and  supported Colombia, as did the four Caribbean countries Foreign  Minister Niehaus mentioned.    This closes another chapter in Costa Rica's hopes to hold  the  highest office at the OAS.    [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 1719 GMT on 28 March cites  San Jose LA NACION as reporting: "Panama broke its promise to  Costa Rica and voted for Colombian President Cesar Gaviria for  OAS secretary general." The ACAN report adds "Dominica,  Ecuador, Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the  Grenadines changed their vote at the last minute, thus enabling  President Gaviria's victory.]"</p>

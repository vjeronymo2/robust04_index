			<p>BFN     [Text] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] has agreed  to amendments to the Electoral Act which allow the IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] to register as a political party for the  elections, and which makes it possible for citizens of the TBVC  [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states to use valid  travel documents as identity for voting. Another amendment  approved permits for staff of any hospital or old age home to  vote by special vote if they were unable to get to a polling  station when they are open. The amendments will be made law  through proclamation by the state president.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Ivanyuk report: "An Army Without Housing, Weapons, or </F> Hope. That Is the Possible Result of Budget Cuts"]    [Text] Recently our newspaper has repeatedly addressed the  problem of financing defense expenditure. We have done this by  no means out of corporate or lobby interests, but because we are  convinced that only a profoundly indifferent and incompetent  person could stand by and observe the way in which, on the  pretext of demilitarizing the country and converting military  production, the actual destruction of the Army and Navy and  simultaneously of the economy itself is taking place.    Why of the economy? Because once again the idea that all  economic matters can be rectified at the Armed Forces' expense  is being trotted out. In the four years in which politicians  and economists have diligently put it into effect, this idea has  become fairly decrepit and has brought no improvements to  people's lives. And, although expressed in 1990 prices, the  military budget has "slimmed down" to half its size, the  situation both in the Army and the economy has deteriorated.    It would seem to be high time to abandon this approach  toward  budget procurements and to look at things realistically. But  this kind of enthusiasm cannot be observed in our economic  departments. It is much easier to cross out one figure on paper  and put down another -- slightly smaller -- one than, say, to  properly organize tax collection so that the budget's income  element increases rather than catastrophically decreases. Thus,  according to Economy Ministry data, in the first quarter the  federal budget received 3.4 trillion rubles [R] less than  expected in taxes and dues. Naturally, the Finance Ministry  never has any money.    Furthermore, financing military expenditure only to the  extent that the empty treasury purse is filled, as has been the  practice recently, is also directly damaging the country's  economy. For this reason, the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry Military Budget and Financing Main Directorate has  estimated that nonproduction expenditure in 1993 totaled R870  billion, which again required an increase in the defense budget.    How is this sum made up? The Defense Ministry was forced to  pay over R490 billion because scheduled deadlines for paying for  ordered output were broken, bank credits obtained by supplier  enterprises and included in the cost of military output came to  R306 billion, penalties for late payment for transport services  totaled R37 billion....    In the past year the financing of the draft Russian  Federation Law "On the State Budget for 1994," which preserves  the level of defense expenditure proposed by the government, has  created a ludicrous situation in the Army and Navy. The sum of  R37.1 trillion represents a mere 42 percent of the requirement,  and this money could be enough only to pay personnel. There can  be no question of paying the defense complex, building housing,  etc. In short, this sum cannot actually be apportioned to  sections of the military budget. Therefore, it has never been  seriously discussed. At one time the Finance Ministry officially  evaluated the draft military budget at R55.5 trillion.    Even this compromise level of appropriations, enabling the  Army to survive somehow, requires considerable adjustment of the  state defense order approved by the Russian Federation  Government in December, including for housing for servicemen,  not to mention a reduction of the range and volume of weapons  and equipment being purchased. The military budget is now 60  percent "social" in its structure, and further cuts in it will  inevitably hit people who as it is do not have sufficient  guarantees regarding their daily lives. In these conditions the  Russian Federation Government, without coordinating with the  Defense Ministry, is submitting to the Duma a draft law on  suspending a number of articles of the Law on the Status of  Servicemen, and is attempting to abolish privileges which have  existed since prewar times. How is this to be viewed?    If we closely analyze what makes up the remaining 40 percent  of defense expenditure, it is evident that it contains a  considerable volume of enforced expenditure not directly  associated with military activity. Over R3 trillion, for  example, is required for the withdrawal of troops from foreign  countries near and far and for providing them with amenities in  a new location. It requires considerable expenditure to  maintain a state of emergency in "hot spots" and to carry out  peacekeeping activity within the former USSR. The military  budget is being used to maintain space centers, the air traffic  safety service, hydrographic and air navigation services,  lighthouses, and much else that not only the Armed Forces but  the entire country needs. After all, this comes to trillions of  rubles, and an adjustment for them should also be made in the  budget.    But, even taking the annual budget of R37.1 trillion, the  Defense Ministry is not currently being given the full volume of  funding -- as of 15 May it had already received R4.5 trillion  less than it should have. While the military department owed a  total of R6 trillion for the period January-April. An  impressive figure, it cannot be denied. But this is not what  gives rise to serious alarm -- the lack of resources makes it  impossible to properly prepare compounds for winter and  transport all the essentials to Far North areas. Operational  and combat training of troops and maintenance of the material  base and military equipment are being disrupted.    Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin has repeatedly  drawn the attention of the government and parliamentarians to  the fact that it is necessary to find a solution regarding this  year's budget without harming the country's defense capability.  But his instruction of 3 March 1994 has still not been  implemented. On 6 May the president supported an amendment to  the draft budget made by the State Duma Defense Committee and  envisaging an increase of the "National Defense" item to R55  trillion.    One wants to believe that this figure will find support  among  State Duma deputies when the federal budget is finally approved.  This level of appropriations will not, of course, solve all the  Armed Forces' problems, but at least it will make it possible to  avoid many minor and major misfortunes which are knocking  increasingly loudly at the door....</p>

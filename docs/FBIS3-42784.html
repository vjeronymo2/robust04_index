Six years ago  this was the distance the heavy Urals would cover every day  carrying their loads. For some drivers the path to the mountain  of gold was their last: Their brakes would fail on the steep  pass and the vehicles "were on their way" into the abyss. As for  the extraction of metal, the workers of the Zabaykalzoloto state  association spent more time boozing it up than increasing the  country's gold supply. "Taking into account the lengthy period  when the mines were worked at a loss, their insolvency plus the  fact that the measures taken repeatedly...produce no positive  results," effective 1 July 1988 the association terminated state  mining. The Irokinda mine and the wretched housing that went  with it were turned over to the Vitim gold mining artel.    In a short period of time the private owners had completed  the construction of a mining village and a factory for enriching  metal, they had blasted the pass and built a road from Taksimo  that could be traveled in a couple of hours, and they had  extended an electric power transmission line to Irokinda. The  few kilograms of gold from the period of state production were  turned into 2.4 "artel" tonnes.    And a real interest in Irokinda awakened again in the state:  The Buryatzoloto state gold mining enterprise (GZP), which  replaced Zabaykalzoloto and with which Vitim had concluded  contracts for leasing technical equipment and working the mine,  decided to become a joint-stock company. And in such a way that  the mine and practically everything that had been done by the  prospectors was to go to the GZP, while the artel itself would  either be absorbed by Buryatzoloto, half of which was made up of  white-collar workers in Ulan-Ude, or, after turning over what it  had acquired and created, would depart. At the same time the  Vitim prospectors, who were also trying to privatize, wanted  nothing to do with this "vassal."    The scenario is not a new one: When they divide up property  everything is blood, sweat, and tears. But when they divide up a  "vein of gold" there is a lot more of everything. The branch,  which has enriched the country by tens of billions of dollars,  was built through unconcealed exploitation of gold mining  artels. They did not receive licenses to work the deposits, they  did not have the right to bring armed guards to the gold mines  and fields, and they were essentially deprived of their property  claims, being forced to conclude agreements for leasing by state  enterprises. The latter sold the gold to the Committee on  Precious Metals at prices considerably below world prices, but  they cut the payment to the "private owners" by another third.    They did not manage to include in the first state program  for  privatization in 1992 a provision whereby gold miners could  purchase leased property from state enterprises. A certain  breakthrough was made by Council of Ministers Decree No. 117,  according to which during 1992 the artels were permitted to work  without licenses, automatically, without special clearance from  state enterprises, leasing agreements were extended, and  payments were set in the form of 75 percent in rubles and 25  percent in foreign currency in direct settlements with the state  for gold. The only thing that Buryatzoloto won away from the  artels that year was that the apparatus would be maintained with  deductions from profit and amortization. And the artels, even  without valuable instructions from the GZP, increased extraction  and expanded mine production out of their own revenues, they  improved the technology for enrichment of gold in the factories,  and they started up their own refineries.    The prospects of losing the "gold mine" made the general  director of Buryatzoloto, Valeriy Dmitriyev, uneasy. His  instinct for self-preservation told him that he should gather  together some workers and start mining. The question as to  "where to mine?" was answered by the general director without  much fuss: the best deposits. And where would he find them? He  would take them away from the gold mining collectives. Valeriy  Dmitriyev acted intelligently. In order not to have the artels  form a front against him, he set all the small, placer mines  adrift. The GZP chief dealt his first blow to the largest artel  in Buryatia, Sayany. "They literally wrenched it out of our  hands," said its chairman, Mr. Markovskiy. "Administration by  injunction, threats, and graft among workers were all put into  play. We were forced to turn over the enrichment factory and  abandon the richest mine, Kholba." The best artel, by the  admission of other gold miners, one that had built dozens of  kilometers of roads and bridges, an enrichment factory, and  sanatoriums, one that had extracted about two tonnes of gold and  introduced technology for obtaining it in slabs, was essentially  crushed, forced to retreat to the Irkutsk placer mines where  gold is extracted by the kilogram.    It was a little bit difficult for Valeriy Dmitriyev to  "swallow up" Sayany and Vitim all at once, and therefore he  applied the tactic of gradual suffocation to the second artel,  Buryatzoloto. According to the law on minerals and the "Statute  on the Procedure for Licensing the Use of Minerals," Vitim,  which was operating at Irokinda, should have received its  license for 1993 automatically. But the republic Council of  Ministers and Geology Committee, sidestepping the law, issued it  not to the artel but to the GZP. The Vitim chairman, Vasiliy  Davidyuk, resisted for three months, but the futility of the  situation forced him to sign an agreement with Dmitriyev. Under  these conditions 63 percent of the revenue from the sale of the  metal would be collected by Buryatzoloto. Without lifting a  finger, last year the GZP "panned" out of the artel R5.9 billion  and $1.09 million.    In words Valeriy Dmitriyev is not denying Vitim the right to  exist: "The artel can form a joint-stock company as a part of  Buryatzologo and receive the portion of shares due to it." The  trick here is that the GZP sharply increased the sum of its own  fixed capital by appropriating the property of Sayany and part  of Vitim's and it also gave this sum in current prices while the  artel's "wealth" was accounted for in 1992 prices; thus the gold  mining collectives' share of Irokinda in its authorized capital  shrank from 70 percent to 10 percent. But even that is not the  main thing. Valeriy Dmitriyev submitted one document whereby  Buryatzoloto would not inform the artel of the plan for  extraction for 1994--the general director, in his mind not  considering himself the master of Irokinda, gave Vitim up as a  lost cause.    And this is at a time when the laws are on the side of the  latter. On 21 May 1993 Decree No. 480 of the Council of  Ministers, was published under the signature of Viktor  Chernomyrdin, according to which the Russian Federation State  Committee for Management of State Property was instructed "upon  privatization of mining enterprises not to include in their  authorized capital property leased by gold mining artels and to  include it on the balance sheet with subsequent transfer to be  leased by the gold mining artels." The fact that the Buryat  conflict was so typical and the desire of the Russian GZP's  under the Committee on Precious Metals to profit from the  formation of joint-stock companies at the expense of the artels  led the first deputy chairman of the GKI [State Property  Committee], Petr Mostovoy, in a special letter to the local  regions to emphasize once again the property rights of the gold  mining collectives. And right before that Yegor Gaydar, a deputy  prime minister at the time, instructed the chiefs of  administrations of the oblasts where precious metals are mined  and the chairman of the Council of Ministers of Buryatia,  Vladimir Saganov, "before 31 December 1993 to adopt a decision  to issue licenses to gold mining artels for precious metal  deposits they are working or preparing for working."    Vitim still did not receive a license. In this case Valeriy  Dmitriyev, the law abider, as he calls himself, interprets  obedience to the law extremely broadly. Since October of last  year Buryatzoloto has stopped paying money to gold mining  collectives for the work they have done. In January, on orders  from the general director of the GZP, all work was halted at  Irokinda, dozens of armed people from Buryatzoloto took the  enriching factory under guard, and they are trying to drive the  gold mining collectives out of the electric power plant and the  boiler room. The situation heated up to such a degree that the  Committee on Precious Metals sent a commission to the site of  the events. It is no secret that the chairman of the Committee  on Precious Metals, Yevgeniy Bychkov, depends on the general  directors of state gold mining enterprises for support. The  commission could not fail to take this circumstance into account  and it unequivocally took the side of Mr. Dmitriyev. Both Mr.  Bychkov and the "generals" of the branch are afraid that Vitim  will create a precedent. In order to prevent this they are  refusing to recognize the instructions of the State Property  Committee and they are ignoring the decrees of the government  right down to the directive of Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets of 22 January to the Russian Federation State  Committee on the Administration of State Property and the  Committee on Precious Metals "to provide for unconditional  fulfillment" of the property rights of the artels.    If we set aside the moral and legal aspects of the Buryat  "battle" it makes no difference to the Russian citizen who chips  away at the ores of Irokinda--as long as they mine more gold.  But the fact is that the state enterprises have demonstrated  their abilities long ago. After taking the Kholba deposit into  his own hands and driving Sayany out, Valeriy Dmitriyev, instead  of the 1.5 tonnes of gold he had promised the republic, produced  840 kg while the plan of the artel, which was overfulfilled  every year, was for 1.2 tonnes. It took Sayany four months to  build the technological line at the enriching factory while the  GZP took a year. And there was nothing stored up for the future.  The same thing will happen if Irokinda is seized. They can only  squander what they have obtained for nothing. Practically  nothing can change the nature of the GZP, which is capable of  surviving only on state subsidies and what they can steal from  the artels. In 1992 and 1993 on secret instructions from the  government to Buryatzologo, 500 kg of precious metal each were  allotted for financing developments in Kholba and Irokinda. The  commission of the Committee on Precious Metals, which had been  given the assignment of figuring out what the money was spent  on, never did make their way to the end. The gold mining  collectives from Vitim said that they were prepared to pay half  of Buryatzoloto's debt--as long as the artel was allowed to  privatize itself along with the mine and everything that had  been done there by Vitim.    In general this only requires something small--but it is  fundamental: to legally grant the gold mining artels the right  to buy from the state not only movable but also immovable  property. It seems that the Russian Federation State Committee  on the Administration of State Property did not have enough  strength to beat off the attack from the Committee on Precious  Metals and at the last moment that point was left out of the  State Privatization Program for 1994. And so there will be more  conflicts like the ones in Buryatia and resolving them is not  likely to add to Russia's gold supplies.    In December of last year at a conference of branch leaders  the chairman of the Committee on Precious Metals, Mr. Bychkov,  proudly informed those in attendance that against the background  of the general depression of the national economy only the gold  mining industry did not lower the production level. It is just  that Mr. Bychkov forgot to add that this had not occurred  because of the self-sacrificing labor of the GZP. It is simply  that the gold mining artels had increased gold extraction by 18  tonnes in three years.</p>

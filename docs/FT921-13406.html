			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / India seeks new trade pact with Russia MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is expected to visit New Delhi in March or April to sign a new friendship treaty to replace the 1971 agreement between India and the Soviet Union. A draft agreement was discussed with Russian officials when Mr J N Dixit, India's foreign minister, visited Moscow last week. It was recognised during the talks that India's old relationship with the Soviet Union, in which it gained preferential treatment as its main ally in Asia, no longer held good and that a new arrangement would have to be worked out. The draft omits the references to security in the 1971 treaty, although it does provide for regular consultations on peace and security. Russian support for India's stand on Kashmir is said to have been reaffirmed. The transition to a new pattern of bilateral trading is proving more difficult. It has been decided to give up 'rupee' transactions, under which an annual trade protocol was signed listing imports and exports of the two countries on a balanced basis. However, an immediate changeover to using convertible currencies is not contemplated. For the present, the goods exchanged will be valued in dollars but paid in rupees. This will continue for two years while the difficult question of the rupee-rouble exchange rate is worked out. Trade in convertible currency is to follow after that. This presumably means that Russia will cease exporting to India cheap crude oil, fertilisers, newsprint and metals and that trade will be based on world prices. This will harm India since it has been receiving sophisticated defence equipment from the Soviet Union cheaply and on easy credit terms. While the Russians are reported to have agreed to provide spares and components which the Indian armed forces need urgently, the terms for future defence supplies have still to be worked out. The Indians are satisfied that Russian will honour credits for several power projects promised by the Soviet Union. This includes assistance for a nuclear power plant in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. A similar treaty is being negotiated with Ukraine.</p>

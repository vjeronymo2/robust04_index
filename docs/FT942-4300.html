			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Social Europe Wednesday's European Court judgements, coming on the last day of Britain's European election campaign, could not have been better timed to provoke maximum confusion. In fact none of them were unexpected and they are, with some qualifications, to be welcomed. The decision to extend to employees who are not in unions the right to be consulted in cases of redundancy and business transfer is overdue. It was a Labour government which favoured unions when transposing into national law the European requirement to consult. But Conservative governments happily followed suit in European legislation, as well as in domestic health and safety legislation. A statutory right to consultation for all employees is, in principle, a big step away from the British system of industrial relations and towards one based on continental-style individual employee rights. Britain has in fact been heading in this continental direction in recent years, based on the belief that to have workplace rights mediated only by trade unions is anachronistic. Moreover, the actual effect of the consultation ruling on employers is likely to be small. It appears that employers will not have to establish a prescribed mechanism for consulting but rather a procedure, which allows a good deal of flexibility. The danger is that the government will be tempted to transpose a minimalist interpretation of the requirement to consult and so will risk opening a fresh wave of Euro-litigation. This temptation must be avoided. If there is any lesson to be drawn from the continuing chaos over the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, it is the importance of realism. The government has good reason to object to Tupe - which excessively protects jobs and conditions when businesses are transferred - but pretending it does not apply in contracting-out cases has left contractors as well as employees confused and angry. The most grotesque misunderstanding is to suppose that this week's events undermine Britain's 'opt-out' from the Social Chapter. In fact, this opt-out relates only to future legislation; the matters which were the subject of this week's court rulings arise from EC directives of the 1970s. The opt-out may, in any case, become superfluous as the EU moves away from an over-detailed and prescriptive approach to labour legislation. A deregulatory tide is now running and even on Tupe there is a current in favour of narrowing its scope to exclude at least some of the activities covered by contracting out in Britain. That outcome has been helped by Britain's constructive lobbying 'at the heart of Europe', not by opting out or wishful thinking.</p>

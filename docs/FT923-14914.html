			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: Abstracts from the scrap-heap - William Packer reviews Janet Nathan and other constructivist exhibitions JANET Nathan is an artist who makes reliefs. Is she a sculptor turned painter, or painter become sculptor? And is what she makes an image or an object? Has she moved from the imagined and internal pictorial space and the single point of view that it commands, to the object celebrated for itself in the physical world, or the other way about? Is her work representational or abstract? To ask such questions is only to confirm her contrariness. Her material is what she finds on the scrap-heap or in the skip, for the most part scrap wood with occasional bits of metal. Yet this is no absolute dependency, nor any fixed rule, for she has always been prepared to contrive the particular element if none comes to hand, or to modify or distress it as need be, painting or polishing or scraping it down. And nowadays she almost always uses synthetic resin, most artificial and contrived of all, light and translucent, by which to fill the amorphous, organic spaces left within the composition. As these reliefs have become more worked and contrived, so they have become at once more dense and physical, and more pictorial. That is not to say that they are descriptive pieces, in any sense objectively observed, but rather that the associative and symbolic qualities of abstract image and formal composition are readily accepted. The ever-present disc, red, blue or whatever, must stand for sun or moon; the insistent horizontal device soon becomes itself the true horizon; the repeated serpentine or cursive profile can suggest the ebb and flow of water. The landscape connotation, the particular watery landscape of marsh and estuary, is inescapable. 'Saltfleet', 'Naze', 'Whisper Creek': the titles tell their own story. And yet abstract they remain, objects hanging on the wall, confident and authoritative in their presence, and beautifully made. The contradiction is all. The same contradiction is nicely pointed in its historic context by the Non-Objective World at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge. The material in every sense was to be used only in its proper quality, line as line, colour colour, form form, stuff stuff, and Miss Nathan's constructivist credentials, through the romantic, intuitive line of Kurt Schwitters and his collage and merzbild are sound enough. And yet how delicate and physical, how imaginatively particular and free, how unschematic these things are, by Mondrian and van der Leck, Malevich and Kupka, Arp and Hepworth, for all their principles. The imaginative possibilities come flooding in. Over these past 20 years or more, Annely Juda's main summer offering at her London gallery has been a substantial study of this material in one or other of its aspects. Indeed she set the critical debate at a time when early 20th century abstraction, and constructivism in particular, was far from fashionable, and has seen her acuity and judgment confirmed a hundredfold. London has been spoilt too long, and it is only right that this year the country at large should benefit by this touring show, which Mrs Juda has herself selected. A short walk away, at Jesus College, the present Master, Colin Renfrew, with the full support of his Fellows, has again brought a selection of contemporary British sculpture into the college gardens. This has become a biennial exercise, now celebrated for the third time, and is unique in our universities. The opportunity is patent, the lack of emulation by other colleges sadly no surprise, yet Jesus deserves perhaps even more congratulation in the event than for its splendid initiative. This was from the first a serious business, the artists carefully chosen and invited to work to a particular site, even to make the piece within the college. So a Gormly figure now lurks beneath the great tree in the Fellows' Garden, a Long slate circle fills a cloister, a Mach assemblage plays music to itself in its ancient corner. Michael Archer, Richard Bray, Diane Maclean and Nina Saunders are the other artists. A Flanagan horse was acquired from the first exhibition, a small totem by William Turnbull from the second. In this respect too, the intention is to continue. Janet Nathan - Constructions: The gallery at John Jones, Unit 4, Morris Place, Finsbury Park N4, until July 25. The Non-Objective World: Kettle's Yard, Castle Street, Cambridge, until July 19 - then on to Swansea, Liverpool and Kendal: a South Bank Touring Exhibition sponsored by British Telecom. Sculpture in the Close: Jesus College, Cambridge, until August 1.</p>

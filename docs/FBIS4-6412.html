			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Representatives of the  ruling coalition parties are close Tuesday [19 April] to forging  agreement on key policies such as national security prior to  picking a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The representatives, who resumed discussion on Tuesday  morning, are expected to reach agreement during the day if they  can hammer out differences on two issues of immediate concern,  Japan's stand on North Korea's suspected nuclear development  program and tax system rehabilitation, coalition sources said.    The two issues have blocked the coalition from cementing  ties  on policies for a new government to replace the administration  of Hosokawa, who declared his resignation April 8 over scandals  involving his finances.    Clearing these obstacles could lead to a meeting as early as  Tuesday of coalition party leaders, who will formally sign into  accords key policy coordination and then select Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata as their candidate in the prime ministerial  election in the Diet, the sources said.    On Monday, Hata emerged as the most probable successor to  Hosokawa after veteran conservative politician Michio Watanabe  indicated second thoughts about his plan to leave the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) and seek coalition backing to run in the  Diet election for the premiership.    Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito [Clean  Government Party], the coalition's key party, told reporters  after the representatives' session went into recess that they  agreed on all policies but tax reform.    Regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, the alliance  partners agreed that Japan will abide by the United Nations,  prepare for emergency under the framework of the Constitution  and cooperate with the United States and South Korea, the  sources said.    Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the leading coalition the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) [as received], told reporters that  if the representatives forge an agreement, a meeting of  government leaders will be held to confirm the agreement and  then party chiefs will discuss picking a prime ministerial  candidate and forming a new cabinet after confirming the policy  accords.    The session will resume at 3:00 P.M., coalition officials  said.    The representatives are made up of persons at secretaries  general level of the SDP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party),  Komeito, the Japan New Party (JNP), the Social Democratic Party  (DSP), the Democratic Reform Party and Kaikaku No Kai [Reform  Party].    New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which declared Friday that  it  will not take a post in the new cabinet, stayed away from the  session.    Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the House of Representatives  Steering Committee, meanwhile, said Monday he wants to convene a  plenary session Wednesday or Thursday for a vote on the  premiership.    He told reporters that the lower house will hold the  vote-taking plenary session as soon as the heads of the  coalition parties pick their official nominee for the next prime  minister.    Hata said Monday that cabinet changes must be minimal after  the establishment of a new government.    Hata, 58, head of Shinseito, the coalition's core party,  told  reporters late Monday night, "I think it's difficult to replace  many of the cabinet members who worked out the fiscal 1994  budget if the present coalition agrees to establish a new  government."    Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, said the new  government must be a full-fledged rather than provisional  government because Japan needs to meet the expectations of the  rest of the world.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] on Saturday alleged  VABAL scam (Value Based Advanced Licensing scheme) worth  thousands of crores, may turn out to be much bigger than the  stock scam, urging the government to inquire into it and punish  the guilty.    Talking to newsmen BJP economic exports Jai Dubashi who is a  member of the national executive alleged that in this scam that  concerns commerce ministry, the customs revenue had been hit by  Rs 3,000 [rupees] crore and that excuse revenue by another Rs  2,000 crore. He said the exports figures being quoted by the  government are highly inflated and need be inquired and checked.    He said people involved in this VABAL scam are owners of  firms close to the ruling Congress party. At least one firm had  figures previously in a similar case of dubious import-export  business.    In a joint statement Mr Jay Dubashi and BJP spokesman  Krishan  Lal Sharma, MP [member of Parliament] said there was no end to  scams under the Narasimha Rao Government. Two years ago it was  the stock and banking scam in which over Rs 5,000 crore were  spirited away under the nose of a slumbering Finance Minister by  a gaggle of Congress politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen  close to the ruling party.    And now there was another scam this time in the Commerce  Ministry from whom exporters and businessmen claiming to be  exporters secured licences for exports and robbed the government  of over Rs 1,800 crore by manipulating an export incentive  scheme called VABAL.    The joint statement of the BJP leaders termed the above  figure as only the tip of the iceberg as the actual loss must be  much more--so large that it was unlikely to have taken place  without the collusion of insiders in the ministry, just as the  stock and banking scandal was the handiwork of people who had an  access to the highest levels in the Finance Ministry and the  Reserve Bank of India. The modus operandi of the exports "under  the VABAL scheme is that an exporter files a declaration for  exports or fictitious exports, obviously in collusion with  authorities which can be as much as 20 to 30 times his actual  exports. The foreign exchange he "earns" was nothing but his own  money sent out of India through "Hawala" transactions. These  bogus "exports" promptly go into the books of the Commerce  Ministry as legitimate exports, though they are nothing of the  kind."    "In addition, the exporter gets import licences for raw  materials on the basis of his bogus declaration, which can be as  large as two-thirds of "exporters." He does not pay customs and  other duties on them. Thus he launders black money into white,  cheats on taxes and helps the Commerce Ministry to cook up its  books and claim that exports are booming said the joint  statement.    They said some of the first which have received such  licences are close to the ruling party. At least one firm has  figured previously in a similar case of dubious import-export  business, the BJP leaders alleged in their statement maintaining  that if exporters can claim bogus exports under VABAL scheme  they can also do so outside VABAL, which meant that a large  proportion of the so-called exports must be fictitious.    The joint statement wanted the Commerce and the Finance  Ministries to come clean on the VABAL scam and tell the BJP what  steps if any they have taken so far to plug the loopholes and to  book the culprits.</p>

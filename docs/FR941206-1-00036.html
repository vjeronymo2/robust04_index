The rationale for this proposed approval is set forth below; additional information is available at the address indicated below.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before January 5, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments should be sent to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act, as amended in 1990 (Act), requires States containing ozone nonattainment areas classified as ``severe'' pursuant to section 181(a) of the Act to adopt transportation control measures (TCMs) and transportation control strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips, and to attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with other emission reduction requirements) as necessary to comply with the Act's RFP milestones and attainment requirements. The requirements for establishing a VMT Offset program are discussed in the April 16, 1992, General Preamble to Title I of the Act (57 FR 13498), in addition to section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For certain programs required under the Act (including VMT-Offset), USEPA had earlier adopted a policy pursuant to section 110(k)(4) of the Act to conditionally approve SIPs that committed to provide the USEPA with specific enforceable measures by a date certain. That interpretation was challenged in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Browner <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , consolidated lawsuits brought in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In a full opinion, dated May 6, 1994 (and in a March 8, 1994 Order and April 22, 1994 Amended Order issued earlier) the Court found that USEPA's conditional approval interpretation exceeded USEPA's statutory authority. While the court did not specifically address the VMT Offset program in it's orders or opinions, USEPA believes that the court's general conclusion that the Agency's construction of the conditional approval provision was unlawful precludes USEPA from taking action to approve any submitted VMT Offset committal SIPs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 26, 1993, the USEPA published a proposed rule (58 FR 62309) to conditionally approve Illinois's commitment for the VMT-Offset requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the decision reached in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Browner <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , USEPA has decided not to go forward with conditional approvals of VMT committal SIPs, but that it would be appropriate to interpret the VMT Offset provision of the Act to account for how States can practicably comply with each of the provision's elements. The VMT Offset provision requires that States submit by November 15, 1992, specific enforceable TCMs and strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips, sufficient to allow total area emissions to comply with the RFP and attainment requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris beg to differ on Bundesbank FRANKFURT and Paris harboured conflicting views about the Bundesbank's actions today, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was further buffeted by gloomy economic forecasts and a belief that the Bundesbank will not ease interest rates at today's council meeting. The DAX index fell to an intraday low of 1,492 but ended 7.65 lower at 1,500.59. Turnover was not available yesterday. A report from the Ifo research institute forecasting little prospect for economic recovery before 1994 came on top of a study by west German retailers which saw a 1 per cent decline in sales in 1992, the first decline in 10 years. Deutsche Bank fell another DM5.10 to DM648 following Tuesday's disappointing 10-month results, while Daimler was DM5.30 easier at DM517.70 as selling continued following Airbus's recent order loss. Lufthansa went against the trend with a 50 pfg rise to DM96 after announcing that it had taken a 13 per cent stake in Luxembourg's national airline. Volkswagen improved DM2.50 to DM254 after its recent weakness. PARIS had a quiet morning but was lifted in the afternoon by a strong Matif which rose on hopes of a cut in German interest rates today, though equity dealers were not so convinced. The CAC-40 index ended 25.28 or 1.4 per cent higher at 1,791.16 in good turnover of FFr2.5bn. The rise in the index was helped by a big rebound in Elf which bounced back by FFr18 or 5.4 per cent to FFr350 after Tuesday's 4.1 per cent fall following its chairman's profit warning. The most active stock yesterday was Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez which fell another FFr22 or 4.5 per cent to FFr460 on worries about the financial outlook for its Dumez building subsidiary. The drinks group Pernod Ricard dropped FFr11.70 or 3.2 per cent to FFr354.30 on news that a board meeting planned for yesterday had been postponed until January, raising fears about the company's 1992 results. MILAN had a mixed day after Tuesday's closure as Stet rose on privatisation hopes and Fiat dived on worse-than-expected November car sales. The Comit index rose 1.11 to 432.03 in turnover estimated at more than Monday's L121bn. Fiat was settled L25 higher at L4,125 but then fell as low as L3,950 in afternoon trading in London on reports that its car sales had fallen 11.74 per cent in November from the same month a year earlier. Stet was fixed L14 up at L1,578 but reached L1,655 in the afternoon on news that the government was prepared to sell its controlling stake in the telecommunications company. ZURICH saw activity in chemicals and pharmaceuticals as the SMI index rose 18.2 to 1,980.7. Ciba-Geigy was one of the day's most active stocks as its registered shares rose SFr5 to SFr601. Georg Fischer bearers put on SFr5 to SFr685 in spite of the company's forecast that 1992 group results would be below expectations. AMSTERDAM was higher and ING featured among favoured stocks. The CBS Tendency index was 0.4 higher at 106.2 as ING rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 52.30. The insurer has been performing strongly since releasing good nine-month figures last week. ABN Amro was 70 cents up at Fl 49.90. STOCKHOLM extended its rally into a third day, thanks to heavy demand for shares in Astra. Its B shares finished up SKr17 at SKr727 on speculation of a share split and hopes of positive news at a forthcoming analysts meeting. The Affarsvarlden general index advanced 12.0 to 898.4 as turnover rose to SKr866m from SKr579m, of which Astra accounted for SKr140m. ISTANBUL fell back 1 per cent on rumours that a withholding tax might be introduced soon on earnings from stock trading and on dividend income. The 75-share index fell 40.25 to 3,816.09 in turnover of TL140bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 9                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes                Open      10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1052.59    1053.98     1054.10     1050.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1133.85    1135.02     1133.16     1131.30  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Dec 8      Dec 7       Dec 4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100               1051.12    1056.02     1052.78 FT-SE Eurotrack 200               1135.64    1137.52     1133.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00     14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100          1050.53   1050.51     1051.63     1054.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1129.90   1130.25     1132.31     1133.46  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Dec 3             Dec 2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100                    1055.11           1052.11 FT-SE Eurotrack 200                    1136.09           1130.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1055.16 ; 200 -  1135.67 Low/day: 100 -  1049.73  200 -  1128.11  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

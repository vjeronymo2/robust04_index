			<p>BFN     [Text] On Saturday Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev sent congratulation telegrams due  to the forthcoming Victory Day addressed to the chairman of the  Sevastopol city council of people's deputies Viktor Semenov,  residents of Sevastopol, and the Black Sea Fleet mariners.    Having congratulated the Sevastopol residents and the Black  Sea Fleet mariners with the Victory Day and with the 50th  anniversary of the liberation of the city from German fascists,  Yeltsin stressed in his telegram that Sevastopol, the major base  of the Black Sea Fleet, "is one of the national sacred places  for all Russians" which "strengthens the force and the spirit of  the Russian people and gives them a hope for the best future."  "Eternal glory to those heroes who defended the freedom and  independence of Sevastopol," says the president's telegram.    For his part, Pavel Grachev pointed out that despite "the  difficult times" which Sevastopol is experiencing now "neither  economic difficulties, nor political contradictions, nor painful  problems related to the Black Sea Fleet division should darken  this bright holiday."    "During my recent visit to Sevastopol I was made sure of the  strong will of the residents of this hero-city and saw how its  residents trust that their city would be the major base of the  well known Black Sea Fleet," Grachev underlined.</p>

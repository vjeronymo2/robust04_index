			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Finance &amp; the Family: When your house is worth less than the mortgage . . . - A look at the problem of negative equity and suggests some ways to relieve the strain FEELING positive when you have negative equity is difficult although, for most people, the thought that their mortgage might exceed the value of their home turns into a problem only when they need to move. Negative equity is largely a regional problem affecting areas where house price inflation was at its highest in the mid to late 1980s. 'Nearly all the problem is south of the Midlands,' says David Gilchrist, general manager of corporate development at the Halifax building society, the largest lender. The problem is also confined, for the most part, to first-time buyers. According to the Woolwich building society, Britain's fourth-largest lender, 9 per cent of all British home-owners have negative equity and 70 per cent of those live in the south of England. But 75 per cent are first-timers. The Woolwich found that the number of home-owners with negative equity had dropped from 1.8m in the year's first quarter to 1.45m in the second. This was due to a 3.2 per cent rise in house prices (recorded by the Halifax) between the first and second quarter. The Woolwich estimates the average amount of negative equity per household to have dropped from Pounds 7,200 in the first quarter to Pounds 6,600 in the second. Sitting tight and waiting for house prices to rise is the easiest way out of negative equity. But what of those who bought a one-bedroom or studio flat and now have a family? Or others who have to move because of their job? The costs of moving are substantial. Not only is there the negative equity debt - the other outgoings include estate agents' fees, surveys, stamp duty (on properties worth over Pounds 60,000), a deposit on the new home and, for loans of more than 75 per cent of the property's value, a mortgage indemnity premium. (This is a one-off insurance premium which protects the lender, not you, against a mortgage default.) The options for coping with these problems are limited but, broadly, they are: beg, borrow or save. Talking to your lender Begging for help is perhaps an exaggerated way of describing the first step, which is to talk to your bank or building society about the matter. Lenders have adopted a policy of 'forbearance' to reduce the level of repossessions (see below) and have extended this - although on a limited basis - to those with negative equity. You are most likely to get co-operation if your move also benefits the lender. If you live in London but have a job offer in Birmingham, it is in the interests of the lender to help you move to ensure that you will be able to keep up payments. But lenders usually will help their negative equity customers only if they have a strong payments record. A few lenders have packaged schemes but most work on a case-by-case basis. Although the Halifax has eschewed packages because it says each person's circumstances differ, it is running a pilot study on such a plan although warning that it cannot be promoted as a solution to negative equity problems. Transferring the negative equity The Halifax prefers to deal with negative equity by letting the person move and then transferring the shortfall on the old loan to the new property by granting a mortgage of more than 100 per cent on the new one. The maximum it will loan is 125 per cent of the value of the latter. If your existing mortgage was Pounds 100,000 and the cost of the new property also was Pounds 100,000, you would be able to buy it if your negative equity was not more than Pounds 25,000. But your new total debt of Pounds 125,000 must not exceed three times the level of your income. The mortgage indemnity premium in this example would be Pounds 1,750. The Halifax will not give additional help (although the mortgage indemnity premium could be deducted from the loan) and expects people to have built up savings for moving expenses. The Royal Bank of Scotland follows a similar policy by granting loans up to 125 per cent on a new house, to a maximum Pounds 200,000. The new mortgage, however, is granted at half a percentage point over the bank's standard variable rate, now 7.99 per cent. Instead of a mortgage indemnity premium, the RBS will charge an arrangement fee of 1 per cent of the loan, to a maximum of Pounds 1,000. Under the Woolwich's Mobility Mortgage, an effective trade-down would be necessary because the price of the new property would have to match (or be less than) the sale price of the existing home. The negative equity would be added to the new loan, bringing the home-owner up to the same level of borrowing as before. Top-up loans The Leeds and Nationwide societies will grant 100 per cent mortgages on the new property with a top-up loan where necessary. The maximum limit on the top-up loan is Pounds 25,000 at Nationwide, charged at 15 per cent APR if the loan is unsecured and 12 per cent APR if it is secured on another property. Under the Leeds' scheme, the total debt cannot exceed 125 per cent of the purchase price of the new property, and the 25 per cent loan would be charged at the society's standard variable rate. Substituting equity The Leeds, Woolwich, Nationwide and Yorkshire societies will allow borrowers to use their parents' home (or that of anyone else willing to sign the documents) as security for a larger loan. The details of the schemes differ but the cheapest way is for two mortgages to be taken out, one on your new home and one on that of your parents. You could avoid paying the mortgage indemnity premium by borrowing up to 75 per cent of the value of new home, with the parental mortgage making up the shortfall. 100 per cent mortgage Those with enough savings to pay off their negative equity, and who can afford moving expenses but not the deposit on a new home, can consider a 100 per cent mortgage. This market was virtually dead until recently, but some lenders have ventured in again. Take care to get a quotation for the full final cost of the mortgage (including arrangement and other fees) before taking it out. The Abbey National will consider 100 per cent mortgages for its own customers while mortgage-broker John Charcol and the Household Mortgage Corporation will consider applicants meeting their criteria as long as they are second-time buyers. The Royal Bank of Scotland will also grant 100 per cent mortgages, but only to first-time buyers. The 100 per cent loan can be taken out in various forms at John Charcol. You can get the full 100 per cent or, to avoid the indemnity premium, a 75 per cent mortgage with a loan covering the other 25 per cent (although the interest on this proportion would be at a higher variable rate of 10.5 per cent). Fixed rates are available for the mortgage portion. The HMC also offers fixed and variable rates (its standard variable rate is 7.69 per cent). Indemnity premiums are on the high side; for a loan of Pounds 100,000, the charge would be Pounds 2,500. This can be added to the mortgage if that is up to 95 per cent of the value of the home, but will be subtracted otherwise.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Poles reject idea of shares gift from state MOST Poles would prefer to pay for shares in newly privatised state enterprises than receive them free, according to an official Polish survey. The survey, commissioned by the Polish Privatisation Ministry, also showed that a majority intend to treat their allocation of shares from Poland's impending mass privatisation scheme as a long-term investment rather than than a vehicle for quick profit. A year ago, during the presidential election campaign, Mr Lech Walesa told Poles that privatisation would give every Pole free shares in former state-owned companies that would be worth 100m zloties - about Dollars 1,000 each. It was a vastly over-inflated figure which made bankers and economists wince and provoked general disbelief. It did little for Mr Walesa's reputation as an economist, but was widely discounted as political hyperbole and did not prevent his eventual election. The latest confirmation of Polish realism virtually ensures that when final details of Poland's mass privatisation scheme are revealed within the next few weeks the original plan of free shares for every adult Pole will not be on offer. Instead Poles will be offered 'participation certificates' for a fee of between 10 and 20 per cent of the presumed value of the shares in more than 200 medium- to large-sized enterprises. The shares themselves will be managed by new investment funds whose key personnel are expected to be foreign specialists on contract. But the survey also revealed suspicion of the foreign element in the new investment funds, provoking the Privatisation Ministry to propose setting up a panel of senior Polish professionals to keep watch over the foreign merchant bankers and investment specialists who have applied to manage the 10 to 20 proposed closed-end funds. The reaction of the would-be foreign managers to such surveillance remains to be seen. Meanwhile, close observers of Czechoslovakia's proposed 'voucher privatisation' believe that implementation of the scheme could provide unexpectedly cheap, and possibly politically sensitive, bargains for aggressive foreign investors. A recent analysis by Mr Jan Vanous, of the Washington based Planecon research unit concluded that 'flaws in the voucher privatisation scheme virtually guarantee that Czechoslovakia will be a place with a large number of investment bargains for anyone willing to incur some risk'. This follows the sudden surge in popularity of the privatisation vouchers which have now been bought by over 8.5m Czech and Slovak citizens.</p>

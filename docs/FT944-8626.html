			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Markets Report: US dollar slips as benefit of rate increase fades The foreign exchange markets took a post-Fed breather yesterday as the after-shocks from Tuesday's rise in the Federal Funds rate started to fade, writes Philip Coggan. The US dollar lost some more of the gains it made in the wake of the 75 basis-point rise in rates, which was higher than market expectations. Neither US economic data, nor a report from Germany's 'wise men' saying there would be no further rate cuts, had much impact on the market. Sterling managed a slight rally, with the trade weighted index finishing at 79.8 from Wednesday's 79.7. Against the dollar, the pound edged up in London to Dollars 1.5742 from Dollars 1.5713, although against the D-Mark it eased a shade to DM2.4368 from DM2.4371. Overall, the pound is well down from its recent trade-weighted peak of 81, which came after a strong rally from below 79 following September's increase in base rates from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent. Yesterday's weaker than expected UK retail sales data appeared to confirm the impression left by Wednesday's mass of economic statistics - that an imminent interest rate rise was unlikely. Short sterling continued its recent rally, with the March future rising 5 basis points to 93.00 and the December contract up 4 basis points to 93.73. Nevertheless, analysts still think the markets are overest-imating the potential for an early rate rise. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said: 'The retail figures were another nail in the coffin of the interest rate bears. People are not now expecting the authorities to raise interest rates ahead of Christmas.' The pound has also been affected by political uncertainty arising from Prime Minister John Major's battle with Eurosceptics over the increased UK contribution to the European Union budget. Mr Michael Burke, an economist at Citibank, said: 'Against a background of higher US interest rates, sterling has come off quite substantially. If there is to be capital flow from Europe to the US, sterling is more likely to suffer than a hard currency like the D-Mark.' However, Mr Burke felt that an upward revision to the GDP data, published today, might take some of the shine off interest rate optimism and give support to sterling. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in Europe, believes the pound can climb above DM2.50, once the European Union Finance Bill is passed and the Budget is out of the way. Yesterday's varied economic data - October housing starts, the latest weekly jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed index - seemed to have little effect on the dollar. Against the yen, the US currency eased to Y98.145 from Wednesday's Y98.38 close, while it slipped to DM1.548 from DM1.551. It ended in New York at Y98.325 and DM1.5524. The German independent council of economic advisers, known as the five wise men, predicted an average exchange rate of DM1.60/Dollars in 1995, implying a dollar rebound from current levels. Yesterday, the dollar was not helped by the weaker Treasury bond market. The 30-year bond dropped around  3/4 point in early trade and ended  3/8 down. JP Morgan's Mr Persaud said: 'The key condition for the dollar to recover is for US investors to feel more comfortable buying Treasury bonds.' At the moment, he believes 'the market is genuinely uncertain whether the Fed has done enough; but ultimately the market will conclude that the Fed has injected credibility into monetary policy'. However, Mr Charles Ranald, managing director of the foreign exchange analysis group Forexia (UK), said charts indicate that the US currency is heading down towards DM1.53 in the short term. After a period of consolidation at that level, he thinks it will then move to DM1.50 and below. The Irish punt took the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, in its stride, finishing modestly higher against the D-Mark at DM2.396, from DM2.386 on Wednesday. 'Nobody really believes that a new government would alter the shape of economic policy,' said Mr Cunningham at UBS. The Bank of England gave the UK money markets Pounds 825m help in two tranches, having forecast an Pounds 800m shortage. Overnight rates traded within a range of 5 to 4.25 per cent.</p>

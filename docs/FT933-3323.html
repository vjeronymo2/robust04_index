			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airtours placing A large placing of shares by the directors of Airtours weakened the stock, although a bullish trading statement accompanying the announcement limited the fall. Hoare Govett, the company's newly appointed broker, placed 5.1m shares with institutional clients at 403p. The move takes directors' total holdings in the company from around 47 per cent to 42.4. Airtours said the sale was designed to widen the shareholder base of the company and improve liquidity. The shares lost 6 to 409p. Airtours said its full year results 'will not disappoint the market', indicating that it is likely to beat current forecasts. Bookings for summer 1993 are 20 per cent ahead of the previous year, the company added. Hoare Govett yesterday upgraded its profits forecast by some 5 per cent to Pounds 43m for the current year. But few other brokers followed suit. One leisure analyst said Airtours was currently trading at the top of its market rating - which, in line with other holiday companies, is at a substantial discount to the market - and was unlikely to attract further upward revisions in market forecasts. He added that Airtours' positive trading performance had been largely discounted in the share price. A mixed performance by Whitbread shares provided the focus of interest in a drinks sector largely overshadowed by tough UK trading conditions reported by Foster's, the large Australian brewer. Whitbread responded to further speculation that the non-voting 'B' shares would be enfranchised, with the news annnounced with the group's results, due in November. The 'B' shares jumped 125 to 1325p, while the 'A' stock, which would be diluted should Whitbread restructure, slipped 11 to 538p. Grand Metropolitan was one of the few bright spots, where continued expectations of the sale of its Chef &amp; Brewer group of restaurants and public houses were being felt. The shares put on 5 at 430p. Guinness dipped 5 to 473p following Inchcape's report of a poor Japanese market. Disappointment with the results sent Dalgety down to 480p, but the stock recovered on consideration of continuing yield attractions, finishing only a penny off at 490p. Nervousness ahead of Thursday's results left United Biscuits 7 cheaper at 359p. Thorn EMI recovered from last week's profits warning, with Hoare Govett also recommending the stock. The shares moved up 12 to 983p. Press reports of an unprecedented demand for Mercury One-2-One handsets, launched in a blaze of publicity last week, hurt Vodafone, the company's cellular rival. Vodafone retreated 9 to 484p. Water and electricity issues were again in demand on yield considerations, with UBS also said to be strongly recommending selected stocks. Among those gaining ground in the Recs, Midlands rose 11 to 580p and Yorkshire the same amount to 585p. In waters, North West added 4 at 530p. Shares in Kwik-Fit were wanted ahead of figures on Thursday and they firmed 6 to 169p. The day's biggest turnover - 24.3m shares - was recorded in engineering group Babcock International, which fell sharply last week following a profits warning. Bargain hunters were out in force yesterday and the shares bounced 4 to 33 3/4 p. Last week's poor results from P&amp;O continued to exact a toll and the stock gave up a further 14 to 597p as 2m shares were traded. International trading group Lonrho hardened  1/2 to 119 1/2 p on reports, confirmed after the market close, that it and the Ghanaian government are to seek a listing on the Ghanaian and London markets for Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, in which Lonrho has a 45 per cent stake. Shell Transport, the UK arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, rose 10 1/2 to 664p as investors switched into the stock for the dividend benefits. The Dutch arm, Royal Dutch Petroleum, went ex-dividend yesterday and income buyers were selling the shares to buy Shell Transport, which trades xd from Monday. International conference organiser Blenheim fell 30 at one stage on highly critical comment in the press. However, 300p tends to provide a floor for the share price and once it hit that level it recovered to close 10 off at 318p. Invesco, the fund manager which managed a proportion of Mirror Group pensions, fell 14 to 164p on weekend comment that there might be more legal claims in the offing from the trustees of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme. The fund said yesterday it was 'surprised and outraged' to read reports of the possibility of further claims. Reuters Holdings was up on the eve of its seminar to New York analysts and a reiterated 'buy' from SG Warburg. The shares gained 11 at 1566p. Big internationally traded stocks offering a solid yield continued to outperform, with Hanson closing firmer at 252 1/4 p in active trade of 9.1m and ICI rising 11 1/2 to 728p.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Yefimovich report: "Radioactive Train"] </F>   [Text] Several containers of Polonium-210 have been seized  from the transport network by staffers of the Volga-Vyatka  Internal Affairs Administration. The newspaper NIZHEGORODSKIYE  NOVOSTI reports that the unusual contraband had been despatched  from Arzamas-16 to sovereign Kiev for use in X-ray machines.  But the investigation will show whether this was actually the  case.    The containers of dangerous radioactive polonium-210 had  crossed virtually all of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast from south to  north. And they were coupled to a...passenger train. The cost  to the passengers of this little journey is as yet unknown.</p>

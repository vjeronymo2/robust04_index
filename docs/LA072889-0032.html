			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DAVIDSON SETTLES FOR 3 MEDALS IN TABLE TENNIS  </P> <P> Carol Davidson will return home to North Hollywood with three U.S. Olympic  Festival medals, but not the one she wanted most.  </P> <P> Davidson, 30, won a medal in every event -- except women's singles. Arditch  Lonnon of St. Paul, Minn., knocked off Davidson 21-18, 9-21, 13-21, 23-21,  21-16, in the quarterfinal round Thursday night at Oklahoma Christian College's  Payne Field House.  </P> <P> Davidson was the second-highest-ranked player in the Olympic Festival field.  Only Li Ai of Colorado Springs, Colo., was rated higher, and Davidson had  already defeated her once in team competition.  </P> <P> Ai later defeated Lonnon to win the gold medal, 21-12, 21-14, 21-13.  </P> <P> "With this field I felt I should have won the tournament," Davidson said.  "Normally I can hit, but I played too defensive. I didn't play smart."  </P> <P> Davidson advanced to the quarterfinals with a perfect record in pool play.  </P> <P> She defeated Kristey Reed of Enola, Pa., 21-11, 21-8; Donna Sakai of Lanham,  Md., 21-17, 21-14; and Kerry Terrel of Richland, Wash., 21-11, 21-15.  </P> <P> Davidson, the 1986 U. S. women's amateur singles champion, has won nine medals  -- two golds, one silver and six bronze -- in five Festival appearances.  </P> <P> This year, she won a gold medal in women's doubles and bronzes in the team and  mixed doubles events.  </P> <P> MEN'S VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> For the second match in a row, the North team, with Coley Kyman at middle  blocker, won its first game then lost three in a row. This time it was the West  that took advantage for a 6-15, 15-5, 15-13, 15-12 victory at Lloyd Noble Arena  in Norman, Okla.  </P> <P> Kyman, a two-time City 3-A player of the year at Reseda High who will be a  freshman at Cal State Northridge in the fall, was second on the North with 15  kills. He also had a team-high two service aces and a stuff block.  </P> <P> TEAM HANDBALL  </P> <P> Jeff Fruin, Kevin Withrow and Mike Hurdle combined to score 12 goals for the  West, but the South pulled out an 18-14 win at the State Fairgrounds.  </P> <P> Fruin, from Camarillo, had five goals; Withrow, from Thousand Oaks, had four;  and Hurdle, from Reseda, added three.  </P> <P> FIELD HOCKEY  </P> <P> The two teams dominated by Valley-area players -- the West and the South --  will battle for bronze today.  </P> <P> The North defeated the West, 2-1, on a penalty stroke shoot-out at Cameron  University in Lawton, Okla.  </P> <P> The North's opponent in Friday's gold-medal game will be the East, which scored  four second-half goals to defeat the South, 4-2, in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Derek Wallace, a former Chatsworth High standout, took the loss as the East  turned 13 hits and five errors into a 13-2 victory over the West at All Sports  Stadium.  </P> <P> The East, which will play the North in Saturday's gold medal game, was paced by  Doug Hecker of Wantgh, N. Y., and pitcher Rob Mosser of Oley, Pa.  </P> <P> Hecker went 4 for 5 with two doubles, two triples and five runs batted in.  Mosser pitched a three-hitter and retired 18 in a row from the third inning  through the eighth.  </P></p>

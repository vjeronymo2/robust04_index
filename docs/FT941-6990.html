			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Watching and waiting - Alison Smith assesses the new Personal Investment Authority From July a new watchdog, the Personal Investment Authority, is due to open for business. The PIA's brief is to improve sharply the standards for independent financial advisers, life companies, banks and building societies selling financial services to private investors. It will replace the existing regulatory bodies for these services such as Fimbra and Lautro. There is some scepticism in the industry and among consumer groups about whether investor protection standards will rise significantly once the PIA starts. And there is bound to be a long period while the jury of public opinion considers if any overall improvement has been made. In the meantime, the PIA does have a valuable - if unheroic - fallback position because of the general welcome for its plans to deal with consumer complaints. The proposals for handling complaints are among the more detailed and definite aspects of the PIA prospectus, published on Monday. Indeed, the most likely problem with the systems it sets up may well be a degree of over-kill for even the most aggrieved investor. In the first instance, these systems cover the internal procedures for handling complaints of every firm regulated by the PIA. The firms must acknowledge complaints within seven days and give the customer a copy of an official leaflet setting out how these are dealt with. If the issue is not resolved in two months, the customer must be told he can refer the matter to the PIA ombudsman. The second stage is the ombudsman scheme itself. The ombudsman will try to conciliate but, if that proves impossible, will make a judgment. Whatever the strict legal position, he will be able to give precedence to the PIA's own principles, rules and codes. If the customer is content with the ombudsman's award (up to a maximum of Pounds 50,000), then the firm will have to pay. Above that limit - which is half that for the insurance ombudsman at present - the PIA ombudsman can recommend a high award if he thinks the case warrants it. Firms will have to join the scheme, but they will also be able to volunteer to give the ombudsman an extra role. This would cover complaints relating to life policies - an issue that goes wider than simply regulating the way a firm does business. In this role, the ombudsman could deal with a complaint about how a life office had handled a maturity claim - an area which might well not affect the way in which the PIA regulated one of its members. As is usual with ombudsman schemes, that of the PIA will be supervised by a council - chaired in this case by Baroness Turner of Camden, a Labour front-bench spokesman in the House of Lords. In addition, the PIA will appoint a complaints commissioner whose task will be to keep under review, and report annually on, how the way PIA handles complaints against the firms it regulates - and against itself. Aggrieved investors were on the minds of another regulator this week as the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, published its proposals for overhauling the investors' compensation scheme (ICS). This acts as a safety net for investors who have lost out from bad advice and find that those responsible are not around to provide compensation. SIB's paper says that compensating people who have lost out after following poor advice to transfer from an occupational pension scheme will be dealt with outside the normal ICS arrangements. Some estimates for compensation over these transfers have reached Pounds 1bn, but even those who refuse to believe they will be that high concede they are likely to top Pounds 100m - although at least some of that will be covered by the firms which wrote the business and have made provisions against possible liabilities. A permanent agreement about how to handle pension transfer claims where firms are unable to meet their liabilities is unlikely to come into effect until the autumn. In other respects, however, this week's proposals will not affect the way in which the ICS operates as far as investors are concerned. SIB has decided against the suggestion that separate schemes for different parts of the financial services sector might be set up. Nor will there be a change to the limits on compensation paid for any one claim: a maximum of Pounds 48,000, made up of 100 per cent of the first Pounds 30,000 and 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000.</p>

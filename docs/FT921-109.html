			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Pearson close to buying Outram from Lonrho PEARSON, owner of the Financial Times, is close to a deal to buy George Outram, publisher of The Herald newspaper in Glasgow. Negotiations are at an advanced stage with Mr 'Tiny' Rowland's Lonrho, owner of George Outram. It is believed that a price for the deal has been agreed, although no formal agreement has been signed. An initial bid from Pearson, which yesterday announced better-than-expected pre-tax profits of nearly Pounds 174m for 1991, was rejected by Lonrho as being too low. It is believed that the early bid was in the region of Pounds 70m and that a higher offer has since been made. Although the Observer newspaper is technically part of George Outram it is not part of this deal. Apart from The Herald, which changed its name from the Glasgow Herald in February as part of a redesign, the deal covers the Evening Times, the Glasgow evening paper, and a number of magazines, including the profitable Scottish Farmer. Circulation of The Herald is more than 124,000 as it competes increasingly against its Edinburgh-based rival, The Scotsman. If, as seems likely, the deal goes ahead, it will be the latest part of the Lonrho empire to be sold to reduce debt. Last week the company announced that it had sold a one-third stake in its Metropole Hotels chain for Pounds 177m to the state-run Libyan Arab Investment Company. A Pearson purchase of The Herald would automatically be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission but is unlikely to be blocked. Pearson's regional newspaper division, Westminster Press, has no titles in Scotland. Last night Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director of Pearson, declined to comment. Yesterday Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive of Pearson, firmly ruled out once again any interest in acquiring Mirror Group Newspapers. Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, said last night: 'We have not sold our newspapers to Pearson, nor are we negotiating to sell our newspapers to Pearson.' However, since Lonrho signalled its intention to make a series of big disposals, the market has expected the sale of the George Outram subsidiary. Mr Spicer refused to comment that negotiations had taken place, or were about to take place, with Pearson, or whether Lonrho was negotiating the sale of George Outram. Pearson profits fall 23% to Pounds 173.8m, Page 23</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] An Australian parliamentary delegation believes a  settlement of the five-year old Bougainville secessionist  conflict may be reached in a matter of months. The five  parliamentarians visited Bougainville in April and also held  discussions with the Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government and  Defense Forces.    The report of the delegation's visit, which had been tabled  today in Parliament, concludes that there can be no military  solution to the conflict and recommends a timetable be set for a  peaceful resolution. It also suggested the Australian military  may have a role to play in rebuilding the island.    Labor senator Stephen Loosley, who as head of the delegation  last week handed the copy of the report to the PNG Government,  outlined its conclusions to Lyndal Curtis in Canberra.    [Begin recording] [Loosley] The peace process ought to work  on the basis of the participants that are parties to the  conflict talking directly within an agreed framework, with an  agreed agenda with a person agreed by both sides as being  suitable to chair the talks on the basis of a timeframe that is  known to everyone, so that the focus is there and that people  are conscious of their responsibilities.    We have been heartened by the responses that has come from  both PNG and from the Bougainville interim government.    [Curtis] What about the concept of a South Pacific regional  peacekeeping force raised by Sir Julian Chan? Is that a valid  concept?    [Loosley] Yes, is very valid. The notion of neighboring  South Pacific countries playing a role is one that the  delegation recogizes would have very positive consequences. On  that basis, there is a specific recommendation that ought to be  an option.    Our view as a delegation was that Australia should work in  concert with PNG to resolve the crisis. What we are saying is  that a cease-fire having been implemented and effective border  management having become the norm between Bougainville and the  Solomons, then humanitarian assistance ought to be able to flow  very freely across the island to the areas of greatest need.  And in that respect, we have suggested that the island be  opened up to a range of humanitarian organizations,  nongovernment organizations, the churches to make certain that  humanitarian assistance and support flows to areas of very real  need.    [Curtis] Is the will there in the PNG cabinet for, say, a  regional peacekeeping force or for a wider peace process to work.    [Loosley] My belief is very clearly that it is. Last week  as a courtesy to the Government of Papua New Guinea, I took an  advance copy of the report to Port Moresby for the foreign  minister, Sir Julius Chan, and for Prime Minister Wingti, and  the response was very positive in terms of people having had an  opportunity to talk with me about our delegation's findings.  And subsequent to that, of course, we have learned that there  are ongoing discussions between the parties to the conflict  which again is a very positive step, a major step forward. So,  in terms of the resolve, I believe that within the Government of  PNG the resolve exists.    [Curtis] Does Australia have a role to play in the peace  process, or is the fact that the BRA [Bouganiville Revolutionary  Army] sees Australia as far too close to the PNG militarily  rules us out?    [Loosley] I think that is less true now than when it was a  year or two ago. The delegation worked very hard at being as  open- minded and evenhanded as we could, both in terms of the  briefings that we undertook to have prior to our departure and  the discussions that we had within PNG and subsequent to our  return, and the letter that I have had from Mr. (Moses Seveni),  who is the representative in Australia of the Bougainville  interim government, has been very positive in terms of our  delegation's visit. And my view is Australia therefore has a  role to play in terms of supporting the peace process, in terms  of logistical assistance, in terms of following through, once  the peace process is hopefully proved successful, as I trust it  will. And in that respect, we are talking very much in terms of  rehabilitation and reconstruction.    [Curtis] Is there any role to play in the military [word  indistinct]?    [Loosley] Our delegation is of the view that the Australian  defense cooperation program could quite reasonably and  realistically be extended to Bougainville in that type of effort  -- road building, bridge building, the provision of  infrastructure, health care, schools, things of that nature -- a  very positive constribution at which our military have proved so  able in terms of the defense cooperation program in West PNG and  other parts of the country and of course, in other peacekeeping  operations.    [Curtis] Could that potentially mean Australian troops on  the ground in Bougainville helping in rebuilding effort?    [Loosley] I don't know that we would be looking to move in  that direction quickly, if at all. I certainly think that there  is a role for the defense cooperation program to be extended,  though, in order to make sure that those skills are available to  PNG to embark upon further rehabilitation and reconstruction.    There will have to be a clear peace settlement in place and  security very clearly defined and guaranteed before it would be  a circumstance where that kind of intitiative could be taken.    [Curtis] How about the question of human rights and claims  of breaches of human rights during the conflict?    [Loosley] Yes, we endeavored to address that very directly.  We have urged the Government of PNG to look at the Amnesty  International report on human rights abuses by both sides as a  benchmark. We have been heartened by the announcement by Prime  Minister Wingti of Human Rights Commission for PNG and also of a  police complaints unit to be located on Buka Island. So the  response to date has been positive.    We are firmly of the view that there has to be a process of  accountability. The delegation's view was that the rule of law  must return to Bougainville in an evenhanded way and  circumstances of human rights abuses be judged on the basis of  evidence in a fair and reasonable way and those responsible be  brought to justice and be made accountable.    [Curtis] In your view and the committee's view, is it  reasonable to expect that the conflict on Bougainville will be  finally resolved in a matter of months?    [Loosley] That would certainly be our hope. In terms of the  time to make peace, I don't think there has been a better  opportunity for negotiations and discussions and for peace  settlement and reconciliation. [end recording]</p>

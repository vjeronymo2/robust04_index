			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [George Jones article: "Major Leaves Door Open for Europe </F> Referendum"]    [Text] Mr John Major kept open the door to a referendum on  closer ties with Europe last night as he sought to head off a  damaging Tory party split ahead of next month's European  elections.    He was responding to pressure from senior back-benchers,  would-be Euro-rebels and former Cabinet ministers to promise a  plebiscite before Britain joined a single currency or  surrendered further powers to Brussels.    After a day of hurried consultations in Downing Street and  Conservative Party headquarters, the Government's hard line  against a referendum appeared to be softening. Party officials  said that, while Mr Major's personal view was still against a  referendum, the door was not "locked and bolted."    Tory MPs had earlier voiced their concern that Mr Paddy  Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, had seized the initiative  in the forthcoming Euro-elections campaign by revealing that a  pledge to hold a referendum on closer European integration would  be included in his party's manifesto.    Mr Norman Lamont, the former Chancellor who has emerged as a  potential leader of the Conservative Euro-sceptics, called on Mr  Major to follow suit and agree to allowing the people, rather  than Parliament, the final say if there was any further  "significant" erosion of British sovereignty by Brussels.    He said a referendum was now inevitable as it was the only  way to resolve the argument over Europe. Otherwise Europe would  continue to split the Conservative Party.    "There are two wings of the Conservative Party which have  different views on this. This is contributing to John Major's  personal difficulties, and one way out of this is for him to put  this issue to the people as was done in 1975," said Mr Lamont.    There was also support for a referendum from the Left of the  party. Mr Peter Temple-Morris, Conservative MP for Leominster  and a supporter of Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board  of Trade, said: "We may well have to keep the option open of  having a referendum in connection with 1996 (date of the next EC  summit), either before the intergovernmental conference, on the  basis of what we go there with, or on the basis of what we come  back with."    But Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford and leader of the  Maastricht rebels, said that if there was to be a referendum it  should be as soon as possible after the European elections. The  question could be simply: "Do you want a federal Europe?"    At Westminster it was clear that many mainstream Tory MPs  believed that the promise of a referendum could help to paper  over the Tory Party's divisions on Europe in the run-up to the  June 9 elections.    But the difficulties faced by Mr Major were underlined when  the Positive European Group of Tory MPs voiced strong opposition  to any move by the Government to back a plebiscite. One member  of the group said: "It is a bad idea and would create disunity,  pitting part of the Conservative Party against the other in an  official campaign."    Lady Chalker, the Foreign Office Minister of State,  underlined the tensions in the party when, in the Lords, she  launched a strong attack on Euro-sceptics for seeking to  undermine the position of Mr Major.    "I really don't believe that the question of a referendum on  European matters arises now, and therefore it doesn't need any  decision now," she said.    But by last night it was clear that Mr Major was anxious not  to close off the referendum option. While a single currency  remained highly improbable and was not likely in any event  before the end of this century, "we are not saying never on a  referendum," said one senior aide.    Mr John MacGregor, the Transport Secretary, told a meeting  in  Norwich: "It would be economic madness to contemplate any  possibility that the UK could withdraw (from Europe), be  isolated or be marginalised. Any moves or suggestions that we  may wish to withdraw or isolate ourselves could have a  disastrous effect on our economic prospects and on jobs."    Mr Ashdown campaigning in Truro, said: "We are about to see  a re-run of the Tories' Maastricht muddle -- a struggling Prime  Minister held at clubpoint by a bunch of Euro-cavemen."</p>

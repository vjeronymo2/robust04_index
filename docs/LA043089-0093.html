			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEALTHY LEADER OF A SHIITE SECT INVESTS IN THIRD WORLD HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> One of the world's richest men is creating what may be the most ambitious  private program anywhere to correct the crippling inequities that deprive  people in developing countries from the basic benefits of housing, education,  health care and social advancement.  </P> <P> He is a 52-year-old, Harvard-educated British citizen residing in France,  Prince Karim Aga Khan, the 49th hereditary spiritual leader of the Ismaili sect  of Shiite Muslims, who number 15 million.  </P> <P> For 30 years the Aga Khan (the title means "great leader") has carefully  expanded the programs of social and economic development begun early in this  century by his grandfather, whom he succeeded as spiritual leader of the  Ismailis in 1957.  </P> <P> The list of social and economic development programs now include 300  educational institutions, 200 health-care centers, diagnostic clinics,  dispensaries, five general hospitals and scores of business enterprises  self-initiated by poor people in such countries as Pakistan, Kenya, Tanzania,  India and Bangladesh. All are funded primarily by Ismaili religious tithings  and are available to everyone.  </P> <P> Last month the Aga Khan came to Karachi, Pakistan's largest and most  slum-ridden city, to attend ceremonies at what is planned to become the  centerpiece of the Aga Khan Health Services stretching from Africa well into  the Asian heartland.  </P> <P> The event was the graduation of the first class of 42 physicians from the Aga  Khan University Medical College, a $300-million institution with an ultramodern  721-bed hospital that is by far the best in the nation.  </P> <P> Experts familiar with the problems of training and maintaining health personnel  in developing countries fear that here may be another example of sincere  intentions destined to falter and finally be ground into inferiority by the  same merciless forces that create inequity.  </P> <P> Countless programs funded by international agencies have so withered. But the  considerable educational, financial and political forces behind this movement  -- plus a community-based involvement that is the cornerstone of all Aga Khan  development enterprises -- raise its chances of succeeding.  </P> <P> There is also the significant impact of a religious sect that is both intense  and well directed. Ismailis have been called the "calm corner of Islam." In the  words of the Aga Khan: "It is important that the industrialized world not see  the Islamic world as being exclusively the somewhat strident voices which are  not representative of the majority."  </P> <P> Ismailis place a high value on education -- particularly of women, who have  long been subjugated in many Muslim countries. English and science are the  "global intellectual currencies," as the Aga Khan has said.  </P> <P> Pakistan does not need more doctors so much as a different kind of doctor. The  country paradoxically has more physicians than it can now employ -- not because  the need is lacking but because of economics and the failure of existing  government schools to prepare physicians and organize a delivery system that  meets public health needs.  </P> <P> Pakistan spends less than 1% of its gross national product on health. The  government system has no slots for public health nurses. Rural health centers  are either underutilized or overwhelmed with patients but seldom have active  programs to teach preventive health.  </P> <P> The Aga Khan's stated goal is not to replace the government health system but  to create programs as models that can be duplicated by other developing  countries as well as Pakistan, to meet the needs of all the people. The Medical  College, in a unique program, immerses students in the social and living  conditions of the masses of poor -- who are the bulk of Pakistan's 100-million  residents. From virtually the first day of class, each student is assigned to  spend 20% of his or her five school years among Karachi's poorest residents or  in backward villages designing and running health programs.  </P> <P> It is there, say faculty members, where future doctors will learn the causes --  mostly preventable -- of infant and maternal mortality, malnutrition and  infectious diseases that curb economic development and make life insufferable.  The official infant mortality rate is 126 deaths in the first year for every  1,000 live births -- more than 10 times the U.S. rate -- and in many areas of  the country the rate is far higher.  </P> <P> But the university is not satisfied trying to meet only primary needs. In what  some see as a threat to maintaining its community health program, the Medical  College has also decided to provide the specialized training required to  perform high-tech procedures typical of health care in developed nations.  </P> <P> While agreeing with that goal, the dilemma, said Dr. Jack Bryant, an American  who heads the department of community health services, "is that the largest  needs of Pakistan will be met mainly through community-based health services in  poor and remote settings, whereas the largest part of the training of the  students takes place in an elegant setting where technology is supreme."  </P> <P> A concern is that students -- as has occurred in the United States -- will be  lured away from working to meet critical community needs by higher earnings in  more sophisticated pursuits, and that such conflicting human drives will hamper  efforts to remedy health problems that afflict more than half the world's 5  billion people.  </P> <P> One hope lies in the network of educational and economic development programs  fostered by tithes and gifts from faithful Ismailis to the Aga Khan. A key  feature -- and one of the firm tenets of all community development -- is that  the incentive to raise living standards must spring from the poor in the slums  and rural villages, rather than from outside imposition. A grass-roots  philosophy pervades all of the Aga Khan programs.  </P> <P> Before any health program is begun in a city slum or a rural village, leaders  of that community are consulted and asked what they see as their most pressing  problems. Eventually they choose several residents to attend basic training  courses and become that community's own health workers. Once trained, these  workers are contacted frequently, to be consulted, resupplied with simple drugs  -- and with encouragement.  </P> <P> From these communities many future doctors, nurses and students are expected.  The theory is that such students are the most likely to return to the villages  to work.  </P> <P> Mumtaz Mughan, a 1988 graduate of the university nursing school, was born in  the Gilgit region of Northern Pakistan among the majestic snowcapped Karakoram  Mountains not far from China. Today she is the community-health nurse in  Singul, a village where Aga Khan Health Services has built a satellite health  center that serves perhaps 10,000 persons living in villages strung along the  Gilgit River Valley.  </P> <P> "I could make more money if I stayed in Karachi, but I came back because I  wanted to help," she said. Her sentiment echoed many faculty members who  returned from greener pastures abroad to help build a better health system in  their native land. Most of the full-time faculty of 140 are Pakistani doctors  who have returned home after years of training and working in Britain, Canada  or the United States.  </P> <P> Dr. Halfdan Mahler, former director of the World Health Organization, captured  the spirit pervading the program with a Chinese adage he cited in an address to  new graduates:  </P> <P>  Go to the people.  </P> <P>  Live with the people.  </P> <P>  Learn from them.  </P> <P>  Start with what they know.  </P> <P>  Build on what they have.  </P> <P>  When the task is finished,  </P> <P> The people will say,  </P> <P>  "We did it ourselves."  </P></p>

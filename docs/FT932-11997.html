			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Middleton starts implementation next week THE LEADERS of the Lloyd's of London insurance market plan to implement their new business strategy urgently. They recognise that time may be running out. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said yesterday: 'This is not a consultative paper, it is a plan. We will obviously listen to people's reactions but we haven't got time. We must get on and make changes.' A visibly tired Mr Middleton added: 'We'll have the weekend off and we'll start implementation on Tuesday.' The urgency is appropriate. The plan, prepared at speed over the past three months, amounts to nothing less than a survival formula for a market which has suffered losses of more than Pounds 5bn in the past five years. Its central proposals - for modernising the market and modifying the principle of unlimited liability - develop the conclusions of the task force report, published less than 18 months ago. The task force was headed by Mr David Rowland, who was then an adviser to Lloyd's and is now its chairman. But the underlying tone is both more realistic and more radical than that of the earlier blueprint, reflecting the sharp decline in confidence among both Names - the individuals whose assets back the market - and businesses trading there in the wake of record losses in 1989 and 1990. The market's capital base has sunk by nearly Pounds 3bn - to about Pounds 8.5bn - in just two years. Whereas the task force report aimed for a capital base of between Pounds 13bn and Pounds 17bn by 1997, the new business plan is more modest, recognising that only a much lower level - of between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 12bn - is now possible. But even to maintain a Lloyd's of that size will require the most radical upheaval ever witnessed at the 306-year-old market. Costs are to be cut by a third and more than 2,000 jobs shed in the next two years as the market seeks to improve efficiency and profitability to attract corporate investors. The market and regulatory boards, set up last year to administer and regulate the market, will be more closely involved with the market's 200 syndicates and 100 agencies, which in practice will lose much of their independence. The syndicates and agencies will become more akin to franchises, whose standards of performance and service will be determined centrally by Lloyd's. Syndicates will be compelled to adapt to electronic trading. Businesses that are not viable, and professionals who prove to be incompetent, will be rooted out. Agents will be forced to supply better quality and give up-to-the-minute data about their performance to the Lloyd's corporation much more quickly. Mr Middleton said: 'We do not think it is appropriate any longer for individual businesses at Lloyd's to only look at their own individual interests - they are deploying our brand name.' Mr Rowland said: 'I do believe there should be a market of individual competing units but if it is left, red in tooth and claw, to do whatever it likes it can bring the whole market to the brink of destruction.' The plan recognises that the interplay of market forces has already caused some rationalisation. More than 150 syndicates and dozens of agencies have disappeared in the last three years. But it says the cost has been too high, adding: 'It can never again be left to market forces, which operate too late to prevent serious loss.' That statement carries revolutionary implications for a market which has been a bastion of laissez-faire economics. Some progress appears to have been made with a set of past problems. Lloyd's proposal to establish a new reinsurance company marks the first serious effort to address the burden of US asbestosis and pollution-related liability claims. The scheme - to compel syndicates to reinsure all policies underwritten before 1986 with the new company - is hugely ambitious, however, and technically and legally complex. The plan says: 'No one should underestimate the difficulties associated with this restructuring. The management challenge is very great and we will need to be far more effective at managing these changes than we have in the past.' The biggest weakness perceived in the plan is the lack of any concrete proposals for dealing with the litigation between Names and their agents which is dogging the market. More than two dozen groups of Names are seeking several billion pounds in compensation for their losses in more than two dozen actual and potential legal actions. Last November Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton opened the prospect of a negotiated settlement, funded largely by the errors and omissions insurers (which cover the cost of legal awards for negligence) of the agents involved in the actions. These efforts have so far been unsuccessful. Mr Rowland said, however, that Lloyd's centrally might even be prepared to contribute a 'modest sum' to allow a settlement, and negotiations could intensify over the next few weeks. Much will depend on their success. At best, in Mr Rowland's words, the continuing litigation will be 'very unattractive and not at all helpful'. At worst it could derail the whole process.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHORTCUTS AND SUGGESTIONS;  </P> <P> BUILDING THE BEST KEBABS FOR THE BACK-YARD CHEF  </P> <P> Build a better kebab and hungry barbecue fans will beat a path to your back  yard. Here are some guidelines to make you kebab champ of the neighborhood.  </P> <P>  -- Allow four servings per pound of boneless meat or fish; three servings per  pound of shrimp with shell or chicken with the bone. Plan on one cup of fruit  or vegetables per person.  </P> <P>  -- Cut meat for kebabs in even-size pieces. About 1-inch cubes are the best;  meat and vegetables get done at the same time.  </P> <P>  -- Kebabs cook more evenly if there's breathing space between pieces.  </P> <P>  -- Short of time? Look in the fresh meat case of the supermarket for  ready-to-cook kebabs.  </P> <P>  -- Add flavor with a marinade. Place the meat or seafood cubes in a plastic  bag in a shallow dish. Add your favorite marinade and close the bag. Chill two  to four hours for fish, seafood or chicken; six hours or overnight for beef,  pork or lamb. Reserve the marinade to brush over the kebabs as they cook.  </P> <P>  -- There's no need to precook these fruits and vegetables: apple wedges,  1-inch papaya pieces, orange slices, 1-inch fresh pineapple pieces, 1-inch  green or red pepper pieces, pea pods, frozen artichoke hearts and 1-inch jicama  pieces.  </P> <P>  -- Precook for 1 to 2 minutes: 1/2-inch slices of summer squash, broccoli or  cauliflower florets and baby scaloppine squash; 4 to 5 minutes: baby carrots,  1-inch pieces of green onion or leek; 6 to 8 minutes: 1-inch pieces of fresh  corn on the cob; 12 to 15 minutes: halved tiny new potatoes.  </P> <P>  -- Cherry tomatoes cook fast. Place them on the skewer for the last 2 minutes  of cooking.  </P> <P>  -- Grill kebabs on an uncovered grill over hot coals for 8 to 12 minutes. Turn  often.  </P></p>

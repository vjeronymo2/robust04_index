			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the Employer adopted the Plan in 1989, Feingold &amp; Feingold Insurance Agency, Inc. of Worcester, Massachusetts (Feingold) was appointed Plan Administrator. Included in Feingold's duties, among other things, was the responsibility to maintain books and records for the Plan, manage Plan assets, and recommend investment vehicles for Plan participants to invest the assets of their respective accounts. Feingold submitted the GICs as one of its five recommended investment vehicles for the Plan. The GICs were purchased from Executive Life by Feingold at the direction of the respective participants and were held in trust by its subsidiary, Feingold Investment Planning Trust, for the benefit of the participants in the Plan. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  GIC 1303, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an issue date of January 1, 1989, and a maturity date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 31, 1995, was to pay an annual interest yield of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.95 percent until maturity. GIC 1344, with an issue date of January 1, 1990, and a maturity date of December 31, 1996, was to pay an annual interest yield of 8.65 percent until maturity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Feingold is no longer Plan Administrator for the Plan, but its subsidiary continues to hold the GICs in trust for the Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As of March 31, 1991, GIC 1303 had a balance of $9,147.56, which was determined by adding its earnings of $1,165.42 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the original price of $9,227.31 and subtracting $1,245.17 in withdrawals. The GIC 1344 was determined, as of March 31, 1991, to have a balance of $3,759.12 which was determined by the same calculation of adding its earnings of $338.20 to the original price of $3,881.30 and subtracting the withdrawals of $460.38.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On April 11, 1991, the California Department of Insurance obtained a court order placing Executive Life under conservatorship and freezing, as of March 31, 1991, the value of the GICs and their interest payments. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  The following month, First Executive Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which wholly owns Executive Life, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GICs are governed by the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Part 4 of Title I of the Act. In this regard, the Department is not proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GICs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 13, 1993, the Superior Court of California approved a Rehabilitation Plan of the Department of Insurance of California and authorized the Insurance Commissioner for California and the successor of Executive Life, Aurora National Life Insurance Company (Aurora), a California corporation, to implement all the provisions of the Rehabilitation Plan. Included in the implementation was an offer of an option to every contract holder of Executive Life to continued coverage through Aurora, or opt out of the Rehabilitation Plan and receive a reduced return over a longer extended period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On or about February 11, 1994, Feingold, with its subsidiary holding the GICs in trust for the participants of the Plan, elected to continue the GICs with Aurora under the Rehabilitation Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Rehabilitation Plan the maturity dates of the GICs were extended to September 3, 1998, from their respective maturity dates of December 31, 1995, and December 31, 1996. Also, under the Rehabilitation Plan the interest rates for the GICs were reduced at various periods of time from a low of 2.68 percent to the high of 5.34 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the GICs are subject to an ongoing litigation concerning a determination of the priority of payment to creditors of Executive Life. The application represents that no payments to the holders of the GICs are anticipated until all possible appeals to the litigation are exhausted. The applicant represents that if the court determines that holders of the GICs are creditors of Executive Life and not insurance policy holders, the holders of the GICs will have little or no recovery. The applicant further represents that the GICs do not have the protection of the State Participating Guaranty Association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In order to avoid the continued risk to the participants and beneficiaries of the Plan with investments in the GICs, the Employer proposes to purchase the GICs from the Plan for cash in a one-time transaction with no expense to the Plan. The Employer intends to pay the Plan the greater of either the fair market value of the GICs on the date of the Sale, or an amount that is equal to the total funds expended by the Plan in acquiring the GICs, less withdrawals, plus the earnings the GICs would have received to the date of the Sale if Executive Life had not been placed under conservatorship. In addition the Employer will pay to the Plan any funds emanating from the GICs in excess of the Sale price and received by the Employer after the date of the Sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a written statement dated September 15, 1994, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., Incorporated (Kidder, Peabody) represented that it was retained by the Employer to make an independent determination on the date of the Sale that the exact amount of payment will be made to the Plan in accordance with the formula set forth by the Employer in its application for exemption. Also, Kidder, Peabody represented that the payment will not be less than the fair market value of the GICs on the date of the Sale. Both Kidder, Peabody and Merrill Lynch stated that there is no market for the GICs in written statements dated September 15, 1994, and July 28, 1994, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a statement dated October 20, 1994, Feingold represents that the Sale will enable the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries to avoid continued risk associated with holding the GICs; and the proposed Sale to the Employer is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because (a) the Plan will receive from the Employer in a one-time transaction cash in an amount that is the greater of either the fair market value of the GICs or an amount that is equal to the total amount paid by the Plan for the GICs, less any withdrawals during ownership of the GICs, plus earnings the GICs would have received to the date of the Sale if Executive Life had not been placed under conservatorship by the Superior Court of California, as well as, any funds from the GICs in excess of the Sale price received by the Employer subsequent to date of the Sale; (b) the transaction will enable the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries to avoid any risk associated with the continued holding of the GICs; (c) the Plan will not incur any losses or expenses from the proposed transaction; and (d) the fiduciaries of the Plan have determined that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mr. C.E.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Zaynetdinov and Sergey Sergiyenko report: "It </F> Turns Out That the Moscow Militia Has One Concern -- To Tail the  Mayor of Khimki"]    [Text] The assassination of State Duma Deputy Andrey  Ayzderdzis, which happened in the evening of 26 April this year  in the Moscow suburb of Khimki, is continuing to agitate the  public. A joint investigating group from the General  Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the  Federal Counterintelligence Service is working in the city. All  the available manpower and resources have been brought into  operation. Major General Vladimir Kolesnikov, chief of the  Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Criminal Investigation Main  Directorate, has practically "moved" his office to Khimki.    However, it seems that everything is already obvious to the  Khimki administration. That, at least, was the claim that was  laid on thick at a news conference that was held.    Notably, Khimki chief Yuriy Korablin stated that  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has put out a number of exclusively ordered  (that is, generously paid for, evidently) materials indirectly  accusing Yuriy Vadimovich and his assistants of involvement in  the assassination.    The versions published in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA are based on  documents obtained from state structures. The chief's unfounded  accusations against the editorial office are good reason for a  meeting in court. And not only for journalists.    As Korablin stated, the Regional Administration for  Organized  Crime [RAOC] under the Moscow Oblast Internal Affairs Main  Administration is directly related to the assassination!  Specifically, he means Major General Aleksandr Kartashov, who  heads the RAOC.    "We have been reliably informed that Mr. Kartashov is today  doing all he can to lead the investigation in another  direction.... Is this deliberate or unintentional? Either it  testifies to a low professional standard, or else it testifies  to a personal interest...."    If the head of the Khimki administration is to be belived,  the only thing the RAOC is doing is "shepherding" Korablin about  day and night. "Four vehicles and eight staffers are following  me around full time, which gives you a very unpleasant  sensation." The RAOC commented on this information as follows:  "One section is involved in external observation, and it only  has three clapped-out little Zhigulis."</p>

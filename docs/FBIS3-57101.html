All these apparatus posts were allocated  among Russia's Choice, Yabloko [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc],  the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], the Agrarian Party  of Russia [APR], the Democratic Party of Russia [DPR], the "New  Regional Policy" [NRP], the Communists, Zhirinovskiy's  followers, and the Women of Russia. The Women of Russia have  obtained the opportunity to chair the Committee for the Affairs  of Women, the Family, and Childhood. Yabloko occupies the  leading positions on two committees (but what committees!): The  Committee for International Affairs (V. Lukin) and the Committee  for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances (Mikhail Zadornov).  Aleksey Mikhaylov, who is deputy chairman of the Committee for  Economic Policy, is also from that bloc. Members of the NRP  association have become chairmen of three committees. The PRUA  and APR and the Communists chair two. Russia's Choice has  chairmen on four committees, including defense (Sergey  Yushenkov) and information policy and communications (Mikhail  Poltoranin). However, the makeup of their deputy chairmen --  that is to say, Communists and deputies from the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] and APR -- raise doubts about  the strength of Russia's Choice on those committees. The LDPR  has installed chairmen on five committees.    A proposal to vote for each committee individually did not  find support. However, the ritual of candidates presenting  themselves and their programs did begin. I think it is a great  pity that television is not broadcasting the sessions of  parliament now. The election of the State Duma apparatus  promised to be instructive as regards the candidates' character  and potential. Sergey Glazyev (chairman of the Committee for  Economic Policy, DPR) was single-minded and businesslike.  Mikhail Lemeshev (LDPR) was approved as chairman of the  Committee for the Environment in his absence. Vladimir Isakov  (APR), chairman of the Committee for Legislation and Judicial  and Legal Reform, proposed creating the "most sophisticated  system of legislation in the world" through computerization.  You will recall that not so long ago there was half-joking  discussion of whether the stress on the first syllable of  "nachat" ["to begin"] will become the norm. Lyubov Rozhkova  (NRP), chairman of the Committee for Education, Culture, and  Science, launched a new philological tendency: Quoting  Franklin, she twice referred confidently to him as Veniamin.  And, admittedly, Fedor Roosevelt and Misha Faraday might well  extend the bounds of Russian knowledge, might they not?    Eight potential committee chairmen spoke that day. The  pointless procedure was cut short by a deputy's address: "The  'party bosses' have already shared everything out, that's enough  time wasted, let's vote." And voting did take place,  demonstrating once again that every opportunity for independent  deputies to influence the work of the committees has been  removed.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Canadian budget will take only small steps: The Liberals' real new broom is unlikely to start sweeping until 1995 Canada's Liberal government has worked hard in its four months in office to prove that a new broom is sweeping through Ottawa. From promises for a speedy overhaul of the social-security system to prime minister Jean Chretien's modest sedan, the Liberals have tried to project a fresh, down-to-earth approach. The finance minister, Mr Paul Martin, is expected to try to build on that theme when he presents his first budget in the House of Commons this afternoon. Mr Martin's economic assumptions and deficit forecasts are expected to be more conservative than the perennially optimistic projections by his Progressive Conservative predecessors over the past nine years. The minister will undoubtedly point to a series of pre-budget 'town hall' meetings, held across the country over the past month, as proof that he has listened to the concerns of Canadians from all walks of life. But anyone hoping for an imaginative new plan to achieve the Liberals' twin goals of cutting the deficit and creating jobs is likely to be disappointed. Judging from hints dropped by Mr Martin and his officials, the main elements of today's budget will follow much the pattern set by the Tories. On the spending side, the minister is expected to extend restraint on civil-service wages and announce further defence cuts. Despite the Liberals' criticism of Tory tax increases and signs that Canadians' tolerance of their heavy tax burden is wearing thin, Mr Martin plans to squeeze more revenue from taxpayers. Among the possible casualties are the tax-free capital-gains exemption, currently set at CDollars 100,000 (Pounds 51,020), and a range of business expenses. Mr Martin has indicated that he will aim for a budget deficit of CDollars 39bn-CDollars 40bn for the year to March 31 1995. That is down from the CDollars 45bn estimate for the present fiscal year, but still far above the Liberals' election promise to cut the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, equal to about CDollars 22bn in 1994/95, by the end of their third year in office. While fewer tax breaks and the modest deficit cut will come as a disappointment to the business community, the word from Ottawa is that the main purpose of today's budget is to set the stage for bolder measures in 1995. The Liberals have promised to draw up proposals over the next 12 months to overhaul the social security system and to conclude a new agreement on transfers to the 10 provinces of responsibility for health, social welfare and education. With these two envelopes making up close to 80 per cent of total federal spending, no meaningful assault on the deficit is possible until the reforms are in place. Financial markets are expected to take today's budget in their stride. 'There's no reason for anyone to be surprised,' says Mr Ted Carmichael, senior economist at Burns Fry, a Toronto securities firm. Domestic and foreign investors are more unsettled for the time being by Ottawa's monetary policies. Uncertainty on this front has been heightened by three recent developments: the first rise in US short-term interest rates in five years, the appointment from February 1 of a new governor of the Bank of Canada, and Mr Martin's tendency to ruminate about interest rates in public. Mr Martin and the new bank governor, Mr Gordon Thiessen, have a strong incentive to keep Canadian interest rates falling. Canada is pulling out of recession far more slowly than the US. The economy is growing at an annual rate of only about 3 per cent, compared to more than 5 per cent in the US. The traditional gap between US and Canadian interest rates is already at its narrowest in more than a decade. The gap on three-month Treasury bills is only 33 basis points, compared to a peak of 600 points in early 1990. The spread on 30-year bonds is currently 80 basis points. The question in the minds of traders, investors and policy-makers is whether there is room for this gap to narrow still further, or even to disappear, without causing the Canadian dollar to nosedive. Inflation in Canada is expected to be no more than about 1 per cent this year, about half the rate in the US. Even so, Mr Martin sent the dollar into a spin this month when he suggested that the rise in US rates might bring Canadian rates below those south of the border. His comments were immediately followed by a rise in short-term rates to protect the currency. Bank of Nova Scotia economists noted in a recent commentary: 'The central bank may have little choice but to sanction higher rates and spreads if currency pressures continue.' Despite the impressive inflation performance, the markets have yet to take the measure of Mr Martin and Mr Thiessen. Although the new governor is reputed to be a dedicated inflation fighter, he has yet to establish the credibility of his predecessor, Mr John Crow. Similarly, Mr Martin and his counterparts in the provinces (whose combined deficits are even bigger than the federal government's) have not convinced the markets that their deficit-cutting actions will match their words. Until they do, economists predict that Canadian interest rates will reach US levels only at the expense of a further slide in the Canadian dollar.</p>

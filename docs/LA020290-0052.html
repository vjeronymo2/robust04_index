			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> MOST BASES ON HIT LIST LIE IN DEMOCRAT AREAS  </P> <P> When Defense Secretary Dick Cheney unveiled a new proposal this week for  closing 43 military facilities and cutting back scores of others, congressional  Democrats cried foul.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration was disproportionately targeting installations in  Democratic congressional districts, they said. They predicted that the  Administration would hold the hit list over the heads of congressional  Democrats like a club if they deviated substantially from President Bush's  defense budget.  </P> <P> Cheney dismissed the complaints. But a statistical analysis of the  Administration proposal shows that whether intentionally or not, the hit list  would hit Democratic districts far harder than Republican ones. Cheney himself  acknowledged that the list gives the President enormous leverage over  individual congressmen in the coming budget battle.  </P> <P> Of the 21 bases on Cheney's list that are large enough to have major economic  impact on their locales, 19 are in Democratic congressional districts. That  prompted Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) to call the list an "unacceptable"  and "partisan" document in which "Democratic districts are hit and Republican  districts get off scot-free."  </P> <P> Cheney insists his plan reflects purely military judgments.  </P> <P> "I didn't come down and say, 'Hit Democrats or hit liberal Democrats and not  conservative Democrats,' " Cheney told reporters. "If you look at the list,  you'll find that it is in fact the best judgment of the (military) services of  what (their) requirements are."  </P> <P> At the same time, he has conceded the political power of his base-closing list.  </P> <P> "I think it's a real test for Congress," he said. "We've got a lot of people up  there who want to cut the defense budget, and here's a very simple way to do  it. Either they will remove roadblocks to essential readjustment . . . of our  base structure, or they aren't really serious about cutting the defense  budget."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Trap in Wait?  </P> <P> Prominent Democrats recognize the trap that lies in wait.  </P> <P> "The way they handled it certainly has every appearance of political motives,"  said John C. White, former Democratic national chairman. "It says, 'Look guys,  you're going to have to deal with us this year.' First it comes out of the  blue, it's laid on the table and then the defense secretary says there's no  final decision yet. It looks like a trial balloon, that it may be negotiable"  if a lawmaker has something to offer in return.  </P> <P> No one in the Administration will acknowledge a political motive. A member of a  commission that successfully recommended 86 defense facilities for closure in  1986 said there is no way to prove one.  </P> <P> "When we finished our recommendations, we sat back . . . and talked about how  you prove politics," one commission member said. "We decided you can't do it.  You just can't do it."  </P> <P> That bipartisan commission prepared a list -- by coincidence, according to  members -- that struck Democratic and Republican districts roughly evenly. That  prompted House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) to call it  "fair and reasonable," and it set the stage for relatively easy approval.  </P> <P> Several lawmakers, including Aspin and Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento),  want to establish another bipartisan commission to review the Cheney list.  Matsui's Sacramento district would lose an Army depot in Cheney's proposed  closures.  </P> <P> But for whatever reasons, the effect of Cheney's proposals is decidedly  lopsided. Information released by the Army, Navy and Air Force this week  reveals that the vast majority of personnel to be affected by the cuts are in  Democratic congressional areas.  </P> <P> Slated for Relocation  </P> <P> Apart from National Guard and reserve personnel, about 95,600 military  personnel are slated to be moved if their bases are eliminated, reduced in  scope or "realigned." Of those, more than 87,000 -- fully 91% of the total --  are within Democratic areas.  </P> <P> Of the approximately 60,000 civilian employees on the targeted bases, 93%, or  more than 56,000, work in Democratic districts. Many of these civilian workers  are not guaranteed alternate employment when their military units are disbanded  or moved, military spokesmen said.  </P> <P> Republican-located installations appear to be getting better treatment than  equivalent facilities in Democratic areas.  </P> <P> Of seven Army ammunition plants facing closure by 1994, for example, only two  are being offered the chance to compete with each other for metal-parts  contracts in a bid to survive. Located in Minden, La., and Scranton, Pa., both  are in Republican congressional districts.  </P> <P> Case closed? Not so fast, some experts say.  </P> <P> Nearly 60% of House districts are represented by Democrats, and many of the  nation's big military bases are located in traditional Democratic areas of the  South and West. According to the House Armed Services Committee, 19 of the  nation's 24 largest bases -- which cumulatively account for almost 40% of the  servicemen and women stationed in the United States -- are located in  Democratic districts.  </P> <P> "Congress is controlled by Democrats, the committees that deal with defense are  controlled by Democrats, so they'll have the preponderance of the bases," said  Lawrence J. Korb, a Pentagon official in the Ronald Reagan Administration who  oversaw defense installations. "They get on those committees because they have  or want a facility in their district, and they stay on to protect them."  </P> <P> Moreover, although Democratic congressional districts would be hit hard by  Cheney's list, many of the targeted bases are located in states with prominent  Republican senators. Among them is Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), whose  gubernatorial bid could be hurt by the proposed closure of 11 installations --  bases and smaller facilities -- in the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gramm Affected  </P> <P> Other prominent Republicans affected would be Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, whose  state accounts for seven of the proposed closures, and Sen. John Heinz of  Pennsylvania, whose state would suffer four closures. Gramm, a powerful ally of  the Bush Administration, faces a reelection bid this year.  </P> <P> Finally, one analyst said, the base-closing issue could prove to be a political  liability for Bush.  </P> <P> The closings "will be an issue in 1990, but they're going to be realities in  1992" when Bush is up for reelection, said longtime GOP analyst Kevin Phillips.  "In those key electoral states, if I were Bush, I don't know that I would  really want very much to win" on proposals to close bases.  </P> <P> Staff writers John M. Broder and David Lauter contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 11 CALIFORNIA BASES SLATED FOR CLOSURE  </P> <P> Of the 21 full-fledged military bases that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney  proposed to close, 11 are in California. Nineteen are located in the districts  of Democratic congressmen.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.32IN:2.55IN:3.10IN:2.11IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Military  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Civilian  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Base  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Home city  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Congressman  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Employees  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Employees  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Naval Aviation Depot  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Alameda  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> D-Fortney H.

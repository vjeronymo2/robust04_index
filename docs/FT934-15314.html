			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (11): The velocipede started it - Karlsruhe scientists have a long tradition of co-operation with industry KARLSRUHE'S reputation as a technology centre dates back to 1815 when one Baron Karl Friedrich Freiherr von Drais invented the velocipede, the forerunner of the bicycle. It spoils the story only slightly to know that the baron subsequently moved to Mannheim - it was there, rather than in Karlsruhe, that he patented his invention and began industrial production. Other 19th century inventors include the machine-builder Emil Kessler who started making locomotives in Karlsruhe in 1842, and Heinrich Hertz who discovered magnetic waves in the town in 1888. Coupled with the foundation of the Polytechnical School in 1825 - the forerunner of the Technical University and today's Fridericiana University - this points to a long tradition of co-operation between Karlsruhe scientists and industry. This tradition is alive today in a city which boasts where 10,000 scientists work - more per head of the population than any other part of Germany. There are three Fraunhofer institutes which specialise in the scientific research which has a practical industrial application. The Fridericiana University has close links with industry - especially via the Computer Sciences Research Centre, which works with companies such as IBM and Nixdorf in developing information technology. There is also the Technology Factory, an institution founded in the early 1980s at the initiative of Mr Lothar Spath, the then president of the state of Baden-Wurttemberg. He came back from visit to Silicon Valley in California inspired by the idea to set up a co-called 'innovation centre' which would promote technology-oriented start-ups and help replace jobs lost in more traditional manufacturing industry. Housed in a former sewing-machine factory, the Technologie Fabrik is now the largest institution of its kind in Germany. Founded with the help of DM14m in state funds, the Technologie Fabrik now houses 40 firms and six institutes, which collectively employ between 600 and 800. Entrepreneurs present their business plan to the Factory's administrators. If the plan is accepted, the fledgling company can stay for a maximum of five years, starting on a peppercorn rent which increases over the course of the tenancy. The Factory's administration provides secretarial and other support services to the tenants, and advice on how to raise finance. Since the centre was founded, a handful of tenants have gone bankrupt, but the survivors far out-number the normal 70 per cent success rate for start-ups in Germany. In total, 1,400 jobs have been created since the factory was founded: an appreciable contribution to Karlsruhe's workforce of 180,000. The biggest existing tenant is a company called INIT, which has 70 employees specialising in communications equipment for the transport sector. Of the 30 tenants which have moved out, the most successful is probably Pipetronix, a company which devised electronic equipment for identifying faults within pipelines. The company now employs 250 people and was sold in February 1992 to Preussag, the Hanover-based conglomerate. Pipetronix also benefited from co-operation with the Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe. Literally translated, this is the Nuclear Research Centre, but it does not limit itself to nuclear research: it has developed expertise in environmental technology, information technology, microsystems technology and cellular and molecular biology. Dr Jurgen Wust, head of the centre's Technology Transfer Co-ordination Office, explains that the centre plays an active role in seeking industrial applications which emerge from these research areas. 'We market ourselves aggressively,' Dr Wust says, 'concentrating on licensing and patenting what we discover here.' One such patent was the sensor which is at the core of Pipetronix's pipeline equipment. The centre has 320 licensing arrangements and is working on 70 formal projects in co-operation with industry; since it was founded in 1956 it has worked with 5,000 different industrial companies. Karlsruhe is confident that its historical connection with technology will guarantee its future. As a measure of its confidence in the future, the city will start to build a 30 hectare technology park early next year and the technology factory is set to be enlarged by a further 8000m squared.</p>

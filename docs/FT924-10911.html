			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (7): Charge of the lightweight brigade - Aluminium is increasingly replacing steel in cars A CHEER went up from the aluminium industry when it became clear that Mr Ferdinand Piech will next January take over as chief executive of Volkswagen of Germany, the world's fourth-largest automotive group. An innovative engineer, Mr Piech is boss of VW's Audi subsidiary and for the past 10 years has enthusiastically driven that organisation towards using much more aluminium in its up-market cars. Next year Audi will launch an 'aluminium intensive' car based on a revolutionary spaceframe concept - skeleton-like car bodies made from aluminium - and using aluminium sheet components for the floor pan and body panels. This vehicle was jointly developed with the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) which has set up a Dollars 70m plant in Soest, Germany, to make the spaceframe components which it expects to sell to other car makers too. Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of Alcoa, says: 'Mr Piech - a far sighted leader who has been supporting the aluminium intensive vehicle project for a decade  -is now to become chairman of the whole of Volkswagen and this must be good for the innovative use of aluminium as a material in autos.' Alcoa is not alone in the spaceframe business. Reynolds Metals' technology was used for the Ford Contour, a one-off 'concept' sports car. Ford, the world's second-largest automotive group, says it is evaluating an aluminium spaceframe for possible introduction in a 1997 or 1998 car. The group also predicts that the average aluminium content of its US cars (at present about 176 lbs or 79.8 kgs) will increase to 500lbs (227 kgs) by the year 2005. The spaceframe concept is also well-known to General Motors, biggest group of its kind in the world. GM is to build a car based on an aluminium spaceframe at an annual rate of 10,000 a year from 1993. Called the Impact, it is an electric car developed to meet California's requirements for some totally pollution free cars . Among the world's other top six car companies, Toyota, Nissan and Honda of Japan are already deeply committed to using more aluminium. Honda's NSX sports car, launched in September 1990, is the most aluminium intensive car on the road today and contains 1,000 lbs of the metal. The most gung-ho forecasts about the use of aluminium in cars come from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). It predicts that demand for aluminium from Japan's car makers will reach 1.87m tonnes by 1995, more than double the 1989 level. This confident forecast springs from the knowledge that Japanese manufacturers have decided that only substantial use of the lightweight metal will enable them to meet increasingly stringent fuel economy and pollution regulations in the US, their most important market, without reducing the size of their vehicles to unacceptable proportions. Similar predictions are being made about European cars which are now about 5 per cent aluminium by weight. It is widely suggested this will go up to 20 per cent by the year 2000. Mr Jochen Schirner, chairman of VAW, Germany's largest aluminium company, says that, even if the increase is only to 10 per cent of the average car, it would mean each new vehicle carrying about 100kg of aluminium and boost demand for the metal in Europe by about 1.5m tonnes a year. This represents a jump of nearly one third on the present 4.6m tonnes. US car companies used an average of 176lbs (79.8kg) of aluminium in each vehicle last year and some analysts are more bullish than Ford and predict this will rise to 600lbs (272kg) by the year 2000. If there is some increase in car production over that time, an extra 6m tonnes of aluminium might be required. Put those figures in the context of total aluminium (including scrap) usage last year of not quite 20m tonnes and it is easy to see why Mr David Morton, chairman of Alcan of Canada, says the aluminium industry can expect an 'avalanche' of new business from the automotive industry. Apart from weight saving considerations, the switch by car makers to aluminium is also being heavily influenced by environmental pressures and the car makers' perception that one day they all might be forced to produce recyclable cars. Mr Yale Brandt, vice chairman of Reynolds Metals and who is responsible for that company's relationships with the automotive groups, points out that this is where aluminium's role as an 'energy bank' is so important. 'If you put 5 cents worth of electricity into aluminium, you get more than 4 1/2 cents back when the aluminium comes back as scrap.' VAW's Mr Schirner says: 'Cars in the future will be dismantled into their components within minutes. Aluminium is a high-value material that cries out for several life cycles.' Much of the increase in the use of aluminium in cars so far has come from substituting the light metal for other materials. But aluminium is about four times the price of steel - the traditional material used in cars - so not everybody in the motor industry is enthusiastic about using vast quantities even though it is only half the weight. The aluminium industry's response was to find a way of designing a car from a clean sheet so as compensate for the extra cost of the material. It believes it has achieved this with the spaceframe concept. Alcoa says, for example, it has cut the number of components required by about half from the number needed for a conventional steel car body structure. This reduces capital, tooling, labour, stock and other costs yet produces a car 30 to 40 per cent lighter than a structure of equal stiffness made of steel. Hydro Aluminium of Norway is, like Alcoa, using extrusions for the spaceframes it has developed. (Alcan, on the other hand, has chosen to build its spaceframe of sheet aluminium.) Hydro has developed aluminium spaceframes for Pininfarina, Porsche and Tresser and is setting up a production unit to make them in Michigan, US. Although it will not name its US customer, the project dovetails neatly with GM's launch of the Impact electric vehicle. Mr Ivar Hafsett, Hydro's president, suggests the aluminium industry still has a great deal of work ahead before it can achieve the final breakthrough  -the use of the technology in mass-produced cars. At present aluminium spaceframes are suitable only for relatively small-volume models, produced at an annual rate of no more than 100,000. Much will depend on another project in which Hydro is involved - the F360m Mosaic venture with Renault. This is part of the Eureka programme in which European car producers and their suppliers have joined together to do some basic research. Mosaic has a target of using new materials and methods to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in the weight and a 9 per cent reduction in cost of a car's body-in-white plus a 9 per cent reduction in total investment cost. Mid-way through the programme, which should be completed at the end of 1993, there is stiff competition between two versions: an all-steel car which is assembled with adhesives and a hybrid solution which involves Hydro's aluminium spaceframe and plastic panels. This is a true mass production vehicle rather than a limited volume specialised car. As Mr Hafsett suggests: 'Our decade will see a lot of spaceframe-based experimental cars and cars made in small volumes. The ultimate breakthrough to mass-produced cars will have to wait until the next century.' However, Mr Brandt at Reynolds adds a cautionary note. 'Ultimately, the move to more aluminium in cars does not depend entirely on what the automotive industry or the aluminium industry wants - but on what society wants.'</p>

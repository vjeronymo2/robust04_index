			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Russia in deep crisis as output plunges by 25%: Capital investment down 28% - Tax revenues hit / Debts spiralling A deep deterioration in the Russian economy over the past six months, with steep falls in production, investment and tax revenues, risks creating a 'social explosion', the Ministry of the Economy has warned the government. In the past few days the ministry has released a string of data for the first quarter of the year, which suggest the economy is in the midst of a deep crisis. A 25 per cent fall in industrial production in the first three months of this year compared with 1993 is threatening hundreds of thousands of workers who are being laid off with little or no pay. The prestigious Zil industrial complex in Moscow, which employs 85,000 workers making white goods and trucks, has put thousands on extended holiday and plans to halve truck production to 50,000 this year. Mr Yevgeny Brakov, the Zil general director, said the company was in a 'very difficult position'. According to the official Russian Information Agency account of the data, the ministry warned that a drop in output of consumer goods 'threatens the economic independence of the country and brings the danger of a social explosion'. The warning of the looming crisis was rammed home on Friday by Mr Oleg Soskoevets, first deputy prime minister in day to day charge of the economy. He told the official Tass news agency: 'Russia is living through the toughest phase of its transition.' Moscow is facing a critical choice. It could increase credits to help out the ailing state sector, but that would compromise its fight against inflation, which has come down to between 8 and 9 per cent a month from a high last year of nearly 30 per cent. That reduction has been crucial in gaining access to International Monetary Fund finance. However, Russian economists warn that if it retains its tight monetary stance, it could within months trigger a rise in unemployment to between 10m and 15m which would threaten Russia's fragile social stability. In an effort to alert his compatriots to the looming economic threat, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, wrote in the weekly magazine 'Rossiya' that it was 'vitally necessary' to stop unwanted production - citing tanks as one such sector. The indicators of Russia's deepening crisis include: The 25 per cent fall in industrial production in the first quarter of the year appears to be accelerating, according to preliminary figures for April. Production of sugar, shoes, fabric and clothes has fallen by between one third and one half. Car, bus and truck production is relatively better, standing at 85 per cent of last year's level. However, at some leading car plants such as the the AZLK (Moskvich) factory in Moscow output is down by between one and two thirds because municipal authorities have no money to renew their fleets. Investment in capital projects, including state investment in infrastructure, in the first quarter shrunk to Rbs12 trillion (about Pounds 4.7bn) 28 per cent down on 1993. The economics ministry report says work on most state and regional authorities' investment projects has stopped. Foreign investment remains 'weak', with only Dollars 180m being invested in the entire Russian economy in the first quarter. Tax revenues are falling fast. Government figures show tax collection short by Rbs3.4 trillion - or 15 per cent below budget - in the first quarter. Regional authorites are increasingly reluctant to pass collected taxes on to the central government, according to officials in Moscow. Debts held by enterprises are spiralling as customers, other enterprises further up the supply production chain, become increasingly unable to pay for supplies. Many plants will refuse orders unless they are paid upfront in cash. The economics ministry's figures show overall corporate debt has risen threefold in the last six months, to stand at at about Rbs69 trillion. Public support for continued reform is collapsing, according to a poll last week by the Russian Academy of Sciences. It found support among Russians for reforms has shrunk from above 40 per cent five years ago to less than 25 per cent at the end of last year. The majority of those polled agreed that 'privatisation is legalised theft' and between one-third and two-thirds of respondents believed that privatisation was 'undertaken for the benefit of the nomenclatura and criminals'. Enterprises in the coal and oil region of Vorkuta in the north have petitioned for the area to be designated one of 'special poverty', and strikes are threatened for next month over wages unpaid since January.

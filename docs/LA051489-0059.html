			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEEKING SOLITUDE IN THE MONASTERIES OF MT. ATHOS  </P> <P> Monasteries, regardless of religion, appeal to that side of my personality that  is contemplative, bookish and escapist. I arrange for a room, choose worthy  paperback roommates, load a camera and journey toward the silence.  </P> <P> I remember past monasteries: a rainy night's climb to the Buddhist monastery on  Adam's Peak on Sri Lanka; the dusty ride to St. Catherine's in the Sinai, the  shattering of thin ice to wash my morning face at the Japanese monastery on Mt.  Koya, Honshu Island.  </P> <P> The years passed and I found myself in Thessaloniki, shortened to Salonika,  applying for permission from the Ministry of Northern Greece to go to Mt. Athos  on the Chalcidice Peninsula below the plains of Macedonia.  </P> <P> Chalcidice, on a map, is like a turtle inching southeast toward Turkey. Mt.  Athos is the northeastern arm of the turtle, a peninsula 30 miles long by 10  miles wide, ending in the 6,600-foot Holy Mountain itself.  </P> <P> From the peak of this mountain, one can gaze north over a landscape distinct in  today's world: a hilly, forested peninsula dotted with ancient, fortresslike  monasteries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Donkey Trains  </P> <P> The unpaved roads of its interior are walked by men in black leading donkey  trains that wind slowly past chapels containing icons from the 10th Century. No  cars, no electricity, no telephone poles.  </P> <P> On the western coast, over a pebble beach fronting a blue-green sea, stands the  monastery of Xenophontos, founded in AD 520.  </P> <P> The promontory is physically part of the Greek mainland, but by custom and law  it is quite removed. It's an autonomous monastic state consisting of 20 large  monasteries and hundreds of chapels and hermitages. Many caves remain for the  ascetic who wants to remove himself from temptation.  </P> <P> You climb the rope ladder, pull it up after yourself and drop a basket down  once a day for bread and water. For visitors less ascetically inclined, it is  possible to spend a night or more at one of the monasteries. But the  possibility is limited to men.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sacred to Greeks  </P> <P> This has long been sacred soil to the Greeks, even before Christianity. Ruins  of a temple to Poseidon were found at the base of Mt. Athos, the highest point  in Chalcidice Province.  </P> <P> The monks who live and work around Mt. Athos are the sole monastic branch of  the Greek Orthodox Church. These are monasteries of the earliest traditions --  prayer and self-sufficiency, and were not intended for proselytizing. The monks  grow what they eat, have no private property and are under supervision of an  elected abbot.  </P> <P> There are restrictions for visitors: no women or small children, no short  pants, no musical instruments, no pets or movie cameras.  </P> <P> Buses leave daily from Salonika to Ouranopolis, the town bordering the monastic  territory.  </P> <P> Heaven City, as Ouranopolis translates, is aptly named. Women must wait for  their men to come back, which makes it look like heaven to the pilgrim  returning from a stay in a land for males only.  </P> <P> The ferries run daily from Ouranopolis to Daphne, the port of Athos. At Daphne,  dock permits are inspected. The monks standing on the wharf cast trained eyes  on each person who disembarks, in case a woman dressed in man's clothing should  be hidden among the passengers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spectacular Views  </P> <P> The one partially paved road and bus line goes from Daphne to Karyes, the  capital of Athos, over a mountain range that provides the first of many  spectacular views.  </P> <P> On the western side are monasteries built on stilt foundations and precariously  overlooking the sea; on the eastern side is Karyes itself, along with the  Prototos Church, a basilica from the 13th Century; Koutloumousiou Monastery,  and surrounding vegetable gardens, fruit orchards and vineyards.  </P> <P> Along the roadside lie tangled blackberry bushes and ivy, obscuring approaches  to the forests of poplar, pine and chestnut. Bells ring for services and  black-robed monks slowly converge.  </P> <P> There are grocers, vegetable dealers, cooks, peddlers, street cleaners -- all  of them monks. You'll see beards of all kinds: black, brown, gray, blond and  snow-white; some pointed, some spread out like bell-shaped brooms, others  thick, curly, impenetrable.  </P> <P> In Karyes, each visitor is taken to the office of Holy Supervision to purchase  a card called a diamonitirion for 800 drachmas, about $5 U.S., which entitles  one a visit to any of the monasteries plus room and board. It's not haute  cuisine, but it's filling fare.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cobblestone Roads  </P> <P> All roads from Karyes, other than the one to Daphne, are cobblestone or dirt,  and they often narrow down to trails. You can walk or rent a mule for the  inland monasteries or hire a small launch for the coastal ones. The monasteries  are situated so that to get from one to the next is never more than a day's  hike, and often under two or three hours.  </P> <P> Koutloumousiou is a 20-minute walk from Karyes. An ecclesiastical mansion  covered by ivy and grapevines gone wild, it appears to be succumbing to the  lush vegetation around it. Koutloumousiou was founded in the 13th Century, and  counts among its treasures the left leg of St. Anna and the left hand of St.  Gregory Theologos. Originally designed for 100 monks, it now houses 10.  </P> <P> Only a few rooms on the upper two floors are in use; the rest are shuttered.  Within the outer walls is a small chapel with gold and silver icons,  ivory-inlaid prayer stools and an intricate, hand-carved wooden altar.  </P> <P> On request, a monk opened the chapel's heavy door with a huge key hanging from  his waist. The chapel is like a precious egg in a nest half-decayed, guarded by  aged eagles. The monk demanded that our group stay close together and asked  that I remove my hand from my pocket.  </P> <P> While others listened to his tour, I wondered what was wrong with my pocket.  Was it something Freudian or merely the fact that these relics were literally  worth millions of dollars and there wasn't a cop within miles?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disappearing Cat  </P> <P> Outside, in the courtyard, a cat -- fat and talkative -- rubbed gently against  my ankle. I was bending over, stroking its back, when I heard a board creak. A  frowning monk approached, wagging his finger at me. The cat disappeared into  the shadows and I listened to a short lecture in modern Greek, which I couldn't  understand.  </P> <P> My four days were planned in a circle from Karyes, staying at three  monasteries. After a night at Koutloumousiou, I walked to the Pantokratoros  Monastery in the company of a Greek from Trieste and a German man with his two  sons.  </P> <P> When the monastery first came into view, it looked like a Gothic fortress. On a  wooden porch built out over the massive front entrance sat two monks. One of  them rose and came to greet us. His gray hair was tied in a bun behind, and the  beard fell below his chin. He showed us to our rooms and told us when and where  we would eat.  </P> <P> It was as simple as that. There is no visitor's timetable of events, tours or  sermons.  </P> <P> The room I shared was in a large tower with a narrow archer's window that  looked over a cliff down to the waves pounding on rounded boulders. It was  clean and comfortable, and the view, illuminated by a full moon, was  spectacular.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Saints' Calendar  </P> <P> For dinner we were taken to a small dining room at a corner of the tower, with  views on two sides of the beach and cliffs. The long, wooden table was set for  the 10 visitors, and a strong breeze from an opened window rustled the pages of  a saints' calendar.  </P> <P> One of the few young monks I saw brought our food. We had lentil soup, tomato  salad, plates of small salty fish and home-baked bread washed down with fresh  water.  </P> <P> The next morning we hiked to Vatopedi Monastery, where as recently as a hundred  years ago 300 monks lived. Twenty-five remain today. Vatopedi is on the side of  a hill where a valley opens to the sea and overlooks a harbor.  </P> <P> Grapes grow in profusion, the ground sometimes smelling like a winery. In AD  862, invaders burned the original monastery, killed the monks and took their  treasures; the rebuilt monastery looks like a fortified medieval town.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finger of a Saint  </P> <P> In the 19th Century, Robert Curzon, a British traveler, visited Vatopedi and  was shown relics of St. John the Baptist. I didn't see St. John, but a monk did  show me the reliquary, laying several relics on one side of the chapel's altar:  the finger of one saint, the skull of St. Andrew encased in a gold and silver  helmet with a hatch on top to view the bone, the belt of the Virgin Mary and a  piece of the Cross.  </P> <P> Vatopedi takes several days to explore. Twenty minutes up the coast, I found a  secluded sand beach where I could meditate, feet submerged in the cooling  waters of the Aegean Sea.  </P> <P> I found myself spending less time in the dark halls of monasteries and more in  surrounding gardens, observing scenes out of the Middle Ages: black-robed men  hoeing the earth between lines of green beans and tomatoes, with the high  crenelated walls towering behind, an arched stone aqueduct ending abruptly  nowhere, the ruins of a Russian church open to the wind and two storks standing  tall over a nest on a chapel roof at sunset.  </P> <P> And everywhere the sound and smell of the Aegean Sea.  </P> <P> To visit Mt. Athos, you must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, Directorate of Churches, 3 Academias St., Athens, or at the Ministry  of Northern Greece, Directorate of Civil Affairs, Platia Diikitiriou,  Thessaloniki.  </P> <P> A letter of recommendation from an American consulate is necessary for the  permit. The permit is exchanged at Karyes on Mt. Athos for a diamonitirion  permit at a cost of 800 drachmas for a stay of up to four days. Included are  room and board at the monastery.  </P> <P> A first-class hotel in Thessaloniki is the Macedonian Palace, which charges  $110 U.S. for a double. In Ouranopolis, recommended hotels are the Eagles  Palace Hotel and Bungalows (April through October, about $70 double, including  two meals) and the Xenia Hotel (May through September, about $40 double,  including two meals).  </P> <P> KLM flies direct from Los Angeles to Athens. The APEX fare, with 14-day minimum  stay, is $1,087 starting in June. Olympic Airways flies from Athens to  Salonika. Cost is $86 round trip. The round trip by train is about $30, but the  pace is slow.  </P> <P> In Athens, the Greek National Tourist Organization office is at 2 Amerikis St.  and at 34 Mitropoleos St., Salonika.  </P> <P> For more information, contact the Greek National Tourist Organization at 611 W.  6th St., Suite 1998, Los Angeles 90017, or call (213) 626-6696.  </P></p>

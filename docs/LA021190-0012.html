			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: TIP - OFF;  </P> <P> THE BEST TABLES IN TOWN  </P> <P> ALL OUR TABLES are "good" tables, promise those who take restaurant  reservations. But don't believe it. At Spago, for instance, the rich and famous  knowingly scramble for the front-window seats.  </P> <P> At Citrus, the coveted tables are the ones near the glass doors at the  entrance.  </P> <P> For those of us who have more ambition than fame, we begged maitre d's from  such hot L.A. restaurants as The Bistro, Citrus, MaBe and Spago to share their  secrets for getting a good table.  </P> <P> Their tips:  </P> <P> Dine on a Tuesday or Wednesday instead of a busy weekend evening.  </P> <P> Make reservations and arrive on time. If you want a particular table or  location, ask for it when making the reservation, not after arriving.  </P> <P> Be a repeat customer.  </P> <P> Never offer the maitre d' money for a table. They all said that. Honest. JUDITH  SIMS  </P></p>

Co-Defence Minister Tea Chamrat said government troops  captured the Khmer Rouge base at Anse, which straddles the Thai  border in remote Preah Vihear province, Thursday. There were no  immediate casualty figures.    Its capture comes after the government said it had full  control over the radical faction's base at Anlong Veng some 80  kilometers (50 miles) to the west which it seized earlier this  month.    Anlong Veng was the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for guerrilla  operations in north and central Cambodia.    Tea Chamrat said the Khmer Rouge had now pulled back east to  Krapeang Kul, an isolated area where the Cambodian, Lao and Thai  borders meet.    The Khmer Rouge had been bringing rocket launchers and  artillery pieces forward from Anse to pound government positions  in Choam Khsan, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of the  border.    Government officers said the Khmer Rouge were attacking  Choam  Khsan as a diversionary tactic to draw Cambodia's troops away  from Anlong Veng.    Western aid officials said that some 3,000 villagers had  fled  to the Preah Vihear provincial capital, Tbeng Meanchey, to  escape guerrilla artillery and rocket attacks.    But provincial Governor Mean Sarin said the villagers should  now be able to return home.    "I am very optimistic that after capturing Anse all the  displaced villagers can come back from Theng Meanchey to Choam  Khsan and they will have no more fears," he said.    The guerrillas captured Anse last August in an attack which  United Nations peacekeepers said was partially launched from  Thai territory. UN personnel, stationed at the border at the  time, were detained by guerrillas during the attack but were  later released unharmed.    Mean Sarin said that government troops would now try to  recapture the nearby historic hill-top temples of Preah Vihear.    The guerrillas seized the temples in a pre-dawn raid July 7  which government and military officials said was also launched  from Thai territory.    "We have the ability and the means to capture the very  famous  temple back from the Khmer Rouge," he said.    Tea Chamrat said he did not know if the recent government  victories would force the guerrilla faction to the negotiating  table.    "We cannot guess whether they will come and talk. But if  they  don't want to talk, we can only stop them from disturbing us,"  he said.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Berkshire housing targets attacked A decision by Berkshire County Council to bow to government pressure and establish a target of 2,667 new homes a year has angered developers and environmentalists. The outcome is seen as an important indication of how the government intends to respond to developments in politically sensitive counties. The council's environment committee, which had proposed a lower figure, decided by a single vote to accept a recommendation from Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, which would require the county to accept the development of 40,000 homes between 1991 and 2006. This is one-sixth less than the 48,000 homes recommended by independent inspectors after a public inquiry. The Housebuilders Federation, which had proposed a target of 54,000 homes, said yesterday it was very disappointed that inspectors appointed by the environment department had been ignored. The Council for the Protection of Rural England said yesterday that it 'was disappointed that the local authority and government had not sent a stronger signal that the environment matters in Berkshire'. The decision to curb the supply of development sites in one of the country's most sought-after housing markets comes as the government has been struggling to retain the support of its traditional voters in southern England. Mr David Coates, national planning officer for the the Housebuilders Federation, said it would ask Mr Gummer to reconsider the county's plan. This was accepted by the council's environment committee after Conservative and Labour councillors joined forces to defeat Liberal Democrats who want the lower figure to be maintained.</p>

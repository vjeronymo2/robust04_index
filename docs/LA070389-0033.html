			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DETOUR AHEAD;  </P> <P> PIECEMEAL STREET WIDENING FORCES DRIVERS TO JOG AROUND JUTOUTS  </P> <P> It's hard to miss Roger Curry's place when you drive along Mason Avenue in  Chatsworth. His is the house with the front yard that sticks about 30 feet into  the street -- the one that some motorists have to swerve to avoid.  </P> <P> Curry's small dirt parcel is a "jutout," one of hundreds of pieces of unpaved  land on street rights of way scattered along thoroughfares across the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Homeowners find themselves living on a jutout when the street is widened in  front of neighboring properties, but not theirs.  </P> <P> Since 1962, such widenings have been required of landowners applying for  permission to build on lots facing streets that have not already been paved to  their planned ultimate width.  </P> <P> It is up to property owners to donate the land for the widening and pay for  asphalt paving and concrete curbs, gutters and sidewalks, which can cost almost  $20,000 for a 100-foot-wide lot.  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials say jutouts exist because the city has to wait for  landowners' money because it does not have the funds to widen every street  itself.  </P> <P> Property owners who have not built on their land since 1962 are not forced to  widen streets or install sidewalks unless their jutout creates a safety hazard.  But the accelerating pace of construction, replacing older Valley homes with  new houses or condominiums, results in an increasing number of older streets  being widened to their intended size on a piecemeal basis. That's causing the  leftover land to jut out at motorists.  </P> <P> Drivers on Louise Avenue in Encino face an obstacle course as they maneuver  around 12 jutouts on both sides of the two-lane street along a half-mile  section between the Ventura Freeway and Ventura Boulevard. One small jutout  exists to preserve a 600-year-old oak tree.  </P> <P> In the East Valley, countless jutouts extend from North Hollywood tract houses  built in the 1940s and '50s along Tujunga and Vineland avenues and parts of  Burbank Boulevard.  </P> <P> In the West Valley, jutouts at 1920s and '30s farmhouses cause motorists  traveling on such streets as Woodlake Avenue in West Hills to squeeze into  single lanes.  </P> <P> The jutout in front of her house sticks out "like a sore thumb," said Betty  Curry, whose jutout was formed about eight years ago when developers on both  sides of her Mason Avenue home north of Devonshire Street widened the street as  a tract-approval requirement.  </P> <P> Roger and Betty Curry tried to eliminate their jutout by joining with the  subdividers in widening the street. But Betty Curry said they were forced to  drop that plan when city officials required that the couple also widen a side  street next to their property as part of the deal. That would have required  them to tear down their guest house.  </P> <P> When their jutout was first formed, unsuspecting motorists traveling southward  on Mason Avenue would occasionally drive into it, she said. After several  errant drivers damaged their water and sewer lines, the Currys persuaded the  city to install a reflectorized barricade at the edge of the jutout. That ended  the problem, she said.  </P> <P> City officials say jutouts can be an inconvenience to drivers but are seldom a  safety hazard.  </P> <P> The most dangerous jutouts have long ago been paved over, said Jim Glasgow, the  city Department of Public Works engineer in charge of street design for the  Valley. In some cases, the city spent its own money rather than wait for  adjoining property owners to get around to financing the work, he said.  </P> <P> Owners not planning to redevelop their property any time soon can rid  themselves of jutouts by petitioning the city to form an assessment district to  handle the cost of road widening and sidewalk building. Payments, added to the  property tax bills of jutout owners, can be spread out over 10 years, officials  say.  </P> <P> The cost of eliminating a typical jutout from a 50-foot-wide lot ranges from  $8,000 to $10,000, officials said. That pays for asphalt pavement, concrete  curbs, gutters and driveway entrances, a sidewalk and decorative trees.  </P> <P> The typical jutout-removal project takes about two years, counting the time  needed to form an assessment district, draw up plans and do the actual  construction. Some jutouts are far from typical, however.  </P> <P> City officials have been trying since 1974 to remove a two-block-long jutout on  Parthenia Street at the northern edge of Canoga Park. The 43-foot-wide dirt  strip extends from Lurline Avenue almost to De Soto Avenue. It pinches  Parthenia's busy four lanes into two, causing jam-ups in the morning and  evening when heavy traffic from nearby industrial areas squeezes through.  </P> <P> The city's proposal to eliminate the bottleneck has been delayed by nearby  homeowners' unhappiness at losing what have become the extended front yards of  a row of one-acre mini-estates on the north side of Parthenia. Some residents  believe that the strip contributes to what they regard as the rural look of  their neighborhood.  </P> <P> When 34 Parthenia Avenue property owners were advised five years ago that they  would be assessed an average of $9,000 each to pay for the widening, the  resulting outcry forced the City Council to waive requirements that the  widening project include street lights, sidewalks and sewer hookups.  </P> <P> The protests have triggered eight redesigns to the Parthenia project over the  years. The most recent revision was finished a month ago, clearing the way for  city officials to begin discussing sharing the cost of the $1.8-million project  with property owners.  </P> <P> "The city will pick up a portion of the costs because Parthenia is a secondary  highway," Glasgow said. "We're just now beginning negotiations with the  owners."  </P> <P> Officials hope to iron out the details in time for the Parthenia widening  project to get under way in March, 1991, he said. Residents say they are  equally eager to resolve the long-running dispute.  </P> <P> "I have mixed feelings about the widening," said Vicki Johnson, whose family  has owned one of the Parthenia mini-estates for nearly 20 years.  </P> <P> "The new street will be closer to our house. But there will be fewer accidents.  There have been a lot of them -- people don't see the barricades. I've taken  blankets out to people who have been hurt in accidents out there."  </P> <P> But a more frequent problem involves motorists in four-wheel-drive vehicles who  race over the dirt strip and stir up billowing clouds of dust, she said.  </P> <P> Others who live behind Valley jutouts say traffic problems are few, however.  </P> <P> "There's never even the screeching of brakes, not even in the morning rush  hour," said Steve Fletcher, who rents a small clapboard one-time farmhouse on a  jutout lot next to Wilbur Avenue in Northridge.  </P> <P> Ray Franzalia, whose Studio City front yard forms a jutout on busy Coldwater  Canyon Avenue, said only one motorist has driven onto his property. "Ten years  ago some woman landed on my front porch. I think she got a little confused  trying to make a turn there at the corner," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Won't Sell  </P> <P> Franzalia, who has lived in his home for 30 years, said his jutout was formed  when apartment houses were built on either side of him. He said apartment  developers, who would have to pave over the jutout, frequently ask him if he is  interested in selling his house to them. "I tell them I'm not selling to  anybody," he said.  </P> <P> Down the street, operators of the landmark Little Brown Church -- which also  sits on a Coldwater Canyon Avenue jutout -- say the same thing. They aren't  interested in selling. And they have not been troubled by cars crashing into  their jutout.  </P> <P> "God really watches over our chapel," said Catherine Martin, a church  secretary. "Someone hit our picket fence six or eight years ago. But that's  all."  </P> <P> Martin said the jutout is one of the reasons the tiny 48-year-old chapel, which  was the scene of the Feb. 29, 1952, marriage of Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis,  has never been changed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Offers  </P> <P> "The street would be right up to the front door if we got a building permit.  That's one of the reasons we've never remodeled," Martin said. She said the  church is approached frequently by developers, "but we have no intention of  selling it or tearing it down."  </P> <P> Glasgow said the cost to property owners of widening streets varies, depending  on the size of the jutout. Local residential streets are only 36 to 40 feet  wide, while secondary streets are 66 feet wide and "major highways" are  designated to be 80 feet in width.  </P> <P> The city shares the cost of paving over large jutouts under the philosophy that  people should not be penalized for living on a busy street. "If the widening is  more than a local benefit, they shouldn't have to pay for more than their  share," Glasgow said.  </P> <P> Glasgow said the city is in no rush to force landowners to eliminate jutouts  that do not cause traffic problems.  </P> <P> Those jutouts, motorists will have to wait out.  </P></p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Bus war sees off council operator Darlington Transport Company, a council-owned bus operator, went into administration yesterday in the wake of fierce competition between rival operators in the County Durham town. Mr Nick Wallis, chairman of the council's transport committee, said: 'The financial viability of DTC has been smashed beyond repair.' The Labour-controlled council blamed the government's deregulation policy and the sales process it imposed on council-owned bus companies for the collapse of the 90-year-old business, which faces liquidation. But it also blamed Stagecoach, the Perth-based company, which this week started offering free travel for five weeks in Darlington, largely on the same routes as DTC.</p>

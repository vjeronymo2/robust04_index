			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 6 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  said here Friday [6 May] that it was eager to help the new  government of South Africa to establish "a democratic and  nonracial society."    Theodoros Pangalos, Greek chairman of the EU's Council of  Ministers, said the Union was ready to embark on an economic and  political dialogue with the new government aimed at quickly  boosting economic trade and aid.    "The EU warmly welcomes the holding of the first democratic  elections in South Africa and congratulates all the people of  South Africa and its leaders on this historic occasion," he said  at a meeting of development aid ministers.    Pangalos added the EU's confidence that all parties in South  Africa would meet the commitments they made during negotiations  leading up to last week's all-race elections, and would pursue  peaceful dialogue.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Poll revives question, will Quebec quit?  -Tory collapse stokes separatist debate THE industrial and farming centre of Sherbrooke, in the rolling countryside east of Montreal, will be one of the most closely watched constituencies on election night in Canada next Monday. Political analysts say the outcome there could have a significant impact on national, and especially Quebec, politics over the next few years. The result in Sherbrooke will shape the political future of Mr Jean Charest, who is the town's sitting MP and, since last June, deputy prime minister in Ms Kim Campbell's Progressive Conservative cabinet. Most important, the youthful Mr Charest, aged 35, is viewed as one of the few Quebec politicians able to articulate a vision of the future in which the francophone province remains part of Canada. But the Conservatives, who have held office in Ottawa for nine years, have their backs to the wall in the election campaign. Recent opinion polls indicate that the Tories will not only be defeated by the Liberal party, they may even fail to gain enough seats to form the official opposition. Nowhere has the Tories' collapse been more spectacular than in Quebec. The party now has 56 out of 75 Quebec seats in the House of Commons. But if recent opinion polls are any guide, it will be lucky to win three or four on October 25. The Tories have fallen victim in Quebec less to the Liberals than to the Bloc Quebecois (BQ), a group formed in 1988 to press for sovereignty for the francophone province. The BQ, led by Mr Lucien Bouchard, a former Conservative cabinet minister, is expected to pick up between 40 and 55 seats on election day. The BQ's strength has again brought to the boil the interminable debate about whether and for how long Quebec will remain part of Canada. The election of a large group of BQ MPs will not in itself bring independence to Quebec. 'We cannot do anything formally to implement sovereignty in Ottawa,' Mr Bouchard says. 'This has to be done through a decision made by Quebeckers in a referendum.' In any case, opinion polls suggest the number of Quebeckers who vote for the BQ next week will be greater than the hard core of nationalists who actually favour a break with the rest of Canada. Among those likely to back the BQ in the election are many who, while not favouring full independence, are frustrated by the failure of one set of constitutional talks after another over the past decade to devolve more powers from the federal government to Quebec. observers also ascribe the BQ's strength to Quebeckers' sense that a vote for the Bloc next Monday carries few risks. For many, the BQ's attraction is that it offers a change from the two traditional parties, holding out the promise of better economic times if Quebec's interests are given higher priority in Ottawa. Mr Alain Dubuc, chief editorial writer at La Presse newspaper in Montreal, wrote in a recent column: 'There are no alternatives to the Bloc and that's the problem.' The provincial poll to be held some time during 1994 will be far more crucial to Quebec's future than the general election. The BQ's provincial arm, the Parti Quebecois, has pledged to hold a sovereignty referendum within 12 months if it succeeds in unseating the ruling Liberals in the provincial election. The risk is that the presence of a large contingent of separatist MPs in Ottawa could generate rising support for sovereignty within Quebec as the provincial election and then - possibly - a referendum approaches. Mr Bouchard has promised the BQ will not obstruct the parliamentary process. But it could raise the level of Quebeckers' frustration with the federal system by making demands which a national government, balancing Quebec's needs with those of other parts of the country, cannot fulfil. For instance, among the decisions facing the next government is the likely closure of some military bases. Mr Bouchard notes, however, that while Quebec has 25 per cent of Canada's population, it has only four out of 26 bases. He insists all four must remain open. The BQ's ability to further the separatist cause could be enhanced by the expected strong performance next Monday of the right-wing Reform party, whose main support is in western Canada. A pillar of the Reform platform is that Quebec should get precisely the same treatment as all nine other provinces. If Quebeckers insist on special powers, so the Reform argument goes, they should not be discouraged from leaving the fold. The political situation within Quebec is also fluid. Mr Robert Bourassa, the respected and popular Liberal premier, announced his resignation from politics last month. The timing of his announcement at the start of the federal election campaign was widely interpreted as a signal to Quebeckers that they might wish to think twice before adding one bit of political instability to another by voting BQ. But Mr Bourassa's decision has thrown his own provincial Liberal party into disarray. The new leader will be chosen at a convention next January. But only one candidate for Mr Bourassa's job - Treasury Board president Mr Daniel Johnson - has so far come forward. Other senior party members are offended that Mr Bourassa turned a blind eye to Mr Johnson's early lobbying for the leadership and failed to give them enough time to organise their campaigns. Mr Johnson is a staunch federalist and has a blue-chip political background. Both his father and brother were premiers of the province. But there is some doubt whether he can match either Mr Bourassa's deft political touch within the party, or Mr Bouchard's charisma on the stump. Hence the hope in federalist circles that Mr Charest will still have a platform after next Monday from which to appeal to Quebeckers not to give up on Canada.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Arts: The Dream's spell in the Park - Theatre In hell they give performances of A Midsummer Night's Dream without a single laugh. In this life, however, it is the most watertight of Shakespeare's comedies. The lovers' confusions will rouse the sleepiest of audiences, and the Pyramus and Thisbe scene seems never to fail. The production that opens this year's Open Air season in Regent's Park, directed by Deborah Paige, is not very far above these minimal standards - but does that matter? Regent's Park itself lends poetry where the actors lack it. Part of the spell is that the birdsong, which at first virtually drowns the actors, gradually ebbs away during the evening; and the last glow of full daylight deepens into nightfall behind the stage and is replaced, bit by bit, by stage lighting. The quality that is rarest in performances of The Dream is sheer human complexity, that most vital Shakespearean ingredient. It is most touchingly present on this occasion with Bottom, given an unusually po-faced, even dignified, performance by Robert Lang. His speech on awakening, baffled by last night's memories, is spoken with ideal, hushed awe; and, as he remembers, his hands trace above his head the arcs of his vanished ass's head. No jolly stupidity here, but the stunned wonder of one whose life was briefly transfigured. Then, on his next appearance, comes the robust life-giving camaraderie of 'Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?': sweet bully Bottom, fully restored to the human race. Excellent also is Estelle Kohler's Titania - an arresting mixture of dangerous power and wanton sensuality. She speaks the verse with an authority that sends the play's pulse soaring on her every entrance. Cameron Blakely, with horns and thick black hair like the god Pan, is a virile, bright-eyed Puck with bags of attack. Paul Freeman's Oberon, eyelids glittering, is more hammy, savouring the role's rhetorical flourishes and rolled Rs. Most of the rustics do well, though why Flute (Simon Harrison, looking like Tim Brooke-Taylor) should say he has 'a beard coming' when he is already half-bald beats me; his piping voice is a cheap joke; and Peter Quince (weakly performed by Tim Stern) does not speak the prologue as Theseus and Lysander then describe. The four mortal lovers are given light, superficial performances by actors who have plenty to learn about producing their voices. (And if the Open Air Theatre doesn't teach them . . .) Geraldine Pilgrim has put them in 19th-century attire (Empire line for the girls), and has provided an elegant set - an extended creamy neoclassical arcade through which we see the park's trees. The fairies, as usual, are a problem: five of them here, played by adults. Most of Jonathan Goldstein's music for them sounds like (remember Round the Horne?) the Fraser Hayes Four; and Pilgrim and Paige have dressed them with mirror-specs, black helmets, glittery leggings, and fanned silver-paper wings to look like bluebottles. Were I Bottom, I would not ask one of them to scratch me. And, call me old-fashioned, I cannot believe in fairies with large buttocks. In repertory at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park.</p>

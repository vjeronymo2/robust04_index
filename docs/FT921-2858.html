			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: WPP It is one thing not paying a dividend. It is quite another publishing a profit and loss account drawn up to a specification laid down by your banks. That at any rate seems to be the reality of yesterday's decision by WPP to release Pounds 44m of property provisions and other excess liabilities as exceptional items, thereby enabling the heavily indebted group to comply with its interest rate covenants for last year. The question is whether the lenders will be so easily satisfied in 1992. Notwithstanding a slightly disappointing dip in WPP's 1991 revenues, they can at least derive some encouragement from operating margins which were better than Saatchi's and from the recent new business success. On current trading assumptions, however, the probability is that they will shortly be confronted with a request for new cash. Asset disposals may be part of the price for continuing support, with Scali, McCabe; market research; and the Far Eastern advertising operations the three favourite candidates. While Tokyo's fall is hardly helpful in this regard, a more significant worry is whether the drop in interest charges which would result from such sales would not be largely offset by a loss of cash flow. The risk for ordinary shareholders remains a Saatchi style capital reconstruction which would hugely dilute their interest. Without it, the shares might be cheap. But the fact that the combination of WPP's fully diluted market capitalisation, average net debt, and payment obligations to senior staff represents 55 per cent of gross revenues - as opposed to 65 per cent in Saatchi's case - reflects the market's continuing unease.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Deetman To Stay"] </F>   [Text] CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] member Wim Deetman  is to remain Second Chamber chairman. The PvdA [Labor Party],  which as the largest party is entitled to fill this position,  has renounced any claims to it. PvdA leader Kok made this clear  in a letter to party leaders yesterday [10 May].    The appointment, in principle for four years, takes effect  when the new Chamber first sits on Tuesday of next week.  Deetman, chairman since September 1989, had already indicated  that he was available.    According to the PvdA, there is "broad appreciation" of the  way Deetman has discharged his responsibilities. Another factor  was also that First Chamber chairman is the PvdA's Tjeenk  Willink. According to an unwritten rule in the Netherlands  parliament, the presidents of the First and the Second Chamber  must never be from the same party.    In 1986, when the CDA had more seats than the PvdA, PvdA  member Doman was also allowed to remain at his post. As the  biggest party, the CDA did not demand the job for one of its own  members until 1989.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The sole occupant of a small plane that apparently ran out of fuel made an  emergency landing just short of the runway at Montgomery Field on Thursday  night, authorities reported.  </P> <P> The pilot, identified by San Diego police as William Russell of La Jolla, was  not injured. There were no passengers.  </P> <P> Police Lt. John Kern said Russell was approaching Montgomery Field from the  east in his two-seat, experimental plane about 6:45 p.m. when the engine died.  Russell brought the aircraft down in a grassy area about a quarter of a mile  east of the runway.  </P> <P> Stewart Cochran, a pilot who was at the airport when the landing occurred,  described Russell's plane as a home-built, experimental craft known as a  Glasair.  </P> <P> "That plane may have saved his life," said Cochran, president of the San Diego  chapter of the National Experimental Aircraft Assn. "It's an all-composite  aircraft and it's very strong."  </P> <P> Police said the plane remained upright. It was moderately damaged.  </P> <P> Because of the darkness and light rain, police and firefighters had a difficult  time locating the craft. By the time they reached Russell, he reportedly was  walking around the aircraft checking for damage.  </P> <P> It was unclear Thursday where Russell's flight had begun.  </P></p>

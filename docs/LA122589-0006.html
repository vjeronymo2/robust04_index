			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH OFFICIAL DEFENDS HONG KONG CITIZENSHIP PLAN  </P> <P> Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has defended the government's plan to give full  British citizenship to up to 50,000 professionals and their families -- about  225,000 people in all from Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Hurd said in the Sunday Express that the move was necessary to persuade  professionals essential for Hong Kong's prosperity not to emigrate before the  British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.  </P> <P> Confidence in Hong Kong has plummeted since the Chinese army brutally repressed  pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in June.  </P> <P> Hurd said that assurances for the colony are needed because many people have  already left. "The lifeblood of Hong Kong is being drained away."  </P> <P> Officials said the package was designed to give Hong Kong citizens most likely  to emigrate an "insurance policy" of right of abode in Britain if needed after  1997, thus encouraging them to stay in the colony.  </P> <P> Hong Kong legislators have described the British government's proposal as  potentially divisive and pledged to fight for the rights of all 3.25 million  British passport-holders in the colony.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dzhaba Ioseliani, head of the Georgian </F> delegation at the negotiations with the Abkhazian side in Geneva  and commander of the "Mkhedrioni" paramilitary group, by Inga  Nizharadze in Tbilisi; date not given: "`The Fact That We Are  Right Is Recognized by the World'"]    [Text] [Nizharadze]Batono [Georgian polite form of  address] Dzhaba, how did the second round of negotiations in  Geneva go [on 11-13 January]?    [Ioseliani] Relatively normally. The main thing is that the  world public and Russia are on our side. The fact that we are  right in this matter is recognized by everyone. The Abkhazian  side was constantly balking by clinging to unsubstantiated  facts, as a result of which the negotiations were almost  suspended. Judge for yourself: They submitted the most stupid  conditions regarding the question of refugees -- that we take  back only women, old men, children, and those men who did not  take part in the fighting. In short, the Abkhazians conducted  themselves in an uncertain manner, evidently realizing that  their position was not right. Their fanaticism is the first  sign of their lack of confidence. A fitting role was played by  the UN, CSCE, and U.S. representatives who advised the Abkhazian  side to behave more sensibly and not to pin their hopes on the  world recognizing Abkhazia as a separate state from Georgia. In  this way, the communique, which suited us and corresponded to  the interests of Georgia, was signed. However, the Abkhazians  called the methods ostensibly used to force them into signing  this document "Beria-type methods." In answer to this, I told a  joke, reminding them of the famous Abkhazian dramatist who,  unfortunately, had not managed to write anything as he had been  shot in 1937 by Lavrentiy Pavlovich [Beria].    [Nizharadze]However, the view is being expressed that  the second round of talks in Geneva ended in complete failure  for the Georgian side....    [Ioseliani] This is not how I view it. The talks were  productive. The return of refugees to Gali rayon is to begin  already on 10 February. This will be the first stage, following  which refugees will return to the other rayons of Abkhazia.  There will be complete disarmament and the withdrawal of all  kinds of voluntary formations and individuals who went there to  take part in the conflict, and so forth. I would advise those  who think that we suffered a fiasco at the talks not to make  such statements and draw such hasty conclusions.    [Nizharadze]What can you say about Russia's position at  the second round of the negotiations?    [Ioseliani] That Russia undoubtedly feels its guilt and is  trying in every way to make amends. Naturally, the Russians  have got what they wanted: They will put on blue helmets and  will fulfill the role of peacekeepers, not forgetting the fact  that the peacekeeping forces are financed by the UN.    [Nizharadze]During your absence, the decision was  adopted to disarm the "Mkhedrioni." How did you react to this  and is there any truth in the rumors that the "Mkhedrioni"  intends to re-elect its commander?    [Ioseliani] Let it disarm. If this proves beneficial and  helps to improve the criminal situation in the republic, we are  ready to obey and submit to this decision. The weapons will be  kept in a safe place and, if it becomes necessary, we will again  arm ourselves. Of course, it's a pity. The "Mkhedrioni" has  been fighting for four years now; during this time, we have lost  632 fighters and about 1,000 have been wounded. Probably the  time has now come for the police to take over; they have been  taking cover somewhere and are now swaggering about and  dictating to us how we should behave. This is the law of life.  This is what happened to the famous English Prime Minister  Churchill who was not re-elected after the war because, as they  put it: The war is over. Why do we now need Churchill? As  regards my re-election, I would be glad if this happened.  However, these are rumors, as are the claims that I have headed  off to Austria with a 24 year-old girl in tow.</p>

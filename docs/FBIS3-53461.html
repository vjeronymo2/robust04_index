			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taba, 18 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political  adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has expressed  the hope that the Syrian-U.S. summit will positively affect the  peace process in the region. He pointed to the importance of  Syria's participation in the ongoing peace efforts.    Arriving in Taba this morning to lead the Palestinian  delegation to the meetings of the Gaza-Jericho Committee, Sha'th  said the Palestinians want progress in every direction and on  every track of the Arab-Israeli negotiations to achieve a  comprehensive peace in the region.    Sha'th said that during the new round of talks, which will  begin today, he and the Israeli delegation will discuss the  border crossings, the size of the Jericho area, and the Israeli  settlements in the Gaza Strip. He expressed the hope that  topics relating to the transfer of civilian authority to the  Palestinians will be wound up during this round.    He stressed that the Palestinian side has a real desire to  negotiate during this round. He said he hoped the Israeli side  has the same desire. He said the Palestinian stance has not  changed, indicating that it is awaiting Israel's reply to the  papers it presented earlier.    Dr. Sha'th noted that the Palestinians will participate in  the coming round of Arab-Israeli talks in Washington, noting  that there has been too much delay in resuming these talks.    Dr. Sha'th called for a quick transfer of power in the West  Bank and for holding legislative elections in the occupied  territories in July 1994.    Dr. Sha'th said the new round of talks in Taba was delayed  because he was in Tunis, where he briefed the Palestinian  leadership on the outcome of the last round of meetings of the  Gaza-Jericho Committee. He stressed that any progress in the  meetings of this committee will positively affect the meetings  of the Economic Committee in Paris next week.</p>

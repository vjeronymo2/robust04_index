			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN TRANSITION GAME PLAGUED BY HEAVY TURNOVER;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: DEPARTED PLAYERS TAKE SOME PARTING SHOTS, BUT COACH PETE  CASSIDY DEFENDS THE PERSONNEL CHANGES AS TEAM GEARS UP FOR DIVISION I.  </P> <P> It is difficult enough on a shoestring budget to take a mediocre Division II  basketball program to the Division I level.  </P> <P> The difference in talent can be demoralizing and an arduous schedule, such as  the one Cal State Northridge faces -- only 11 of 28 games will be played at  home -- can be difficult to overcome.  </P> <P> At Northridge, the obstacles are even greater because the program's timing  could not be worse. Since their final Division II game last February, the  Matadors have lost eight players with eligibility remaining and two others are  academically ineligible. CSUN will make its Division I debut Friday at  Colorado.  </P> <P> The athletes recruited expressly for making the transition didn't stick around  to see it through. Forward Kendell McDaniels, the team's second-leading scorer  as a sophomore last season, transferred to Cal State Bakersfield. Bill Mazurie,  the top freshman scorer, left for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> Freshman center Shanan Rosenberg, academically ineligible last semester,  transferred to Division II UC Davis and sophomore forward Sandy Brown switched  to Occidental.  </P> <P> Senior starters Jemarl Baker and Eugene Humphrey and walk-on Andre Henry, all  of whom were major contributors, left the program but remain students at  Northridge, as does walk-on Brooklyn McLinn.  </P> <P> From the standpoint of the defectors, with the exception of Baker and Humphrey,  the program is fraught with problems. From where 20th-year Coach Pete Cassidy  sits, a housecleaning was inevitable.  </P> <P> "We'll probably never have the turnover that we had last year and wouldn't have  if we didn't go Division I," Cassidy said. "You can't gradually change 25% of  your schedule, then 50%. If you upgrade the schedule, you have to upgrade your  personnel. Any time you tell kids they don't measure up to the standards, you  are the bad guy. I tried very seriously to be fair."  </P> <P> Although Cassidy attempted to recruit Division I-caliber players the past two  seasons in anticipation of the move, he admits that he sometimes was not  successful.  </P> <P> "You don't really know about kids until after the first year," Cassidy said.  "The courtship that is recruiting goes only so far. The players are on their  best behavior. I don't think any coach knows a kid until they see them in a  stress situation, day in and day out."  </P> <P> Mazurie and Brown did not pass Cassidy's stress test, but they were given more  playing time than two players Cassidy retained, Erik Cooper and Kirk Scott.  Henry and Rosenberg also played more than Cooper and Scott on a team that went  12-15 in its final Division II campaign.  </P> <P> "Some of the kids we didn't invite back because we didn't think they would make  it," Cassidy said, referring to Brown and Mazurie. "Others, I thought worked  hard. Sometimes you say, maybe with hard work and commitment, they can be a  Division I player."  </P> <P> That was Cassidy's thinking in the cases of Henry, McDaniels, Baker and  Humphrey.  </P> <P> But Henry, a walk-on who started nine games last season, quit after learning  that he would have to start over at the bottom of the depth chart. McDaniels  didn't take kindly to the treatment of Brown but didn't make up his mind about  quitting until Cassidy told him that he couldn't afford to give him two weeks  to consider it. Cassidy reasoned that he needed to recruit a replacement for  McDaniels immediately. In the cases of Baker and Humphrey, he didn't get the  chance -- they quit too late for him to get replacements.  </P> <P> Baker, the team's third-leading scorer, decided in late September not to return  because of family responsibilities. Humphrey, CSUN's point guard, announced  Nov. 6 that he was quitting to spend more time on his studies.  </P> <P> The turnover rate among personnel has taken its toll on a recruiting budget  that has been limited from the outset.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of players over the years that we lost because we didn't have  the financial wherewithal," Cassidy said.  </P> <P> "We not only came in second and third to Division I schools, we lost to  Division II schools as well. We are also under time restraints recruiting  because we (the coaches) have to teach classes here as well."  </P> <P> In the past three seasons, 16 players have lasted one year or less, requiring  the CSUN staff to repeat the recruiting process more often. Instead of focusing  on a few recruits each year, the Matador staff has had to restock with 11  players this season.  </P> <P> "Any time you have to recruit a bunch of guys in one year, it is going to be  tough," said Rusty Smith, a former assistant coach.  </P> <P> "Ideally, you recruit three to four guys a year, maybe one to two some years.  Every now and then these things do happen."  </P> <P> Another consequence of frequent turnover is the amount of practice time wasted  on teaching skills to players who ultimately will not return. Wrongly assessing  these players is not limited to talent and potential.  </P> <P> During the early signing period last fall, Cassidy signed two players to  national letters of intent, Dorian Manigo of Riordan High in the Bay Area and  Mark Wilkinson of Foothill High in Orange County, who did not qualify  academically under Proposition 48.  </P> <P> Another signee, Troy LeBlanc, did not receive his associate of arts degree from  Skyline College and could not enroll at CSUN.  </P> <P> Cassidy is concerned about the situation, but he won't invoke a rule that  potential recruits have to pass the Scholastic Aptitude Test or the American  College Test before he signs them to scholarships. He fears he would lose the  chance to sign too many outstanding players. "Most kids haven't taken the test  yet (by the Nov. 14-21 early signing period) or if they have, they don't have  the results back," Cassidy said.  </P> <P> As for the players who are academically ineligible this semester, Cooper and  Percy Fisher, and the pair that were in that situation last season, Scott and  Rosenberg, Cassidy insists that his new staff members, assistants Tom McCollum  and Wayne Fluker, must be more discriminating. "We can't let guys in who are  marginal," he said. "We have to make sure they have a better chance."  </P> <P> Sandy Brown fits into the Loyola Marymount-style offense CSUN is employing this  season, but that is not what Cassidy wanted a year ago.  </P> <P> "I didn't fit into the system, the eight-passes-before-a-shot rule," said  Brown, who averaged five points a game as a reserve.  </P> <P> "The type of team we had was a bunch of greyhounds, a run-and-gun type that  could move up the court, but (Cassidy) wanted a slow tempo. Almost the whole  team had trouble adjusting to that pace. You had to play with a feeling of  restraint."  </P> <P> To the players, it is restraint, to Cassidy, it's discipline.  </P> <P> "The 5-7-8 passes were (practice) drills," Cassidy said. "We had to have  discipline to run the offense, especially a motion offense. Even in the games I  didn't want outside shots some times."  </P> <P> In a meeting with Cassidy, Brown was told that the staff was recruiting players  with abilities that were superior to Brown's.  </P> <P> "It was kind of insulting," Brown said. "He said I hadn't developed into his  type of player. I admit I wasn't going to pass the ball every time I touched  it; I am a scorer. It could be defense; I have lazy days in practice, but I kid  you not -- in games I would play defense."  </P> <P> Another shortcoming was Brown's reedy 6-6 and 160-pound frame.  </P> <P> "I didn't gain enough weight and I didn't get as strong as he expected me to  get," said Brown, who Cassidy characterized as "unwilling" to work out with  weights.  </P> <P> From the beginning, Brown had difficulty communicating with Cassidy.  </P> <P> "Cassidy doesn't talk to recruits," Brown said. "He lets the assistants  recruit. I saw him only once before I signed. A couple guys joked about it, how  he doesn't do the recruiting. It's like looking at a book. The book looks  interesting, but when you open it, it is boring."  </P> <P> Smith, the team's top recruiter until June when he accepted a similar position  at Eastern Washington, claims that Cassidy's style is not unusual. "Every  program does it differently." Smith said. "Some head coaches are involved a  little more than others."  </P> <P> On trips, Brown said he only saw Cassidy just before the games.  </P> <P> "An assistant coach came to your room and talked to you and laughed, but not  the head coach," Brown said. "We had quite a few team meetings, though. You  were allowed to speak up, but he (Cassidy) was stubborn. Nothing anyone tells  him would change his mind."  </P> <P> Cassidy acknowledges that he doesn't get close to his players, but he believes  that is the role of a head coach. "When you are the head guy, players are less  apt to come to you with their problems and concerns," the 56-year-old coach  said. "They go to an assistant to buffer that. The head coach seems to be put  up there. I don't think he puts himself up there.  </P> <P> "The age difference doesn't mean I can't help them, but do you think I'm going  to hang out with them? I don't think so. I want them with their peers. I have  three children. When they have a party at the house, they don't want mom and  pop around."  </P> <P> Mazurie, another player who clashed with Cassidy, found himself in much the  same situation as Brown during the recruiting process. "I never really talked  to (Cassidy)," the 1989 graduate of Capistrano Valley High said.  </P> <P> "I dealt with Coach Smith and Coach (former assistant Dave) Fehte. But it  didn't matter. How do you know a coach until you are in practice? It is like a  crap-shoot."  </P> <P> A reserve, Mazurie averaged 7.3 points and two assists a game. He was on a  short leash, however. On several occasions, he was yanked out of the lineup  after his first mistake.  </P> <P> Smith thought enough of Mazurie, however, to recruit him to Eastern Washington,  but Mazurie chose San Luis Obispo to stay closer to home.  </P> <P> In terms of scoring, McDaniels' loss was the greatest. He averaged 11 points,  second-best on the team behind Derrick Gathers, whose eligibility ran out.  </P> <P> "The last two seasons we were walking in place," McDaniels said. "The program  wasn't going in any direction. Then Sandy Brown, my best friend, got cut so I  didn't want to play. I wasn't going to play at all, but the Bakersfield coaches  said I could go there."  </P> <P> It wasn't easy leaving.  </P> <P> "That was my home and I was comfortable there academically," said McDaniels, a  graduate of Chatsworth High. "Coach Cassidy told me he'd like to have me, but  if I wanted to go, he wouldn't stop me. Coach Smith wanted me to stay, for what  reason I don't know because he was leaving."  </P> <P> At 6-foot-8 and 235 pounds, Rosenberg gave the Matadors the size they  desperately needed. But instead of posting up for CSUN for four years,  Rosenberg is toiling at UC Davis.  </P> <P> "I was unhappy, but I don't really think it was the methods or the coaches,"  Rosenberg said. "I believe there wasn't a proper amount of respect between the  players as a group and the coach. It is nothing against him. I like Coach  Cassidy. A lot of it was (lack of) chemistry. It wasn't working out too well.  All the guys got along, but I don't think we were really brought together as a  family. There was the players and there was the head coach and when it came  time to play basketball, then we were together."  </P> <P> While Rosenberg's loss was softened by the return of 6-7, 300-pound center Todd  Bowser, Henry's absence is critical in light of Humphrey's departure.  </P> <P> "I left because I wasn't going to be given an opportunity to play, even though  I was playing well," said Henry, who guided the team to six of its 12 wins in a  starting role. "I hadn't decided to quit until (Cassidy) told me I'd be  starting from the bottom," Henry said.  </P> <P> "I never had a problem with (Cassidy). I got along with him. But he is not a  motivator. He motivates by threatening you that you are not going to play."  </P> <P> Another factor was Cassidy's decision not to give Henry scholarship money.  </P> <P> "In Division I, if you give a guy a dollar that counts as a scholarship used,"  said Cassidy, who is limited to 15 players on scholarship but has funds for  only 10. "In my opinion, I couldn't afford to do that. I'm sure he's upset but  I felt I had to do it."  </P> <P> McLinn too is still attending CSUN.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of rumors that (Cassidy) is not supposed to be coach next  year," said McLinn, a sophomore from Taft High. "I felt I would sit out a year  and see what happens. If he is still the coach, maybe I'll transfer; if there  is a new coach, I'll try out."  </P> <P> Two-time all-conference forward Pat Bolden, who played from 1984-88, had no  problems with Cassidy, but that wasn't the case with the rest of the team.  "People had a hard time learning his system and they griped about (lack of)  playing time," said Bolden, who is trying out for the Omaha Racers of the  Continental Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> "A lot of it had to do with his substitution pattern. We had some players that  were a little more athletic on the bench and maybe some of them deserved to be  on the court, but Cassidy wants you to think and he demands a specific role  from each guy. He might start a role player over someone with more athletic  ability."  </P> <P> Bolden also pointed out that Cassidy's offensive style didn't jibe with those  of some players.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it was 10 passes before you could shoot it," Bolden said. "If you  came from a running program, that was a tough transition."  </P> <P> The Matadors went 20-10 and won the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title  in Bolden's freshman year. "We had excellent chemistry," he said. "Not just in  practice. We were friends. We played ball with each other all the time."  </P> <P> The Matadors would finish no higher than fourth in the conference during their  stay in Division II.  </P> <P> James Carr, a reserve from 1985-87, enjoyed an amicable relationship with  Cassidy and contends that many of his teammates did not have a realistic view  of their abilities. His criticism is limited to a belief that Cassidy harnessed  Bolden and that Cassidy should have been more involved with recruiting. "A lot  of guys came here expecting something and they got a controlled style that they  didn't like," Carr said.  </P> <P> By the same token, those players could have investigated the program more  closely before signing their national letter of intent. "I explained that we  were a medium-tempo team," Smith said. "We tried to run, if the shot wasn't  there, we worked it around."  </P> <P> Cassidy says the backlash is natural.  </P> <P> "I don't always say yes when they walk through this door," he said. "They come  in for playing time and more (scholarship) money.  </P> <P> "My hands are tied (financially) and I can't always help them. Naturally, they  are bitter and say you can't communicate. I have a hard time dealing with lazy,  self-centered players who don't pay attention. So you become like a parent  scolding them when they don't fulfill their potential. Naturally, I'm labeled a  bad guy. But I hold no bitterness toward them. They are too young to hold  bitterness toward."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE BASKETBALL EXODUS  </P> <P> Brooklyn McLinn: Guard  </P> <P> Sophomore: Not Playing  </P> <P> McLinn (6-foot, 150 pounds) played in eight games as a walk-on for the Matadors  last season and scored only four points. He still attends school at Northridge  but says he will not try out for basketball again unless a coaching change is  made.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Andre Henry: Guard  </P> <P> Junior: Not Playing  </P> <P> Henry (6-0, 145) appeared in 20 games and started nine at the point guard  position last season. He played well when Eugene Humphrey, CSUN's starter, was  sidelined because of an injury, but by the end of the season Henry's playing  time had dramatically diminished. He averaged 1.5 points and 2.2 assists a  game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jemarl Baker: Guard  </P> <P> Senior: Not Playing  </P> <P> Baker (6-2, 165) started all but one game for the Matadors last season and led  the team in scoring twice. He was third on the team in scoring with an average  of 9.1 points a game. The two-year starter was among CSUN's best defensive  players. He decided in September not to return because of family  responsibilities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kendell McDaniels: Forward  </P> <P> Junior: Bakersfield  </P> <P> McDaniels (6-4, 210) was the top scorer among players who were supposed to  return. He led the Matadors in scoring six times and averaged 11 points and 6.4  rebounds while shooting 54.3%. McDaniels left CSUN after becoming disenchanted  with the coaching staff's treatment of his friend and teammate, Sandy Brown.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bill Mazurie: Swingman  </P> <P> Sophomore: San Luis Obispo  </P> <P> Mazurie (6-2, 175) played in all 27 games last season. He led CSUN freshmen  with a scoring average of 7.3 and was fourth on the team in assists (58) and  steals (20). After the season, Mazurie was encouraged by CSUN coaches not to  return and he transferred to Division II Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eugene Humphrey: Guard  </P> <P> Senior: Not Playing  </P> <P> The starting point guard last season, Humphrey (6-0, 162) left CSUN on Nov. 6  to spend more time on academics. He averaged 6.9 points, led the team with 73  assists and was CSUN's best free-throw shooter, making 38 of 44. The loss of  Humphrey forced Keith Gibbs to move from shooting guard to point guard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sandy Brown: Swingman  </P> <P> Junior: Occidental  </P> <P> Brown (6-6, 160) appeared in all but one of CSUN's games last season and  started three games. He averaged 5.3 points and two rebounds. Brown transferred  to Division III Occidental College after being told by CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy  that his skills were inferior to those of players Northridge was recruiting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shanan Rosenberg: Center  </P> <P> Sophomore: UC Davis  </P> <P> Rosenberg (6-8, 235) played in 16 games last season. After averaging 3.1 points  and 1.8 rebounds in limited appearances, he missed the second semester because  of academic ineligibility. Rosenberg claimed that Northridge players and  coaches lacked mutual respect.  </P></p>

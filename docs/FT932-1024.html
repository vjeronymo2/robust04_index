			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Letter: Shifting blame Your leader, 'Local counsel' (June 17), and the response from the director of the Council for the Protection of Rural England (Letters, June 19/20) fail to explain the one crucial need the government has for the review of local government and why status quo is unacceptable to them. Irrespective of what size the future unitary authorities are, their creation gives the government the perfect excuse to screw down their Standard Spending Assessment compared with their predecessor authorities. This way, the hard-pressed government will save money and the resulting shortfall in services will be blamed by both it and the new unitary authorities on the incompetence of the predecessor authorities. Neither district nor county will gain from the review. The government will be the winner and the user of local authority services the losers. R S Bristowe, 57 Crescent Road, Sheffield S7 1HN</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US plans food aid for former Soviet bread basket The US hopes to sign an agreement to provide Ukraine, once the Soviet bread basket, with Dollars 20m in food aid as a safety net in its transition to a market economy. Mr August Schumacher, head of the US Department of Agriculture's foreign agricultural service, said in London yesterday that the aim was to avoid food shortages in the cities as agricultural reforms took effect. The agreement is expected to be signed when President Leonid Kuchma visits Washington at the end of this month. 'We're exploring with Ukraine whether more will be needed, and we're hoping Europe will also be able to help,' said Mr Schumacher, who spent last weekend in talks in Kiev. He said the aid would be part of the World Bank/International Monetary Fund stabilisation programme for Ukraine. It was vital that Ukraine, with 53m people, should have fertiliser and seeds for spring wheat planting next year and foreign exchange to buy harvesting machinery and spare parts.</p>

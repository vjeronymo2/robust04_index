			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Merrydown shares lose sparkle after warning on profits Shares of Merrydown tumbled yesterday after the Sussex-based cider and soft drinks maker issued a warning on profits and announced plans to restructure its activities. The shares were marked down to 125p in pre-market dealings, as analysts hastily revised their profits forecasts downwards, before rallying to finish at 159p - still 54p below Friday's closing level. The board, chaired by Mr Richard Purdey, said that sales in the crucial Christmas period had been 'very disappointing'. Despite growth from the repackaged Original brand, the sales outcome for the full year to end-March was likely to be 'well below previous expectations with a considerable adverse effect on profitability'. While the recently acquired Shloer and PLJ brands had maintained sales, cider was hit, particularly in the bulk cash and carry and wholesale sectors, reflecting competition from economy brands, the directors said. The full-year was unlikely to show more than a modest profit, and the level of the final dividend - 6p last time for a total of 7p - was 'under review'. The proposed restructuring, aimed at increasing working capital by concentrating on the company's main brands, would involve a reduction in stock levels and overheads and the disposal of Martlet Natural Foods and other 'non-core assets'. Merrydown's quoted competitors - HP Bulmer and Taunton Cider - both responded to the statement. Bulmer, which produces the Strongbow, Woodpecker and Scrumpy Jack brands, described its trading over Christmas as 'reasonable'. It said its brand portfolio was more 'balanced' than Merrydown's and stressed that economy brands accounted for just 5 to 6 per cent of the total cider market. Taunton, which warned in December that lower-priced brands had adversely affected the take-home market, said its own trading over the period was 'satisfactory'. The group, which makes Dry Blackthorn and Autumn Gold and the premium Red Rock, Diamond White and Brody brands, is launching fresh promotional campaigns from next month, but declined to make a formal statement on trading.</p>

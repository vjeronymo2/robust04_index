			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: J&amp;S trims loss to Pounds 973,000 Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester-based producer of grinding and honing machines, yesterday reported a marginally reduced first half pre-tax loss of Pounds 973,000 - down from Pounds 981,000 - and is again passing its interim dividend. Turnover for the six months to end-September fell from Pounds 6.27m to Pounds 5.41m, although the 1992 figure included Pounds 795,000 of sales from the small tools business, sold in February. Losses per share were slightly lower at 8p (8.2p) and gearing was contained at 38.5 per cent. However, the company raised a net Pounds 2.96m in October from a subscription, placing and open offer of 13.5m shares. Following this, a pro-forma balance sheet would result in no gearing, it said. Mr Len Weaver, chairman, said the capital injection had enabled the company to resume its rationalisation programme announced last year, since when the workforce had been halved to 265. As part of the capital injection, Korber of Germany took a 26.5 per cent stake in the company. Mr Weaver said an integrated operating plan, advantageous to both J&amp;S and Blohm and Schaudt, the Korber grinding machine tool businesses, was in the final stages of preparation. He said the first six months' trading had remained difficult, with order intake still depressed. The immediate outlook remained uncertain, although manufacturing activity in UK and US markets was showing some signs of recovery. But the full implementation of the company's new manufacturing strategy, which relies heavily on buying-in machined components, had placed J&amp;S 'in an excellent position to exploit even a modest upturn in demand and thus return to profitable trading.'</p>

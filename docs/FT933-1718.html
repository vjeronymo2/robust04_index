			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact to seek cash injection THE BUFFER stock manager of the International Natural Rubber Organisation says he will be asking organisation members for more cash to buy in rubber in an effort to prop up sagging prices. Up to Dollars 60m could be requested from Inro's 20 natural rubber consuming and six producing countries. The Inro buffer stock manager has now accumulated a stockpile of about 200,000 tones of natural rubber. Rubber traders say Inro member countries might be reluctant to contribute more funds in view of uncertainties about the future of the organisation. Producer and consumer countries have been involved in protracted arguments about renegotiating the International Natural Rubber Agreement, which Inro supervises. Consumer countries, led by the European Community, want the present agreement, which expires at the end of this year, to be renewed, but producers want a renegotiation of the terms of the agreement. Mr Ahmad Farouk, head of Malaysia's delegation dealing with Inra, says producers cannot survive persistently low prices and will have to take action if consumers fail to agree to a new Inra. 'I can tell you for certain, if there are no negotiations, there is no Inra' said Mr Farouk. 'I just can't understand the consumers. To negotiate doesn't mean to agree. The producers have bent over backwards in the spirit of co-operation.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As the Press Center of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina reports, after Franjo Tudjman's Bosnian  initiative on the confederation of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the war criminal Radovan Karadzic has made  it public that he is also considering coming out with a proposal  on a confederation of all states that have appeared in these  regions. Let us recall that the last attempt to save peace on  the territory of former Yugoslavia was the initiative of Alija  Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and Kiro Gligorov, president of Macedonia, on forming a  confederation of south Slav states.    The greater state appetites of Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo  Tudjman, and the desire of the citizens of Slovenia, Croatia,  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia to break free from the  Belgrade Bolshevik hegemony then came into direct confrontation.  The former Yugoslav People's Army was used as the fiercest  defender of such a hegemony, simply because it was the only  guarantor of the high standard of living for its officers and of  the high budget earmarked for the Army.    The war criminal Radovan Karadzic, if this is his idea, is  too late in starting to think independently, and if he is still  a mere mouthpiece for Milosevic's ideas, he is then offering us  one more deceit, the umpteenth prison of the South Slav peoples.  After they themselves broke up the now already former  Yugoslavia, after hundreds of thousands of people have been  killed in war, after expelling, displacing, or forcing the  emigration of more than 2 million people, after destroying the  economies of all these states and everything that people  painstakingly achieved over years, the value of which is  estimated to tens of billions of dollars, they now realize they  cannot live without us.    They have realized this even before, but they expected to  achieve their domination with force, arms, and the sowing of  fear. Along with the fear, they have sown hatred, distrust, and  evil. Just as the force and all the weapons they have stolen  from us failed to help them, just as they have not managed to  frighten, conquer, or destroy us, they also failed to implant  hatred or to force us to answer crime with crime. We are ready  to build confidence among people and nations -- in fact, we have  never given it up -- and we are going to build it. However, in  doing so we must be careful, at least not to form a union with  those people who initiated genocide and made a large part of  Serbian people commit it, or at least not oppose it. We could  even try with somebody else and somebody different.    In August 1992, there was an initiative for a confederation  of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Croatia. Had a true military  alliance between those states been established then, Serbian  fascism would have already been defeated and the conditions  created for establishing confidence among peoples and states,  and even for establishing the principles of a possible  confederal agreement. However, somebody who has several times  already saved Milosevic's fascism from a complete defeat, as  Tudjman has done, deserves equal suspicion, and his initiatives  also.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Letter: Real difficulties will result from arts grant cut Sir, Antony Thorncroft is right to think ('Off the Wall', June 19) the arts will tremble if views ascribed to Iain Sproat, the new junior minister at the national heritage department, typify those of the government as a whole. Luckily, they do not seem to at the moment. However there is little evidence that the creation of the new senior department has yet yielded any great benefits to the arts. All that has happened so far is the promise of a Pounds 5m cut in the Arts Council's grant for next year so that more money can go to the blighted British Library building. Although Pounds 5m only represents 2 per cent of the Arts Council's budget the damage will be out of all proportion to the size of the cash cut. In the arts a little money goes a long way. The government has been successful in making sure that, with such a plural system of funding, the multiplier effect of the small amount it gives is highly efficient. Even in companies where public support represents a small part of total budgets, its partial withdrawal will lead to real difficulties, especially where there are cuts in local authority grants, sponsorship and box office income to add into the equation. If we were only worried about the grants to big arts companies things would be bad enough. Coming together with the collapse of much of the arts education system and a dangerously flawed lottery bill, the position requires rather more energetic attention than the government seems prepared to contemplate.

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Government accused of ignorance about police THE HOME OFFICE is ignorant of simple management information about provincial police forces, the National Audit Office said yesterday. Until last year it did not know the number or age of provincial police stations, although many need of repairs or replacing. In a critical report on the Home Office's monitoring of the 41 provincial police forces in England and Wales, the NAO highlights a series of weaknesses and calls for an overhaul of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, which reports to the home secretary. While spending on provincial policing has doubled to more than Pounds 3bn over the past decade, recorded crime has jumped by 40 per cent. It is not clear that the money has been matched by better policing and greater efficiency, the report concludes. 'The time seems right for a fundamental review of (HM Inspectorate of Constabulary's) functions, methods of operation and resources,' it says. The Home Office knows little about how police resources are deployed, how officers spend their time and what standards of performance are achieved, the NAO says. Although the Home Office collects information to promote value for money in police forces, the data are not used systematically. The NAO recognises that the Home Secretary has limited powers to interfere in the operations of the provincial police forces.

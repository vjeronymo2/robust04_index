			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Ousted Afghan leader set to leave for India: Guerrilla groups claim control of almost all cities PREPARATIONS were under way last night for ousted president Najibullah to leave Afghanistan after spending five days under the shelter of the United Nations. The Indian government said arrangements had been made for Najibullah to arrive in New Delhi, but could not say when or whether he would do so. In Kabul, Mr Benon Sevan, special representative of UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, said negotiations were continuing to allow Najibullah to leave. Mujahideen guerrillas claimed to control all major cities except Kabul, the capital, as the transfer of power from government forces to rebel groups continued. No violence was reported as government forces attempted to strike deals with the guerrillas they have been fighting for 13 years. Officials in Kabul told Reuters news agency that the city of Jalalabad, east of the capital, was still in government control but its commander was negotiating the formation of a coalition with the rebels. Kandahar, a key southern city, was in the hands of a coalition of mujahideen guerrillas and the local commander. Najibullah, the formerly Soviet-backed leader, was toppled last week by his own generals and ministers as government forces' resistance to the advancing guerrillas crumbled. He tried to leave on Thursday but was turned back by troops at Kabul airport. After his removal, Najibullah was denounced by his former close associate, Mr Abdul Wakil, the foreign minister, as a hated dictator who must be handed over to the law. Mr Sevan has been seeking for months to arrange the peaceful transfer of power from Najibullah to a council including mujahideen representatives. Talks on the composition of such a council are still going on in Peshawar, Pakistan, where many guerrilla groups are based. Diplomats in Kabul believed the ruling Watan party had decided that it would not oppose the formation of a mujahideen government as long as it was not dominated by hardline Islamic fundamentalists led by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. By negotiating, the party hoped to retain some influence. Mr Hekmatyar yesterday warned that his Hezb-i-Islami guerrilla group would attack Kabul unless the government capitulated by April 26. His forces are massed to the south of the capital. Those loyal to Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, a rival leader, are mainly to the north. Mr Wakil said Mr Masood had given an assurance his forces would not attack Kabul while talks with him were in progress. A Pakistani government official said, however, that Mr Masood had sent messages to mujahideen leaders in Pakistan, telling them that he remained committed to setting up a mujahideen government in Kabul, and had no intention of joining members of Najibullah's regime. The Pakistan government announced that Mr Boutros Ghali, would arrive in Islamabad on Friday on a two-day visit for discussions on the situation in Afghanistan.</p>

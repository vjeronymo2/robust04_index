			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "It Behooves One To Help Another"] </F>   [Text] On 28 March, this newspaper carried a newsletter  entitled "The Affection and Tears of a Foster Mother of Korean  Minority," and a commentary entitled "Everyone Comes To Give  Some Love," attracting attention and strong responses from the  broad masses of readers. On the Harbin-Beijing No. 18 express  train, in the Harbin Railway Bureau, in the Heilongjiang Grain  Bureau, in Shenzhen, by the south China coast...people are  trying to show they care by donating money. Before this, on 22  March, this newspaper carried an article entitled "Live Like  `Father'" reporting on Xiang Shixin and his wife in Shenyang,  who, though earning a moderate income, financially supported a  youth in school who was neither a relative nor an old friend,  also causing strong responses from readers. Similar stories  have often been carried by newspapers recently, making people  feel that a warm current of love and offering is flowing in the  vast motherland, spreading to millions of households, and  encouraging billions of people. In the 1990's, the fine social  habit of "one helping another" is still striking deep roots in  the Chinese soil.    In the big family on our motherland, no matter where you  live, what you do, or what ethnic group you belong to, everyone  is the builder of the socialist undertaking, and has common  interests, ideals, undertakings, and pursuits. When people are  as close as brothers, love one another, and help one another, we  will increase the nation's cohesive force and form a strong  integrating force for invigorating the Chinese nation. In  society, there is always a group of people who are comparatively  poor or very poor, who are leading a comparatively difficult or  very difficult life, and who sometimes even slip into a very  dangerous situation and badly need the help of other people.  "One helping another" is required by our socialist system, as  well as a duty to be performed by every person who has a sense  of social responsibility and a sense of righteousness. A  majority of people in society are doing so. However, in a  certain period, some people were influenced by mammonism and  thoughts of extreme individualism, so they turned a blind eye to  other people's difficulties, and turned a deaf ear to other  people's call for help. When a hooligan insulted a woman, they  stood aside to watch....When a child fell into the water and  shouted for help, a man first demanded money....The terrible  indifference and the extreme selfishness made them throw away  the minimum social responsibility and morals needed for being a  man. People of various social quarters expressed righteous  indignation and condemnation on this situation and strongly  hoped to change it.    Indeed, as we diligently build the socialist market economy  system, it has become an urgent and important duty for us to  vigorously strengthen spiritual civilization construction in the  whole society. If this problem is not solved properly, it will  certainly affect social stability and hinder the smooth process  of reform, opening up, and modernization construction.  Spiritual civilization rests mainly on construction. Like  material civilization construction, spiritual civilization  construction must also begin from doing concrete things one  after another, solidly and persistently. The deeds of PLA  soldier Xu Honggan, the deeds of the Korean lady Bai Yulan, and  the deeds of many other advanced figures tell us that, amid  socialist spiritual civilization construction, the heroic and  moving deeds by the broad masses show the truly commendable  spirit of dedication, as well as historical initiatives.    In our Chinese nation's history of civilization of several  thousand years, respect for the elderly and care for the young,  rescuing people in danger and helping the poor, taking up the  cudgels for a just cause, and laying down one's life for a just  cause, are the traditional virtues praised by the people. In  the 70-year history of our party leading the people to engage in  revolution and construction, care for others, taking pleasure in  helping others, considering others first, sacrificing oneself  for public interest, and "eight sides coming to the aid of one  side when it has trouble" are outstanding habits which have won  hearts and minds. In the new historical period, if we can  develop our nation's traditional virtues, uphold our party's  outstanding work style, borrow helpful experiences from foreign  countries, explore behavioral and moral norms which have the  features of the day, and combine all these organically into one,  then we can create a world- renowned socialist spiritual  civilization with Chinese characteristics.    When we reflect on the reports of these moving stories, we  find that mass media have played an important role. So long as  we can give full play to the characteristics and strong points  of public opinion work, encourage healthy trends, and criticize  evil tendencies, we can increase the number of people who like  to give and help, and we can decrease the number of those who  are extremely selfish and care only about themselves, so that  social atmosphere will continue to improve. Journalists have  great room to maneuver in the area of guiding people with the  correct public opinion and molding people with lofty spirit.  This newspaper wishes to join hands and walk side by side with  brother units, to continue to work hard.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Barber ruling put to the test  -European Court Preliminary opinions were given recently by the European Court of Justice in two test cases arising out of the Barber judgment on the equalisation of pensions. The court is examining the compatibility of methods of pension equalisation adopted by occupational pension funds post-Barber with equal pay rules. The first case concerned the occupational pension fund of Avdel Systems and focused on the equalisation of benefits in 1991 referred to the ECJ by the Bedford industrial tribunal. The second involved similar questions from the Hague cantonal court concerning equalisation of the pensionable age for employees of the Royal Dutch Shell group occupational pension fund in 1985. Advocate General Walter Van Gerven said it followed from Barber that sex discrimination in occupational pension schemes must be abolished. The central question in the present cases was whether and, if so to what extent, an occupational pension scheme can equalise pension ages to take account of Barber by raising the pensionable age for women rather than lowering it for men. Each of the pension schemes had chosen to raise the normal pensionable age for women which meant female employees in future had to remain longer at work to gain a full occupational pension. In the Avdel case, the ECJ was asked whether it was inconsistent with the equal pay rules for an employer to replace different normal pension ages for men and women of 65 for benefits received in respect of particular periods of service. These include: after the date of equalisation on July 1 1991; before the date of equalisation, but after May 17 1990 (the date of the Barber judgment); and before May 17 1990. In the Dutch case, the equalisation was in 1985 before Barber and the pensionable ages were raised from 55 to 60. In response, the Advocate General said the ECJ should rule that it was not contrary to the equal pay rules for an employer to raise the pensionable age for women rather than lowering it for men in respect of future periods of service after Barber and after the date of equalisation. EU law does not preclude a reduction of benefits provided that the level of benefit is the same for male and female employees. To rule otherwise would amount to an undesirable interference in a policy area presently within the competence of member countries. European law also does not preclude such equalisation applying to periods of service completed before Barber. But, in respect of periods of service between May 17 1990 and the equalisation date (where later), it is necessary to increase the level of benefits of the disadvantaged sex because those rules form the only valid frame of reference for direct enforcement of the principle of equal treatment, pending the adoption of new rules to remove the discrimination. In answer to other questions from the national courts, the Advocate General said that there was no obligation on the employer to minimise the adverse consequences to women whose benefits are affected by the employer's decision to eliminate the difference in pension ages. In particular, an employer was not permitted to maintain transitional arrangements agreed before Barber under which a limited group of females enjoyed a lower pensionable age of 55, while the age for men was 60, with regard to periods of service after May 17 1990, as in the Dutch case. However, an employer could only justify a cut in benefits paid to women during the period after Barber and before equalisation in exceptional circumstances. It is for the national court or tribunal to assess whether factors which have no connection with sex discrimination and which represent a need relating to the existence of the business or the solvency of its occupational pension scheme justify a restrictive implementation of the principle of equal treatment. But they must ensure the principle of equal treatment is not restricted unnecessarily.

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Slovaks pick new premier Former Slovak foreign minister Jozef Moravcik was chosen by a coalition of five parties yesterday to replace the deposed Mr Vladimir Meciar as prime minister, presidential spokesman Jan Findra said. President Michal Kovac had approved the nomination, the spokesman said. Mr Meciar (pictured left), independent Slovakia's first prime minister, was ousted in a vote of no confidence on Friday after bickering with President Kovac and a stream of dismissals and resignations by ministers and members of his own party. Mr Moravcik was chosen by the leaders of the broad coalition following negotiations. He is expected to deliver a new government list to President Kovac for approval within days. He was Czechoslovakia's last foreign minister under the federal system which split into independent Czech and Slovak states in January 1993. A former member of Mr Meciar's party, he defected to form a breakaway faction in February.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 179(a), unless the state corrects the deficiency, one of the two sanctions listed in section 179(b) must be imposed 18 months after a finding is made, and the second must be imposed 6 months after the first sanction is imposed, if the deficiency remains uncorrected. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, USEPA may apply both sanctions after 18 months if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of the state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On October 1, 1993, U.S. EPA proposed a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under section 179 of the Act. 58 FR 51270. The rule proposes that the offset sanction apply first and the highway funding sanction apply second. According to the proposed rule, U.S. EPA may change this sequence of sanctions through individual notice-and-comment rulemaking. This proposed sequencing applies only to mandatory sanctions that apply under section 179(a) and does not govern sanctions imposed under section 110(m).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although section 179(a) establishes mandatory deadlines for the application of sanctions at certain points after a finding of deficiency, section 110(m) provides USEPA with the discretion to impose section 179(b) sanctions at any time (or at any time after) a section 179(a) finding. Likewise, although mandatory sanctions under section 179 are limited to the area with the deficiency, section 110(m) authorizes USEPA to apply discretionary sanctions to any portion of the state that USEPA deems reasonable and appropriate to ensure that the requirements of the Act are met. See 57 FR 44534, 44536&hyph;44537. However, the Act requires USEPA to establish by rule criteria to ensure that such sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable implementation plan are principally responsible for the deficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 28, 1992, USEPA proposed criteria under section 110(m) that it would use when proposing statewide sanctions to determine if one or more political subdivisions is principally responsible for a SIP deficiency. 57 FR 44534. These proposed criteria are discussed later in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to Illinois, USEPA is using its discretionary authority under section 110(m) to propose early sanctions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  based on Illinois' failure to submit a complete I/M program. USEPA is taking this action for two reasons: (1) Congress required timely submittal of I/M programs as a measure central to allowing the State's metropolitan areas to meet CAA deadlines and any legislative delay threatens the State's ability to meet those deadlines, and (2) enhanced I/M is the single most effective air pollution control measure available. Delayed legislative approval of an acceptable I/M program places a disproportionate burden for cleaning the air on the State's major industrial sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. EPA issued a letter on December 30, 1993, finding that the state's failed to submit a SIP revision as required by the Act. Mandatory sanctions under section 179(a) were triggered by issuance of the letter notifying the state of the finding of the deficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Finding Under Section 179(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated previously, on December 30, 1993, USEPA Region 5 issued a letter notifying the State of its failure to submit a complete SIP revision on November 15, 1993, as required by the Act. USEPA's letter constitutes a finding under section 179(a) that triggers EPA's discretionary authority to impose the sanctions proposed in this notice under section 110(m). Further, on December 2, 1993, USEPA proposed to disapprove the I/M committal SIP containing Illinois' commitment to adopt and submit both basic and enhanced I/M programs meeting the requirements of the Act and USEPA's I/M regulation by November 15, 1993. Illinois has now failed to adopt and submit such programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If sufficient progress has not been made by Illinois toward the implementation of an approvable I/M program to be operational on or before January 1, 1995, EPA hereby announces its intention to impose sanctions on May 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Rationale and Approach for Section 110(m) Sanctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(m) of the Act allows USEPA to apply the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and the 2:1 emission offset sanction at any time (or at any time after) it makes a finding under section 179(a). Based on its finding dated December 30, 1993, USEPA is proposing to impose both the Federal highway funding assistance limitations and 2:1 emission offset sanctions. USEPA believes that the imposition of both sanctions is appropriate because of Illinois' failure to submit a complete SIP revision to enhance its existing vehicle I/M program. In the absence of improved vehicle I/M, the ability of the State's metropolitan areas to meet the CAA deadlines for attaining healthy air quality is severely compromised. As previously noted, I/M programs are the single most effective air pollution control measures available and delayed legislative approval of an acceptable program further burdens major industrial sources of air pollution with responsibility for cleaning the air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Observer: Gone before 'Is CSFB's Rudloff the man for the 1990s?' asks the cover of the latest Euromoney. Alas he isn't CSFB's Rudloff any more. He is being booted up to executive board of CS Holding, Credit Suisse First Boston's majority shareholder, and replaced by David Mulford, the former US Treasury official. This career switch doesn't seem to have been foreseen by Rudloff when he was interviewed in December. Asked if he fancied a change, he replied 'Perhaps. But there is still so much to build here.' Yet it is hard to believe that the chain-smoking Rudloff - the most feared and respected man in the history of the Euromarkets - will actually withdraw from deal- making merely by going to Switzerland. Besides having the market in his blood, he has been deeply involved in the business regardless of geography, dividing every week for a decade between London, Geneva and Zurich. One lucky break for Rudloff, however, is that he avoids the firm's dreaded move to London's Docklands on Monday morning.</p>

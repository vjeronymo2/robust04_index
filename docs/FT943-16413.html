			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Blair aims to shift Labour stance on schools Mr Tony Blair began yesterday to reposition Labour's education policy by stressing the party's commitment to higher standards, greater parental involvement in schools and published assessments of children's progress. The front-runner for the party leadership also unveiled a range of ideas designed to underpin the case for putting a radical extension of educational opportunity at the heart of the party's political prospectus. In the latest of a series of speeches setting out his agenda, Mr Blair said the key to modernising the education system was 'high investment, high expectations and high performance for all and by all'. Describing education as the foundation of a healthy society and of a wealthy economy, Mr Blair said Labour would make a reality of lifetime education and training to equip individuals to meet the demands of economic and social change. He gave strong backing to universal nursery education and floated a new scheme under which 'teacher associates' from business and local communities would inject more expertise into school classrooms. Mr Blair also called for the development of 'individual learning accounts' to draw a single thread through a continuous process of education and training between childhood and retirement. But the political significance of the speech lay in a strong emphasis throughout on the importance of discipline and high standards of teaching and a responsive attitude to the preoccupations of parents. Acknowledging implicitly that Labour has traditionally been seen to represent the interests of teachers more than of children and parents, he said the profession must recognise the need for a partnership with parents. Labour 'must stand up for the highest standards in all schools, with good discipline, highly motivated and highly performing teachers and the maximum involvement by parents'. Accusing the Conservatives of discrediting the process of testing, Mr Blair insisted that Labour must nonetheless provide a 'proper basis of both assessing pupils and allowing parents access to the greatest amount of information'. Mr Blair brushed aside in a single paragraph the debate within his party over whether it should restore grant-maintained schools to local authority control. He said the interest of local communities must be balanced against the desire of parents, teachers and governors to have the power to make decisions for individual schools.</p>

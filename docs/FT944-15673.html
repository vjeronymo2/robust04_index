			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (17): A change of image in the US - Growing interest in two-way radio paging services Radio paging, perhaps the least glamourous area of the telecoms industry, is set for its own star turn in the US, thanks to a series of auctions of radio spectrum, staged by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in the summer. The commission succeeded in raising over Dollars 600m from companies eager to bid against one another to acquire a new allocation of radio frequencies that will enable the winners to offer - for the first time, anywhere - two-way paging services. The auction exceeded expectations and attracted bidders from outside the confines of the paging industry: two of the most successful were KDM Messaging, a wholly-owned subsidiary of McCaw Cellular, America's largest cellular operator which has been taken over by AT&amp;T, the largest telecoms company in the world; and - among others - Destineer, a new company which has the backing of the software giant, Microsoft. Both companies appreciated how two-way services go beyond the limitations of the staid, limited-revenue potential of existing paging systems. New systems allow users to make and receive data messages and paging - sold as one of the new range of interactive multimedia services. Destineer and AirTouch, one of the largest cellular operators in the US and a one-way paging operator which also bid successfully for some of the new frequencies, are looking at similar applications: both want to use two-way paging as way to invigorate the market for personal digital assistants (PDAs), the personal organiser-messaging devices launched last year by various manufacturers, including Apple Computers and AT&amp;T. Initial sales of the Apple Newton Messagepad were disappointing; and AT&amp;T's EO has been withdrawn from sale. However, AirTouch in particular believes that PDAs can succeed if pitched at a business rather than consumer audience. The company is already using its existing paging network for trials to a PDA manufactured by the electronics company Casio and will extend the service to its new two-way frequencies next year. AirTouch is also looking at new, industrial applications for paging such as a monitoring device which would be sold to suppliers of vending machines. A radio device, fitted inside a vending system, would emit a signal when it was time for restocking, thus saving the time and expense of regular checks by the vending machine supplier. All five of the US companies licensed by the FCC are looking at similar new ways of widening paging's appeal and increasing its already substantial penetration in the US - where, incidentally, eight per cent of the population owns a pager. By comparison, in Europe, only three per cent of the population are pager-users; there is also greater market pressure in Europe as the cost of using cellular phones continues to fall. Cellular, particularly since the arrival of digital phones based on the pan-European GSM standard, would swamp the European paging industry unless it can maintain its price differential or explore more advanced applications. Two initiatives in paging during the past year demonstrate the way that European industry is getting to grips with the challenge: First, there was the launch of the MiniCall service last year by Sweden's state-owned mobile operator, Telia Mobiltel. This has had a significant influence on the marketing strategies of other European operators. MiniCall is known as a 'CPP' service which stands for 'calling party pays.' In other words, the tariff burden is shifted from the pager-user - who buys the pager but no longer pays a one-off connection fee or monthly rental charges - to the caller who wants to leave a message. Instead of a standard local call tariff, the caller is charged at a premium-rate for leaving a message. The lost revenue from connection and subscription charges is more than made up by increased contribution from call charges, according to Telia Mobiltel. The Swedish model was closely studied by other-operators including BT and Mercury who launched their own versions of the service this autumn. BT gave their service an extra twist by offering it with the UK's first wristwatch pager, manufactured by Swatch. Secondly, an important innovation in Europe this year has been the launch of digital paging services. Based on an European Commission-backed standard called Ermes (European radio messaging system), the system had several technical setbacks following interference to television sets in Germany, before its launch in France. Several other European operators are to start Ermes services in the near future; Telia Mobitel will launch its Minicall Europe service in the first quarter of 1995. Initially, Ermes terminals will be significantly more expensive than today's pagers but they will offer a wider range of services. The system transmits messages faster and is capable of including more text in each message. Futhermore, users are able to receive messages electronically from computers on Ermes pagers. Ermes' main advantage over existing paging systems is that, as a common European standard, it is possible for the first time to receive messages across Europe. As the equivalent digital technology to cellular's GSM, which now has nearly 3m subscribers in Europe, Ermes must make a similar impression if paging is to shake off its dowdy image.</p>

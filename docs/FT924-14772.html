			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Technology: Aladdin's cave - Andrew Baxter explains why the east German engineering sector is a mine of metal expertise Discovering signs of life in the east German machine tool industry is almost as hard as finding traces of the Berlin wall, whose overnight dismemberment has turned whole sectors of manufacturing into mere shadows of their former selves. An industry which in 1990 ranked ninth in the world with production worth more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) has seen employment fall from about 100,000 before reunification to 15,000-18,000. But the collapse is only half the story. Among west European machine tool builders, the perception of the east German industry was as a producer of solid, unexciting machines, mechanically sound but with outdated control systems, and tawdry, unproductive factories. Much of the manufacturing capacity has now been swept away along with the industry's markets in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. And there has been little reason for west German machine tool builders to make acquisitions - they have enough problems of their own and do not need extra manufacturing capacity. Even in a recession, however, machine tool companies are interested in technologies which have the potential to transform the economics of one of the industries to which they provide manufacturing equipment. Such is the case with Bad Duben Profilwalzmaschinen, based in the spa town of Bad Duben near Leipzig. A few months after reunification, the company was purchased by Germany's Pittler Group, one of the world's largest machine tool companies. The main attraction of Bad Duben for Pittler was its development of ring rolling, a technology that is often viewed as a holy grail in industries such as the bearing sector which uses accurate, hard-wearing rings in high quantities. Ring rolling has been around for about 15 years, and for ring producers offers an alternative to machining. Instead of using a turning centre to cut a ring from a blank, a section of steel tube is loaded on to a mandrel - a cylindrical rod around which metal is shaped. When the mandrel rolls it expands the blank into its correct shape against a profile forming roll, with a smaller round rolling unit to control roundness (see graphic). There are disadvantages in the process. The original ring has to be extremely accurate, which requires some initial work in a lathe, and there are size limitations. Bad Duben's URWA 100 machine will produce rings up to 120mm but, with Pittler's encouragement, is now developing larger capacity models up to 250mm. But the process is fast - as little as three seconds per ring - and the end product has an accurate, high-quality finish that, says Pittler, reduces the need for finish grinding. And, perhaps most importantly, the forming process can increase the component's performance by up to 50 per cent, raising the possibility of using lighter bearings to do the same job. It is partly because metal-forming can improve the quality and strength of a previously low-grade material that the entire eastern bloc is an 'Aladdin's cave' for R&amp;D of cold-forming techniques, says Peter Standring, senior lecturer at Nottingham University's Department of Manufacturing Engineering. A second reason for the eastern bloc's prowess in metal-forming, he says, was the central control of its machine tool industries. Ideas from universities would be given to sin-gle, large companies to develop. This was what happened at Bad Duben, which began work on ring-rolling in 1982 in collaboration with a Dresden academic. The company was founded in 1943 and gained many years of experience in the technology of cold forming. By 1989 it was a world leader in machines for rolling rings, screws and gear parts used in the automotive, aerospace and other industries. It also, naturally, had some of the ideological baggage that bedevilled east European industry and stifled its products' market potential. Unwilling to talk to western companies which it feared were after its secrets, it was allowed to talk only to the Koreans and Japanese - and ended up seeing some of its ideas copied. After the fall of the Berlin wall, the Rothenberger brothers who control Pittler were among the first to make contact with the east German machine tool industry. Bad Duben had been identified as a target in 1988-89. 'We thought it would make a good addition to our range,' says Dieter Weidemann, chairman of Pittler. The group has also regained indirect control of Drema, a Leipzig-based producer of multi-spindle autos founded in 1889 by the original Wilhelm von Pittler, and is discussing a third takeover. Since its takeover Bad Duben's profile has been transformed - the west has taken over from eastern Europe as its biggest market, although volumes are much lower. For Pittler, the main task now is to develop Bad Duben's ring-rolling technology further, and its markets for this and other products in the west. Ring-rolling is not unique to Bad Duben, but the company claims to be ahead of its competitors in solving some of the technique's inherent disadvantages. It is working, for example, on a process for rolling asymmetrical shapes, which could be ready in the next two years. According to Standring, Bad Duben's technology is excellent, but ring-rolling will be able to match the economics of conventional turning only for high-value added components. The tubing for the original blank costs more than a solid blank, and there is not much to be gained in speed when compared with modern automated turning machines, he says. But the process could be attractive to producers of bearing rings designed for applications where quality is paramount, such as in aerospace. The challenge for Pittler is to convince the bearing industry of the benefits of Bad Duben's ring-rolling technology. This is not easy during a recession that is making bearing producers wary about making equipment purchases, and in an industry that is coalescing around a handful of major producers. But if a bearing producer fears that a competitor could gain a permanent cost advantage, it could be forced to follow suit. Unfortunately, though, the bearing industry is fanatically secretive about its manufacturing technology, and Pittler and Bad Duben might then find themselves having to keep a low profile.</p>

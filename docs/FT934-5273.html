			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (13): Sex and the class struggle WEATHERING THE STORM: WORKING-CLASS FAMILIES FROM THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TO THE FERTILITY DECLINE by Wally Seccombe Verso, Pounds 34.95 286 pages IN 1973, Aldo Brandirali, Secretary of the Italian Marxist-Leninist Party gave this advice in the party's official sex guidelines: 'Sex without class consciousness cannot give satisfaction, even if it is repeated until infinity.' Now, in Wally Seccombe's difficult book on working-class families and the fertility decline, Weathering The Storm, it is not the sex but the class consciousness which is infinitely repeated. Seccombe continues from his Millennium of Family Change: Feudalism to Capitalism in Western Europe by looking at working-class families from the 19th and early 20th centuries throughout two industrial revolutions. In the late 19th century, technological improvements coincided with a decline in birth rates. The book looks at wages, family structures, prosperity and the relationship between working and living conditions. It is an inquiry of broad scope and interdisciplinary method; but the effort required outstrips the rewards gained in reading it. Seccombe places family activity (reproduction, sustaining, rest) at the heart of what he calls 'historical materialism's central theoretical category.' Crudely, if a Marxist historian wants to account for work and behaviour in the working-class family and at the same time wants to assume that the labouring classes are defined by the ruling classes, he will need some notion of how the working-class family evolves itself. Seccombe has the answer: 'In order to recognise the deeply reciprocal nature of this equilibration, and to gauge its resilience or vulnerability, we must eschew structuralist-functionalist models in which the prevailing mode of production determines, in a full or sufficient sense, the familial reproduction of its labouring classes.' And he sets off to explore 'the potential utility of this revised paradigm for Marxist inquiry' throughout the next 200 pages of theory and abstraction. In spite of the difficulty of Seccombe's style, the book has a tight logic which draws out the initial hypotheses into expanded sections. The section on 'The Fetishism of the Wage Form and the Concealment of Domestic Labour' has the familiar air of a male professional academic feeling guilty because one of the pioneers in the area, Marx in this case, was just not feminist enough. The disadvantage of Seccombe's method is that, while academically prudent, he is empirically jumbled, always carrying on a debate with unseen detractors while at the same time delivering facts and figures which non-implicated readers would find useful. The best chapters are the final two, where Seccombe meets his poor monosyllabic sources face to face. He looks at patterns of earning in the second industrial revolution (broadly, around 1870 to 1914) when gas, chemicals and electricity made a technological impact on an England which had readied itself for change by building the railways in the 1850s. Here Seccombe has testimony from women managing on meagre resources and committed to feeding husband and children first. The last chapter charts the decline of 'proletarian fertility' from 1890 to 1920 by looking at abortion, birth-control and abstinence. Here, Seccombe draws on collections of letters to The Women's Cooperative Guild and to Marie Stopes between 1910 and 1920. At this point, the theory slackens its relentless grip on Seccombe's material, and individual cries of hurt, need, pain or joy are heard. This chapter is much more in line with another book in the same social history series, Franciose Barrett-Ducrocq's fine Love in the Time of Victoria: Sexuality, Class and Gender in Nineteenth-Century London which focuses on evidence from hospital and charity archives.</p>

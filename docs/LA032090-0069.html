			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> STATE FUNDS STUDY OF ETHNIC LIBRARY USE  </P> <P> Cheryl Duran of Camarillo has received a $41,457 grant from the California  State Library to study how American Indians, Latinos and Asian-Americans use  the library as a resource.  </P> <P> Duran, assistant dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Library and Information  Science, said the grant will be used for a yearlong study examining whether  members of those ethnic groups throughout Southern California use the library  as a primary resource or instead go first to authority figures within their  communities.  </P> <P> For example, Duran, who is Cherokee, said members of the Indian community will  often go to an elder in the tribe when seeking information.  </P> <P> The study will compile the names of such people, and librarians will work with  those community sources to improve library services for the various ethnic  groups.  </P> <P> The study will also examine limited English-speaking skills as a factor in  library use.  </P> <P> Duran will oversee the study, which will be conducted by a doctoral student and  other research students from UCLA's library program, she said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 7 June, 12 enterprises in our  province received the nameplate of a window enterprise for  supervision of administrative law enforcement from the  provincial legislative affairs bureau. They have thus become  the first batch of units conducting experiments in supervision  of administrative law enforcement to protect enterprises'  legitimate rights and interests and standardize the government's  administrative behavior.    At present, as we are developing the socialist [words  indistinct] economic management departments and monopolistic  trades turn power into a commodity by using the power in their  hands and their monopolistic status. These unhealthy practices  or corrupt phenomena have done serious harm to the inviolability  of the law and the authority of the government. To further  strengthen supervision of law enforcement and protect  enterprises' legitimate rights and interests, the provincial  Legislative Affairs Bureau decided to set up pilot window  enterprises to supervise and administer law enforcement across  the province in light of the realities. Through extensive  investigations and consultations, the bureau decided to  designate 12 representative enterprises, including the Xining  Steelworks and the Qinghai Bank of Agriculture, as the first  batch of window enterprises to supervise and administer law  enforcement.    Xu Tongqing, deputy director of [words indistinct] of the  provincial people's congress; Lan Faliang, deputy secretary  general of the provincial government; Yang Miaoling, director of  the provincial legislative affairs bureau; and other comrades  issued nameplates to the 12 enterprises. At the  nameplate-issuing ceremony, they stressed: All window  enterprises should expose and report administrative law  violations, particularly administrative power-for-money  behavior, promptly and accurately provide administrative  law-enforcement information, especially administrative  power-for-money information to judicial organs, and help the  latter do a good job of cleaning up window enterprises. At the  same time, they should study and abide by the law, standardize  their own behavior with the law, and strive to be models in  observing discipline and abiding by the law.    It has been learned that since the implementation of the  supervision of administrative law enforcement, the provincial  legislative affairs bureau will further expand the number of the  window enterprises when conditions permit and continuously  deepen the supervision of administrative law enforcement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mastram Kapur: "Will Mulayam Work to Fulfill </F> Peoples' Expectations?"]    [Text] Generally the whole nation has welcomed the SP-BSP  [Samajwadi- Bahujan Samaj Party] government in Uttar Pradesh.  Except for some fundamentalist elements who are badly shaken by  this total change in the low castes after centuries, everyone  should be happy . In a society divided by stratification, the  confrontation does not take place between those sitting on the  top rung with those on the bottom rung. The confrontation  usually happens between those sitting on adjoining rungs--first  with second, second with third, and third with the fourth. There  had been some confrontations between the backward classes and  the scheduled castes. A cooperation between these groups heralds  major changes, and these changes can convert a ladder-like  system to a flat social system. The BSP-SP coalition can be a  strong platform for the claim that the BSP leader Kanshi Ram has  made about changing the vertical system to a horizontal system.    The skepticism expressed by some people about the stability  of this coalition keeping in mind the traditional confrontation  is not unjustified, but is pessimistic. The optimistic view  point would be that history has taken a turn, and this change  could be the beginning of a major historic transformation.    These Vidhan Sabha elections, which can be called mini  general elections, have given some clear signals which, if read  correctly, can indicate the path of the future of our politics.  The first important signal is that the 1990 division of the  Janata Dal was unreal and unnecessary, and the unity of various  Janata Dal factions, under whatever name, is the need of the  time. The Janata Dal in Bihar and Orissa, the Samajwadi Party in  Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Janata Dal in Haryana, and other  smaller parties in other states all represent the socialist  movement and the desires of the farmers and laborers. This  movement is inspired by the desire to change centuries-old  unfair social system into an equitable system. Because of their  personal ambitions and the conspiracies of the opposing forces,  they were divided even when they agreed as it happened during  the 1967-70, 1977-79, and 1989-91 periods. The anti-national  communal forces that ignore the Constitution were able to gain  power because of this internal strife. The Congress (I) had been  able to rule at will because of the weakness of this movement,  and this made our nation's situation very precarious. Therefore,  keeping in mind out nation's interests, these divided groups  must unite.    The second point made by this election was that politics of  such useless issues as temple-mosque cannot always work. They  must raise the issues that the people confront daily. The people  are being squeezed by high prices and are tormented by the  corruption spread throughout government offices. They are  suffering from lack of electricity, water, health, and other  amenities and from unemployment. All constitutional institutions  are corroding. All services for the people (mail,  transportation, distribution of services, health, education, and  police) are now very unstable. The people will turn away from a  political party that ignores these issues and tries to kick  around unnecessary issues to take advantage of them.    Another signal issued by this mini general election is that  the politics of those who make up parties in thin air will not  be successful now. The tragedy of the Janata Dal has been that  it had good leaders but they could never unite. No political  party can function effectively without first organizing itself  at grassroots levels of district, county, and state. In  addition, the structure of the party will not be strong without  the support of such sub-groups as youth, women, labor-student  organizations, and organization of creative camps for the  training of the party workers. The Janata Dal became weak  because of the appointment of party officials through  nomination, search for candidates and workers at the time of the  general elections, and last minute efforts to find money for  election expenses. Every party members understands this problem  and we do not need to provide any proof of it. Opposed to it,  the secret of Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party's success is that  he worked hard for two years. He visited every part of the  state, organized camps for training his workers (in the five-day  camp in Mussoorie, about 1,000 boys and girls had participated),  and maintained contact with all the workers. He has to focus on  building a good structure of the party for a lasting success.    The main reason the eyes of the whole nation will be focused  on Uttar Pradesh is to see how the Mulayam Singh-Kanshi Ram  government operates. Will it follow the old system, or will it  be innovative? The people will have this question in their minds  because the style of change agents is different from the status  quo type of parties. The SP-BSP coalition has already expressed  its commitment to change. The change should not be immediate and  superficial; it should be long-term and fundamental. The  attitude of the Congress (I) and the BJP governments is to  disrupt the status quo minimally, because change is dangerous to  their existence. We saw that during the anti-Mandal campaign.  However, the status quo can be dangerous to parties that herald  change. These parties will self-destruct if their tendency for  change is fake, have the goal just to somehow stay in power, and  avoid breaking up the old died traditions. That is what happened  to the V.P. Singh government at the Center in 1990-91. It spent  the nine months of its duration wondering whether it should  carry out the Mandal Commission recommendations, and whether it  should make a solid political decision over the Babri Masjid-Ram  Janambhumi issue. It formed committees after committees, and  questions were postponed. In the end, this policy of  procrastination drowned it.    The positive aspect of the SP-BSP government is that the  issues such as temple and Mandal that incite people are dormant  now. The Supreme Court has given its decision on the Mandal  issue and it will be implemented easily. The temple issue is  also in the Supreme Court and the BJP will continue its efforts  to keep this issue alive. However, this issue can be dealt with  logically without any problem. In the Mandal application,  following the Karpuri Thakur formula would be useful because  this formula proved to help unite the backward castes in Bihar.    The main criterion for Mulayam Singh-Kanshi Ram government's  success will be how diligently is it able to carry out the  developmental plans in Uttar Pradesh that have been neglected  for years. They do not have to depend on the Center for  reformation in such areas as supply of electricity and water,  roads and transportation system, health and education, and  efficiency of government offices. However, the people will feel  relieved if actual work is done in these areas. The people of  this country are simple like Lord Shiva who was happy with the  flowers of dhatura (intoxicating plant). Their needs are very  few and their worldly desires are not unlimited like the  societies that are slaves of the consumer culture. Still, these  people yearn hopelessly for these small comforts and minor  reliefs. This shows that this nation never had a government of  the people. It will be the responsibility of the SP-BSP  government to make the people feel that it is the government of  the people.    However, the most important responsibility for Mulayam Singh  and Kanshi Ram will be to remove the bitterness felt by various  groups in the society against each other and creation of an  environment of acceptance and good will. This bitterness is a  natural outcome of the efforts to break up the caste system. All  this had started when the Constitution was written and  implemented. This process has been going on slowly and invisibly  since the Constitution promised equal political, social, and  economic rights to every citizen, and gave them the assurance of  freedom, equality, and brotherhood. These changes have finally  begun to emerge in concrete form. The society conditioned to  living in one way for centuries is naturally to feel the pains  that come with change. This process can be made comfortable if  the political leaders form a policy of sympathy and cooperation.    Similar bitterness was felt here when the small kingdoms  were  phased out and the landlord system was ended. We passed that  phase easily thanks to the hard work of our dedicated leaders.  We need the same understanding and empathy during the period  when the caste system is being broken. Uttar Pradesh is the most  sensitive state from this perspective, and they must be  especially cautious here. The SP-BSP government has to be  careful here. We are happy to learn that the cabinet that  Mulayam Singh's has announced shows representation from all  caste groups. What flaws there are, can be removed later. This  government must refrain from the showing favors and taking  revenge. For the first time in history, scheduled castes and  backward groups have formed a government. It is natural for the  higher castes to have all kinds of misgivings. To remove these  suspicions, the SP-BSP government must debut the new politics of  impartiality, hard work, tolerance and wide-spread  collaboration.</p>

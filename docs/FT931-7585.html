			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / New Zealand to see 3% growth NEW ZEALAND'S economy should continue to grow by 2.5-3 per cent a year until 1994, with growth led by exports and increasingly supported by domestic demand, the OECD says in its latest survey. Low inflation and more efficient use of labour should lead to increasing international gains in competitiveness. But import demand is also likely to pick up, making further improvements in the current account difficult. The competitiveness gains follow a long and painful period of adjustment since 1984, and 'may provide a harbinger of stronger growth based on expanding the range and market share of New Zealand exports'. But there are risks which 'could deny this outcome', the greatest of which would be a deteriorating external environment. A slowdown in world economic activity or increasing trade protection abroad could adversely affect export revenues, either by depressing prices of traditional commodities exports or by limiting opportunities for other products. With high levels of public debt and sizeable projected budget deficits, the economy also remained exposed to adverse interest rate movements and other external shocks. The OECD noted the budget deficit in the year to June 1992 was 1 percentage point higher than projected, at 3.4 per cent of GDP. The government's finances were an area of concern, and continued spending restraint was essential. 'Given the high level of external debt, it is vital that the confidence of foreign investors in fiscal policy is maintained and any risk to long-term interest rates minimised.' The deficit was projected to rise in the current year, before falling to 2.7 per cent of GDP by 1994-1995. But this depended on a sustained recovery with inflation of 0-2 per cent. In a generally optimistic report, the OECD said the present policy environment in New Zealand would support a transition to faster growth, lower inflation, greater labour flexibility, stronger export performance and the growing international orientation of the business community. But greater attention should be paid to training, education and skills shortages.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 11 (CNA) -- A Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) official on Saturday [11 June] said the trial  of the three suspects charged with robbing and murdering 24  Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crewmen and guides aboard a  pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake was like a "play acted according  to a prepared script."    Hsu Hui-you, SEF's vice secretary-general, said that he  regretted that the trial, which ended with final prosecution and  defense statements on Saturday, was seriously flawed, and that  it only revealed Beijing's intention to summarily close the  case. He said that the complexity of the case meant it should  have been handled in a careful and thorough manner.    The court will announce the verdict Sunday.    Hsu said that key witnesses to the crime were not allowed to  testify, and that many of the questions raised by Taiwan  concerning the case remained unanswered.    The prosecutor asked the court to mete out the death penalty  to the three men because of the heinousness of their crime. The  defendants' lawyers asked for leniency, saying their clients had  shown deep regret for their crimes. The defendants, Wu Lihong,  Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun, all pleaded guilty, and did not defend  themselves when testifying. Yu did say, however, that he hoped  cross-strait relations would improve after sentencing is carried  out on him and the other two defendants.    Hsu was not as optimistic that the cross-strait relationship  would resume as it had been before the incident, saying that  scars would be left on the hearts of Taiwanese because of the  way Beijing handled the case.</p>

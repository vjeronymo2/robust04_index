			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> AMD Loses Patent Suit Over Chips: In a case that breaks new legal ground,  Advanced Micro Devices has lost a patent infringement lawsuit brought by  Brooktree Corp. of San Diego. A U.S. District Court jury found that AMD  violated three of Brooktree's patents and also infringed on the company's  rights to protect chip layout designs under a 1984 law. The Brooktree suit has  been closely watched as the first major test of the Semiconductor Chip  Protection Act, which made illegal the use of photographic techniques and other  forms of copying chip designs.  </P></p>

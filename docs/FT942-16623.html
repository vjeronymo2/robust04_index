			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / India reports 6.7% rise in industry output Industrial production in India rose 6.7 per cent in December compared with the same month a year earlier, according to figures published yesterday which offered fresh evidence that industry is seeing a steady recovery after two years of stagnation, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. The increase compares with a rise of just 2.4 per cent for the nine months to the end of December, said the government's central statistical organisation. The largest increase was registered by makers of machinery, which had previously suffered the steepest declines in output.</p>

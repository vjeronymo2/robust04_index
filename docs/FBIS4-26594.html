			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By the editorial group for the "Military Writings of Mao </F> Zedong": "Reveal Mao Zedong's Military Thinking in a Complete  and Comprehensive Manner -- A Brief Introduction to the  `Military Writings of Mao Zedong'"]    [Text] The newly published, six-volume Military  Writings of Mao Zedong (henceforth shortened as  Writings), totalling 2.67 million characters,  consists of 1,612 military cables, commands, reports, letters,  and theoretical works on military affairs written by Mao Zedong  between August 1927 and December 1972, most of them never  published before. The new publication is the most systematic  and comprehensive military work to date by Mao Zedong. It  documents in detail the founding of the Chinese People's  Liberation Army [PLA] from next to nothing, its development from  a small into a large army, and its outstanding war record; sheds  light on the formation, maturation, and development of Mao  Zedong's military thinking, vividly showing Mao Zedong's highly  successful troop maneuvers and brilliant art of military  command; and displays relatively comprehensively the theoretical  structure of Mao Zedong's military thinking. The work is Mao  Zedong's rich and valuable theoretical heritage for military  theory and philosophical thinking.    The first volume of the Writings contains  247 of Mao Zedong's military essays written during the Agrarian  Revolutionary War which highlight Mao Zedong's painstaking  exploration of a range of issues, such as carving out a path for  the Chinese Revolution, establishing a new type of people's  army, and people's war and its strategies and tactics.    After the fiasco of the 1927 Revolution, the CPC began to  probe seriously for a path for the Chinese Revolution. In his  "Speech at the Emergency Central Conference," "Outline of the  Hunan Movement," and "Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan Requires  Army Support," Mao Zedong puts forward explicitly the idea of  seizing political power by force and by combining peasants'  uprisings with military support. With the defeat of the Autumn  Harvest Uprising, Mao Zedong boldly pulled his insurgent army  back to rural areas, where the enemy's rule was weak, and  established a revolutionary power base in Jinggangshan, where he  built an "armed independent regime of workers and peasants." In  the "Writings," letters and papers, such as the "Letter to the  Central Committee Through the Good Offices of the Hunan and  Jiangxi Party Committees" and the 20 March and 5 April 1929  letters from the Red Fourth Army Front Committee to the Central  Committee, concentrate on probing for a theory to account for  "armed independent regimes of workers and peasants," and  policies and strategies on the struggle against the enemy.  The publication in early 1930 of A Single Spark Can  Start a Prairie Fire marked the formation of Mao Zedong's  basic theory on the path of the Chinese Revolution.    Mao Zedong made the most important theoretical and practical  contributions to the process of founding a new type of  proletarian revolutionary army. A range of key principles he  advanced during this time -- such as affirming party leadership  over the Army, the establishment of a democratic system within  the Army, the pursuit of the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and  Eight Points for Attention," the three assignments of combating,  fund raising, and mass work for the Red Army, strengthening  political education, and laying down correct military-political  relationships -- drew a fundamental line between the Red Army  and all the previous armies. Mao Zedong's "Letter to Lin Biao"  on 14 June 1929 is an important piece of literature on the  development of the People's Army, spelling out the basic  principles for a new type of army and paving the way for the  "Gutian Conference Resolutions." The Writings  prints the full text of the "Resolutions at the Ninth Congress  of the Fourth Army of the CPC Red Army" (that is "Gutian  Conference Resolutions"), which systematically sums up the  army-building experience since the founding of the Fourth Army  of the Red Army, and is a programmatic paper for the development  of the People's Army.    Exploring the warfare experience, which involved great  hardship, Mao Zedong came up with a whole set of strategies and  tactics tailored to the characteristics of China's Revolutionary  War. The Writings fully reflects the famous  "16-character formulation of military principles" -- that is  "when the enemy advances, we retreat; when the enemy camps, we  harass; when the enemy tires, we attack; when the enemy  retreats, we pursue" -- authored by Mao Zedong and Zhu De in the  early years of the Red Army, and the active defensive strategy  centered on "luring the enemy to penetrate deeply," which was  formulated during counter-campaigns against "encirclement and  suppression." During the counter-campaigns against  "encirclement and suppression" and strategic retreats, Mao  Zedong advanced many important military principles on troop  concentrations, mobile warfare, war of quick decision, and war  of annihilation.    As a distillation of the Red Army's decade-long experience  of  pitched battles, Mao Zedong's "Problems of Strategies for  China's Revolutionary War" displays a mature theoretical  structure spelling out in a systematic way the abovementioned  problems concerning strategies for China's Revolutionary War,  and moreover, examining their philosophical and methodological  implications. This marks the formation of Mao Zedong's  thought on military affairs.    The second volume of the Writings contains  244 essays written by Mao Zedong during the War of Resistance  Against Japan which highlight his theories, lines, principles,  and policies on the national united front in Resistance to  Japan, War of Total Resistance, protracted war, and guerrilla  warfare.    The War of Resistance Against Japan was advocated by the  CPC and pursued under the banner of Anti-Japanese National  United Front, itself based on the KMT-CPC Collaboration. Led by  Mao Zedong, the Chinese communists buried the hatchet; valued  the national cause above all; and made detailed plans for the  deployment of the Eighth-Route Army and New Fourth Army,  strategic unfolding, and the prosecution of war. Moreover, with  a positive attitude, they continuously made suggestions to the  KMT authorities about providing guidance on a national  anti-Japanese strategy. Essays such as "Cable to Chiang  Kai-shek on the Japanese Invasion of the Lugou Bridge," "On  National Defense," "On the Strategy for the North China Front,"  and "On Strategic Arrangements in North China Following the Loss  of Taiyuan" underscore problems in this area.    Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War" argues most forcefully for  the general principle of waging a protracted war, and was  immensely important in providing guidance to the Chinese people  in winning the final victory in the war against Japan.    Mao Zedong expounds fully on the strategic value of  guerrilla  warfare in the war against Japan in "On the Principles of  Warfare for the Red Army" and in many other essays. These  essays played a key role in the rapid development of guerrilla  warfare in the war against Japan.    One outstanding feature of army building in the war against  Japan was the insistence on party leadership and the guaranteed  political, ideological, and organizational independence of the  Army. Mao Zedong's systematic summing up and incisive analysis  of army building in the seventh party congress political report  raised thinking on army building to a new dimension.    An important part of the second volume of the  Works concerns correctly handling the national and  class contradictions in the war against Japan and the KMT-CPC  relationship. Early in the Anti-Japanese war period, the  Eighth-Route Army and the KMT Army were the two forces to bear  the brunt of fighting on the North China front. For a time, part  of the KMT Army came under the command of the Eighth-Route Army.  Regarding this group of KMT troops, Mao Zedong has this to say  in his cable to Zhu De and Peng Dehuai: "We should care about  and help them; they should not be assigned the most dangerous  missions, nor want for food and supplies" (p. 70). He also  instructed: "We should criticize constructively and make  suggestions about certain weaknesses with friendly parties and  armies, and should not laugh at and ridicule them" (p. 130).  After the fall of Wuhan in October 1938, the KMT diehards  pursued the policy of passive resistance against the Japanese,  but active fight against the communists, constantly creating  frictions with the communists. Mao Zedong laid down the policy  and measure of struggling against the diehards on just grounds,  based on our advantage, and with restraint adopted "a militarily  defensive position," and stressed "unification in fighting  against the Japanese" (p. 567) to counter the attacks by KMT  diehards. Led by Mao Zedong, our party was able to adhere to  correct policies and measures in the national united front  against the Japanese, and thus ensured victory in the war  against the Japanese.    The third and fourth volumes of the Writings  consist of 902 of Mao Zedong's essays written during the  Liberation War period. This was an important stage in the  development of Mao Zedong's military thinking. The essays  collected in these volumes highlight Mao Zedong's theories and  practices in strategic decision, war planning, and the art of  high command.    1. Arriving at a strategic decision, and proposing new  strategic missions, principles, and methods to achieve these  missions based on the practical conditions of both our side and  the enemy. With victory in the war against the Japanese  and aimed against the reactionary KMT's policy of actively  preparing for a full-scale civil war, Mao Zedong reminded the  whole party and Army of conducting prompt strategic changes,  which consisted of switching the guerrilla warfare to mobile  warfare and the pursuit of "moving toward the north and  defending the south." With the outbreak of full-scale civil  war, Mao Zedong, based on the strength of our side and the enemy  and on the combat experience of our troops gained early in the  civil war, formulated the interior-line operations and a policy  of active strategic defense, consisting of wiping out the  enemy's effective strength and refraining from seizing or  holding strongholds. Under the guidance of this formulation,  our Army scored the momentous victory of smashing the KMT's  full-scale offensives and countering their selective attacks  with concentrated forces. When the momentum of the enemy's  concentrated attacks was spent, but when the PLA still was  outnumbered by the enemy in total troop strength, Mao Zedong  made the bold strategic decision to direct the PLA main force to  attack the exterior lines in order to expand the war into areas  under KMT rule, thus initiating the historic change in People's  Revolutionary War from strategic defense to strategic offense.  Beginning in the fall of 1948, he directed our Army to launch  in a timely fashion the three great Liaoshi-Shenyang, Huai-Hai,  and Peiping-Tientsin Campaigns, which basically wiped out the  KMT main force and shook the KMT rule to its very foundations.  Thereafter, in a fearless, combative, and triumphant spirit,  Mao Zedong refused to be duped by Chiang Kai-shek's "peace talk"  plot or intimidated by the imperialists' threat of armed  intervention, and made the strategic decision of widening the  war to the whole country in pursuit of the revolution, thus  smashing Chiang Kai-shek's hope of rearming himself for a  comeback on the strength of his half-diminished power base south  of the Chang Jiang, forcing the imperialist powers to pull back  from armed intervention, and finally winning the great  Liberation War.    2. Putting forward in a timely fashion a highly  relevant principle of military operations that was able to meet  the needs evolved from the development of war and adjust to  specific conditions of different battlefields. Early in  the war, in view of the rearmament of the KMT by the United  States and therefore its greater combat power, Mao Zedong laid  great emphasis on the principle of "concentrating a superior  force to destroy the enemy forces one by one." Parallel to this  was the guiding thought of adhering to the war of annihilation  and mobile warfare. Regarding areas with heavy concentrations  of enemy troops, the emphasis was on caution, waiting for an  opportunity, working for more than instant results, and luring  the enemy to penetrate deeply. In waging battles that had  decisive strategic significance, the emphasis was on boldly  taking over enemy strongholds and heavily fortified cities, and  launching wars of annihilation on an unprecedented scale.  The 10 famed military principles summarized by Mao Zedong  in his "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" embody and  highlight the guiding principles for all our Army's operations  during the time of the War of Liberation.    3. Great mobility and maneuverability; good at luring  or drawing away enemies; creating favorable opportunities for  battles; holding firmly the initiative to launch offensives; and  handle everything with great flexibility and according to  changes in enemy movements, time, and locations -- these are the  obvious characteristics of Mao Zedong's art of high command.    Essays in this period also reflect new developments in Mao  Zedong's thinking on army building.    The sixth volume of Works includes 219  essays written between the founding of the PRC and December 1972  which trace how Mao Zedong ordered the PLA to continue the  strategic pursuit; liberate the whole country and certain  important islands; move troops into Tibet and peacefully  liberate it; conduct the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid  Korea; and defend the country, its national security, and  territorial integrity; and build a modern and regular army for  national defense.    Mao Zedong paid great attention to the construction of a  powerful, modern, and regular army of national defense. He  pointed out: We now have come to the highest stage of army  building, which is the acquiring of modern technology. China  must build a powerful national defense army, a powerful air and  naval force, and a good logistical system. He was determined to  launch research and development of hi-tech weapons, and wanted  to develop atomic and hydrogen bombs and intercontinental  ballistic missiles. In line with modernizing army equipment, he  demanded that the Army be regularized and that it install a  "centralized command, hierarchy, and establishment, and  discipline and training system" to instill "organization,  planning, accuracy, and discipline" (p. 341).    Mao Zedong's military thinking sums up the experiences  of China's Revolutionary War and wars against aggression. It is  a theoretical distillation of those experiences. It was born in  revolutionary war practice and continuously developed alongside  the practice and changes in historical conditions. Today,  learning and studying seriously the Military Writings of  Mao Zedong, and appreciating profoundly and acquiring its  basic tenets, principles, and scientific methods, hold important  significance for our conscious effort to adhere to Mao Zedong's  military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's theory on national defense  and army building in the new era as the guiding thoughts for our  Army.</p>

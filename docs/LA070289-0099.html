			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> JARUZELSKI WON'T SEEK NEW POST OF POLAND'S PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said Friday he does not intend to run for Poland's new  presidency because the people see him as the man who imposed martial law, not  the leader of reforms that followed, the government reported.  </P> <P> It said Jaruzelski, the Communist Party chief, recommended the interior  minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, for the job -- a powerful post resembling the  presidency created in the Soviet Union for Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> The party's Central Committee neither accepted nor rejected Jaruzelski's  proposal. Instead, the plenum asked Jaruzelski to reconsider his decision, the  state PAP news agency reported. Party representatives in the Sejm, or  Parliament, did likewise.  </P> <P> Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said there would be a meeting soon to choose  between Jaruzelski and Kiszczak. The Communist-allied Peasant and Democratic  parties also would be consulted, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> "I know well that public opinion associates me more often with martial law and  less often with the line of reforms, with those so significant decisions of the  10th plenum," when the party agreed in principle to restore legal status to  Solidarity, Jaruzelski told the Central Committee. "I must take into  consideration social reality."  </P> <P> In a statement carried by state TV and the news agency, Jaruzelski said in  endorsing Kiszczak:  </P> <P> "I would like to ask you to extend the recommendation of the Central Committee  for the soldier, politician, patriot and a man who has been close to me for  many years, Comrade Czeslaw Kiszczak.  </P> <P> "In the eyes of the society, including also opposition circles, he is rightly  considered as a leading representative of . . . reconciliation."  </P> <P> Jaruzelski said he was committed to removing obstacles to national  reconciliation.  </P> <P> "When there is an obstacle to reconciliation, to uniting social forces, there  is only one possible solution -- even if that obstacle is Wojciech Jaruzelski,"  he said.  </P> <P> Anti-Jaruzelski demonstrators marched in the streets of Warsaw while the  Central Committee met, hurling stones and gasoline bombs at police, who  responded with water cannon.  </P> <P> The Central Committee convened Friday morning to choose a nominee for the  presidency, which has been transformed from a ceremonial post. The president is  to be elected by the National Assembly this week and the party nominee is  considered certain of victory, although Solidarity won all but one of the seats  put up for free election earlier in June.  </P> <P> Officials want the president in office before President Bush arrives for a  three-day visit July 9.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski's election had been assumed since the new presidency was agreed upon  by government and opposition negotiators. The agreements, signed in April, also  legalized Solidarity and provided for the partially free elections.  </P> <P> In an interview with the Associated Press on Wednesday, however, Jaruzelski  said he was not campaigning for the presidency and might not accept it without  "at least a minimum of support" from the opposition. Solidarity legislators had  said they would not vote for Jaruzelski.  </P> <P> Kiszczak could be easier for Solidarity legislators to support because of  Jaruzelski's connection with the martial law crackdown in December, 1981, under  which Solidarity, formed during strikes the year before, was suppressed and  outlawed.  </P> <P> The 63-year-old army general, a Jaruzelski loyalist, directs Poland's extensive  police network and helped conduct the government's war against Solidarity in  much of the 1980s.  </P> <P> He won the Solidarity leadership's confidence, however, as leader of the  government side in the "round table" negotiations. In addition, he joined  Jaruzelski during the January party meeting in threatening to resign unless  Solidarity was made legal again.  </P> <P> The National Assembly, which will elect the president in joint session, is  expected to convene as early as Tuesday. The Communists have a 300-259  advantage.  </P> <P> Solidarity won 99 of the 100 seats in the new Senate and all 161 seats open to  free election in the 460-member Sejm. One Solidarity senator-elect died of a  heart attack Thursday, creating one vacancy in the Senate.  </P> <P> After the president is chosen, he is to name a premier to form a new  government.  </P> <P> The president, who is limited to two six-year terms, will be commander-in-chief  of the armed forces and be responsible for foreign relations. He may dissolve  the Sejm for new elections and declare one 90-day state of emergency.  </P> <P> Solidarity is not expected to put up its own candidate.  </P></p>

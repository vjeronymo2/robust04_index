			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (2): Badly handled calls cost sales, money and customers - First Impressions / Many company switchboards have a built-in frustration factor, but new technology is helping to ease the problem of misrouted calls EXASPERATION understates your feelings. Attempting to 'phone the marketing department, you reach the wrong site and are then passed to the right site, but the wrong department. As the operator struggles to find someone - anyone  -to answer, the obligatory Vivaldi 'Four Seasons' begins to play, vainly suggesting an element of urgency. Eventually you are put through. There is no reply. Each time the operator checks you are still on the line, she is so quick you have no chance to ask to leave a message. Your last quarter's telephone bill was horrific - it's not too difficult to work out why. The only possible compensation is that you'll save money by never buying anything from the sales department - if you ever reach it. Such experiences are commonplace, but no less frustrating for that. For this article, it took four days of left messages and increasingly urgent appeals to public relations officers to reach any executive at GPT-Siemans competent to talk on the subject. At one stage it took ten minutes of shuffling through one organisation to discover all its press officers were out to lunch. The problem is no joke. Missed and badly handled calls generate more than ill-will. They can cost sales, money and customers. But technology may be riding to the rescue. The cavalry is in the shape of three letters - ACD, more easily understood in this acronym-ridden industry as automatic call distribution. ACD is designed to allow callers to reach a person rather than an engaged or non-answering line. A sophisticated software system monitors incoming calls and directs them to the personnel, known in the trade as 'agents', who have been free the longest. Simultaneously, a real-time information system provides data to managers about how calls are stacking up and how individual agents are performing. Mr Nick Doughty, marketing manager of business systems group at GPT of the UK, one of the leading manufacturers of ACD equipment, explains how the system can monitor the average time taken to respond and the number of people abandoning their calls through frustration. Some companies have been able to cut the number of abandoned calls by as much as 30 per cent, he says. About 6,000 ACD systems are installed world-wide, according to Mr Richard Reid, managing director in the UK of private switching for the European subsidiary of Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecoms manufacturer. Users include banks, airlines, insurance companies, credit card companies, and mail order houses. Telephone operators' efficiency can be increased by up to 30 per cent using ACD systems, claims Philips Business Systems (see page 9: Lost calls mean lost business). In Britain, BT, the UK telecommunications group, has installed 47 Meridian systems supplied by Northern Telecom. The group has also installed 5,000 ACD telephones as part of its customer first programme. The aim is to answer 90 per cent of all customer service calls and sales enquiries within 15 seconds. Mr John Turner, head of planning for the programme, explains BT will now be able to offer fault reporting 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The system will work on a regional basis, allowing agents to pick up calls from outside their local area. Each agent has a regional database allowing them to access the relevant data on each caller. Other users include British Airways which according to Mr Doughty has installed a system in four or five of its airports, linking some 300 agents together. When one airport is over-loaded by calls they can be transferred to the other sites. In the US, large organisations had even redirected inquiries to different time zones, and even different countries. In New York, one bank uses ACD to deal with loan inquiries. Once customers have been interviewed for the loan they can call back, enter a code through a touch-tone telephone and then hear the result of their request. The bank filters out the vast majority of customers who are given a positive response and can then deal more effectively with the minority of those refused. About half of ACD systems are sold integrated with voice-messaging, says Mr Reid at Northern Telecom. The most recent technology records not only the message, but also the number of the caller. The system will then call back automatically when required. Messages can be subsequently annotated and redirected within the organisation for action, or even broadcast to everyone else's electronic voice-box. The market for ACD is dominated by Ericsson, the Swedish group, AT&amp;T of the US, Siemens of Germany, GPT in the UK and Northern Telecom. The UK market is worth only Pounds 50m a year, according to Mr Doughty, but it is growing at about 10 per cent a year. Meanwhile, the technological prospects for ACD will be enhanced by the introduction of integrated services digital network, ISDN (see page 10: Milestone for integrated services). Once in place, ISDN will allow companies to use computers to identify the telephone number calling in, interrogate a database, and bring up the caller's name and his relevant information on to a screen in front of the agent. The agent could pick up the telephone and respond with the caller's name before he, or she, has even spoken. That sounds rather better than being lost in the usual telephone system paying for the privilege of listening to an undistinguished recording of Vivaldi.

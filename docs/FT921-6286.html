			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Emap favourite to buy MBC EMAP, the newspaper, magazine and exhibitions group, last night emerged as favourite to buy Maxwell Business Communications from Price Waterhouse, the administrator. The fast-growing group is believed to have entered into detailed negotiations with PW in advance of an expected announcement. The 70-strong MBC group, part of Maxwell Communication Corporation, attracted considerable interest. A number of the bidders were only interested in part of the group which also includes an interest in exhibitions. Emap has made a bid for all of MBC in partnership with Mr Brian Gilbert, a former chairman of MBC. It is expected that after the deal is complete the partners will divide up the parts in which they are most interested. Emap would almost certainly be interested in the exhibitions and in titles such as Architect's Journal and Media Week. The bidders included a management buy-out team and Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail.</p>

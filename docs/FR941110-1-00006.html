			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;NM&hyph;123&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA received several reports of cracked fuse pins on the upper link of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inboard and outboard struts on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. Several pins also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showed evidence of corrosion. The fuse pins involved in these reports were ``bottle bore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> style'' fuse pins installed in the forward position of the struts. The cracking initiated in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machining groove in the inner recess of the pin bore, and it propagated due to fatigue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cracking of the pins occurred on some airplanes as early as 9,366 total flight cycles (on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the airplane) and 42,493 total flight hours. One of the reports involved the complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fracture of both shear planes on the fuse pin; consequently, that pin had no load carrying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability. Analysis of several of the cracked fuse pins indicated that fracturing occurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the recess area of the pin bore.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Corrosion may cause cracking of the fuse pins; this could lead to fracturing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuse pins. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the strut and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separation of an engine from the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 747&hyph;54A2166, dated April 28, 1994, which describes procedures for replacement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``bulkhead style'' and ``bottle bore style'' fuse pins, installed in the forward position of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upper link on the inboard and outboard struts, with either a 15&hyph;5 corrosion-resistant steel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuse pin (also known as a ``third generation'' pin) or a new bulkhead style pin. (This alert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service bulletin specifies that installation of the third generation pin is preferred.) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alert service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detect corrosion of the bulkhead style pins; magnetic particle inspections to detect cracks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in these pins; and replacement of any cracked or corroded pin with a third generation pin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or a new bulkhead style pin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The alert service bulletin references Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54&hyph;2155, dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 23, 1993, as an additional source of service information for replacement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain fuse pins, installed in the forward and aft positions of the upper link, with third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation pins. (Although there have been no reports of cracked pins in the aft position,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement of the pin in the forward position with a third generation pin necessitates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the aft pin also be replaced with a third generation pin in order to preserve the function  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and location of the primary structural fuse.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require replacement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottle bore style fuse pins, installed in the forward position of the upper link on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inboard and outboard struts, with either third generation fuse pins or new bulkhead style  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pins. This proposed AD also would require repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion of bulkhead style fuse pins; magnetic particle inspections to detect cracks in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those pins; and replacement of any corroded or cracked bulkhead style fuse pin with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third generation fuse pin or with a new bulkhead style pin. Installation of a third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generation fuse pin, if accomplished, would constitute terminating action for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection requirements of the proposed AD. The actions would be required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The manufacturer has advised that it is currently developing a modification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for the engine strut that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD. Once this modification program is developed, approved, and available, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may consider additional rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

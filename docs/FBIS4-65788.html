			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arja Nukarinen: "SKP(Y) Brings Back Communist </F> Party -- In Party Program Draft, Revolution Based on Citizen  Power and Freedom"]    [Text] The minority communist faction Finnish Communist  Party-Unity, SKP(Y), has set out to build a new Finnish  communist party. At the end of the year, in connection with the  party congress, a decision will be made on how to continue from  here with the bankrupt Finnish Communist Party (SKP).    Last Thursday [21 April], SKP(Y) made public a new draft for  a party program. The draft emphasizes "a new kind of socialism  and a humane civilization."  <H5>  Revolutionary Goal Still Alive </H5>   According to Yrjo Hakanen, chairman of the SKP(Y), who  presented the draft, the goal of a socialist revolution is still  intact. However, the collapse of the USSR has changed the  concept of revolution. Hakanen noted that we learned from the  example of the USSR that seizing power is not the same thing as  implementing socialism.    "We need the creation of a fundamentally different  democratic  use of power in our society. For example, based on the  experiences in the USSR, there has been an inclination to view  matters strictly from the perspective of the state and the  governing of the state. We want to emphasize the use of power by  individuals themselves. The development of individual ways of  influencing and a new type of society of citizens is  unavoidable."    According to Hakanen, it is not enough anymore to move into  the government or to be part of the state machinery. "It is easy  then for matters to move out of the control of the citizens, and  thus there is a tendency for events to turn against people."    SKP(Y) proposes a "new and radical program." According to  this, markets and capital flow should be subjected to democratic  guidance, the banks should be nationalized, and workers should  be given greater opportunities for influence. The government  should be turned into a "government of democratic change, which  would be guided by the needs of people and not by the  requirements of the markets."  <H5>  Six-Hour Workday </H5>   According to the program, the general workday should be  shortened to six hours. Thus employment will improve. Shortening  the workday without decreasing earnings is possible, according  to the program, as work would become more productive and profits  would be distributed in a new manner. Individual companies  would, among other things, be responsible for the employment of  people. Correspondingly, society would ensure that companies  could continue to operate.  <H5>  Cooperation Instead of Alliances </H5>   Existing gender-based inequities should be eliminated, by,  among other ways, eliminating the division between male and  female work in the job market.    According to the program, the public sector should be in the  forefront of implementing equality. The size of the public  sector should not be reduced. Instead, it would be its function  to develop employment, regional democracy, and environmentally  safe technologies, as well as guaranteeing citizens a high level  of social services.    On the international scene, the renewed SKP would like to  develop Finland's policy of neutrality, which has "traditions  that still contain much of value and worth developing." As  examples of this are mentioned an active role in resolving  conflicts proactively and peacefully, as well as the development  of a good cooperative relationship with Russia.    The program would reject membership in the European Union  [EU], as this would avoid "supporting the development of new  opposing political blocs and unequal structures." The program  suggests that the security of Europe could be ensured by  promoting disarmament and by dismantling "remnants of the Cold  War, such as NATO."  <H5>  Final Program Taking Form </H5>   A decision will be made regarding SKP's program, in  connection with the party congress at the end of the year. The  communists want to debate the matter, based on which the final  program will take shape. The new program will replace SKP's old  program.    According to Hakanen, the date of the party congress will  not  be set until the date of the popular referendum regarding  membership in the EU is known. Because of the campaign against  the EU, the party leadership does not want to take any chances  by having the congress convene around the time of the plebiscite.    Hakanen stated that SKP(Y)'s view is that if the party  congress accepts their concepts, there will be no need for a  separate SKP(Y) any more, and "the communists in this country  will act in the name of SKP."</p>

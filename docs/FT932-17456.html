			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Japan's banks sell Y682bn of bad loans LEADING Japanese banks said yesterday they had sold Y681.7bn (Pounds 3.9bn) of their bad property loans in recent weeks to a new agency, which purchased them at a generous 66 per cent of face value. At the same time the leading 21 banks are believed to have successfully hurdled the 8 per cent target set for capital adequacy ratios for the fiscal year which ended yesterday. About eight of the largest 11 commercial banks are believed to have capital to assets ratios at a comfortable 9 per cent. The loan purchases, announced through the Bank of Japan, were by the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, an industry body established earlier this year to try to clear away the large pile of non-performing property-related loans. Banks bring their bad loans to the CCPC, which values the property and other collateral and buys the loan credit, allowing insititutions to write off the difference, at a favourable tax rate. It is hoped the company will help to put a floor under property prices through its valuations. The CCPC said that the loan credits bought in recent weeks came from 35 banks and life assurers. The banks have to provide the money for the CCPC to buy the loans, and remain responsible for selling the property, even though they have theoretically sold the collateral to the company. Before the CCPC began valuing the collateral there were concerns that the property valuations could be overly generous, undermining the potential role as a guide to prospective land pruchasers. The 66 per cent figure suggests that banks either brought in their most attractive bad loans or that the valuations were generous. The leading 21 banks were officially estimated to have non-performing loans of Y12,300bn at the end of last September. But that figure is regarded as an underestimate as it does not include affiliates' bad loans or the increasing amount of loans on which token repayments are made to ensure they are not officially 'bad'. But the banks will be relieved that their capital adequacy ratios, as defined by the Bank for International Settlements, are relatively healthy. They have been helped by the surge in Tokyo stock prices in recent weeks, and the strengthening yen.</p>

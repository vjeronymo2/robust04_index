			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANDFILL FOES ATTACK STUDY OF 3 CANYONS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: POLITICIANS JOIN HOMEOWNERS IN PROTESTING A COUNTY REPORT NAMING  AREAS IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS AS POSSIBLE DUMPS.  </P> <P> About 200 homeowners, schoolchildren and politicians met at a scenic spot off  Mulholland Drive on Tuesday to condemn a county report naming three Santa  Monica Mountains canyons as potential landfill sites.  </P> <P> With placards declaring "It Stinks" and other angry slogans, the landfill  opponents cheered elected officials who threatened legal and legislative action  if the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts dump garbage in Mission, Rustic  and Sullivan canyons.  </P> <P> "I am absolutely appalled that anybody would think we need anything like a dump  site here," state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), told the gathering  near the Bel-Air Skycrest subdivision. "I am going to do everything I possibly  can to prevent this from happening."  </P> <P> Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), through a spokeswoman, called on  sanitation officials to cross the West Los Angeles canyons off their landfill  list and said their use would violate a federal law protecting land in national  parks from being used for garbage dumps.  </P> <P> Although the Sanitation Districts own Rustic and Sullivan canyons and Los  Angeles County owns Mission Canyon, all three lie within the boundaries of the  Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, which just received $12  million in federal funds for land acquisition.  </P> <P> The Sanitation Districts have pledged that the three Westside canyons would be  exempt from landfill development if the Santa Clarita Valley's Elsmere Canyon  becomes a regional garbage dump. But protesters said Tuesday that they were  alarmed that a recent study still lists Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons --  situated between the affluent communities of Encino, Bel-Air, Brentwood and  Pacific Palisades -- as possible landfill sites.  </P> <P> Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy, accused the Sanitation Districts of "trying to splinter the forces  against landfills" by making the Westside canyons' exemption contingent upon  the development of a landfill in Elsmere Canyon.  </P> <P> Towsley Canyon, also in the Santa Clarita Valley, and Blind Canyon, in the  Santa Susana Mountains above Chatsworth, are also named as possible landfill  sites in the study.  </P> <P> The controversial study, a draft environmental impact report on a countywide  trash-management plan, has been the subject of continuing public hearings since  its release Aug. 31.  </P> <P> Grace Chan, the Sanitation Districts planner who supervised the study, said  public comments will be accepted until Dec. 3, after which the report will be  completed and submitted to the Sanitation Districts' Board of Directors for  final approval. The deadline for public response had been tomorrow, the reason  for Tuesday's rally.  </P> <P> Chan said the report also addresses recycling trash and hauling it to remote  areas by train.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Terry D. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), City Councilman Marvin Braude,  and David Gackenbach, superintendent of the national recreation area were among  the officials present.  </P> <P> About 22 fifth-graders from the private Westland School, adjacent to Mission  Canyon, attended to call attention to the potential health hazards of a  landfill.  </P></p>

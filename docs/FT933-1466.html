			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Norway banker foresees krone link to Europe NORWAY'S central bank governor Hermod Skaanland said he believed Norway would in some way or other link the krone to a future European currency system even if Norway did not become a member of the European Community. 'Should we not become a member, I think we will nevertheless seek a currency regime which in some way or other is tied to the European system and on a basis as mutual as circumstances will permit,' Mr Skaanland told delegates of the annual meeting of the Federation Internationale des Bourse de Valeurs. Norway unilaterally linked the krone to the European currency unit in October 1990, but was forced to float the domestic currency last December during turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism which also forced neighbouring Sweden and Finland to float their currencies. After an immediate fall of about 6 per cent in the krone's value against the Ecu, it has returned to about 3.5-4 per cent below its pre-float level. 'A unilateral link to the Ecu of the kind we had up to December last year does not appear a very promising alternative. Something more robust is needed,' Mr Skaanland said without giving details. Norway is currently negotiating membership of the EC but polls put opposition to accession at about 58 per cent with just 31 per cent in favour. The issue will be decided by a referendum, possibly in 1995. 'As a member, Norway would be fully prepared to participate in the foreign exchange co-operation within the European Community which may at that point in time exist. 'In the meantime, I suppose we will continue to await the course of events without any major change in our exchange rate policy,' he said.</p>

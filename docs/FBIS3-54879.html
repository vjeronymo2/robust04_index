			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal </F> Democratic Party of Russia, in Moscow, by Poivre d'Arvor in  Paris -- live]    [Excerpt] [D'Arvor] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's European tour  was marked by scandal. Three weeks after his success in the  elections, he was expelled from Bulgaria. He is persona non  grata in Austria, and Germany refused him a visa. He  subsequently threatened Germany with a third world war. We have  with us live Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Good evening. It is hard to  believe you when you say that you wish to crush Germany in a  third world war when you come to power. Did you really say that?    [Zhirinovskiy] No. I wanted to visit Germany once again. I  visited Germany previously, on four occasions, but I would like  to say that if future events in Russia unfold as they do now, or  as they do in the Balkans, or in some other parts of the world,  a third world war may break out one day. I want to prevent  this, I want to take measures now to prevent the risks of a new  world war.    [D'Arvor] You seem to long for a Russia that would expand  into a Great Russia. You say you wish to recover the Baltic  states, Finland, and Poland. Where will your yearning for  expansion stop?    [Zhirinovskiy] No expansion. On the contrary, we now have a  situation where, for instance, Tajikistan and some  Transcaucasian republics want to be with Russia once again. But  I for one, together with my party, do not want this. We want  the opposite. This is a recurrent lie. I say these countries  should develop on their own as independent states, but I also  say they will never be like independent states, because they  joined Russia 200 years ago. This was always the tragedy of  these peoples. They tell me they have no possibility of being  [independent] states, now this is the same problem, always the  tragedy of Tajiks, or of Georgians, of Armenians, of Azeris.    We are [word indistinct] here in Russia and I favor the  pullout of all Russian troops back to Russia, to Moscow. You  will see for yourself that a terrible war will start there  between Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and  Iran. The same thing is happening now in Afghanistan, without a  president, without a government, with gangs, with groups, with a  commander or something similar.    This is not a state, this is not civilization. This is  already a part of the third world war because there are millions  and millions of people living there, and they are in a situation  of civil war within their country, or in a state of war with  other states: Armenia and Azerbaijan, Abkhazia and Georgia,  Tajikistan and Afghanistan. This is already a part of the world  war because it is a vast territory from India to Athens, to  Serbia. It is larger than Europe during the World War II.    [D'Arvor] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, do you yourself wish to return  to  the former Great Russia, that of the tsars?    [Zhirinovskiy] I want to see our state within its historical  borders, but not through violent means, only through economic  means, through civilization, culture, law. For instance, if one  day they want to return, if they call on us, and if you in the  West, in Paris or in London, say we too will help these people  to live, to remain alive, then perhaps can we take positive  steps. However, now, we do not want them to come back within  Russia, all the peoples from the south, from Tajikistan to  Chisinau. We do not want this, my party and I are against this.    [D'Arvor] Does this include the Baltic states?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, the Baltic states too, but I say we must  have economic relations. This does not mean constant aid for  the Baltic states. If we stop selling our energy and mineral  resources cheaply to the Baltic states, contrary to what we are  doing now, their existence as independent states is over. I  say: If I lead the Russian Government, we will immediately stop  all economic aid to the Baltic states and to any other country.  Trade yes, but pay, pay: Pay with hard currencies and no more  economic aid. After that, the existence of the Baltic states as  independent states is over.    [D'Arvor] I understand. When you say if I lead the Russian  Government, does this mean that you wish to replace the current  prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin?    [Zhirinovskiy] Could you repeat your question more slowly?    [D'Arvor] Do you wish to see the current prime minister,  Viktor Chernomyrdin, resign and hand over power to you?    [Zhirinovskiy] I believe that he will stay for a few months,  but in March or April, we will have another prime minister. Our  president, Mr. Yeltsin, wants to keep Viktor Chernomyrdin as  prime minister and also some other ministers from the previous  government. It is their ultimate mistake; if they make it, it  will be over for this government in April, and we will have a  government led not by myself -- I know I said that I would lead  the government -- but by a more neutral person, perhaps from  Siberia. He will lead the new Russian Government with new  ministers, but Mr. Gaydar's team, with its conception of this  economic reform that only brings negative results...[pauses]  Programs must be changed, we need reforms, but through other  programs. It is the same as medicine: You must have medication,  but prescribed by another doctor. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FLOATING JAILS  </P> <P> Local political leaders tell us they have no money for additional jails.  Citizens complain about locating criminal detention facilities in their back  yards, and the justice system grinds slowly to a halt because we have no  courtrooms.  </P> <P> And all the while, former warships sit in mothballs in local harbors. How does  that figure?  </P> <P> As a former Marine Corps judge advocate, I know prisoners have been held in  ship brigs for the last several years. The repair ship Jason, and the destroyer  tenders Cape Code and Acadia have all housed prisoners waiting for  court-martial. If it works for the military, why not the county?  </P> <P> Why not rejuvenate these decaying vessels into beautiful memorials of San Diego  naval history and use them as county jails? We can then take the space adjacent  to the downtown courthouse that presently serves as the County Jail and build  the courtrooms our judges need to ease the crunch on our justice system.  </P> <P> THOMAS M. CONNALLY  </P> <P> El Cajon  </P></p>

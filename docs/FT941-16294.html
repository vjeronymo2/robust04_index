			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Observer: Promoting prophylactics It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good. As the Tory party's sexual peccadilloes play havoc with John Major's authority, Sime International  - the world's biggest rubber company which owns a condom brand called Jiffi - spotted an opportunity too good to miss. Jiffi's advertising agency, Nobull, quickly came up with a national advertising campaign attuned to the zeitgeist: 'Next time, don't be so conservative' it trumpeted in a full page ad for its products, which it said were 'available not only in blue, but also red and yellow (and) ideal for any party'. The ad was not to everyone's taste, however. According to Nobull, The Guardian turned it down while The Mirror said Yes, but only for an exorbitant price. However, Today loved it, as did the Evening Standard, which called up Nobull's media buyers to ask if it could please run it too, at 'a hell of a lot less than rate card'.</p>

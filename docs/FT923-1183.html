			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Letter: First with computer fax system Sir, Your very interesting article (Technology, September 22) about a machine that can send the contents of a personal computer floppy disc over the phone gives the credit for this technique to the Japanese. In fact, the first machine of this kind in the world (as far as we can discover) was designed in Britain and launched on the UK and European markets as the 'Diskfax' nearly two years ago by our company. It now has a substantial base of users in large corporations and in niche markets such as desk-top publishing and computer-aided design. Not only did the British Diskfax pre-date the Japanese device but it has a substantially higher performance. By using a novel transmission method, it can send discs virtually error-free over ordinary telephone lines. Its users do not need to have access to an integrated services digital network (ISDN). It can also operate unattended, just like a fax machine, and can share a single phone line with a fax machine. We hope that in making these points our letter will demonstrate that not all innovative electronic products originate in Japan. Peter Burton, chairman, Alfa Systems, 32-66 Stratford High Street, London E15 2PD</p>

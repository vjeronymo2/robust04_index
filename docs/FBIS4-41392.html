			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Presidential aide Georgiy Satarov has said the idea  of extending the tenure of office of both parliament and  president, proposed by the speaker of the upper house - the  Council of the Federation - Vladimir Shumeyko is not new.    Satarov told IF [Interfax] Wednesday morning that back a  month ago, when President Yeltsin met with the group of State  Duma members called the "December 12 Liberal-Democratic Union",  State Duma member Irina Khakamada asked Yeltsin about his  attitude to the idea of extending parliament. Satarov said the  President replied he was not against that "on the condition the  State Duma and the Council of the Federation proved effective".    That idea has been discussed as a possibility in  professional  circles for a long time", Satarov said.    The presidential aide said that when I. Khakamada asked the  President about the idea of prolonging his own term of office,  Yeltsin replied: "Don't touch the 1996 elections, please".  Satarov said he would not comment on the President's statement.    The presidential aide believes that if the idea of extending  powers gains the upper hand, amendments to the current  Constitution will most probably be made through a referendum.  "However, the subject of holding the referendum will remain open  until both houses of parliament have approved of a law on the  referendum", Satarov said.    In an exclusive interview granted to Interfax on Tuesday  Shumeyko said it would be expedient to postpone both  presidential and parliamentary elections for two years. The  speaker of the upper house said he had discussed that with the  President, who, Shumeyko said "does not object in principle to  prolonging his tenure of office". "He (Yeltsin) sees this as a  normal way out, because what the country needs today is a period  of stability", Shumeyko said.    According to Shumeyko the speaker of the lower house, the  State Duma Ivan Rybkin is for that proposal, too.    "Members of parliament are politicians", the speaker said.  "Once a person becomes a politician, he must decide whether to  go on with his or her political career. If politicians know  their term is about to expire, they will keep the forthcoming  elections in mind whenever they walk to the speaking stand. We  should be concerned about different things now, about the state.  We have put Russia on the track of reform and the first stage  of reform ended on December 12 1993. Now we must take care of  fostering the state".    Shumeyko recalled that the Constitution had established a  four-year term for both houses of the Federal Assembly, whereas  the first Council of the Federation and State Duma were elected  for a transitional period of two years. "Why should there be a  transitional period of two years, and not four?" Shumeyko asked.  He believes it would be enough to amend the second section of  the constitution ("Final and Transitional Provisions") to double  the term of the first parliament.    Shumeyko said the first two chapters of the Constitution  could be altered in no way other than calling a referendum,  whereas the others could be amended by parliament. "The  Constitution does not specify how the second section can be  changed", the speaker of the upper house said. "Since nothing  definite is stated, the legal practice requires the general  procedure, that is a referendum. The referendum would be far  less costly than new elections".    Shumeyko said that if the first Federal Assembly were  extended alongside the presidential term (1996 elections would  then be canceled), the period of stability in Russia may last  2-3 years.    The speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament  told  IF on Wednesday one should be very cautious about the idea of  extending the powers of parliament. "We've got to show the  people we are worthy of the extension", Rybkin said.    The State Duma Speaker said neither house of the Federal  Assembly was as efficient as necessary yet. He said that the  country still had no budget and "some politickers seek to  capitalize on that". Rybkin said he was referring to those who  had earlier worked in the government and then took senior posts  in both houses of parliament.    Rybkin even ventured the guess it would be reasonable to  re-elect parliament as early as next year. "The people, aware of  their bitter experiences, would elect totally new people", he  said.    Interviewed by IF earlier, Rybkin said the idea of extending  parliament and the president would be realistic under three  conditions: "if the economy develops signs of stabilization  within the next two or three months; if an appropriate legal  network is formed, and if both houses of the Federal Assembly  prove efficient". "These pre-requisites seem to be in the making  and the march of events looks constructive", Rybkin said. He  added he would be happy about the extension of both parliament  and the president provided all the mentioned conditions were met.</p>

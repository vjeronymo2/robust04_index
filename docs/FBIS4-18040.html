			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] The arrest of a leading member of Kazakhstan's  Russian speaking community, Boris Suprunyuk, gave rise to  "serious concern" in Moscow, a spokesman for Russia's Foreign  Ministry, Grigoriy Karasin, said at Thursday's briefing.    According to him, his ministry has already requested  Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry to inform it urgently of what  Suprunyuk is charged with, as well as of investigation and other  actions taken against him.    As Karasin said, Alma Ata [Almaty] "has resorted to the  thesis that Suprunyuk must be subjected to psychiatric  examination." "This cannot fail to evoke memories of the  notorious methods of combating dissent. Nevertheless we hope  that the Kazakh authorities will display an objective and  unbiased approach, that they will be guided by their commitments  in the area of human rights, including those made in the  framework of the CSCE," Karasin said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States agreed Friday that they will continue efforts to  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue before  referring it to the U.N. Security Council. The agreement came  during a meeting between South Korean Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the  State Department on Friday afternoon.    At the hour-long meeting, Han and Christopher shared the  opinion that Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy  Agency could still make progress in negotiations on IAEA  inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, according to  Chang Chae-yong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's  American affairs Bureau.    In addition, Han and Christopher agreed that even if the  North Korean issue was referred to the Security Council, U.N.  action against Pyongyang should be taken in stages rather than  through immediate sanctions.    They reportedly decided to introduce mild measures at first,  such as passing a resolution urging North Korea to accept IAEA  inspections, before gradually turning up the heat, Foreign  Ministry sources said.    Han also handed Christopher a personal letter from President  Kim Yong-sam to U.S. President Bill Clinton.    In the letter, President Kim reaffirmed the agreements he  and  Clinton reached at their summit in Washington last November and  in a telephone conversation on Dec. 7, in which they vowed to  pursue "thorough and wide-ranging" measures to resolve the North  Korean nuclear problem.    Earlier Friday morning, Han met with new U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry and agreed to study plans to hold the  joint military exercise "Team Spirit," tentatively scheduled for  March 10, if North Korea refuses to allow inspection of its  nuclear facilities.    Han told Perry that South Korea was positively considering  the proposed deployment by U.S. forces in Korea of Patriot  missiles, but he urged the United States to be careful about the  timing, sources said.    The two officials further agreed that the current situation  on the Korean peninsula could not be termed a crisis.  Nevertheless, Seoul and Washington would make thorough  preparations to preserve South Korea's security against any  military provocation by North Korea.    Prior to meeting with Christopher, Han held wide-ranging  discussions with senior officials of the U.S. State Department  including Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for  political and military affairs, and Tom Hubbard, deputy  assistant secretary of state.    The two sides agreed that they will not abandon their  efforts  to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue  before Feb. 21, when the IAEA Board of Governors is scheduled  to meet.    In addition, they decided to study the possibility of  holding  a working-level contact in New York between the United States  and North Korea in the belief that Pyongyang must be told of  "the hard- line atmosphere" in the international community on  the nuclear issue.</p>

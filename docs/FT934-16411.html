			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese carmakers agree supply deal THE DIVISION of labour within Japan's motor industry gathered pace yesterday as three car manufacturers announced plans to supply each other with vehicles for the domestic market. The moves are to allow the companies to maintain product ranges while reducing development costs. Nissan, Japan's second-largest carmaker, will supply Fuji Heavy Industry, maker of Subaru cars, with vans from early next year. Nissan will also supply Mazda with vans and estate cars, but in return buy vans and trucks from Mazda. Nissan will provide Fuji Heavy with 200 vans a month. Fuji will terminate production of its Subaru Leone van, now running at about 200 a month. Nissan will supply Mazda with 1,400 vans and estate cars a month, for sale under the Mazda Familiar marque in the Japanese domestic market. Mazda will stop producing its Familiar vans and wagons for the domestic market, but continue to manufacture the vehicles for export. The moves, which follow an agreement between Honda and Isuzu earlier this year to supply each other with vehicles, reflect the efforts of Japanese carmakers to survive one of the worst recessions in the industry by reducing development costs for less successful models. The industry has seen weak demand for three consecutive years, while the yen's appreciation has hurt the price competitiveness of Japanese carmakers abroad. Mazda has not been as successful with its smaller vans and estate cars sold under the Familiar marque. It produces less than 2,000 of these vehicles a month, and announced recently that it will close one production line where it manufactures the Familiar vans and estate cars. Nissan will also stop making the Vanette van and truck from early next year, when it will replace those models with products from Mazda. The vehicles have been manufactured at a Nissan subsidiary in which Nissan has a 33 per cent stake, but the company has seen production of these models fall from a monthly average of 2,820 last year to 2,440 a month in the first eight months of this year. Nissan said that it was reviewing models which were not profitable, while Mazda noted that it would be more cost-effective for it to buy the vehicles from Nissan than continue developing them itself. Part of Nissan's supply to Mazda will come from Nissan's facility in Mexico, where it recently increased capacity. The company expects to ship 1,500 vans a month from Mexico and increase that number after several years to about 30,000 to 35,000 units a year.</p>

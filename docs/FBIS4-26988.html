			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Nonpolice Personnel Help Keep the Peace"] </F>   [Text] China's security service forces, a nine-year-old  nonpolice group, have become an important aid to police in  safeguarding social stability.    They are shouldering a large portion of security work at  enterprises, government and financial organs, markets, railway  stations, and airports, filling a gap left by the limited number  of policemen.    During the past nine years, their work has shown effective  results, said Gao Xu, the President of the China Security  Association (CSA).    Gao was speaking at the close of a three-day conference in  Beijing to mark the establishment of the CSA.    In Beijing, security workers from the Beijing Security  Service Company act as guards for 2,278 clients.    Last year, these employees handled more than 1.1 million  cases--involving 20,000 thefts or fights and caught 2,474  offenders.    Gao says the CSA will help boost China's service force,  which  needs to be strengthened further.    The security service first appeared in 1985 to meet the  changing domestic situation, which called for more security work  in enterprises and government organs. The forces now have  200,000 employees across the country, whereas the police team  stands at about one million, Vice Minister of Public Security  Mou Xinsheng said yesterday.    They are working at about 1,000 security service companies  nationwide.    The security work mainly involves guarding gates, conducting  patrols for them, and escorting bearers of money or valuable  goods.    Also, they can be asked to safeguard exhibitions, sports, or  enterprise activities and install security equipment at  buildings, Mou said.    However, they are not allowed to own guns and batons or to  act as bodyguards for individuals.    Before beginning their service, these guards usually receive  training for one to three months at one of the service companies.    Beijing and Shanghai now have the largest teams of security  workers.    Beijing has 23,000 security guards in 26 service companies  while Shanghai has 20,300 in 25 companies, Mou said.    Security service companies get paid by the organizations  that  hire their guards.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Arnulfist Party [PA]  presidential candidate, said that if Molirena [Nationalist  Liberal Republican Movement] members wish to remain in the  government, it will be up to Molirena leaders. De Gruber  reiterated that an alliance with the friendly parties could not  be made in response to personal interests.    [Begin recording] [De Gruber] On Sunday we nominated a  presidential slate of three candidates. We said PA was a  serious party and that the three candidates on the slate were to  go to the campaign. In any case, convention delegates agreed to  form alliances with other parties after 23 January, provided  that those parties wished to join the alliance. They left that  possibility open.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] with Molirena,  then?    [De Gruber] Yes.    [Reporter] Do you wish to meet with Professor Carles?    [De Gruber] If he wants to meet with me, I would be pleased  to meet with him.    [Reporter] Will the PA presidential ticket change?    [De Gruber] No.    [Reporter] Are you aware of the fact that this division is  making it possible for the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]  to win?    [De Gruber] Listen, we -- and I personally -- did all we  could to form an alliance. I said this a month ago in David.  We believe there must be an alliance of all parties. However,  here the interests of some prevailed over those of the country.    [Reporter] Some people have said that the president has  talked too much about politics and may be violating some  electoral provisions. Do you agree?    [De Gruber] The president said at all times that there will  be free, clean, and democratic elections in this country. No  matter who wins, the president will surrender the Presidency to  that person. Nobody can prevent him from making any statements  he may have made as a member of his party after working hours.    [Reporter] Do you fear a possible trial of the president?  [Legislative Assembly President] Arturo Vallarino said it was  possible.    [De Gruber] Listen, I understand Arturo Vallarino said that  if the Molirena members were expelled from the government, they  would try the president. I ask him: Why didn't the Christian  Democratic Party think that way when they left the government?  The president has the power to dismiss or appoint whomever he  chooses.    [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya, you said interests have prevailed  within Molirena, but they say the Arnulfists....    [De Gruber, interrupting] I must warn you that I did not say  the interests of Molirena as a party have prevailed over those  of the nation.    [Reporter] Under what circumstances would you negotiate with  Professor Carles?    [De Gruber] We are ready to talk to all parties that want to  come and talk to us. We are ready to talk to all parties except  one. [end recording]</p>

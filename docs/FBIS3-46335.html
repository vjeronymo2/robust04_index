			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 3556): "Guangdong </F> Provincial People's Congress Decides To Strengthen Legislation  on Real Estate Market"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 12 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--An  official of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial  People's Congress disclosed that the congress will lay stress on  strengthening legislation on the real estate market in its  legislative work this year. The Standing Committee of the  Guangdong Provincial People's Congress which starts tomorrow  will examine and discuss three such regulations.    These three regulations are: "Regulations on the Transfer of  Real Estates in Towns and Cities of Guangdong Province,"  "Regulations on House Renting in Towns and Cities of Guangdong  Province," and "Regulations on Real Estate Ownership  Registration in Towns and Cities of Guangdong Province."    The real estate regulation promulgated and put into force by  the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress last month was  "Regulations on Real Estate Development and Management in  Guangdong Province."    According to the official of the people's congress, although  four rules and regulations have been promulgated by the  provincial government and people's congress in the past two  years and more to standardize the real estate market, the  question of lacking sufficient laws and regulations for real  estates remains serious at present.    The official of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress  gave examples to show that the question of the real estate  transfer market is quite conspicuous at present. First, taking  advantage of land acquisition, some grass-roots governments have  acquired land from peasants at low pricse and then sold it to  land developers at high prices to reap staggering profits. This  has resulted in disturbances or fights with weapons. Last year,  land acquisition in Huizhou City alone caused nine incidents of  disturbances and fights with weapons, involving over 100 people  each, wounding 20 cadres and over 100 people, and resulting in a  direct economic loss amounting to 1 million yuan. Second, the  question of illegal land transfer is serious in towns and  townships. On one occasion, several square kilometers of land  were illegally transferred in a certain village in Buji Town of  Shenzhen City. Third, illegal sales and transfer of commodity  housing are serious and such practice harms the interests of the  consumers. Fourth, fraud in real estate transactions carried  out by lawbreakers are often found.    It is disclosed that the three regulations to be examined  and  discussed by the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial  People's Congress tomorrow will include detailed provisions on a  series of issues such as the transfer, renting, and ownership  registration of real estates.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: GE expands its business in India GENERAL Electric, the US electrical and plastics conglomerate, is expanding its business in India in moves seen as reflecting a more optimistic assessment of India's prospects by foreign investors. The group said yesterday it had committed Rs1bn (Pounds 21m) fresh equity capital this year to new joint ventures in India in electrical appliances, medical systems, engineering plastics and lighting. GE is also discussing tie-ups with Indian public-sector companies to make defence, aerospace and transport equipment. It is bidding to build, own and operate a 800-900MW power station for Delhi. 'The potential of expansion (in India) over the next 10 years is unequalled,' said Mr Paola Fresco, senior vice-president (international) in New Delhi yesterday. Similar opportunities could only be found in south-east Asia and Mexico. GE's increased commitment to India could provide a catalyst for other foreign investors, as had GE's entry into Hungary with the collapse of communism there. GE is taking a 40 per cent stake in a tie-up with Godrej and Boyce, the Indian consumer appliances company, to make washing machines, refrigerators and compressors, for the Indian market and abroad through GE's sales network. GE will contribute its share of the Rs1.2bn equity in fresh foreign funds for a new plant at Malanpur in Madhya Pradesh. Godrej will make its contribution through transfer of existing plant. Other new ventures include: a 50/50 joint venture with the state-owned Indian Petrochemicals Corporation to make engineering plastics for the electronics, automotive and appliance industries, involving equity capital of Dollars 36m (Pounds 20.4m); and a venture with Wipro, the Indian electronics company, to make medical systems with the two sides sharing the Dollars 10m equity capital. GE is also involved in talks with two of India's biggest public-sector corporations over licensing agreements in aersopace, defence and locomotive technology. In the defence sector, it has been discussing with Bharat Heavy Electricals the licensing of digital tank turret drives and tank gunner simulators.</p>

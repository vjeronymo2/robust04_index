			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 1 May (DPA) -- Official results have confirm  the victory of the rightist Social Christian Party [PSC], which  obtained approximately 38 percent of the total vote and  one-third of the 65 deputy seats up for election in Ecuador  today.    Thus, the PSC shed the regional nature that has  characterized  it as a coastal organization and became the leading national  force by winning the election in more than 10 provinces spread  throughout the country's four natural regions. This victory  leaves 47-year-old Jaime Nebot, the PSC presidential candidate,  as the front-runner for the presidency in 1996.    Nebot said the PSC faction in the unicameral Congress will  demand changes from President Sixto Duran-Ballen's liberal  government and will strive from the opposition to see that "the  poor Ecuadorean is taken care of." The official vote count  confirmed both the popularity of the right coalesced in the  Roldosista Party as the country's second leading force and the  weakening of the traditionally strong center-left Democratic  Left and Popular Democracy parties.    According to official figures, the surprise of the election  was the reemergence of the Maoist influenced Popular Democratic  Movement as the country's third strongest political force and  the leftist populism represented by Popular Revolutionary  Action. The rest of the Marxist leftist parties have been  virtually extinguished.    All of the political parties that obtained seats in Congress  have announced they will continue to oppose the government. At  the same time, however, they will try to improve the image of  Congress, whose popularity has reached an all-time low as a  result of the inactivity in the past two years.    The period of Congress sessions during which the new  deputies  will be sworn in will open on 10 August. On that same day,  liberal President Duran-Ballen will begin the final two years of  his term with no possibility for reelection.    Although the government received more support in the  elections than predicted by opinion polls, it will have to face  a hostile Congress for the rest of the term.    In this last stage, the government will try to implement its  plan for economic opening and to privatize public corporations  regarded as inefficient and unproductive, an action the PSC will  surely support despite its avowed opposition.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Fisons Fisons, stricken by repeated self-inflicted wounds, seems incapable of curing itself. For three years, the group has attempted to clean its stables of questionable trade and accounting practices. Each time cleanliness was claimed, more mire was uncovered. Yesterday was no exception. Nor was it exceptional that yet another division reported an unexpected profits collapse. The prospects painted by management for all three divisions were grim. The problem is finding a company willing to put Fisons out of its misery. All the groups with asthma franchises have looked and rejected it. Some Japanese groups have also sniffed, and walked away. Even though Fisons' market capitalisation has plummeted from Pounds 3.4bn at its peak in 1991 to barely Pounds 900m, the company looks expensive. Valuing the group on a similar multiple to Glaxo - and that is being generous given Glaxo's better quality earnings - Fisons' underlying worth is about 70p a share. Yesterday's close was 135p. An elegant exit would be for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, with which Fisons now has a series of alliances, to buy the company. Unfortunately, RPR has its own difficulties and probably cannot afford the price. With a management which still insists the group has an independent future, Fisons must limp on alone.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 12 (XINHUA) -- China's largest  industrial metropolis of Shanghai has launched a program to  develop the area in the western suburbs.    The area, with nearly 300 ha under the development program,  will become another of the city's new industrial bases.    It is only six km from the Hongqiao International Airport  and  linked closely with Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces.    Within the area, necessary key infrastructural facilities  such as a transformer substation, a water plant and a  program-controlled telephone system have been built.    So far 32 industrial projects, mainly from joint ventures  with businessmen from Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have  become established in the area with a total investment of more  than 80 million U.S. dollars.    Among them technology-intensive and labor-intensive projects  co-exist, as do those which are export-oriented or serving  domestic markets.</p>

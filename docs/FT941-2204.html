			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Arlington Secs falls by Pounds 7.75m Arlington Securities, the business park subsidiary of British Aerospace, announced a reduction in pre-tax profit from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 5.1m for 1993, after Pounds 5m of provisions against rental guarantees on property sales in previous years. Turnover increased from Pounds 74.5m to Pounds 121.5m, because of land sales, institutional sales and speculative pre-funds from its eight business parks. Arlington let 400,000 sq ft of space (387,000 sq ft), in what was described as a very difficult market by Mr Patrick Deigman, chief executive. The annual report was accompanied by a press statement concerning criticisms that Arlington, which was bought at the peak of the last property cycle, has been a liability to its parent company. 'British Aerospace's so-called property 'black hole' owes more to science fiction than to reasoned analysis of the property market,' it said. Arlington separated from the remainder of BAe's property interests in December 1992, with a view to concentrating the management's effort on business parks and preparing for a possible flotation in a few year's time. At present, BAe describes Arlington as a core business because of its role in masterplanning BAe's disused sites. Arlington said that the clamp-down on out-of-town developments signalled by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, would enhance the value of its land bank. The company has land capable of sustaining 13m sq ft of space with planning permission, as well as land capable of sustaining a further 8m sq ft of space that is going through the planning process. Net current assets increased from Pounds 116.6m to Pounds 168.4m. There is a dividend of Pounds 3m for BAe.</p>

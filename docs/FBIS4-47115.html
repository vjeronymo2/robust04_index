			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valentin Rasputin: "I Do Not Believe That All Is </F> Lost." From the roundtable discussion held at the Union of  Writers of Russia on the topic of "Current and Future Position  of Russia in the Context of the Current and Future World  Situation"]    [Text] And nevertheless, this global society about which  Aleksandr Zinovyev speaks, I believe, has not yet come to  Russia. When it does come is a matter of time, that is clear.  Russia is still a continent, still a civilization, such a  country which, evidently, does not immediately lend itself to  the onset of a global society. For some time to come, it will  remain with its own psychology and with its own character.    You say, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich, that you are an observer,  and we are participants, eyewitnesses. I will allow myself to  disagree with the fact that you are an observer, if only because  of the position which you take, even because of that pain with  which you speak about what is going on in Russia. After all,  your role here was a very important one. Important in that which  happened with Russia, as well as in that which is now happening  with Russia.    In one of the interviews, I believe with a Polish journal  given about a year ago, Vladimir Maksimov said goodby to Russia.  This was painful to hear, because you have a better view of the  state of affairs. You know the West better. You, knowing Russia,  look at it as if through sober eyes, from the side. Sometimes it  seems that we here cannot help but get accustomed to what is  happening. We get bogged down in that situation in which it  exists, and this hinders us from speaking and thinking in a  rational manner.    The situation really does press upon us, and to climb out  from under it is very difficult. You, it would seem, have the  opportunity to think independently. Yet I do not want to agree  with you.    Yes, the situation is desperate and difficult. But having  the  heart of a person living in Russia and being a Russian, I do not  want to agree. Specifically because people are listening to our  words. They want to know what we think. They are listening also  to your word, and in this sense you are not supporting us.  Perhaps it makes sense even to be cunning. Yes, to be cunning is  the last thing we should do. Yet, almost contrary to our own  opinion, we want to keep up hope in the people who are staying  in Russia and fighting for it.    Russia was quite recently a peasant country, by 80-90  percent. And the fact that it was a peasant country, that it had  its own ideology, the peasant ideology, could not disappear  right away. And it has not disappeared, but has become hidden  under some other ideology. But it still lives inside the people.  And perhaps, therein lies the hope...    Today Russia, it seems to me, listens more not even to the  patriotic press, but to common sense, which must ultimately  prevail. Russia understands it better. Especially after the  October events, when it is no longer necessary to convince  anyone, when the instrument which was used to makes fools of us  has fully exposed itself, fully shown itself. When one speaks  with people somewhere in the remote areas, one sees that the  people have gone on the defensive. They are digging in so as to  survive for the time being. To survive, to withstand this  terrible situation, and then to rise up with their attitude, in  order to raise up their country. And it is this sense of  self-preservation, it seems to me, that is being manifested in  the fact that our man does not see himself outside of statehood.  No matter how he might want to survive independently,  nevertheless survival takes place within a certain group. These  groups are expanding. They are becoming bigger and bigger.    Our man is sufficiently literate to understand that if  Russia  perishes, he too will perish... Recent years were very  important. They were frightening, but also important, because  they were very educational. Our economic managers, directors of  enterprises and kolkhozes [collective farms] and sovkhozes  [soviet farms] have been through great universities--political,  economic, and simply those of life. They now think quite  differently. This was several years ago when we were still  confused. Today this confusion has passed. Especially, I repeat,  since October. Today the economic managers know what to do. And  they are ready. And the people are also psychologically ready  for what they will have to overcome.    Then you say that everything is different now--civilization  is different, obviously, the West is different. And this West  will no longer tolerate Russia. The West "does not need the  truth about Russia," as Ilyin said. It needs a falsehood about  Russia which is convenient for it. But the very fact that the  West is speaking out against Russia with such persistence, is  trying to destroy it to the end, speaks of the fact that Russia  nevertheless exists, in spite of the physical force and the  economic force. It understands the power which it can be. It is  the power about which Dostoyevskiy spoke in his "Notes From the  Underground." This is not even power. It is something else, some  twist, some "aberration", when a man, in spite of everything,  does not agree with that which is beneficial for him, which is  important for him, and acts in an unbeneficial way, in such a  way as no one has ever acted. And this, perhaps, is specifically  what will happen in Russia.    Yes, we are being tempted by benefits. We are being tempted  by Western life, and specifically because they are tempting us,  the Russian man will act just the opposite. After all, just  look, advertising is not very effective. Somewhere in Moscow, in  the big cities, people take the bait. But in Russia, in its  depths, that which is imposed evokes hatred and rejection. In a  Siberian village they will not accept a product simply because  it is being imposed upon them. In just this same way, those  rules which are being imposed upon Russia cannot be accepted  because they are being too strongly imposed. A Russian person  always has a cautious and suspicious attitude toward something  that is being imposed upon him. He has always been independent,  and the "slave position" of our man is overly exaggerated.  "Slavery under communism" was also overexaggerated. The Russian  man has a mind of his own. He really was suppressed and  confused, but now he is coming to his senses. And how he will  show himself in another year or two, we still do not know. Yes,  the time is coming when people are starting to not believe in  anything. But when we turn our face in that direction (not to  the West, but to the East), our attitude changes.    During the time of discord, I believe, there were no  theoretical conferences about patriotism, about statehood.  People simply gathered in Nizhniy Novgorod, in Yaroslavl, and in  other cities, and began giving money, began bringing themselves,  their friends and their families to the ranks of the people's  volunteer corps. And ultimately they sacrificed everything. I do  not believe that all is lost. I do not believe it because I live  among these Russian people. If we do not retain hope, then what  is there to live for?</p>

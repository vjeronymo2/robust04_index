			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Russian central bank chairman resigns: Matiukhin blames a running dispute with parliament over interest rates THE chairman of the Russian central bank offered his resignation yesterday, blaming disputes with parliament, especially over interest rate policy, for his decision. Mr Georgy Matiukhin, in office for barely a year and the butt of ferocious criticism in the press and parliament, said his decision was final. The move seems set to be approved by parliament, which contains some of his sharpest critics. The resignation - which came on the day Russia formally joined the International Monetary Fund - throws open the sensitive arena of financial policy to a bitter political feud between government and president on the one side and parliament on the other over the choice of a successor and the setting of bank policy. Parliament is constitutionally responsible for the bank, but President Boris Yeltsin says the bank takes its orders from him, and the government has sought to exert pressure on it. This struggle is certain to become part of a larger conflict between president and parliament over the scope of presidential powers. Mr Yeltsin has promised to hold a referendum on the constitution, and on the private ownership of land - both issues on which he has been blocked by the deputies. If he attempts also to take the central bank out of parliament's control, the much-awaited showdown between the presidential and legislative levels of government could not be delayed further. Two possible replacement candidates have been much discussed in recent weeks as it became clear that Mr Matiukhin was under growingpressure. They are Mr Boris Feodorov, a senior official of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a former finance minister of Russia; and Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, former chairman of the Soviet State Bank (Gosbank), who commands considerable respect. Mr Feodorov would be the choice of the economic reformers in the cabinet, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister. However, Mr Gerashchenko, some 30 years his senior, may command support in parliament. Mr Matiukhin has been blamed for pushing interest rates up to 80 per cent; for starving enterprises of cash to pay wages and for restricting credit to the point where inter-enterprise debt has rocketed to the figure of Rbs1.7trillion. Mr Vladimir Arutunyan, head of Nefteexport, Russia's main oil exporting company, has resigned, Reuter reports. No reason was given for the move, which followed that of Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the country's energy minister, last week.</p>

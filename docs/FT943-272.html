			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Democrats attack in US Gatt row Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader in the US Senate, yesterday said he would hold a rare post-election session of Congress in order to win US ratification of the Uruguay Round trade legislation by the end of this year. Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the senate commerce committee, yesterday showed no sign of backing down from his intention to delay the legislation for 45 working days by holding 'a nationwide debate' over US trade policy. This would keep the legislation off the senate floor until after the congressional elections on November 8. The House is expected to vote and approve the Uruguay Round deal next Wednesday. A key Senate aide said: 'If Hollings does not back down, we will have a lame duck session. Gatt is not crucial to the elections, but it happens to be crucial to the country.' Senator Hollings, a longtime supporter of the textile industry, can delay senate action under special 'fast-track' rules, which require a yes or no vote on legislation implementing trade deals. Chairmen of committees that have jurisdiction over the legislation have 45 days to hold hearings. The American Textile Manufacturers' Institute yesterday said it was surprised by the senator's move to delay the senate vote. 'This legislation includes some vitally important provisions for the US textile industry,' it said in a statement. 'We support these provisions enthusiastically.' It said the damage done to textile producers by phasing out of quotas would be offset by the inclusion of a rule of origin that prevents countries from circumventing quotas limits. Between health care, foreign policy and partisan attack, President Bill Clinton has had little opportunity to sell the benefits of the trade pact. During the formal end-of-summit press conference with the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, he took the opportunity to urge approval of the Gatt agreement and advertise its merits. 'This is the biggest trade agreement in history,' he said. 'It will give us 300,000 to 500,000 new high-wage jobs in the next few years.' The foes of the Gatt deal have taken up Senator Holllings as a hero. 'We're impressed with Senator Hollings's courage on this issue,' said Mr Andrew Wheat, spokesman for the Gatt Project. Ms Caroline Kazdin, legislative director of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union, said the senator is doing the country 'a big service by bringing the substance of this thing to the public eye'. Polls suggest most voters know nothing about the Gatt deal, but when it is explained to them, they oppose it, she said. Although even most of the opponents believe the legislation will ultimately pass, they are by no means giving up their campaign against US ratification of the trade treaty. Mr Ralph Nader, the consumer activist who has joined with right-wing protectionists in opposition, yesterday offered a Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 6,329) prize to the first senator or representative who correctly answers 10 simple questions in person about the content of the Gatt deal and signs an affidavit affirming the he has read the text of Volume I of the three-Volume Gatt agreement.

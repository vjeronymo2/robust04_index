			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O'BANNON OF UCLA SUFFERS KNEE INJURY;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: FRESHMAN FROM ARTESIA HIGH INJURED IN PICKUP GAME. HE WILL HAVE  SURGERY, MISS THE SEASON.  </P> <P> Ed O'Bannon, who was projected as a possible basketball starter at UCLA as a  freshman, severely injured his left knee during a pickup game on campus Tuesday  night and will be sidelined for at least 12 months.  </P> <P> Tests showed Wednesday that he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament and  meniscus cartilage and will need surgery.  </P> <P> The accident occurred when he fell to the court after dunking and landed  awkwardly on his left leg. Bruin forward Don MacLean said the injury occurred  near the end of an informal five-on-five pickup session of UCLA basketball  players at the John Wooden Center.  </P> <P> "Who's to say if we had finished five minutes earlier, it never would have  happened?" said MacLean, who was playing opposite O'Bannon. "God, it's a  shame."  </P> <P> O'Bannon, a highly recruited 6-foot-8 forward from Artesia High in Lakewood,  told those who gathered around him as he lay on the floor that he had slipped  on some water on the court beneath the basket, but MacLean wasn't so sure.  </P> <P> "I think he just came down wrong on it, myself," MacLean said.  </P> <P> Although O'Bannon walked off the court unaided, he was examined by several of  the UCLA physical training staff, including basketball trainer Tony Spino, and  further tests were scheduled. A Magnetic Resonance Imaging test revealed the  extent of O'Bannon's injury.  </P> <P> The MRI was performed by J. David Grauer, an orthopedic surgeon and assistant  team physician. Grauer indicated that O'Bannon would need about a year to  recover from surgery, which has not yet been scheduled.  </P> <P> Coach Jim Harrick cut short a stay in the Palm Springs area and rushed back to  the campus after hearing the news. Harrick had gathered his coaching staff at a  desert resort to work out team personnel moves in detail and discuss the use of  players.  </P> <P> "We can just throw it out the window now," he said. "I really feel bad for the  young man. That's the worst part. Sure, this is certainly a big step back for  us because it changes the composition of the team dramatically, but it's the  kid and the family that it hurts the most."  </P> <P> O'Bannon, one of the more widely recruited players in the nation, averaged 24.6  points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.4 assists a game last season and led Artesia to a  29-2 record. The Pioneers won the Southern Section 4-A championship and the  state Division II championship.  </P> <P> O'Bannon was named most valuable player of the West team in the Dapper Dan  Classic, a high school All-Star game, and scored 19 points in the McDonald's  All-Star game. In July, he averaged 11.5 points a game and helped the U.S.  junior national team win the Championship of the Americas tournament in  Montevideo, Uruguay.  </P> <P> Amid such acclaim, O'Bannon also ended speculation on his playing future. He  decided to attend Nevada Las Vegas, the defending national champion, selecting  the Rebels over UCLA, USC and Arizona State. However, O'Bannon and another  prized UNLV recruit, 6-foot-5 Shon Tarver, a guard from Santa Clara High in  Oxnard, did not sign letters of intent with the university.  </P> <P> When UNLV was barred from the postseason tournament for NCAA sanctions stemming  from incidents of 13 years ago, O'Bannon and Tarver were free to go to another  school. Both chose UCLA.  </P> <P> O'Bannon's injury is a major blow to the Bruins, who were anticipating that he  would move smoothly into the gap left by forward Trevor Wilson, now with the  Atlanta Hawks. Now, Harrick may chose to fill that spot with 6-9 freshman  Rodney Zimmerman of Colorado Springs, 6-7 sophomore Zan Mason, who had  reportedly considered transferring from UCLA because of an anticipated lack of  playing time, or 6-8 senior Keith Owens, a former walk-on.  </P> <P> NCAA rules forbid practice sessions in the presence of coaches until Oct. 15,  the first day of organized practice. But pickup games are considered routine  and are acceptable to the NCAA, according to Chuck Smrt of the enforcement  division.  </P> <P> MacLean said O'Bannon had stolen the ball and driven to the basket. The next  thing MacLean knew, O'Bannon was writhing on the floor, crying out in pain.  </P> <P> "He went up and dunked and everything was normal, then he came down," MacLean  said. "I saw it. It didn't look like anything out of the ordinary. But he  started yelling and screaming about his knee.  </P> <P> "He actually got up and walked off the court after a while. I thought he was  OK. I came back about an hour and a half later and they tell me he screwed up  his knee."  </P> <P> Guard Gerald Madkins, who was playing on MacLean's team, said it was just bad  luck.  </P> <P> Madkins knows how it feels to be injured. He was sidelined for the 1988-89  season after he was seriously injured in a head-on collision when a car struck  the moped he was driving. Madkins suffered multiple fractures of his pelvis and  a torn abdominal muscle. After two operations, Madkins returned to the UCLA  team.  </P> <P> "It's tough on a young guy and I know how it affects you mentally," Madkins  said. "We pray for him. Let's hope he gets through this thing OK, because we're  going to need him."  </P></p>

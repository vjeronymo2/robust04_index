			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> ANTI-CRIME FUNDS PERILED  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed 1989-90 state budget would virtually  eliminate a new program to combat crimes generated by bigotry -- a program that  the Republican governor publicly praised just last month. Steven Owyang,  executive and legal affairs secretary of the Fair Employment and Housing  Commission, said the pioneer program, including films showing the public how to  use a little-known state law against so-called "hate crimes," could be a  casualty of a $204,000 commission cutback proposed by Deukmejian. On Jan. 24,  Deukmejian had praised the commission on its 30th anniversary and cited its  efforts to increase public awareness of the Ralph Civil Rights Act and its  provisions. An Adminstration spokesman expressed surprise at the possible  budget effects on the commission's operation.  </P></p>

Among the instruments described  (all accompanied by their pertinent technical specifications) is  a high-resolution thermal imager for low-orbit satellites.  Another is the ``Klimat'' IR radiometer which is part of the  Meteor-3 meteorological satellite. This radiometer is used for  the registry of thermal images and measurements of the radiation  temperature of cloud cover and the surface (ice and snow cover,  rivers and seas, forests and other natural formations). The  high-resolution MSU-V multispectral scanner, a part of the  ``Okean'' space system, is used for observing the surface in  eight spectral ranges. A multispectral pyrometer was developed  for measuring energy brightness and surface temperature for  constructing synoptic charts of thermal gradients and studying  the radiation balance of the Earth and atmosphere from aboard  the Mir orbital station. A hemispherical radiometer was  developed for measuring terrestrial radiation fluxes and global  temperature sounding of the atmosphere. Different kinds of  thermal imagers also have been developed for aircraft and  helicopters and are briefly described. Fuller descriptions of  these instruments and systems are given in the cited literature.  Figures 3; references: 8 Russian.</p>

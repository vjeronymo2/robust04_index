			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Friday [18 February] denied reports that he and  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura are at loggerheads  and that he wants to remove Takemura from the key cabinet post.  "We are not hostile to each other at all and we are in very  close contact," the premier said at a session of the House of  Representatives budget committee in response to opposition  questioner Michio Watanabe.    Takemura told the same session, "I think we are on good  terms. I don't think we are on bad terms."    Hosokawa was responding to a question as to why he sounded  out Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior legislator of the Sakigake  (Harbinger) group founded by Takemura, on whether he is ready to  take over as a cabinet member in case Takemura cannot remain in  the cabinet.    Watanabe, a former foreign minister, pressed Hosokawa to  clarify "whether you want to replace your chief cabinet  secretary." "Why did your relations deteriorate?" He asked.    Hosokawa told the session many press reports are wrong.    But later on Friday, Hosokawa attended a reception for  members of his Japan New Party and said, "my reformist  administration is over. It has entered a second stage."    Political analysts said Hosokawa implied an intention to  reorganize the cabinet by saying that his administration has  entered a new stage.    Earlier this week, speculation ran high that Hosokawa will  carry out an early cabinet reshuffle and remove Takemura from  the post of chief cabinet secretary. On Monday the prime  minister said he is considering to reshape the cabinet, launched  last August.    Faced with strong opposition from Takemura's Sakigake and  the  Social Democratic Party, the biggest group in Hosokawa's  seven-party coalition, Hosokawa retreated later and said  Wednesday, "the issue is still a blank piece of paper and I am  not working on the assumption that I should conduct it  immediately."    Takemura, leader of the 14-member Sakigake, reportedly  alienated Hosokawa and Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa over his  opposition to the pair's proposal to slap a new 7 percent  indirect tax on goods and services.    Ozawa, a key strategist in the ruling coalition, was  reported  late last year to have urged Hosokawa to remove Takemura from  the key cabinet post.    Meanwhile, a senior official in Hosokawa's seven-party  coalition denied that Sakigake is softening its opposition to  the cabinet reshuffle and leaning toward accepting the removal  of Takemura. He said Sakigake will not accept a proposal to  transfer Takemura to another cabinet post if he gives in to  pressure to quit the office of chief cabinet secretary, whose  constant contacts with the press gives it special political  advantages.</p>

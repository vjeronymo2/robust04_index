			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Powerscreen up 18% on lower costs POWERSCREEN International, the Northern Ireland-based maker of mobile screening and stone crushing equipment, increased interim pre-tax profits by 18 per cent, in spite of the decline in the UK construction sector and weakness of the dollar. The pre-tax figure rose to Pounds 11.2m from Pounds 9.43m, restated at a lower level to include the write-off of R &amp; D spending. Powerscreen's share price responded with a 13p rise to 283p. Turnover rose 22 per cent to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 42m). Included for the first time was Finlay Engineering, which contributed Pounds 5.5m. Another acquisition called Matbro, a maker of agricultural equipment, chipped in Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 1.3m). Together they accounted for about 10 per cent of profits. Mr Shay McKeown, chairman, said reasons for the continued growth included low-cost production helped by use of sub-contract labour and standardised products, 'catering for customer needs rather than our own vanities' and 'avoiding overheads'. The profit figure would have been Pounds 450,000 better if the dollar-sterling exchange rate had stayed the same. The impact of the weak dollar on translation of US figures showed through in the decline in the North American share of turnover from 38 to 31 per cent. The UK's share slipped from 31 to 29 per cent in spite of help from acquisitions. This lost ground was more than made up by rapid sales expansion in continental Europe, which accounted for 30 (22) per cent of sales, and in south-east Asia. Big increases in infrastructure spending in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, for instance, helped Brown Lenox to push up sales to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.9m) in spite of contraction in the UK. Powerscreen Distribution, the biggest subsidiary, saw sales advance by 4 per cent to Pounds 18.9m. Mr McKeown said increased sales of larger screening units had helped offset dollar and UK weaknesses. Interest costs were again negligible. After the Pounds 5.3m acquisition of CPV, a maker of stainless steel containers, debt stood at Pounds 1.5m. The group would be cash positive by the year-end, he added. Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 9.6p (8.3p). The interim dividend goes up to 1.8p (1.7p). COMMENT Powerscreen's nimbleness in switching to more buoyant markets when established beats sag is amply illustrated by its vigorous penetration of south-east Asian markets. That part of the world - with considerable potential for infrastructure development - is being talked of as a third leg to the business alongside Europe and North America. Short term, the company will receive a fillip from the pound's devaluation, as from its latest acquisition. Full-year pre-tax profit is forecast to rise to more than Pounds 22m from Pounds 18.8m, a prospective p/e of nearly 15. Its strong track record, continued overseas growth and recovery potential in the US and UK argue for a small premium. Some might say the premium is there if account is taken of the low tax charge and high market value relative to turnover. After a good run, the stock remains a strong hold.</p>

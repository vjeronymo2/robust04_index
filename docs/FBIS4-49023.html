			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA)--The Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] has sent a letter to  Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] today inviting the  latter anew to send SEF personnel and related experts to  Hangzhou to hear briefings by experts handling the Qiandao Lake  case.    The letter says that in accordance with the law, relevant  departments on the China mainland protect the lives and property  of Taiwan compatriots touring, visiting relatives, doing  business, and making investment on the mainland. Regarding  cases of the lives and property of Taiwan compatriots being  infringed upon, the mainland authorities will investigate and  deal with them should they take place, and handle them according  to the law. The "Qiandao Lake" case has served as an example.  In principle, ARATS agrees to exchange views with Taiwan's SEF  on incidents jeopardizing the lives and property of mainland and  Taiwan compatriots that have occurred now and then in  cross-strait exchanges and contacts in recent years. In the  wake of the "Qiandao Lake" incident, compatriots in Taiwan as  well as on the China mainland have pinned greater hopes on ARATS  and SEF pushing forward cross-strait relations. We should work  hard to promote the aforesaid discussion's bearing fruit. For  this purpose, ARATS has already enthusiastically made  suggestions on the agenda and contents in exchanging views.    The letter says that ARATS has already continuously provided  SEF with facts regarding the crimes of the culprits and the  situation at the scene. Regarding the autopsy reports, verbal  briefings will be given when SEF experts arrive in Hangzhou.</p>

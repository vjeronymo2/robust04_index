			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASY DOES IT;  </P> <P> MEN'S SPRING FASHIONS  </P> <P> This spring, look for a softer silhouette in menswear. Shoulders are slightly  rounded and gently shaped, creating a more natural form than the rigid lines of  recent seasons, and the look continues with the generally looser fit of  ventless jackets and pleated pants. Fabrics such as linen, lightweight wool,  silk and rayon hold their shape, but they also drape gracefully. Two- and  four-button, double-breasted suits with peaked or notched lapels are prominent  designs, but they are softer and less serious than in previous collections,  especially when worn with a colorful shirt.  </P> <P> Most trousers are uncuffed, usually with multiple soft pleats, and some  designers have dispensed with the center crease (but try telling that to the  dry cleaners). For fashion-conscious men today, color defines an individual's  style. Over the past few seasons, even conservative businessmen have been  inching their way into red, yellow and pink ties against gray suits and navy  blazers. Boldly printed 3- to 4-inch-wide ties with designs lifted from the  '30s and '40s can make a personal statement against the most conservative suit  and shirt. If a wide tie is unacceptable, bright, solid-color, 2-inch-wide knit  ties will narrow the focus. Brightly colored socks, belts or shirts also can be  juxtaposed with neutral colors. And for the few who are completely fearless,  bold color -- eggplant purple, tomato red, marigold yellow -- can be worn  full-force in jackets and trousers.  </P> <P> Because Southern California is a hub of creative professions from entertainment  to art, fashion, food and architecture, men here seem to feel easier about  wearing color than do their counterparts in Midwestern or East Coast areas. The  accepted theory is that the more creative a man's profession, the more color he  can wear.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Styled by Lauren Ehrenfeld.

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / The Long View: Cheques and balances THIS IS is no time to be a banker. Humble clerks are kept awake at night with fears of redundancy, and there is no security at the top either: after this week's stepping aside by Sir John Quinton at Barclays only one of the Big Four's chief executives has been in place for much more than a year, and none appears to have gone exactly to schedule. The survivor is, of course, Lloyd's Brian Pitman, the main driving force behind his bank's controversial bid for Midland. One statistic is relevant here: in March, bank and building society lending actually fell (by some Pounds 500m), the first time this has happened for many years. Bank customers in aggregate actually repaid part of the principal, as well as stumping up the interest. It is difficult to exaggerate how shattering this experience of contraction is to the banking industry. Rapid growth rates have been the experience for many years. Manufacturing industry may have suffered recessions, but this never seemed to apply to the banking sector. In difficult times inflation came to the rescue. Look at M4, not a motorway to Wales but the broad definition of the quantity of money, which includes bank and building society deposits. Money is the banks' raw material and it has grown in quantity from Pounds 97bn at the start of 1980 to Pounds 510bn. Until about 1985 the government was attempting half-heartedly to control monetary growth but then it more or less gave up the struggle. The banking industry boomed, and the annual growth rate of M4 rose from 14 per cent in 1984 to 19 per cent at the beginning of 1990. On the other side of the balance sheet, lending was bounding ahead. At the start of 1980 the outstanding volume of house purchase loans was Pounds 45bn, but now it is over Pounds 320bn: an annual growth rate of 18 per cent. By 1990 interest rates had reached 15 per cent and the government was forced to trigger a recession in order to prevent inflation running riot. The year-on-year M4 growth rate has plummeted to 5.6 per cent and may still be falling (building societies suffered an outflow of funds of Pounds 172m in March); in real terms monetary growth is therefore just about nil, which is why monetarists are so pessimistic about the prospects for economic recovery, and bankers are getting into such a mess. The demand for money was high in the 1980s because the real cost of borrowing appeared to be so low. This real cost was best measured not in terms of retail prices but of asset prices: the prices of shares (until 1987) and houses (until 1989) went up far faster than the interest accumulated on borrowings. The final surge of borrowing was in 1989 and 1990 by acquisitive companies, which thought that the value of properties and businesses would continue to climb indefinitely. Huge bad debts have subsequently been incurred by the banks on this final phase of the lending boom. Bad debt provisions in aggregate by the Big Four clearers were Pounds 5.6bn for 1991, and this week a County NatWest study suggested there could be up to another Pounds 4bn of clearing bank provisions still to come against property debts alone. Now the real cost of borrowing has become very high. Asset prices are unexciting: true, share prices hit an all-time peak this week, but the growth in the All-Share Index over the past year has only been about 6 per cent, not enough to make borrowing to buy shares worthwhile, and property prices are still falling. Will the banks and building societies manage their contraction any better than they managed their expansion? There are grave risks of a further decline in the quality as well as the quantity of their loans. We are seeing creditworthy companies paying off bank borrowings through equity and bond issues. But the troubled corporate customers will remain in debt, and interest is rolling up at 12 to 15 per cent a year. Home owners are paying off their mortgages where they can, but those in difficulties are caught in a trap from which there is no escape. People have been scared, and for many years home buyers are likely to take out the smallest mortgage they can get away with rather than the biggest loan they can afford. The instinct of the squeezed lenders is to raise their margins to cover the bad debts. The good borrowers will pay for the bad. We heard a lot of squeals from the small business sector last year as this increase in rates and charges was put into effect. Not only is such a shift perceived to be unfair, but there is a further encouragement for sound customers to seek other forms of financing. Foreign banks may find lucrative opportunities to cream off the good quality business - although fortunately for the British banks a lot of the once-powerful overseas competitors have their own problems. Not so Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, however. The Hongkong Bank's intervention represents a serious threat to the other clearers. They had hoped that Midland, as financially the weakest of the Big Four, would be forced to bear the greatest burden of the industry's retrenchment. But Midland could be shored up by Far East money. Any recovery in the pathetic returns on shareholders' capital in the British banking industry could be postponed, and the other clearers could be forced to shrink more drastically instead. No wonder Lloyds felt obliged to adopt desperate tactics by launching (well, almost launching) the first contested takeover bid for an English High Street bank. Doubtless the public - especially those noisy small businessmen - will celebrate the prospect of Lloyds being beaten off by the Monopolies Commission. But shareholders and staff of the other banks should worry. There is no M4 escape route any more. Serious Money: Page II</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WATER SUPPLY SITUATION CALLS FOR LEVELHEADEDNESS  </P> <P> The San Clemente City Council, responding to a severe shortage in the city  water reservoir, has drafted what experts have called the toughest  water-rationing law in the state. But because residents and businesses  responded so well to the city's pleas for conservation, the water supply is  near normal, and the council has decided there is no need to enact the law now.  </P> <P> This does not mean, however, that the community should go back to its  water-wasting ways. Water conservation is a good habit to get into, not only  when there is a drought but also as an everyday practice.  </P> <P> San Clemente's proposed ordinance regulating developers, businesses and  commercial users has emergency mandatory conservation cutbacks set at specific  water level stages with fines imposed for violations. That would help control  non-residential use.  </P> <P> There is one simple way homeowners can easily conserve large amounts of water  without inconvenience: Follow the advice of experts on lawn care. Lawns and  landscaping account for about half of all residential water use, and most  people use about twice as much water as their lawns need.  </P> <P> Conservation makes sense. It saves residents money. But, most important, it  saves scarce water that should be used wisely and sparingly, no matter how high  the reservoir might be today.  </P></p>

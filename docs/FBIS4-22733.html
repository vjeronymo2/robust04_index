The new realities of the modern world have resulted in the  emergence of new opportunities for the states of the  Asia-Pacific region relative to Russia in view of: its role in  possible elimination of tension on the Korean Peninsula;  negotiations between Moscow and Tokyo over the future of four  islands in the Kuril archipelago that would have been  unimaginable literally just a few years ago; the clear interest  by South Korea, Japan and, to some extent, China in relations  with Siberia and the Russian Far East, which they believe with  their investments could become a new source of economic growth  in Asia; and reduction of Russia's armed forces and military  presence in the Asia-Pacific region.    Analysis indicates that on the whole Russia's role as the  subject and object of policy in the region has shifted from a  leading role to one on a par with Australia, Taiwan or South  Korea. This was the inevitable result, of the one hand, of the  disintegration of the USSR and, on the other, of policy by the  Russian MFA that is not adequate to the newly emerging  conditions of the international situation. In addition, the  states in the region remain somewhat cautious with regard to  Russia's political future.    Much greater concern currently exists due to the fact that  one now finds a paradoxical situation in the Asia-Pacific region  as a result of lessening East-West confrontation: disarmament by  the great powers is prompting efforts by the smaller states to  arm, negatively affecting security in the region.    What is the reason for this paradoxical situation, in which  not a single state in the region has taken advantage of the  peace dividend to reduce its defense expenditures? One must  define several of the most significant factors. The first is  economic conflicts within the Asia-Pacific region. The unequal  economic development of states in the region contributes to a  certain degree to tensions based on envy -- North Korea,  Cambodia and the Philippines have found themselves left out of  economic prosperity.    Distrust and hostility in relations between the United  States  and Japan have tremendous destructive potential, due to American  dissatisfaction over the closed nature of the Japanese market,  the Japanese economic invasion of the United States, and tax  evasion or failure to pay taxes by Japanese companies operating  in the United States. It has been asserted that over the long  term a possible emotional gap could tear apart the  Washington-Tokyo alliance and replace it with keen competition  which would undoubtedly impact other Asian countries and the  region's security as well.    There is a fairly great likelihood that economic and  consequently political disputes will arise between the states  that comprise the "Asian economic realm," the North American  free trade zone (NAFTA) and the European Union. Even now East  Asia accounts for 62 percent of world automotive production, 82  percent of telecommunications manufacturing and 81 percent of  computer equipment production. According to a projection by the  Japanese Center for Economic Research made in February 1992, by  the year 2010 the "Asian economic realm," extending from eastern  Russia to Myanmar and including both Australia and New Zealand,  is expected to be producing as many goods and services as North  and South America combined. Asia's overall GNP will be $11.8  trillion, in comparison with $11.2 trillion for North and South  America and $11.4 trillion for Western Europe. In 2010 prices  Japan alone will have a GNP of $16 trillion, or 84 percent of  the U.S. GNP. In this situation it is very likely that there  will be sharp competition, particularly between East Asia and  NAFTA, and that could significantly affect stability in the  region.    Another group of disputes stem from the struggle for  political leadership in Asia and the various concomitant  manifestations of various peoples' national consciousness.    We are beginning to see the prospect of a Greater China  being  formed through a merger of the PRC's economically developed  coastal provinces with the economies of Taiwan, Hong Kong and  Macao. Eventually Greater China could become the main force  capable of opposing the Japanese economic battering ram.    In South Korea there are some politicians and business  people  who dream of a "Greater Korea." They believe that after  reunification Korea could become one of the most important  economic zones in the world, with the one million ethnic Koreans  in China and the approximately 300,000 in Russia added to  Korea's population of 70 million. They also include the  surrounding Chinese and Russian population, coming up with the  possibility of creating a demographic base of 200 million people  and, consequently, a new center for the Asian economy.    The question is how fast Korean unification can proceed.  Considering Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, it is possible that  the agreement reached by North and South Korea in December 1991  regarding nuclear-free status for the Korean Peninsula, economic  exchanges, rapprochement and unification might not be  implemented. On the other hand, politicians literally break out  in a cold sweat at the thought of a unified Korea with nuclear  weapons. Furthermore, much remains unclear about how North Korea  will behave after Kim Il-Song is gone.    A certain degree of unclarity exists concerning China's  political outlook in the post-Deng Xiaoping era. Specifically,  analysts are considering the possibility of political  instability and disorder in China, as a result of which a flood  of refugees could pour into the Southeast Asian countries.  However, there are clear signals that although there are fairly  serious disagreements and a certain degree of ideological  instability within the Chinese Communist Party -- China's ruling  party -- Chinese communists are united against the threat of  disorder, anarchy and spontaneous disintegration of their  country.    However, the Chinese leadership understands the needs for  accelerated reforms in the economy, as successes in that area  would undoubtedly be a factor in the stability of Chinese  society. Therefore one may assume with a fair degree of  certainty that though there might be some retrenchment after  Deng Xiaoping due to a stronger position for the conservative  political wing of the Chinese leadership, it is likely that this  would be followed by stronger reformist tendencies.    One significant factor is the current state and outlook for  development of Russo-Chinese relations. Here no struggle for  leadership is at issue. Geopolitical interests -- mutual efforts  to ensure the security of borders, a need to ensure favorable  external conditions so that reforms can be implemented,  Beijing's interest in Russian economy and military capability,  reduction of the two sides' armed forces and armaments, stronger  confidence-building measures, Russia's interest in developing  economic and military relations with China, and, finally, a  certain mutual attraction in the search for a counterweight  against the West's political offensive -- all prompt Russia and  China to seek means of rapprochement.    One significant obstacle to the development of relations  could be a possible upsurge in Chinese nationalism and the  pro-Western slant which, in the opinion of the Chinese, exists  in Russia's policy. A significant negative role could also be  played by the personality factor when members of the "Cultural  Revolution" generation come to power in China.    However, both sides are interested in developing economic  cooperation. That interest is reinforced by mutual pragmatism,  as a result of which certain differences on various issues would  not likely be allowed to stand in the way.    Much remains unclear regarding Sino-American relations.  China, in its effort to assume an appropriate place in the new  world political structure, has unofficially accepted a mission  as leader of the developing countries. In the opinion of Chinese  political scientists, the disintegration of the USSR is a  fait accompli and the USSR will never be reborn.  Meanwhile, according to them, the United States, which remains  the sole superpower in the world, is losing influence. China is  outraged by the fact that since the collapse of the USSR the  United States feels that it has a right to intervene in the  internal affairs of other countries and impose its own values.  China believes that the new world order should be based on fair  political and economic principles in order to prevent a widening  of the gap between a wealthy North and an impoverished South.    Nevertheless, China definitely does not intend to get into  an  open confrontation with the United States. It remains interested  in developing relations with the leading Western countries  because it needs new technology and investment. In the opinion  of Chinese political scientists, the fact that in the future  global disputes may develop along West-West lines (between the  United States, Western Europe and Japan) could give Beijing  greater room for political and diplomatic maneuvering.    It is quite possible that as disputes between the various  sides become more numerous their relations will be typified by  ever-increasing harshness. It is also possible that the United  States, in its usual forceful manner, might attempt to force  China to behave in a way that is advantageous to the United  States. How successful the Americans are in doing so would  largely depend on Russia's position.</p>

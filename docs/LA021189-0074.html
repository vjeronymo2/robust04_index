			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSCAR, COME HOME  </P> <P> It is a sad commentary on today's society that art director Lyle Wheeler's five  Oscars, including one that he was given for "Gone With the Wind," are to be  sold ("The Diary of Lyle Wheeler's Oscars," by Daniel Cerone, Feb. 8).  </P> <P> The yuppie couple who by chance came to possess the Oscars remind me of the  characters in "Gone With the Wind" who tried to buy Tara out from under the  impoverished O'Hara family. I'm sure that when Wheeler won the Oscar he had no  idea that 50 years later life would be imitating art.  </P> <P> The five statuettes should be returned to Wheeler immediately as a kindness to  a man who is so much a part of Hollywood history.  </P> <P> LORELAI KUDE  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

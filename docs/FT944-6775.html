			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Markets: The point of maximum danger - Global Investor If you take the word of 40 leading European industrialists, the region's manufacturing companies are now at the 'point of maximum danger' in the economic cycle. The report, prepared by the European Round Table ahead of next month's European summit in Essen, also argues that it is an illusion to believe that economic recovery signals an end to Europe's competitiveness crisis. The authors are right to draw that conclusion. Nine-month trading figures from Bayer and Hoechst, the German chemical and drug giants, which are expected today and Wednesday respectively, are likely to confirm many of the points raised. Pre-tax profits are expected to have rebounded from last year's depressed levels, but margins in some product areas are expected to show the effects of growing competition. In chemicals and petrochemicals in particular, the breathing space which margins have enjoyed recently may be shortlived. Competitors' new capacity which comes onstream shortly in Asia and America is expected to increase competition both in those countries and within Europe. The authors are right to point out, too, that one of the threats to profits is that wage settlements will edge upwards. They argue that at this stage in the economic cycle manufacturers often 'let loose' on costs, especially wages. Given the current backdrop of continent-wide industrial unrest, investors would be wrong to dismiss that threat. The authors may, though, make rather too much of this factor; it is too early to conclude from the current disputes that Europe's historically rigid wage structures have persisted through recession intact. The report's gloominess about Europe's high costs of energy, telecommunications and transport may also be warranted. When such markets are deregulated, the reduction in costs can be rapid: the liberalisation of European voice telephony, combined with privatisation of many of the telecommunications operators, is a case in point. Siemens, the German industrial group, says that European prices for switching and transmission equipment have fallen in real terms by about 7 per cent in each of the last three years, and by even more in Germany. The cause is partly recession and partly the increasingly open procurement policies adopted by its customers, including Deutsche Telekom, Germany's state-owned telecoms monopoly, whose privatisation is forthcoming. But while companies across Europe will eventually benefit from lower telephone charges, the liberalisation puts great pressure on the margins of suppliers, such as Siemens. Last year it reported a fall in new orders, and analysts are concerned that, despite spending 15 per cent of revenues in its communications divisions on research and development, it will struggle to hold margins and market share within Europe. The paradox is that European companies want the benefits of liberalisation - such as lower utility costs which will enable them to compete better abroad  -but resent such measures when they stimulate competition on those companies' home turf. Similarly, while the 40 companies represented in the Round Table have called for cuts in public spending, much of the European pharmaceutical industry has been threatening governments that if public spending on drugs continues to be squeezed, great damage will be done to research and development, and so to the competitiveness of some of Europe's largest companies. In some sectors, the opposition of Europe's largest companies to such cost-reduction measures may stall them completely. Tomorrow's meeting in Brussels of European Union energy ministers will serve to highlight the obstacles to the Commission's drive to liberalise Europe's energy markets. The proposals to allow rival energy companies access to countries' power distribution networks has met with ferocious complaints from power companies. Given such opposition, investors may well be sceptical that European institutions will in the end be willing to make the changes necessary for competitiveness. That should not, though, distract investors from concern they should also feel about the prices paid for investments outside Europe. Not least, European chemical and pharmaceutical companies have made a string of forays in the past year into healthcare in the US, Asia and Eastern Europe. Hoechst, for one, has spent heavily on moving into emerging east European markets, and is negotiating several joint ventures in China. Mr Jurgen Dormann, Hoechst's chairman, has said that he aims to double sales in Asia to 20 per cent of group turnover. But the concern for investors is whether that is an adequately profitable escape from competition at home, given the ferocious competition already present in non-European markets. Mr Dormann acknowledged earlier this month that Hoechst had 'perhaps' paid too high a premium in last year's Dollars 546m purchase of 51 per cent of Copley, the US generic drugs maker. Moreover, despite Hoechst's anxiety to add several more mid-sized pharmaceuticals companies to its recently-acquired US interests in generic drugs, it says that it is waiting until acquisition multiples become more reasonable. It may have a long wait, however: there is little sign that they are doing so. Meanwhile, as investors brace themselves to hear the price paid in the sector's next takeover, they cannot afford to take too much comfort from the recovery of core earnings. While this week's results should confirm that picture, that is no guarantee that profit margins will be intact five years from now.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 24/11/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  % change over period                        US    Japan    Germany   France    Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 0.11    0.04      0.09      0.10      0.16   0.09 Month                0.42    0.19      0.41      0.45      0.70   0.46 Year                 3.69    2.06      5.31      5.82      8.63   5.19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                  0.48   0.65      0.73      0.79      0.37   0.61 Month                -0.04   1.08      1.35      1.35      1.48   2.19 Year                 -2.32  -0.35      0.98      0.28      3.44   0.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                  0.32   0.91      1.47      1.69      0.52   1.26 Month                -0.19   1.44      2.80      2.40      1.86   3.32 Year                 -6.31  -1.44     -2.56     -5.02     -2.20  -2.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                  -2.8   -2.8      -2.0      -2.5      -1.6   -2.8 Month                 -1.9   -5.6       1.2       4.6       0.3    0.6 Year                   0.7    1.4      -0.1      -2.6      21.4    3.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

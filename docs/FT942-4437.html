			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bangladesh sets out to streamline jute industry - A World Bank-backed restructuring programme Bangladesh's jute industry, once the glory of the country's economy but more recently a morass of bad debts, over-manning and decrepit equipment, has embarked on its biggest-ever restructuring programme. With the help of a USDollars 250m loan from the World Bank, the government has in the past year started cutting labour and closing redundant mills. Already some 12,000 workers have gone with generous retirement pay and a further 8,000 are to leave in the next few months. But there are doubts about whether the ruling party can complete the programme for fear of generating a political backlash. With a general election due in early 1996, or before, Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, is already under pressure to avoid electorally-unpopular moves. The scheme will ease the government's burden of financing the state-owned industry, which has accumulated losses since 1972 of 50bn taka (USDollars 1bn). Streamlining the industry will also reduce costs for the surviving mills, enhancing their ability to compete successfully in world markets both in traditional goods such as matting and new products such as jute-based paper and reinforcing material for dams. The restructuring programme includes privatisation of 18 jute mills and the closing of nine others to bring the number of looms down from 25,000 to 19,000. The government estimates that Bangladesh can sell 450,000 tonnes of jute goods annually, which can be produced with 19,000 looms. Four jute mills have already closed. Nine are to be privatised by the end of 1995 and the remaining nine by December 1996. The government will retain only two jute mills which are probably too big to be taken over by the private sector. The restructuring programme provides financial support to the jute mills so that one-third of the debts can be written off and two thirds will be repaid over 15 years after a three year moratorium. The outstanding loan will bear only 3 per cent interest, 2 per cent below the country's bank rate. The banks will also finance exports for the next three years. Jute accounts for 12 per cent of Bangladesh's gross domestic product and 20 per cent of exports. About 5m people out of 118m are dependent on jute production and processing. Once called the golden fibre, jute declined after the nationalisation of the industry in 1972, partly through inefficient operation and partly through the growing popularity of nylon and other synthetic materials. Annual world production of jute has remained static at 3.1m tonnes over the last two decades. About 920,000 tonnes a year are exported by the producing countries - Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Nepal. Bangladesh, the biggest exporter, supplies 480,000 tonnes and India 215,000 tonnes. Worries about the environment have opened up opportunities for promoting jute as a green biodegradeable product. But the demand for new products is in its infancy and prices remain low.</p>

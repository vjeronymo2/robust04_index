			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Technology: Designers check out the chip library - A quick way to produce 'mixed signals' In the electronics industry, last year's product is already a dinosaur. The market lifetime of many types of electronic products is shrinking rapidly, forcing manufacturers to accelerate design and development cycles. One bottleneck has been the development of custom semiconductor chips; devices that are designed to meet the specifications for a particular product. In the digital world of computers, several short-cut 'semi-custom' approaches to chip design are well established. But bridging the digital and 'real world' of analogue signals is more difficult. Demand for such 'mixed signal' chips is rising with the use of increasingly sophisticated electronics in, for example, cars, household appliances and industrial control applications. The automatic breaking systems found on some cars and the control devices used in washing machines require both digital and analogue circuits. Home automation, lighting control and any type of motor control also span the digital to analogue divide. Producing such combinations of digital, analogue, power and memory circuits on a single chip, to provide lower cost, smaller and more reliable devices, is one of the most challenging tasks facing the semiconductor industry. Doing so fast enough to keep pace with accelerating product life cycles is even more demanding. Taking a new approach to the problem, Texas Instruments, the leading US chip maker, has devised a new design method it calls Prism based upon 'reusable engineering'. In concept, Prism methodology can be likened to a library that has integrated circuit elements on its shelves instead of books. When a customer outlines a need for a new semiconductor, the TI design team does not have to create it from scratch. Instead, the engineers can go to the 'library', find predefined modules and re-use them to meet the customers' needs. The techniques make it easier to customise semiconductors, meaning designers can add unique capabilities to their products more quickly than their competitors, providing a critical time-to-market advantage. The chip design time can be cut from a year to as little as three months, and full production can be achieved in just six months, TI claims. Prism also permits a new level of integration - combining multiple semiconductors with different functions on a single chip - thus decreasing the component count in new electronic systems by as much as 50 per cent. 'Prism methodology addresses a number of our customers' most important concerns,' said Tom Engibous, senior vice-president of TI's semiconductor group. 'It shortens time-to-market, reduces development cost, lowers component count and makes it easier to design the end products. Current customers in automotive electronics have been pleased with the results enabled by Prism methodology, and we are expanding its use into other areas.' Another important element of the Prism approach is that it permits reuse of test programs and qualification data, meaning new test procedures do not have to be redefined for each product. This represents a significant step forward in reducing the time required to get a new chip to market. The Prism concept also extends to the manufacturing process, which is segmented into modules so that only the steps that are needed to produce a specific chip are used. An important advance achieved by TI has been to squeeze power transistors, used in high-voltage applications, into the same miniature geometries that are standard for digital circuitry. For the end user, faster development of more highly-integrated chips promises lower prices and more features. In the automotive market, for example, automatic breaking, cruise control and other features found mostly on top-of-the-line expensive cars can be expected on lower cost models.</p>

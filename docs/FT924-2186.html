			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Monday Interview: Keynesian in from the cold - Cambridge economist Wynne Godley talks to Peter Marsh Six months ago the notion of Mr Norman Lamont turning for policy ideas to Professor Wynne Godley - long-time critic of the Tory government and arch-dissident of UK economics - would have seemed fantastic. So it is a measure of how far the government's approach has changed since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in mid-September that Prof Godley was named last week as a member of a new seven-strong panel of economists set up by the Treasury to advise the chancellor. The 66-year-old Cambridge economist - and one-time Treasury forecaster and professional oboe player - is probably Britain's best-known Keynesian economist. Ever since he entered academic life in 1970, he has made himself unpopular with UK free-market economists and politicians by calling for strong government intervention, especially to strengthen Britain's manufacturing base. Prof Godley is often described by fellow economists as a doomsayer. He has warned continuously since the mid-1970s that unless Britain takes action to increase manufactured exports and reduce imports, its big trade deficit will produce structural imbalances that will lead to long recessions and high unemployment. His intense blue eyes, shock of white hair and stooping gait give Prof Godley the appearance of a biblical prophet. He has certainly been in the wilderness. During the mid-1980s, Prof Godley's ideas were distinctly out of favour owing to the widespread feeling that Britain had solved many of its economic problems as a result of the free-market approach of Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher. But in the past two years, as Britain has stumbled into its longest recession since the 1930s, the professor has come back into fashion. Today, his prescriptions for state action to promote recovery fit in with the mood both of a recession-weary Britain, and of a government willing to try new approaches after the ERM debacle and the Treasury's stream of incorrect forecasts about an upturn. Indeed, some of the measures announced by Mr Lamont in last month's Autumn Statement to promote growth - such as the effort to boost factory investment and the housing market by tax incentives and purchases of empty houses - could have been lifted straight from Prof Godley's list of ideas for an upturn. As early as October 1989, Prof Godley warned that the UK was on track for a 'major recession of which the incidence will be random, unjust and destructive'. In March last year, he was the only mainstream economist bold enough to predict, correctly, that UK output would fall both in 1991 and 1992. These forecasts were to some degree repeats of other gloomy predictions by Prof Godley made over the past 20 years. Back in 1982, he warned that unemployment would exceed 4m by the end of the decade - a prediction that does not appear too inaccurate given that today's jobless figure is almost 3m and climbing. Seated on a couch in his study at King's College - his Steinway piano on one side of the room and his Elonex computer used for forecasting in the centre  -Prof Godley explains his view of economics. He says governments must take responsibility for social goals such as high levels of employment, a fair system to distribute income and 'ensuring that people who are ill or old or very poor are cared for'. He rejects free-market Thatcherite economics as both unjust and giving the wrong picture of how economies work. He says the most important part of modern economies is not millions of people working as free agents but institutions such as governments, companies, banks and trade unions which operate in a number of unique ways and cannot be fitted into 'dangerous and pernicious' theories about free choice. Given his view that markets are rarely free, he says governments have a duty to intervene where appropriate in a way that is 'benevolent, unifying and deliberate'. He says: 'Until the mid-1970s it was common ground among decent people that this is how governments should operate. The Thatcherite contribution was to tear this notion to pieces.' As for trade, Prof Godley says: 'A basic premise is that Britain needs a strong manufacturing base to generate the income to pay for imports. It is insanity to say the balance of payments doesn't matter.' He is among many non-government economists worried that even in a recession the UK's deficit on visible goods is heading for Pounds 14bn this year, and could climb to Pounds 19.5bn next year on the Treasury's latest forecast. The need to fund the deficit mainly by borrowing from overseas will, says Prof Godley, be one of the factors keeping the UK economy weak. He reckons output next year will show only the mildest improvement, with growth of 0.5 per cent and with unemployment moving up to 3.3m. During the heady days of the mid-1980s, Prof Godley stuck to his guns, warning that the credit explosion would fizzle out and end in a downturn as businesses and consumers cut their spending once they had realised they had overborrowed. 'There was a yuppie culture in Cambridge at the time and my view led to some difficult moments when talking to students,' he says. His views have also prompted disagreements with fellow economists. Sir Douglas Hague, a former economics adviser to Mrs Thatcher, says Prof Godley has been 'too pessimistic, and wrong'. Lord Skidelsky, an economics professor at Warwick University who is also Keynes's biographer, says: 'Prof Godley is an interesting maverick, not a high-powered thinker. Keynes was always concerned with what is possible: Godley is not very practical and this has reduced his influence.' Somewhat warmer is Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University - one of Britain's leading free-market economists who, like Prof Godley, has also strongly criticised the government and is another member of the Treasury's new advisory panel. Although Prof Minford thinks the Cambridge don 'sometimes goes over the top' in rejecting market mechanisms, he admits he has 'a lot of respect for him'. Whatever the views of colleagues, Prof Godley now has the ear of the Treasury. So what will he tell the Treasury's new advisory committee at its first meeting early next year? Prof Godley wants interest rates cut immediately from 7 per cent to 5 per cent, along with a further devaluation of the pound of between 10 per cent and 20 per cent to add to the 11 per cent depreciation which has taken place since the ERM exit. If inflation started to get out of control, he would damp demand by increasing taxes. He says import controls, which he espoused during the 1970s, are now 'unthinkable'. But he would like to see the Department of Trade and Industry taking 'strong, ingenious and partisan' measures to boost industrial output, through modest ideas such as tax incentives for investment or setting technical standards. Aren't such thoughts, even in a fairly diluted form, a throwback to the bad old days of Labour-style state involvement in industry? Prof Godley says he does not want the government to tell industry what to do, but to work with it. He thinks Labour's economics policies 'pretty feeble'. He has never joined Labour, nor any other political group, and describes himself as a 'one nation Tory'. While some have suggested that the Treasury's new advisory panel is no more than a device to neutralise criticism of the Treasury, Prof Godley is optimistic. 'With good will and forbearance, it could be a very creative piece of machinery,' he says. As for his general views about Britain's future, Prof Godley says he wants to lay to rest that he is an incurable pessimist. 'Britain is full of so many talented people. Given the right combination of carrots and sticks, things can be supremely better than they are.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1926 Born in London.

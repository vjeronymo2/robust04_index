			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / The Possessed: A look at the power of television to help create a consumer society in Russia In an advertisement for the collapsed MMM finance house - still running on Russian television as thousands of jittery investors crowd about its outer-Moscow offices seeking to cash their shares at virtually any price - Lenya Golubkov, the commercial's central character, is in California with his brother Ivan. They are at the football match between Russia and Argentina which destroyed the former's dreams of taking the World Cup. The commentary is jokey, the camera shots are quick and quirky. The main point is that Ivan is in despair - not over the Russian team's performance, but because Lenya, who has funded the trip, has done so because he has put his money into MMM shares - while Ivan, a working stiff all his life, still has nothing. As General Electric hired a clean-cut, right-thinking, second-rank actor named Reagan with which to identify its products in the 1950s and 1960s; as Oxo built up the middle-class English personality of Katie to drive home the essential goodness of its product, so Bakhyt Kilibayev, the Kazakh director of the Lenya series created a one-representing-all working-class character, whose job as an excavator driver is abandoned for a life of wealth and leisure through his embrace of MMM. MMM, launched by Mr Sergei Mavrodi, had huge success this year by selling shares in itself. It quoted its own rocketing share prices - from 1,600 roubles (about USDollars I) in February to more than 100,000 roubles this week - to an ever-widening circle of buyers. Whether they numbered the 2m which the Kommersant Daily estimated this week or the 10m claimed by Mr Mavrodi, the figure is still larger than the Russian army. Since MMM seemed to have no means of making money other than the constant selling of its rapidly-rising shares, it was widely assumed to be a pyramid company funding new business with old receipts. After a triple salvo of government warnings on its solvency it admitted its virtual collapse yesterday, telling investors it had nearly run out of cash and offering them a paltry 950 roubles (US40 cents) per share. However, Mr Mavrodi has not given up. He has launched a political campaign against the government itself, threatening to stir his shareholders to revolt, or at least to sign a petition calling for a referendum on the government's competence. Significantly, he used Lenya in this piece of lese majeste: 'So the authorities don't like Lenya Golubkov and Marina Sergeyevna (a family friend)? But do Lenya Golubkov and Marina Sergeyevna like these same authorities?' - an explicit effort to equate Lenya and Marina with Russia's anti-government citizenry. Lenya, as projected by Mr Kilibayev, is a figure in transition - as most Russians are. A simple if shrewd man in an extended family, his 'life' is crazy, impulsive, and when not caught up in outings to California and to Paris, is lived largely on and around the couch from which he and his extended family watch TV. Putting a TV in the commercials as well as the commercials on TV showed the instinctive mastery which has distinguished the campaign. In the post-Soviet period, the Russian channels old and new are a riot of raucous game shows, western soap operas and films, and the remains of the rambling Soviet talk programmes - and lengthy, frequent commercials, of which MMM's have been the most frequent and the most vivid. Vivid most of all because - in contrast to the many in which sleek young men in dinner jackets and women in shimmering, close-fitted gowns slither round Japanese jeeps - it is both a slice of life in the apartment block, and a send-up of it. It endorses both the common feeling that we are all living through chaos where anything goes (and therefore anything can be gained), and a cynical comment on just that view, a shrug which says: so it's stupid, so it's crooked, so what? When President Boris Yeltsin said Lenya got on his nerves, millions of Lenyas were, according to the daily Izvestiya, insulted. When Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin warned Lenya (by name) that his dream time was coming to an end, Mr Mavrodi went on the attack and threatened to end Mr Chernomyrdin's power by the force of his aroused shareholders. Mr Mavrodi's audacity is, through Lenya, to identify his TV character with the undoubtedly deep feelings of resentment and frustration felt by ordinary citizens when confronted with a country whose prestige and power has been cut at a stroke, whose economy continues to decline, where crime is exploding and fear of it is pervasive, and where the figures of authority are routinely dismissed as venal and uncaring. Lenya also touched a wide range of Russian references. An anonymous psychiatrist, writing in the weekly Soversheno Sekretno, said that in his couch-bound idleness and his production of fantasies, Lenya was a TV recreation of facets of Oblomov - the central character of the eponymous 19th-century novel by Goncharov, one who gave his name to the phenomenon of Oblomovism, or dreamy idleness. But in his working-class past and his escape from it, Lenya proposes to everybody the possibility of unshackling themselves from the previously powerful, state-promoted myth of Soviet Citizen - proud yet obedient, militant but in the direction determined by the party, having surpassed class, want and individualism in pursuit of an ideal (and in part a reality) of collective, all-encompassing security and social and intellectual identity. In its place is the crazy, self-interested, wealth-pursuing world of Lenya Golubkov, where luck and nerve bring rewards to oneself and one's own. The family was always a shelter for individuals against the relentless collectivism of Soviet life. Now it drops its defences, and goes on the offensive - a consumption offensive of the kind big stores from Istanbul to Miami have noted with delight, as their cash registers ring to the sound of Russian purchases. Lenya Golubkov will last as an influence even though the company which gave him birth has folded. He is the media image of the Russian coping with the latest oppression, that of the world of consumption with its attendant images, myths and falsehoods, its new liberations and new enslavements. He is the proletarian turned consumer, the object of history struggling to be its subject. Mr Mavrodi's threat to mobilise millions of Lenya's against the state authorities is likely to be the last throw of a gambler with the chips stacked against him. But he has helped unleash something bigger even than the dreams he encouraged, and has now betrayed.</p>

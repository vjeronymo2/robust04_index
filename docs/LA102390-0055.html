			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE TAMES BLACK'S BEACH BLUFF INTO 'STEVE'S TRAIL'  </P> <P> Steve Simms stands on a dusty bluff overlooking Black's Beach, gazing down 340  feet of twisting, tortuous trail that over the years has thrown as big a  challenge at surfers as the gnarly waves below.  </P> <P> As his eyes squint through a morning haze, Simms does not see a dangerous path  along which dozens of daring beach-goers have been seriously injured attempting  to scale its steep-sloped terrain.  </P> <P> Instead, he sees a beloved improvement project taking shape above the scenic La  Jolla shores. He sees the hundreds of bulky bricks, 2-by-4s, iron pipes and  heavy sacks of concrete he has hauled down the winding trail like a two-legged  packhorse.  </P> <P> He sees the sections of his sturdy wooden steps, handrails and metal drainage  pipes that have made the path a much safer way to reach the famous nudist beach  -- a popular gathering spot for surfers and natural sunbathers throughout  Southern California.  </P> <P> Simms smiles. What he sees is a much-improved access many locals now  affectionately call "Steve's Trail."  </P> <P> "See that section right down there?" he says, pointing to a wood-and-concrete  set of steps that includes a lookout point to the beach below. "That's the one  I'm most proud of."  </P> <P> For five years, the San Diego part-time carpenter has donated his time, money  and sweat to improve the trail that is used by tens of thousands of beach  enthusiasts each year.  </P> <P> When he is not hammering nails, mixing concrete, smoothing blacktop and grading  wood, the 39-year-old scours local building sites looking for donations of  materials. Simms peers inside dumpsters in search of usable bricks, scrap metal  or pipes -- anything to keep construction on schedule.  </P> <P> At night, though he says he has a home, the self-professed loner often prefers  to sleep outdoors in one of the gullies near his creation, sharing campfires  and six-packs of beer with the area's homeless population.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, his trail has become a controversial undertaking, admired by some  beach-goers, criticized by others. The project proceeds under the watchful eye  of city officials who will neither condemn Simms' work nor help him in his  efforts.  </P> <P> "Five years ago, when I started construction, I called the city to tell them  what I was doing," Simms said, angling down the cliffside with a shovel slung  over his shoulder.  </P> <P> "They were all too busy to call me back. So I decided to just go ahead and get  it done."  </P> <P> Terri Williams, deputy city parks and recreation director, said that while the  unstable trail was officially closed a decade ago, Simms' work has been so  solid that city officials have decided to look the other way.  </P> <P> "He's not going to be congratulated or taken before the City Council for any  awards," she said. "But his trail is certainly an improvement over any other  access for people who go to that beach at their own risk."  </P> <P> Authorities acknowledge that in the last decade more than two dozen injuries --  and a few deaths -- have resulted from people slipping along precarious trails  while scaling the unstable cliffs.  </P> <P> At Black's Beach, the sentiment over Steve's Trail is divided.  </P> <P> "Is Steve going to take responsibility if somebody falls and breaks his neck?"  said Joe Bill, manager of the adjacent Torrey Flight Park, a popular  hang-glider launching area.  </P> <P> "A lot of us around here would like to see him stop his work and go on his  merry way."  </P> <P> Regulars say the trail has changed the demographics of the beach.  </P> <P> For years, the beach was so inaccessible that nude sunbathers as well as a  large gay population could lounge in privacy. The city did not see the need to  enforce a no-nudity law on a beach that few people could reach.  </P> <P> Now, that all may change as families and tourists begin gawking as they take  the Black's Beach tour, locals say.  </P> <P> "Still, I marvel every time I use that trail," said beach regular Al Spencer.  "It's really a solid piece of engineering, a labor of love. I think most people  appreciate what he's done."  </P> <P> Surfers complain that the once-isolated beach is becoming too accessible. They  claim that their beach is crowded with beginning surfers -- geeks, goons and  kooks, they call them -- and other undesirables.  </P> <P> "I mean, why does he do it?" one surfer asked. "Why doesn't he just leave the  trail alone? Doesn't he have anything better to do?"  </P> <P> Joe Moberg, a homeless man who has helped Simms with his work, had a possible  answer: "Sometimes people just do things, they take up a cause. Well, this is  Steve's cause. Day and night."  </P></p>

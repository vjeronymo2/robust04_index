			<p>BFN     [Text] Tomorrow is a day of suspense in Zaire. It is,  indeed, tomorrow that the High Council of the  Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] will appoint from  among eight candidates the future prime minister of the country.  The problem is that the hardline of the opposition against  President Mobutu's regime did not deign to present Etienne  Tshisekedi's candidacy. Indeed, the Sacred Union of the Radical  Opposition and Allies [USORAS] feels the post of prime minister  is not vacant because there is a prime minister named Etienne  Tshisekedi. Ousmane Kaba reports:    [Begin Kaba recording] Each side interprets the new  Constitution its own way. The infamous Article 78 is the bone  of contention. One the one side is the Union for the Republic  and Democracy [URD], really an extension of the opposition,  regarded as a moderate group that supports the theory of a third  party, which is to say in light of the permanent confrontation  between Tshisekedi-Mobutu, there must be a third person who can  cooperate with the president. On the other side is the Union  for the Republic and Democracy, a kind of spontaneous generation  of dissidents who, after joining the USORAS, wanted to create a  third school of thought. There lies all the question because  all the political unrest in Kinshasa during these past weeks is  only the logical consequence of the interpretation of the new  Constitution.    As for Tshisekedi, basing himself on his election at the  Sovereign National Conference, he does not intend to support any  list of candidates for the post of prime minister. For  Tshisekedi, as long as the transition does not come to an end,  there is only one prime minister: himself. Will the People's  Palace be invaded again by the security forces like a few weeks  ago? Or will the plenary session be postponed? That is the  question. The URD confirms that the meeting will take place,  while Tshisekedi's partisans strongly deny the information,  ironically explaining that whether there is a meeting at the  HCR-PT tomorrow or not, for Tshisekedi, the commission of 33  deputies who will hold the meeting has no legal recognition.  [end recording]    As Ousmane Kaba has just said, a delegation of  representatives from France, Belgium, and the United States  recently held discussions with the opposition leaders and  Etienne Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba. This delegation was the bearer  of messages from their governments. It delivered similar  messages to President Mobutu Sese Seko yesterday. Regarding the  contents of the messages received by the two Zairian  politicians, here is (Lambert Mende), minister of communication  in the Tshisekedi government:    [Begin (Mende) recording] We received a message that  encourages power-sharing between President Mobutu and Prime  Minister Tshisekedi. We received a message encouraging us to  find a common solution to this crisis that has divided us both  within the two political parties and in our own political party,  by this I mean the problem of dissidents. I think Tshisekedi  answered all these questions regarding dissidence by saying that  there is a bipolarization of the constitution in this country.  We are legalistic. Because of this bipolarization, our friends  who left us to join President Mobutu could no longer consider  themselves, while on President Mobutu's side, as people who can  come and sit among us and be part of our quotas within the HCR  and the transitional government. They can only aspire to this  privilege when they come back to join the cause that we are  defending and around which the USORAS, that is the Zairian  opposition has built its project. [end recording]    The private press today echoed the criticisms leveled  against  France by the UDPS. For the PHARE, the appeal to boycott French  goods at a rally on 5 June by Kiba Samaliba is nothing other  than a declaration of a holy war that can recall the one being  waged by the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria [FIS] against  French interests. The paper writes, and I quote, in both  Kinshasa and the rural areas, people are convinced today that  France does not deserve better than the war that the FIS has  declared on it.    On its part, LE PALMARES, another newspaper close to the  opposition, feels that France is a thorn in the side of Zairian  democracy. The paper also wrote about the setting up of  democratic process in Zaire in order to draw attractive  dividends.    It will be recalled that at a UDPS rally on 5 June, Kiba  Samaliba, a member of the leadership of this party headed by  Etienne Tshisekedi, accused France of supporting a dictatorship  in Zaire, that is President Mobutu's regime.</p>

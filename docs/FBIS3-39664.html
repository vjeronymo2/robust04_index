Defense Minister Ter Beek informed the Second  Chamber on Wednesday [16 February] that (confidential) plans had  been drawn up for that eventuality.    The troops -- which include 3,100 Netherlanders following  the  "deployment" of the reinforced mobile air battalion at the end  of March -- can be withdrawn from Bosnia if they become, or  threaten to become, the target of retaliatory acts by the Serbs.    In the event, Netherlands transport units will be protected  by British troops. The signal corps will leave with the  battalion with which they are on active service. The Nordic  (Scandinavian) battalion will assume responsibility for the  logistics unit, comprising roughly 400 men, stationed in Lukavac.    "Dutchbat," the battalion of infantrymen from the mobile air  battalion, will be assigned its own area of responsibility  (Srebrenica and Zepa in eastern Bosnia), and will have to  supervise less heavily armed UN troops from other countries in  the event of evacuation. The evacuation will be carried out as  quickly as possible from the port of Split using Navy vessels  from various countries, including the Netherlands.    Yesterday, Minister Ter Beek went into the evacuation plans  in detail; the Chamber expressed concern over the risks run by  UN troops in Bosnia.    Both Ter Beek and Foreign Minister Kooijmans left it in no  doubt that if the Serbs fail to carry out the desired withdrawal  of their heavy weaponry around Sarajevo or submit them to UN  control before the ultimatum -- Monday morning 0000 GMT --  expires, then the United Nations and NATO will carry out their  threat of air strikes on Serbian artillery positions. Both  ministers maintained that there could be no question of the  deadline being extended.    In addition, the possibility proposed by the United Nations  of bringing the heavy weapons under radar control was rejected  by The Hague. Physical control is absolutely essential.  Moreover, the Netherlands does not support the idea of urgent  European Union consultations before Monday, as the Greek  presidency has proposed.    NATO and the United Nations must both lend their support to  air support and air strikes. The authority to give this support  resides in the first instance with UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali's special envoy in Bosnia, the Japanese Akashi.  Thereafter, the use of air strikes will be jointly decided by  the commander of the NATO southern sector, U.S. General Boorda,  and the UNPROFOR commanders in the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia,  the French General Cot and the British General Rose.    According to Kooijmans, an effective ultimatum must make the  warring factions see that they are heading for disaster. He  hopes that demilitarization and the placing under UN control of  the Bosnian capital constitutes a first step toward an overall  peace settlement. The international community must exploit the  situation by also guaranteeing to protect the other five "safe  areas" against the Muslims.    Kooijmans and Ter Beek emphasized that the ultimatum  primarily constitutes a means of exerting political pressure  with a view to urging the warring factions to resume peace  talks. Ter Beek said: "The ultimatum will only prove successful  if there is no need to resort to bombardments. Nonetheless,  there may, and can, be no misunderstanding the fact that the  Netherlands and other allies are prepared to go ahead with air  attacks."</p>

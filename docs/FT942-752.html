			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Revenue confesses to tax errors: Underestimates total Pounds 430m Taxpayers paid up to Pounds 100m less in tax than they owed to the Inland Revenue last year, the Commons public accounts committee heard yesterday. Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, told MPs errors in Revenue calculations of assessments sent to taxpayers had underestimated Pounds 100m tax from Schedule D (self-employed) and Pounds 330m from Schedule E (pay-as-you-earn) taxpayers. These gross figures were offset by assessments for too much tax of Pounds 70m for Schedule D taxpayers and Pounds 260m for those under Schedule E. Sir Anthony was answering questions following publication earlier this month of a highly critical report on tax administration by the National Audit Office, the Whitehall watchdog. The report highlighted the fact that of the 5m taxpayers who receive assessments each year the figures were incorrect for 3.1m of those on Schedule D and more than 0.1m on Schedule E. Many of the errors were caused by taxpayer mistakes, but 10 per cent - or 500,000 - were the fault of the Inland Revenue, and in many of these cases it was the taxpayer rather than the Revenue who identified the miscalculation. Sir Anthony stressed yesterday that the difference between assessments and the correct level of tax was just one-tenth of 1 per cent, and said the Revenue had introduced a quality division to improve accuracy and ensure taxpayers paid the right amount. However, he said he was not satisfied with the current position. 'Any errors that get people's tax wrong are to be regretted,' he said. He also admitted that 'morale is not as good as it has been in the past' among Revenue staff as they adjusted to periods of tremendous change and uncertainty. Mr Michael Stern, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, expressed scepticism over the Revenue's belief that most taxpayers truly wanted to pay the correct amount of tax, as they had stated in surveys commissioned by the Revenue. He said that in his experience as a chartered accountant taxpayers were extremely reluctant to push for a revised assessment if they had been asked by the Revenue to pay less tax than was due. The issue is important because the new system of self-assessment places the onus on taxpayers to calculate how much tax they pay, and the Revenue generally to accept this figure unquestioned. The National Audit Office report also pointed out that just 60 per cent of taxpayers surveyed said they were satisfied with the Revenue's handling of correspondence.</p>

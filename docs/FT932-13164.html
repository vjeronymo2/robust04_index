			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Commodities (Week In The Markets): Russia underpins palladium rise THE UPWARD trend in the market for palladium - a platinum group metal used mainly in dentistry, the electrical industry and motor exhaust catalysts - was underpinned late this week by a report that the biggest producer planned to reduce output sharply. An official of Russia's Norilsk, which produces palladium as a by-product of nickel and accounts for nearly 70 per cent of the world's 3.6m tonnes-a-year supply of the metal, was reported to have told a closed session of the International Nickel Study Group in the Hague on Thursday that his country would reduce nickel output by 10 or 12 per cent this year - and that would inevitably result in a pro-rata cut in palladium production. London traders were unsure, however, how much importance to attach to the report, especially as it was unclear whether the reduction was being measured against last year's actual output or this year's planned output. 'Norilsk has been talking about reducing output by about 10 per cent for a year,' one dealer told the Reuter news agency. 'We are buying palladium on the fundamentals, not Norilsk.' said another. 'Nobody wants to be short.' The Norilsk report came when the palladium market was already in a moderately bullish mood, reflecting supply tightness. The London price was showing a rise since the end of last week of Dollars 2.75 a troy ounce, extended yesterday to Dollars 5.50 when the price hit a 10-week high of Dollars 118.25 an ounce. The gold market also ended the week on an upbeat, with the London price reaching a fresh six-month high of Dollars 344.15 an ounce, up Dollars 5.30 overall. Investment fund buying in New York and weakness of the US dollar, which encouraged Middle Eastern buyers back into the market, prompted a strong opening on the New York Commodity Exchange yesterday and enabled the London market to push through the resistance that had frustrated earlier attempts to breach the Dollars 342 barrier. Like palladium, the nickel market was on the upgrade before the emergence of the Norilsk factor. Chart patterns were looking encouraging, dealers said, imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States were reported to be falling, production of stainless steel was at a high level, supplies of stainless steel scrap were tight and a substantial fall in London Metal Exchange stocks was announced yesterday. The nickel market's initial reaction to Thursday night's news was to push the three months delivery price close to Dollars 6,200 a tonne. It eased later, however, closing at Dollars 6,172.50 a tonne, up Dollars 95 on the day and Dollars 235 up on the week. Other LME metals had a less happy time. The copper market tried to consolidate on Monday following the heavy falls of the last two weeks, but Chinese sellers were quick to return and a fresh 5 1/2 -year low of Dollars 1,820 a tonne for three months metal was touched in mid-week. A subsequent recovery ran into strong resistance at Dollars 1,920 a tonne and at yesterday's close three months copper was quoted at Dollars 1,892 a tonne, down Dollars 9 on the week. Aluminium fared no better. A gentle price slide escalated into a technical break-down on Thursday when support around the Dollars 1,125-a-tonne mark for three months metal failed to hold and options-realted and stop-loss selling forced the price down towards Dollars 1,100 a tonne. Buyers appeared to defend that level yesterday and the price closed at Dollars 1,116.50 a tonne, up Dollars 7 on the day and Dollars 17 down on the week. Mr David Morton, chairman of Alcan Aluminium expects 'some improvement' in ingot prices later this year, despite CIS exports reaching well over 1m tonnes in 1993, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Present spot prices of about 50 US cents a lb (Dollars 1,100 a tonne) should prove the low point, Mr Morton said after Alcan's annual meeting. 'I can see 54-56 US cents per lb late this year with somewhat better prices in 1994,' he added. Reynolds Metals chairman Mr Richard Holder last week forecast that aluminium ingot would average 54 cents a lb this year. At that level North American smelters would barely break even. Alcan expects to continue operating at about 95 per cent of capacity in North America and it sees the Japanese market picking up later this year. However it is worried about Europe. Overall world growth in demand should reach about 3.5 per cent, with China becoming a market of growing importance. The short-term thrust in demand will come from growing use of aluminium cans in Europe and Asia and increasing use in car manufacture. Alcan will spend about USDollars 450m this year, mostly to complete its rolling mill expansions in Germany and the US. Together they will raise the company's rolled products capacity by 50 per cent. For investors in soft commodities sugar was the only bright spot this week. Concern about tightening supplies on the world market helped the July contract on the New York futures market up to 12.47 US cents a lb in late trading yesterday, up 0.91 from last week. London trade house C. Czarnikow estimated this week that the setbacks to Thailand's sugar production that played a big part in driving up world market prices earlier in the year would result in a 66 per cent reduction in the country's output to 3.84m tonnes.  -------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------- Aluminium  +4,225 to 1,771,550 Copper     +9,400 to   382,100 Lead          -25 to   249,700 Nickel     -1,458 to    87,450 Zinc       +6,000 to   620,175 Tin          +350 to    20,160  --------------------------------</p>

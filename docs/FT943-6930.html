			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / India eases capital inflows India's central bank has lifted a ban on the repatriation of profits from the local bond markets and encouraged investment in property companies in twin moves designed to attract greater capital from Indians living abroad, Reuter reports from Bombay. The measures were included in a circular to banks following last Friday's move to make the rupee fully convertible on current account transactions. The Reserve Bank of India said it would let non-resident Indian companies acquire up to a 100 per cent of companies involved in housing, real estate, urban infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, building materials and financing of housing development.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with S.A. Yefimov, director of the Center for </F> Regional Development of Crimea, by O. Kulakovskaya, under the  "Economics: The Market and Reforms" rubric; place and date not  given: "Shall We Begin From the Beginning?"]    [Text] Slowly hurrying--this is probably how one  would characterize the movement the current government of Crimea  is constantly attempting to carry out in the fight to attain  Crimean statehood. Have the main reference points changed?  Will we not have to go back to the beginning in connection with  our establishment of the institution of the presidency? These  questions constitute the leading theme of conversation between  our correspondent and S.A. Yefimov, director of the Center for  Regional Development of Crimea.    [Kulakovskaya] Sergey Alekseyevich, a certain stage in the  lives of Crimeans has been completed. We have "undergone" a  presidential election and demonstrated a high level of civic  self-consciousness. Exhibiting a "high-flown style," we have  passed the examination for statehood. But our problems have not  become fewer as a result of this. In fact, with regard to  problems demanding immediate resolution....    [Yefimov] Indeed, construction of the Crimean state has  entered its concluding phase. A president has been elected. In  the next two or three months, now in accordance with the  Constitution in effect, a government will be formed and for the  first time elections to the Crimean Supreme Council will be held.    As far as the activity of the Crimean president is  concerned,  here two paths are possible. The first is to begin everything  on a clean slate, as they say, considering that nothing existed  prior to this; the second--to provide a continuity with respect  to whatever positive undertakings have already managed to be  achieved. I must note that the president of Crimea did not  permit himself to be lured away by the first path--extremely  advantageous to official Kiev, but instead chose the second, a  path firmly sanctioned in the practice of the world community.    [Kulakovskaya] Well, since we are talking about continuity,  one basic question in this regard is the matter of reconciling  budget relations with the Ukrainian side. An agreement on this  matter was signed in December between the Governments of Ukraine  and Crimea. This evoked feelings approaching euphoria even as  early as the days of the presidential campaign, as if to say--we  have succeeded in resolving a key issue, now.... Well, what  does happen now?    [Yefimov] Well now, for the hundredth time we can assert  that the Ukrainian leadership has never learned to fulfill its  obligations. Mr. Zvyahilskyy signs an agreement with Crimea  with one hand, and with the other--the draft Law on the Ukraine  Budget for 1994, which automatically cancels the mutual  agreements.    Naturally, the Ukrainian Supreme Council is also acting as  if  no such agreement were concluded, and has secured this in the  Law on the Ukraine Budget--this in spite of the fact that the  agreement was concluded in accordance with the Law of Ukraine on  demarcation of powers between Crimea and Ukraine.    So what do we see as the result? The Government of Ukraine  is not fulfilling the obligations it has assumed. It is  violating its very own laws and instigating the parliament to do  the same. We see a not very pretty picture. I believe the  people of Crimea must be aware of this shameful practice on the  part of Ukraine's upper echelons of power.    The question of mutual budget relations is a key issue for  Crimea, for without it virtually no transformations in the  economic sphere can take place. It is precisely for this reason  that this was a topic of discussion at the first meeting between  the presidents of Crimea and Ukraine. As a fundamental issue,  it will remain a topic of subsequent talks. The Government of  Ukraine must immediately guarantee fulfillment of this  agreement, and with the aim of ensuring an integral system of  administration and financing, it must change the jurisdiction of  the State Price Inspectorate, Tax Inspectorate, and Control and  Auditing Directorate of the Ukraine Ministry of Finance for the  Crimean Republic, so that these fall under the appropriate  structures of the government of Crimea.    [Kulakovskaya] Aside from budget relations, as of today we  see that property relationships are not settled either....    [Yefimov] Quite right. This is a second key issue that  requires immediate examination. We have to recognize that the  problem of demarcation of property between Ukraine and the  Crimean Republic remains an open one to this day partially  because the Crimean Supreme Council made an unfortunate decision  at one time. The necessary step was not to ask the Cabinet of  Ministers of Ukraine, but rather to draw up an appropriate  document ourselves and then work on settling aspects in dispute.  This was not done, unfortunately. For half a year now, the  question has been in a state of suspension. The Ukrainian side  is making every effort to "shake it up."    [Kulakovskaya] Well, this is understandable--he who is  stronger dictates the conditions....    [Yefimov] I believe that any relationship, especially one on  the state level, must be built on the basis of mutual  understandings. The entirety of world practical experience  shows this. It is impossible to attain anything good when one  ignores the interests of the other side. The results of the  presidential election in Crimea is a clear example of this. You  cannot show disdain for the will of the people. Even the most  ultranationalistic forces of Ukraine are simply obliged to deal  with it.    [Kulakovskaya] Yes, but they are not accustomed to dealing  with it....    [Yefimov] It does not matter--they must be trained. The  Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers is always attempting to "squash"  the issue of demarcation of property when it examines lists of  facilities. No, it is necessary here to look for common  approaches, common principles, according to which we can act.  One of these, which I proposed and which found support in the  government of Crimea: that all facilities located in the  territory of Crimea and subject to privatization in accordance  with Ukrainian legislation in effect constitute property of the  Republic of Crimea. Funds obtained from privatization must not  be dissipated--they must serve to promote the welfare of the  people of Crimea, being directed toward the implementation of  one socioeconomic program or another.    All facilities operating primarily in the interests of the  region must also be placed within the category of property of  the Crimean Republic. While for those facilities that do not  fall under these categories, mutually agreed upon decisions must  be taken. Here is where a facility-by-facility approach is  possible.    [Kulakovskaya] What if talks on these issues do not yield  positive results?    [Yefimov] In that event, the Supreme Council of Crimea must  independently draw up a document respecting demarcation of state  property. In doing so, it will confirm the zero-option decision  adopted in 1991. We must be consistent in our actions. We have  shown respect and proposed joint efforts, but if we see no  movement in response, we have the right to take independent  steps.    [Kulakovskaya] But will these be acknowledged as  constitutional?    [Yefimov] Absolutely. This is purely a question of  economics. Many in Kiev are finally finding it necessary to rid  themselves of nationalistic narrowmindedness and avoid confusing  separatism with bread.    [Kulakovskaya] Sergey Alekseyevich, do you think the  presidential election, having convincingly secured the statehood  of Crimea, gives us the right to be more persistent in looking  after our interests?    [Yefimov] Without a doubt. Crimea has today become a more  active entity, deservedly acquiring this right. As far as to  what extent it will be exercised--I will not be the judge. But  the realm of prospective opportunities has broadened  significantly.</p>

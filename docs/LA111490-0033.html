			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEND YOUR DONATIONS TO CITY HALL;  </P> <P> TIMES SERIES RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT PAST BRADLEY FUND RAISINGS  </P> <P> A recent Times investigation into the fund-raising practices of Los Angeles  Mayor Tom Bradley provides more sobering evidence -- as if any were needed --  of the corrupting influence money has on government.  </P> <P> In a series of reports based on internal campaign documents obtained by The  Times -- with the help of a court order -- reporters Rich Connell and Tracy  Wood detailed how mayoral aides and city commissioners raised $700,000 for  three different Bradley campaigns over the last five years. Lots of that money  came from contractors and lobbyists who had business pending with the city,  often before the very same commissions on which sat the very same commissioners  who solicited the campaign donations. Even if nothing illegal occurred, the  coziness of those relationships raises questions. Were city commissioners  judging projects and proposals on their merits, or on how much money their  proponents had donated to the mayor?  </P> <P> The reports also documented a City Hall campaign operation that was at best  chaotic and, at worst, downright illegal. During two different Bradley  campaigns for mayor, in 1985 and 1989, and his failed run at the California  governorship in 1986, staff aides routinely did political work for Bradley on  city time.  </P> <P> In response to the series, Bradley and Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani point out that  City Hall staffers were told to keep their official duties separate from their  political activities. Fabiani also notes Bradley's strong support of the city's  new political ethics ordinance, which specifically prohibits some of the  campaign activities documented by The Times, as evidence that the mayor  sincerely wants to clear up the ethical haze that hangs over City Hall.  </P> <P> Indeed, city voters can take some reassurance from the fact the ethics reforms  they wisely enacted last June will make it somewhat harder for officials to  engage in dubious fund raising in the future. But promises to do better don't  excuse wrongdoing in the past, and there are some instances cited in the series  that should be further investigated by the appropriate authorities,  specifically some of the fund raising done by long-time Bradley aides. If  Bradley aides or commissioners did anything illegal, they should be prosecuted  and, at the very least, reimburse the city for any campaigning they did on  public time or using public resources. That would send a clear message to  everybody in City Hall -- not just the mayor's office -- that the old rules not  only don't apply anymore but also that they can get you into a heap of trouble.  </P></p>

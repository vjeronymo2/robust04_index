			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UK'S AUGUST DEFICIT IS 3RD-WORST  </P> <P> Britain today notched up its third worst monthly current account deficit -- a  gap of $3.2 billion in August.  </P> <P> The deficit was a fractional improvement over a revised shortfall of $3.54  billion in July but was much larger than economists had expected.  </P> <P> The pound fell on the news by almost one cent to $1.6050 but recovered soon  afterward and by mid-morning in New York was trading at $1.6210.  </P> <P> Financial analysts said the deficit in the current account -- a balance of  payments for imports and exports and invisible items such as banking, insurance  and tourism -- was a blow to the Conservative government's hopes of cooling the  economy through its policy of high interest rates.  </P></p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries rally after early uncertainty US Treasury bonds rallied yesterday after the dollar firmed against the yen and D-Mark. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  23/32 better at 85 23/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.451 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/8 , to yield 6.050 per cent. In early activity, an air of uncertainty hung over the market as traders anxiously awaited fresh developments on the dollar. In overnight trading, the US currency sunk below Y100 but recrossed the line during the morning. By late afternoon, it had improved slightly. Bonds first reacted with a modest move lower, but traders had no appetite for a fresh sell-off after Friday's rout. Dealers were buying government securities on weakness, helping to build a new floor for prices. As the afternoon progressed, the rally gathered momentum in light trading, assisted by a softer trend in commodities. The big question was whether the Federal Reserve would lead a second round of intervention on behalf of the dollar in spite of the failure of last week's efforts. By late afternoon, the central banks had held their fire in the currency markets, though there were reports of them buying Treasury bills and short-term bonds with dollars acquired in Friday's intervention. With the focus set squarely on the travails of the dollar, the day's economic news barely raised a ripple of interest. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes had fallen 0.7 per cent last month, in line with expectations. A large purchase of UK gilt futures, rumoured to be by a US hedge fund, pushed London higher yesterday, while other European bond markets enjoyed a late rally following earlier falls. Trading activity in the continental Europe was subdued, with most activity limited to the futures market. They opened lower but recovered later in the day, led by Germany, after a relatively calm day for the dollar removed the immediate threat of an emergency rise in US interest rates to protect the US currency. Analysts said market sentiment remains nervous ahead of further developments in the currency markets and in US interest rates. 'This is just a short squeeze upwards after a crash,' said Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets. 'Markets are pausing for breath ahead of more data and before the long weekend in the US, the (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, the next Bundesbank meeting and the G7 summit in Naples,' she said. UK government bonds benefited from the government's White Paper on pension industry reform, analysts said. But the single large purchase by a US hedge fund of gilt futures was the principal factor driving gilts higher. The move upwards in the futures market fed through into the cash market. The long gilt future was up 1 31/32 points in late trading at 101 23/32 . 'People have had time to consider the implications of the paper and realise that in the long-term it is favourable for bonds, in that it could involve quite a substantial switch out of riskier assets like equities into long-term gilts,' said Mr David Miles, senior UK economist at Merrill Lynch. The Bank of England was reported to have supplied bonds to the market yesterday due to increased demand. The UK Treasury's latest forecast for the UK economy will attract attention today. It is expected to predict higher economic growth and lower inflation over the next two years than previously forecast. Of particular importance for the gilt market will be the projection for the public sector borrowing requirement, which is expected to be revised downwards. Data showing a fall in German consumer price inflation in June helped lift market sentiment but analysts remained sceptical about the immediate prospect for German bonds. The September bund contract was up 0.54 points at 92.40 in late trading.</p>

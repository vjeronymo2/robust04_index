[passage omitted]    A reaction from Rabah Kebir, one of the leaders of the  Islamic Salvation Front in exile: He says these measures are  insufficient:    [Begin Kebir recording] I am very pleased about the release  of some of our brothers who were imprisoned wrongly and without  trial in concentration camps and who have been there for two  years now. This is not enough, however, because thousands of  our brothers are still in prison, such as our leaders, first of  all.    As for the national dialogue conference, as far as we are  concerned, the junta in power is not to be taken seriously.  That is why this conference has no chance of success. It is  only a propaganda ploy to gain time. Should they ever want a  negotiable solution, all they have to do is to look at the one  condition we set during our news conference on 17 August 1993.  It is no use giving us little presents to cheer us up. We are  not children. [end recording]</p>

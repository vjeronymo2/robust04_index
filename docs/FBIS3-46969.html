			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, in  the second year of his administration, wants to show "tangible  benefits" of his reform to all the citizens in their daily lives.    "Our reform and change will now have to take place in the  areas where the people's lives are directly involved," President  Kim said Friday while presiding over a meeting of cabinet  ministers and leaders of civic groups at Chongwadae.    "We have succeeded in laying down a broad framework for  reform through the disclosures of personal assets of public  officials and real-name financial transaction system," Kim said.    "From now on, reform will have to be carried out on a  broader  scale, based on the foundation we laid last year," he said.    Reform for the citizens' daily lives, the president  explained, should be aimed at establishing a community of an  advanced nation, where its efficiency and productivity is  maximized and where the people are generally satisfied with  their lives.    Kim, speaking at New Year's press conference Thursday, laid  down the action outline for his administration: "The government  must be able to visibly reduce all forms of inconvenience to  citizens with a spirit of service. It must also seek out and  help people in need."    It was obviously a step forward for President Kim, who must  have realized that he could not go on receiving popular support  of the people by just continuing his campaign to wipe out  corruption and official irregularities.    His administration has to work for positive results that  could immediately be felt by the people.    "Reform for living," Kim told Friday's meeting, "is directly  connected with the welfare of the people."    The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, his  cabinet, heads of government agencies, provincial governors and  leaders of large private social organizations.    What President Kim was saying was that since he completed  diagonosis of "the Korean disease" in the first year of his  administration, he has to start curing it through a brave and  determined series of operations. His administration has to work  to offer its people a safer, cleaner environment to live, an  environment for pleasant living.    President also wants to build a much more orderly and honest  society and help the people change their way of thinking and  give them a proper and correct sense of values in life.    "We cannot join the ranks of advanced nations," Kim said,  "unless we have got rid of large man-made disasters, waste  disposal problems, crime and violence, drugs and juvenile  crimes, conspicuous and wasteful spendings on luxurious things,  traffic congestion and collective selfishness. All citizens  should come to realize that law and order are meaningful only  when they are observed by them, and freedom and individual  rights can be enjoyed only after they have carried out their  duty and responsibility," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By YONHAP from UN Headquarters] </F>   [Text] The United States and North Korea held a  working-level contact at the UN Headquarters in New York on the  evening of 24 June. The two sides discussed the agenda and date  for the third round of high-level talks expected to be held in  Geneva in early July.    The results of the contact is yet to be known. However, a  relevant official at the North Korean mission said that there  were no particular difficulties in the contact, thus hinting  that the high-level talks are likely to be held on 8 July, as  requested by the North Korean side, and that the two sides  reached an agreement on the agenda.    In the third round of high-level talks, the United States  and  North Korea are expected to discuss extensively the issue on  permanently freezing North Korea's nuclear development,  including its full return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty, its suspension of reprocessing nuclear fuel, and the  acceptance of special [tukbyol] inspections. In addition,  chances are high that they would discuss the issue concerning  the establishment of diplomatic ties, including the replacement  of light-water moderated reactors and economic aid.    In the contact, Gary Seymour, director of the U.S. State  Department, led the U.S. delegation while Han Song-yol,  counselor at the North Korean mission to the United Nations,  represented the North Korean side.</p>

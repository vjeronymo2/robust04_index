			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed M. Rog.: "Defense Imports and Exports: </F> Deregulation Imminent"]    [Text] ROME--Even weapons are the target of administrative  simplification. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi kept his  repeated commitment to companies of this sector: for imports,  exports, and transportation of weapons and weapon technologies  of a strategic nature, the government approval process will be  quicker and more streamlined. In short, this is like a gust of  innovation to reduce bureaucracy. This is especially true with  regard to the use of the "silent agreement" for continued  contractual negotiations involving the import and export of  armaments. This type of deregulation is being launched with a  regulation for implementing a law related to state holding  companies drafted last week by the prime minister and currently  being examined in parliament.    However, the simplified approval process is not yet  operative. Before the Council of Ministers can apply its final  seal of approval, the two houses of parliament will have to  express their opinion on the measure. An opinion that, in view  of the elections, should not be delayed. At least that is what  the Palazzo Chigi [the Prime Minister's office] hopes. Quick  approval of the regulation governing weapons transactions is  also eagerly awaited by the defense sector.    The foundation on which the simplified approval process  rests  is the silent agreement. Companies will still have to advise the  Foreign Ministry when they begin negotiations regarding the  import, export or movement of weapons or their replacement  parts. But if the ministry does not inform the party concerned  that the request has been denied within 60 days of receiving it,  negotiations can proceed to a conclusion. Moreover, this  two-month time limit is reduced to 30 days in situations where  negotiations "involve transactions from or to NATO countries or  the WEU." Under this procedure the maximum time limit for  granting approval for weapons transactions is 60 days from  presentation of the request.    Thus, the government is trying to speed up the slow,  disorganized administrative machine. The 20-day period allocated  to the Foreign Ministry for approving transactions with its own  permit (not that of the Defense Ministry as is most often the  case) is further evidence of this. This accelerated procedure  covers replacement parts for arms maintenance and repair,  weapons training, and defense equipment which has "already been  approved" for temporary export or import. And if the temporary  imports or exports are the result of participation in fairs or  exhibits, the approval or denial must be issued by the Defense  Ministry within 15 days of the request.    A separate chapter is also devoted to companies that fall  under the so-called general authorization system when importing  or exporting. To untangle the intricate administrative web, the  regulation introduces a package of ad hoc measures for setting  up a special list for interested companies at the Ministry of  Foreign Trade.    Applications included on the National Register made up of  companies in this category would also fall under the accelerated  bureaucratic approval process (at least on paper). These  applications must be processed by the Defense Ministry within 30  days of the request and have a validity of 3 years. Best of all,  control of these procedures has been greatly facilitated. Those  involved in these transactions must provide "proof" to the  Ministry of Foreign Trade that the goods shipped actually  arrived in the destination country, and within 30 days of the  end of each calendar quarter, they must provide information on  all shipments made.</p>

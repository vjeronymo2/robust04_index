			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Brazilian call for ministry: Privatisation in Latin America BRAZIL'S former privatisation chief said yesterday his country needed a privatisation minister to speed up the selling of state-owned companies. Mr Eduardo Modiano, who resigned last week as head of the National Development Bank after the change of government in Brazil, told a Financial Times conference that only a minister would have the necessary influence to push through the necessary restructuring of companies to prepare them for privatisation. Mr Modiano, who reported to the economy minister while in office, said delays had ensued from the slowness of some restructurings. He favoured a Mexican-style process by which companies, once up for sale, would be transferred to the privatisation ministry, which would then carry out necessary restructuring. He told the conference, on privatisation in Latin America, that he expected the new Brazilian government of interim president Itamar Franco to continue the privatisation schedule for the next few months. Thirteen companies are for sale before the end of January, with a total 33,355 employees and a total minimum price equivalent to Dollars 2.68bn, payable in government debt. This would double the combined size of the companies privatised so far. He expected that two steel companies would provide the greatest test for the programme: Acesita, based in Minas Gerais, with 8,000 employees and a Dollars 352m minimum price, due for auction on October 22; and CSN, a Dollars 1.45bn company with 18,000 employees, based in Rio de Janeiro state. In Argentina, the government has plans to float 40 companies by the end of 1993, Mr Juan Carlos Sanchez Arnau, under-secretary for privatisation, told the conference. Afterwards, he acknowledged flaws in the sale to the public this year of Telecom, one of the country's two privatised telephone companies. The shares have fallen sharply from the offer price, possibly damaging the appetite of individual investors for future privatisations. Part of the problem was that many investors took 100 per cent financing from banks to buy the shares, then were in trouble after the share price collapsed. He said the Dutch auction system used to price the shares had resulted in too high a price, which was further inflated by allowing banks to finance the purchases. 'It won't happen again,' he said.</p>

			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / European Finance and Investment, Germany (4): City flexes financial muscle - Frankfurt plays psychological card to win the European central bank JUDGING by the arguments of many German bankers and politicians these days, just about the only way the country's sceptical citizens could be induced to part with their treasured D-Mark in exchange for European monetary union (Emu) would be to put the proposed European central bank in Frankfurt. This is the efficient, modern, but hardly scintillating city on the River Main that is home to the Bundesbank, the German central bank which puts a premium on stability, as well as to the country's leading commercial banks. Ever since the Second World War, the central bank has seen to it that Germany's steady economic growth has been accompanied by inflation rates which are the envy of most of the western world. It is this very record of successful monetary management that lies behind the German drive to have the European central bank located in Frankfurt. 'The stable policies of the Bundesbank are closely linked in people's minds with Frankfurt,' asserts Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the chief executive of Commerzbank. 'This is a successful track record which goes back for many years.' The Bundesbank itself has tried to avoid the impression that it sees Frankfurt as the only feasible candidate for the ECB. Not all its officials feel that the new institution has to be in Frankfurt, though they are fully behind Germany as the country of location. However, there have been enough references in speeches and interviews by German central bankers to Frankfurt's suitability as the home of the ECB to raise some hackles abroad. 'Stability is regarded as being at one with the D-Mark and Frankfurt,' says Mr Otmar Issing, one of the Bundesbank's executive directors. 'We see a decision for Frankfurt against this background.' In the view of Mr Issing and other proponents of the city, it will not be enough that the ECB will be set up largely along Bundesbank lines. It must, he adds, 'also be backed up by people across Europe saying 'this must be done in Frankfurt'.' By playing the psychological card, German policymakers hope to convince other EC members that Frankfurt is, as Mr Kohlhaussen puts it, the 'obvious and logical' choice for the ECB, preceded by its forerunner, the European Monetary Institute. In other words, not only Germans would be reassured by the choice of Frankfurt, but so would citizens in other countries whose governments and central banks have a less solid anti-inflationary record. There are signs that this realisation is getting through, but this may not necessarily benefit Frankfurt. Recent German press reports have suggested that the agreement of the French, British, and other governments to locating the ECB in Germany may be dependent on its being somewhere else than Frankfurt, namely in Bonn. This is to avoid giving Frankfurt any special advantage as a financial centre over London and Paris, its main European rivals. It is a moot point whether Frankfurt would gain much new business from having the ECB. The city would certainly have an enhanced status as the location of the central institution of Emu, assuming that this really does take place around the end of the century. But trading in the financial markets would not necessarily benefit from the fact that ECB policy was decided on the River Main. 'There would still be healthy competition between financial centres', says Mr Kohlhaussen. 'Frankfurt would not be superior to other financial cities.' But a decision against Frankfurt for the ECB would, he reckons, 'be a very unfortunate signal'. Mrs Gabriele Eick, the head of Frankfurt's economic development corporation, feels the same. 'The loss of the D-Mark is taken extremely seriously by ordinary people.' Frankfurt, she adds, also has good communications, is not too big, and has attractive cultural offerings and beautiful hilly and wooded surroundings. Whatever the politicians finally decide, however, the fact that Frankfurt's bankers and officials feel positive enough about the city to promote it as the site of the ECB - with strong backing from Chancellor Helmut Kohl - is proof of its growing confidence as a financial centre. Both Mr Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, have stressed that they want to see the city develop its financial muscle, not least because of the extensive capital-raising programme that lies ahead to help finance Germany's own reunification and the economic reconstruction efforts of eastern Europe. This means a more effective centralised stock exchange system based on Frankfurt as the pre-eminent German bourse. It also involves tighter rules on insider trading, much more transparency in company share registers, and fewer restrictions on investment trusts. Moves to implement these changes are under way, although it remains to be seen how quickly they will happen. Meanwhile, Frankfurt waits to see if it will be the favoured choice for the ECB. It still seems to have the edge over London and Luxembourg, with Amsterdam regarded as the main threat. But a lot of water will have to flow under the bridges of the Main before the rest of the EC accepts Germany's claims for Frankfurt.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE DOUBLE expiry in both the futures and traded options went off smoothly and was followed by strong two-way business with the sellers eventually gaining the upper hand, writes Joel Kibazo. After a brief spate of selling, the September futures contract duly expired at 10.30 am, finishing trading at 3,008 and a closing volume of 3,627. Attention then turned to December and having opened at 3,003, strong demand from the leading houses, including Salomons, James Capel, and a leading Swiss house, the contract leapt forward, reaching the day's high of 3,050 just ahead of midday. However, selling from those same houses and from some of the leading independents saw earlier gains relinquished and a poor Wall Street only served to increase the selling. December closed at 3,007, at an 11-point discount to fair value which stands at 18 points. Volume was 16,112. Expiry of the index options was the main event in traded options and it passed off comfortably. Total volume reached 36,408.</p>

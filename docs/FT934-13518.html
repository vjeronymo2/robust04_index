			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Leading Article: A less easy partnership GERMAN REUNIFICATION took place in 1990 after extensive negotiations between Bonn and its Nato and EC allies on the foreign policy implications of a larger Germany. On the economic aspects of bringing together Germany's disparate parts, for instance over the terms of the D-Mark's entry to the east in July 1990, there was little or no consultation. This may have appeared a plausible course at the time, but it now looks a miscalculation. Bonn's policy errors during the past three years have increased the already considerable economic problems of integrating east Germany, as well as the length of time they will persist. For Germany's EC partners, this has two sets of consequences. First, unification-induced inflationary pressures, by forcing the Bundesbank to maintain high short-term interest rates that were then transmitted abroad, have contributed significantly to the European recession and to 1992-93 currency unrest. Second, the need to finance large fiscal transfers to support east German living standards has become a factor behind wider strains in Germany's relationship with the rest of the EC. Because of the size of the east-west German economic gap, these payments - currently equivalent to 5 per cent of German gross domestic product - are likely to persist at least until the end of the decade. The Community thus stands merely at the beginning of its task of adjusting to the emergence of a Germany which has become bigger, poorer and more polarised. German scepticism One particular difficulty centres on the scepticism of the German public about the wisdom of exchanging the D-Mark for a single currency. Doubts are growing whether Germany itself will be able to fulfil the stability-oriented criteria designed to determine which countries could participate in economic and monetary union. Mr Otmar Issing, a leading member of the Bundesbank directorate, last week gave the first official warning that overall German public sector debt could 'at least temporarily' breach the 60 per cent Emu target laid down in the Maastricht treaty. There must be longer-term doubts, too, about the sustainability of EC budget policies that depend on German willingness to remain by far the main contributor to Community funds. Germany's net payments to the EC last year - Ecu9bn - were three times those of the next highest donor, Britain. Yet, as a result of unification, Germany has slipped from second to seventh place in EC members' GDP per head. EC structural fund payments to east Germany, now one of the Community's poorest regions, are expected at least to double next year to more than Ecu2bn. More will probably have to be done to correct a growing belief in German public opinion - most acute in east Germany - that Community membership brings Germany more disadvantages than benefits. Community compliance Extra funds for east Germany are, however, unlikely to be forthcoming unless Germany maintains high standards of compliance with Community legislation. One disturbing signal at the end of last week was the Bonn government's defiance of EC limits on land which can be sown with cereals in eastern Germany. In the past, German agriculture ministers have negotiated special arrangements - consistent with Community law - to offset cuts in EC payments to farmers with national subsidies. The attempt to put the special predicament of east German farmers above the requirements of reforming the Common Agricultural Policy is, however, a more serious matter. It undermines attempts to persuade the Paris government to agree curbs in agriculture support that are crucial for the talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Additionally, the spectacle of the Community's chief erstwhile proponent of fiscal discipline inciting its farmers to break EC law may strengthen the suspicion that, in its dealings with the Community, Bonn is practising a form of double language. A strong Community requires a self-confident Germany capable of setting the EC agenda. To master its post-unity difficulties, Germany will need solidarity from its partners. This solidarity may be found wanting unless Germany lives up to its previous reputation for solidity and reliability.</p>

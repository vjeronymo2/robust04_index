			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TOROS GET 1 HIT, SCORE 7 RUNS, TOP RIVERSIDE  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills needed only one hit to score seven runs in the  seventh inning in a 7-1 victory Wednesday over UC Riverside at Toro Field. The  victory improved the Toros' record to 2-0 in the California Collegiate Athletic  Assn. and 4-4-1 overall.  </P> <P> Rick Davis pitched a three-hitter and struck out 13 to improve to 3-0. The  senior right-hander has struck out 53 batters in 38 innings. Davis took a  no-hitter into the sixth inning. The only run he gave up was a leadoff homer in  the seventh.  </P> <P> The Toros, who had only four hits, struck back in the bottom of the seventh  with help from the Highlanders. Riverside's Doug Pierce, working on the  shutout, walked the first two batters, then loaded the bases with an  intentional walk following a sacrifice. A squeeze brought home the tying run,  and catcher Mike McCarthy followed with a two-run single. An error, another  squeeze and a wild pitch brought in the final runs.  </P> <P> The Toros will play their annual alumni game Saturday at 1 p.m., then resume  CCAA play Monday at home against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P></p>

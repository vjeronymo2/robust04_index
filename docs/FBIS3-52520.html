Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  made this remark today, adding: Both Israel and the PLO have a  vested interest in the resumption of the talks. The prime  minister made the remarks during a farewell ceremony for  outgoing U.S. Ambassador William Brown. Our political  correspondent Udi Segal reports from the prime minister's bureau:    [Begin recording] [Segal] 'Arafat is trying to deviate from  the agreement of principles, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said.  We, for our part, are committed to the agreement and our stand  is clear. We are exchanging comments and messages, the prime  minister confirmed. The issue of the resumption of the Taba  talks is being clarified, Rabin said, and will certainly be  decided on within the next few days.    [Rabin] Basically, however, they are still claiming that the  matters discussed in Cairo are ad referendum [last two words as  heard], that is -- pending approval. The scope of approval or  whether there is approval at all is currently being examined.  If for them it is ad referendum, for us too it is ad referendum.    [Segal] The scope of approval was expressed in several  additional faxed messages received at the Foreign Ministry over  the past few hours. A senior Foreign Ministry source told us  that the Palestinians understand our demands, and added: We are  certain that the whole matter will be settled in a few days.    Rabin also sounded optimistic. Speaking at the ceremony  today, he rejected an attempt to portray the Oslo agreement as a  dish that went sour:    [Rabin] I believe it did not go sour. The dish is fine. It  is a declaration of principles. The implementation of each  stage of it requires a separate agreement. We adhere to the  Declaration of Principles and intend to implement it. I believe  that the other side wants this as well. It is only natural for  each side to try getting the most for itself, based on its  concepts. This is what negotiations are all about. We simply  need patience. We should not get excited over such or other  attempts, but proceed onward.    [Segal] Rabin answered our questions at the end of a  farewell ceremony for U.S. Ambassador William Brown, who ends a  third, non-consecutive term in Israel. Brown spoke about  Yitzhaq Rabin's courageous leadership, and in his congratulatory  address he used some Hebrew terms he had learned during his long  years in Israel.    [Brown, in English] The next time we meet I will be an  betafqid pensyoner [acting pensioner], but I can only ask, as a  favor, that you extend that warmth, hospitality, frankness,  candor, and generosity to my illustrious successor Ed Djerejian  as you did to me. Thank you very, very much.    [Segal, translates and continues] Rabin praised Brown warmly  for his role as Uncle Sam's ambassador in Israel. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Improving trend at United Newspapers LORD STEVENS of Ludgate, chairman of United Newspapers, told yesterday's annual meeting that profits in the first half of this year should be up on last year's comparable period. He added: 'We hope that this improvement will be maintained throughout the year. Further improvement can be expected from any upturn in the economy.' Lord Stevens warned, however, that the group's markets showed little sign of any significant pickup in the economy - United publishes the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily Star. He said Express Newspapers had made a good start to the year and had benefited from higher advertising volumes and revenues, while costs had been held at last year's levels. The regional newspaper division, however, had yet to benefit from any sustained increase in classified advertising. Mr George Bull has been appointed a non-executive director of United following the retirement of Sir Derek Palmer.</p>

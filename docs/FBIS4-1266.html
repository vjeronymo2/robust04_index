			<p>BFN     [Text] The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]  nominated ministers of information, Joe Mulbah, and agriculture,  Roland Massaquoi, today appeared before the Transitional  Legislative Assembly [TLA] at the Capitol building in Monrovia  for confirmation hearings. Both ministers, Mulbah and Dr.  Massaquoi, now join four other NPFL ministers who were formerly  inducted into office last week. The appearance of the two  ministers is in line with the position of the leadership of the  NPFL to have all its nominated officials formerly seated on the  LNTG [Liberia National Transitional Government].</p>

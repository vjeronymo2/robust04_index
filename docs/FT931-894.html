			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: 'Blip' that cannot be forgotten Sir, I was surprised to see that one of the charts used by the chancellor in his Budget broadcast showed interest rates declining steadily from 14 per cent to the current level of 6 per cent. I am sure that it is an episode he would rather forget, but I seem to remember a 'blip' to this declining trend in mid-September last year. Creating history in terms of record levels of unemployment, record length of recession, record speed in breaking election pledges, and most rapid exit from the ERM is all very well, but re-writing history is another matter altogether. Politicians may see it as their role to manipulate facts, but we cannot allow them to change the truth, however painful it may be.

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Regional finance centres need a lift The cheaper services offered by Europe's regional financial centres has done little to weaken the dominance of London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan. Manchester Business School yesterday published a study of 17 regional centres in the European Union which found that the cost of communications was favouring the increasing centralisation of big decision-making in London and Paris, and acting as a brake on the development of regional centres. Air fares are as much as 22 per cent higher between regional centres and their financial capitals - and for region-to-region travel - than for flights between the international financial capitals themselves. Emerging regional financial centres such as Lille, Manchester, Stuttgart or Turin have grown in the past 10 years by offering cheaper prices in regional markets as prices charged by 'first-tier' international centres have been rising. However, they are making little headway in the wider European single market, the report suggests. Regional centres will have to develop better networks if cross-border deals and fee-income are not to be perpetually channelled through first-tier centres, it concludes. Six of the second-tier cities in the study - Athens, Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Dublin and Lisbon - are national capitals but all 17 serve comparable markets. For example, north-west England, with Manchester as its regional capital, has a similarly sized economy to that of Greece. London is increasingly becoming the dominant force across European financial markets but, like Paris, has intensified its domestic competitiveness during the recession. Mr David Baker, a former Bank of England official who is chief executive of Manchester Financial and Professional Forum, said: 'We need to look 10 years ahead, and try to ensure regional centres get their fair share of European business.' The centres have recently formed a European association to improve their networking led by Turin and its stock exchange. This is expected to help them develop contacts for cross-border deals. However, strong local leadership is also crucial. The research suggests most regional centres suffer confusion from a plethora of promotional bodies. Barcelona is emerging as Europe's best example of a good regional centre in this respect, in that it promotes itself clearly and has control of its own affairs, the report says.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Observer: Dithering decisively European Commission president Jacques Delors has finally revealed that he has made up his mind whether to run for the French presidency. Trouble is, he failed to divulge the nature of his decision. Tantalised Delorologists fell on a single cryptic statement. It was suggested he might feel he was betraying the French left by failing to stand, to which Delors replied: 'I have always done my duty . . . it's an eminently personal decision that depends only on my own conscience.' No one could agree what that meant. For some, the reference to 'duty' meant that he would run; he has already said that, if he made a bid for the Elysee, it would be 'out of duty'. Others homed in on the word 'personal' - a telling reference, they felt, to the family implications for a 69-year-old of a seven-year commitment after a gruelling decade running Europe. Some of Delors' closest advisers remain convinced he will not run. But Delors' widening lead in the opinion polls over potential Gaullist rivals like Jacques Chirac and Edouard Balladur clearly puts increasing pressure on him to throw his hat in the ring. So when will he put the pundits out of their misery? Well, he is due to appear on French prime-time TV on Sunday. Until then, they will have to content themselves with feeding on the most substantial indicator of presidential intent so far. Last Friday, when visiting the Elysee, Delors eschewed his usual foreign-made car for a Renault.</p>

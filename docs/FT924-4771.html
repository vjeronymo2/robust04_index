			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Air charter licences show 24% rise THE number of licences granted to travel companies selling air-charter holidays has risen by 24.1 per cent on last year, the Civil Aviation Authority said yesterday. All operators taking package holidaymakers abroad by air have to receive Air Travel Organisers' Licences from the authority. The authority and holiday companies said that, while this appeared to indicate optimism in the industry, it was too early to say whether the rise would result in excess capacity and a price war. Holiday companies cut prices heavily last summer to sell about 500,000 surplus holidays. The authority said that while companies seemed to be expecting an expansion in their programmes, two other factors may have accounted for this year's sharp rise in the number of licences. Several of the large operators do not renew their licences until March, so the authorisations they hold are for the summer of this year rather than for next year. The figures have also been distorted by the inclusion for the first time of some tourists who have booked package holidays travelling on scheduled carriers. The authority said the number of return seats licensed in November this year stood at 14.3m compared with 11.5m last year. It said the licences granted represented a total turnover of almost Pounds 5bn compared with Pounds 3.7bn last year. The average price of a holiday has risen to Pounds 350 compared with Pounds 323 last year. Mr Charles Newbold, managing director of Thomson, the largest UK operator, who has frequently called on the industry to reduce its capacity, said: 'Obviously I'm concerned about companies putting on too many holidays for next year, but at the moment there's no evidence in either direction.'</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Power to the poor relation: The European Parliament's new-found strength The European Union's Awkward Squad, up to now represented by the French with their misgivings over free trade, by the British and their obsession with sovereignty and Euro-social policy, and by Spaniards demanding more EU money, has acquired a new member: the European Parliament. The directly elected, 518-member, trans-European assembly is beginning to flex its muscles and to use the significant powers it gets under the Maastricht treaty. With Maastricht in force since last November, and with a substantial change of membership expected after June's European elections, Strasbourg is enjoying being the new kid on the Euro-block. The parliament has long suffered derision: as the mother-in-law of parliaments; a talking shop for political has-beens and no-hopers; a gravy train for gilded gypsies who hold their plenaries in Strasbourg, their committee meetings in Brussels, assisted by their staff in Luxembourg, while clocking up the generous expenses needed to fuel this perpetual motion. But this poor relation to the European Commission (which proposes EU measures) and the Council of Ministers (which decides whether to put these into law) is now coming into its own. Neither Brussels nor the member states can afford to ignore it. The clearest example of this new-found strength is Strasbourg's brinkmanship over the treaty to bring Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway into the Union next year, which parliament must approve by 260 out of 518 votes next month if the plan is not to unravel. During last month's bitter row between Britain and its partners over voting rights in the Council, the Euro-MPs made clear that, if the UK won its demand that a small minority of countries could continue to block decisions when the 12 become 16, it would not allow enlargement to go ahead. This attitude constrained member states to make only cosmetic concessions to the UK. Even that, however, annoyed MEPs across party lines. This week's plenary session in Strasbourg was therefore lobbied intensively, by Scandinavian and Austrian government and party leaders, by Commission president Jacques Delors, and by the current Greek presidency of the Council. As a result, the accession treaty will be put to a vote on May 4. But it looks certain that there will be a price. When the 12 members and the Commission review the Maastricht treaty in 1996, parliament may not get a seat at the top table but its views will have to be treated seriously. It could even get more powers, which it says are needed to hold to account both Brussels and national ministers meeting behind closed doors in the Council. It is easy to overlook the fact that parliament, even before Maastricht, already wielded considerable law-making powers. The Single European Act, making possible the single market, conferred on disgruntled MEPs what seemed only consultative power. But the act's move to more majority-voting in Council gave unforeseen influence to parliament. Mr Richard Corbett, the leading constitutional specialist at the parliament, says that between July 1987 and September 1991, 208 Euro-laws were passed to Strasbourg, which made 2,734 amendments. Of these, 1,410 passed into EU and therefore national law. After Maastricht, parliament has 'co-decision' power with the Council, including the rights to veto most measures member states pass by qualified majority voting and to vet the new Commission which takes office next year. In the handful of cases so far concluded, parliament forced the Council to raise R&amp;D spending by Ecu400m (Pounds 315m) over the next five years. But on Wednesday, not untypically, the first ever veto on a Council decision - to ban motorcycle engines above 100-brake horsepower - failed to occur, because not enough MEPs turned up to vote. 'We often stray into cock-up territory, that is true,' acknowledges one parliament official. The parliament is erratic, but is getting less so. Recent attempts by Euro-MPs to set up a Euro-observatory for Unidentified Flying Objects, or this week's call for a so-called 'urgency debate' on the end of the second world war, are no doubt hilarious. But it is a sign of the times that neither request got on the agenda. Socialist-inspired reforms of procedure to root out frivolous motions and amendments, and the emergence of new driving forces, may at last give Strasbourg what it has lacked: a sense of priorities. 'We are concentrating on what is achievable and do-able,' says Mr Julian Priestley, secretary-general of the Socialist group, the largest bloc in Strasbourg. The apparats of cross-border groups like the Socialists and the Christian Democrats, the growing expertise of rapporteurs appointed to steer legislation, a core of experienced parliamentary vice-presidents, and the increasing importance of committee secretariat work, now set parliament's agenda. And with some agility. Parliament, for instance, must be consulted on Mr Delors' successor, but can only object to him or his fellow commissioners by rejecting the entire team. However, officials say they will not put the issue on parliament's agenda unless it can hold US Senate-style confirmation hearings with each candidate. The inferiority complex MEPs had in relation to the other EU institutions or their national MPs 'is a thing of the past', Mr Priestley argues. 'You do get the impression of a parliament coming of age.' Nevertheless, the popular backlash against the undemocratic way in which Europe's great leap forward was decided switched the spotlight back on to national parliaments as the true fount of democratic legitimacy. Did Strasbourg lose out? Links between Strasbourg and national assemblies are tightening, raising MPs' Euro-literacy and MEPs' sensitivity to national concerns. But the effect is strongest on MEPs, undermining transnational group cohesion in Strasbourg. Ms Maryon McDonald, an anthropologist studying the parliament, observes that 'all (MEPs') more powerful emotive symbols still come from the nation state'. Unlike the true believers at the Commission, many MEPs have trouble psyching themselves into the politically correct Euro-discourse of those who would construct Europe. But the trend is in parliament's favour. At the nitty-gritty level, where Euro-law is decided by majority vote in Council, it is the European Parliament, not a national parliament which may have been in the defeated minority, that is best placed to exercise control. And it has given notice that it is willing to play rough.</p>

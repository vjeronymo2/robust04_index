			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PALKIE HELPS KEEP BUENA ROLLING SMOOTHLY AHEAD  </P> <P> A young woman doesn't so much play basketball at Buena High as fit in. But if  the fit is right, she will find herself playing at a level she may never have  dreamed possible.  </P> <P> Buena players figure that as long as no one stands out, no one stands to lose.  </P> <P> It's a belief instilled by Coach Joe Vaughan, who has directed the Bulldogs to  the Channel League title 11 times -- and the state title twice -- in the past  13 years. This year is no different: The scoring and rebounding are spread as  evenly as lawn seed and the team has mowed down every opponent.  </P> <P> Typifying the selflessness, yet finding room to grow as an individual, is Mia  Palkie, a junior forward. In three games last week, including two against  Buena's toughest Channel League foes, Palkie scored a team-high 37 points.  </P> <P> That's hardly a good night's work for the likes of Michelle Palmisano of  Thousand Oaks or Nichole Victoria of Camarillo. But who is the most valuable  cog on a team boasting a record of 19-0 entering the week?  </P> <P> "Mia should become a major college player," Vaughan said. "She has a  well-rounded game. Besides scoring and rebounding, she is a key force in our  pressing situations."  </P> <P> Palkie, 5-foot-8, is just now understanding how good she can become, Vaughan  said.  </P> <P> "She plays like a boy the way she attacks the basket and drives for layups," he  said. "She'll keep getting better. Mia is a player who doesn't realize her  potential yet."  </P> <P> Palkie did realize the value of fitting into Vaughan's system, however, and  that will enhance the growth of her individual skills as well as increase her  chances of playing for a Southern Section championship.  </P></p>

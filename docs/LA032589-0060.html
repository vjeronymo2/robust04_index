			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POST-CENSUS REDISTRICTING MEANS BITTER STRUGGLE FOR HOUSE SEATS  </P> <P> Reapportionment, another word for political trouble, will follow closely on the  heels of the 1990 census.  </P> <P> "That's where the rubber hits the road," one Democratic office-holder said of  redistricting, "and the pavement is hot."  </P> <P> Indeed, how legislative and congressional district lines are redrawn to  equalize population will shape state and federal legislation into the 21st  Century, affecting issues ranging from Social Security benefits to highway  construction, air pollution and national security.  </P> <P> Because population in the United States keeps shifting from the Frost Belt to  the Sun Belt, California is once again expected to be a big winner in the 1991  reapportionment sweepstakes with a gain of five or six congressional seats.  That will give California, already the biggest delegation in the nation, 50 or  51 seats -- more than 11% of the 435-member House.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bitter, Rancorous  </P> <P> Where those new seats will end up is anybody's guess at this point, but  Republican and Democratic leaders are already positioning themselves for the  redistricting battle, a typically bitter and rancorous affair that occurs every  10 years, after each census.  </P> <P> If population growth alone were the basis for drawing the new district lines,  Los Angeles County would get an additional one-third of a congressional seat.  The surrounding counties of Riverside, Imperial, San Diego and Orange would net  slightly more than two seats. The rest of the seats would be spread throughout  the state in growth areas such as the Central San Joaquin Valley, the Bay Area  and the mountain counties in the north that have experienced phenomenal growth.  </P> <P> Within Los Angeles County, the growth has been fastest in the northern areas of  Newhall and Saugus and in certain minority areas, such as East Los Angeles. It  has been slowest in the inner city, the Westside and other Anglo neighborhoods.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Even Distribution  </P> <P> But, as a Democratic redistricting expert put it, "there's nothing about any  population trend that dictates the lines."  </P> <P> The law requires that population be evenly distributed among the districts. How  the district lines are drawn to accomplish that distribution is left to the  state Legislature.  </P> <P> That, of course, means that districts are drawn to benefit the party that  controls the Legislature, and the only immediate deterrent to a blatant  "gerrymander" is the prospect of a gubernatorial veto.  </P> <P> In 1981, when the last redistricting was done, Democrats not only controlled  the Legislature but the governorship as well. And when Republicans turned to  the state Supreme Court to overturn the redistricting signed into law by  Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., they faced a court dominated by Brown's  appointments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Basis for Attack  </P> <P> The high court upheld the plan, which withstood a continued Republican assault  all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided that the GOP had no legal  basis to attack it.  </P> <P> The 1981 plan was primarily the work of the late Rep. Phillip Burton (D-San  Francisco), whose now-famous assurance to both Democrats and Republicans  anxiously awaiting the final plan was, "You're in your mother's arms." The plan  not only protected all Democratic incumbents but also most GOP incumbents -- at  the expense of a handful of Republicans whose districts were "collapsed."  </P> <P> Under the Burton plan, Democrats have maintained majorities in both the  Legislature and an even tighter lock on the state's delegation to the House of  Representatives. In Congress, for example, only one seat in the state has  changed parties in 180 races over the last decade. That was the 38th District  in Orange County, where Republican Robert K. Dornan in 1984 unseated 10-year  incumbent Jerry M. Patterson, a moderate Democrat. Democrats now hold a 27-18  edge over Republicans in the delegation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Defies Political Behavior'  </P> <P> In the Legislature, Democrats hold a 47-33 majority in the Assembly and a 24-15  majority in the Senate, where there is one independent.  </P> <P> "In political terms, that's the most effective gerrymander in the history of  the United States," GOP reapportionment expert Tony Quinn said. Articulating a  familiar theme among Republicans who believe that California is becoming more  conservative, Quinn added, "The congressional delegation in particular defies  the political behavior of the state."  </P> <P> Quinn said the Burton plan managed to "literally cement everybody in place. Not  only are there no shifts, there are virtually no competitive races."  </P> <P> For the 1991 redistricting, state Republican leaders are now pinning their  hopes on two strategies.  </P> <P> First, the GOP is considering several initiatives now being crafted for the  1990 ballot that would force Democrats to draw more compact districts that do  not cross city or county lines more than a set number of times. Several "good  government" groups, such as the League of Women Voters and Common Cause,  support such reforms. Democrats say such restrictions would give Republicans an  edge but would not necessarily prevent gerrymandering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hold Governorship  </P> <P> The second Republican strategy is to hold on to the governorship in 1990. After  Republican Gov. George Deukmejian decided not to seek a third term, the GOP put  heavy pressure on U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson to run. Wilson has announced that he  almost certainly will do so and has formed an exploratory committee.  </P> <P> One of Wilson's first moves as a quasi-gubernatorial candidate was to call for  support of GOP-backed reapportionment initiatives.  </P> <P> If elected, Wilson could veto any Democratic plan he did not like. It would  require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to override a veto, and since  Democrats do not hold a two-thirds majority in either house, the GOP would be  in a very strong bargaining position.  </P> <P> "If there is a Republican governor, then I think the Legislature is out of it,"  said James Tucker, chief legal counsel to the Assembly Elections and  Reapportionment Committee during the 1981 redistricting. "I don't think they  can come up with a plan that gets two-thirds of both houses."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ways to Implement Plan  </P> <P> Quinn said, however, that there are ways the Democrats may be able to put their  plan into effect, if only for the 1992 elections, even if the governor were to  veto it. In the past, the state Supreme Court has authorized interim use of the  new districts proposed by the Legislature when the justices are persuaded that  using the old ones would violate constitutional guarantees of equal  representation.  </P> <P> "Anybody who believes that the election of a Republican governor can save us  from being run through again in 1991 is simply wrong," Quinn said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Democrats are anxious to capture the governorship next year.  </P> <P> "The game is this: If we win the governorship, we can pretty well draw the  lines without doing much consulting" with Republicans, said House Majority Whip  Tony Coelho (D-Merced), who will take an active role in California's  redistricting.  </P> <P> Coelho said that if Democrats control redistricting there probably will be a  3-2 split favoring Democrats in the estimated five new congressional seats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'An Impact'  </P> <P> "Nationally, it would have an impact in that we win a lot of our votes, close  ones, with a less than 10-vote margin," Coelho said. There are now 259  Democrats in the House and 174 Republicans, with two vacancies.  </P> <P> For Republicans, Quinn said, a "fair" redistricting would give the GOP three of  the five new House seats and Democrats one. The remaining district would be a  tossup.  </P> <P> However, Quinn said, the Democrats could take the same population figures and  voting data and come up with four seats for themselves and one for the GOP.  </P> <P> "If we play by the current rules again, we will lose again," Quinn predicted.  </P> <P> Coelho, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Rep. Vic Fazio  (D-Sacramento) will be among those who will try to fill Burton's shoes in the  Democrats' redistricting of congressional seats. Berman's brother,  behind-the-scenes political strategist Michael Berman, also is expected to have  a hand in drawing the new congressional lines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Sophisticated Information  </P> <P> This time around in redistricting, Republicans and Democrats alike will be  armed with computers, as they were 10 years ago. But the information available  to program into the computers will be much more sophisticated.  </P> <P> For the first time in any national population count, the federal Census Bureau  will make available to each state within a few weeks sets of three-color,  block-by-block maps. In all, the bureau has divided the nation into 9 million  blocks, more than three times what was mapped in 1980, according to Marshall L.  Turner Jr., chief of the Census Bureau's Redistricting Data Office.  </P> <P> States that match precincts with blocks will be able to cross-index population  information with voting patterns in much greater detail than ever before.  </P> <P> Tom Hofeller, director of computer services at the Republican National  Committee, recently told a conference on reapportionment at Claremont-McKenna  College that the new technology is going to make even the bloody 1981  redistricting in California "look like amateur night."  </P></p>

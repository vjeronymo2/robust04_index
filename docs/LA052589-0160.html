			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS VOTE TO EASE SOME BUILDING RULES IN OJAI VALLEY  </P> <P> The Ventura County Board of Supervisors this week relaxed construction rules in  the Ojai Valley, bowing to protests from hundreds of landowners who claimed  that a clerical error by planning officials had stymied their building plans.  </P> <P> Despite strict limits on residential development for the area, the board on  Tuesday ordered staff to prepare an ordinance that would make building permits  available to anyone with proof that they had begun seeking approval for a new  home before May 5.  </P> <P> It was on that date that county planners discovered that they had mistakenly  issued too many permits for the smog-prone valley and immediately ordered a  freeze on construction there.  </P> <P> To help remedy the situation, the supervisors last week agreed to allow 104  residents who had already received clearance to proceed with their plans, even  though their homes would exceed annual limits set by the county to curb air  pollution.  </P> <P> But that failed to quell the fears of another 100 to 200 prospective builders  who contended that county planners had told them that there would be no problem  in obtaining the necessary permits.  </P> <P> In what the planning staff Tuesday called a "conscientious, reasonable"  solution, landowners were given a list of 23 documents, any one of which could  serve as proof that a builder had been seeking approval prior to the  moratorium.  </P> <P> Those documents include grading permits, letters of commitment from a water  company, sewage disposal reviews, payment of school district fees and flood  control clearance.  </P> <P> "Imagine how frustrating it would be to go to the counter in October and be  told there was no problem," Supervisor James. R. Dougherty said, "and then come  back in November and be told, 'We're sorry.' "  </P> <P> As of Tuesday, there were 178 applications for Ojai Valley building permits on  the county Planning Department's waiting list, but officials didn't know how  many of those would qualify for permits under the new rules.  </P> <P> At the board meeting, however, about two dozen builders -- who now might have  to wait until 1993 to obtain permits -- complained that the proposed remedy did  not go far enough.  </P> <P> Many said they had sold their homes, purchased lots in the Ojai Valley and even  obtained construction loans, but did not have any of the 23 documents required  by the county.  </P> <P> "I'm a couple hundred thousand into a project and virtually have something of  no value right now," said Brad Hughes, a real estate agent who plans to build  on a vacant parcel he owns in the area.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's morally fair . . . and I don't think it's legal," agreed  Andrew Pollet of Oak View. "It was the error that prompted and encouraged  people to buy lots and expend large sums of money."  </P> <P> But many would-be builders would have been thwarted by the Ojai Valley Clean  Air Ordinance anyway, said planning officials.  </P> <P> Planners said they discovered the error May 5 after recalculating numbers  during a routine discussion of the clean-air ordinance, which called for 156  residential permits to be issued for the Ojai Valley in 1989.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Number Exceeded  </P> <P> When they realized that number had been exceeded, they immediately stopped  issuing permits. Even so, 104 landowners in excess of the limit had already  received clearance to build this year, planners said.  </P> <P> To accommodate those additional homes, officials said they will have to borrow  from future allocations, which call for 94 homes to be built annually in the  area for the next five years. That would entail using the entire allocation for  1990, as well as a portion of the 1991 allocation, to absorb the excess permits  issued this year.  </P> <P> Accommodating any others who will qualify for permits under the new ordinance  will probably entail borrowing from allocations well into 1992 and perhaps  beyond, planners said.  </P> <P> Russ Baggerly, a spokesman for Citizens to Preserve the Ojai and the Ventura  County Environmental Coalition, conceded that there would be an adverse impact  from the boom in construction over the next couple of years, but said it would  level out over time.  </P> <P> "Obviously, there was a mistake," Baggerly said. "But they're doing their best  to deal with the problem."  </P></p>

Rabin voiced his appreciation for Mubarak and the  other Egyptian figures who played a role in the mediation which  culminated in a signed agreement.    Husni Mubarak invited the prime minister to Cairo. Rabin  said he will gladly come, but he will wait for the formulation  of the entire agreement to be completed. There is still much  work to be done, the prime minister told Husni Mubarak. When  the entire agreement is formulated and its implementation is  launched, I will come to Cairo, he said.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: VW takes large stake in Japanese car distributor VOLKSWAGEN Audi Nippon, a wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary of the German carmaker, has confirmed it is buying a large stake in Jax, a Japanese car distributor, to boost its sales in the country. VW yesterday signed an agreement with Jax, which has an extensive network in metropolitan Tokyo, to take a 49.9 per cent stake. The German group has been seeking an alternative to its long-standing partnership with the Yanase distribution group, which is to be dissolved at the end of the year. Jax, sole distributor of Renault of France, has faced financial difficulties owing to the slump in Renault car sales. Mr Takanori Matsumoto, president of Jax, said it would end its sales agreement with Renault. Jax, listed on the over-the-counter market, will issue 5.3m new shares worth Y2.6bn (Dollars 21m) for allotment to VW. Renault said yesterday it had been seeking a new Japanese distributor for its cars for almost a year, but Jax would sell its cars for months yet, Reuter reports from Paris. 'We have an assurance from Jax on the distribution of our vehicles and after-sales service for a period that runs much longer than three months,' Renault said. Industry sources said there should not be any time gap between the end of the Jax link and the beginning of a contract with a new partner.</p>

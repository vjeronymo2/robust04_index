Some handlers are frequently late paying their assessments, which tends to cause cash flow problems for the committee and is inequitable to handlers who pay assessments when due. Imposing interest and late payment charges on handlers would encourage such handlers to pay their assessment obligations in a timely manner and help the committee maintain sufficient funds to carry on normal operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by August 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this proposal.

The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 40 handlers of Oregon-California potatoes who are subject to regulation under the order and approximately 450 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms, which includes handlers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of Oregon-California potatoes may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 25, 1994, a mail ballot was completed in accordance with &sect;947.26 during which the committee recommended, under the authority of &sect;947.41(a) of the order, that handlers who are delinquent in paying their assessments be subject to late payment and interest charges. Nine affirmative ballots were received, meeting the minimum number for a quorum for the fourteen-member committee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee depends upon handler assessments for operating funds. Handlers are invoiced by the committee on a monthly basis. However, some handlers are continually late with their assessment payments and a few wait until the end of the season to remit to the committee what is owed. When assessments are not paid in a timely manner, the handlers paying assessments on time are placed in an unfair situation compared to the delinquent handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Consolidation rules in Frankfurt, Paris Construction stocks starred in Frankfurt and Paris, writes Our Markets Staff. In both, there were signs that analysts were exploring stocks and sectors which had lagged behind the general advance in 1993. PARIS consolidated, the the CAC-40 index closing 16.22 lower at 2274.34. Turnover rose from FFr3.26bn to FFr4.5bn. Eurotunnel extended its recent strength, gaining FFr1.10 to FFr55.50. Construction stocks were led higher by Bouygues, up FFr22 to FFr714 and expected to gain this year from the government's building-related growth initiatives. Financials fell, afraid that Monday's bank rate cuts would slim lending margins, and insurers were down on worries about the impact of recent storms in France. Improving underperformers included Accor, up another FFr5 at FFr627, and LVMH, FFr31 better at FFr3,829. FRANKFURT mixed a continued penchant for construction stocks with general profit-taking. The Dax index fell 14.40 to 2,253.58 on the session and, Ibis-indicated, by 3.73 more to 2,249.85 in the post bourse. In construction stocks, recommended after they lagged behind the market last year, Hochtief rose another DM33 to DM1,233 and Holzmann by DM30 to DM1,075. Elswhere, Metallgesellschaft was nervous ahead of today's meeting with its banks, falling DM11.50 to DM267.50 on the session, and another DM7.50 to DM260 in the afternoon. MADRID saw real fear in the banking sector in the wake of the Bank of Spain's intervention in Banesto. Banco Central Hispano was badly shaken by rumours that it would pass its final dividend and although it said it expected pay an unchanged dividend,the shares fell Pta180 to Pta3,200. The general index fell 2.55 to 324.61. Volume in BCH was heavy, with 611,000 shares traded. With its parent still suspended, Banesto's industrial holding company, Corporacion Banesto, lost Pta150 to Pta1,750. ZURICH consolidated, but a 3.6 rise to 2,999.8 was sufficient to keep the SMI index at a record high. Cyclicals, strong on Monday, ended mostly lower. Brown Boveri eased SFr2 to SFr1,114 and Alusuisse registered fell SFr8 to SFr656. However, Sulzer registered added SFr24 to SFr880. Among insurers, Zurich registered rose SFr15 to SFr1,548. AMSTERDAM ended mixed, holding up in spite of weaker overseas markets and bonds. The AEX, which surged 6.1 on Monday, closed up 0.52 at a record 420.89. Philips topped the volume charts after breaking chart resistance at Fl 40.00 on Monday, posting a 20 cent gain to Fl 41.50. Elsevier added Fl 3.20 to Fl 188.20 after a US magazine said that Paramount, in the past, had tried to buy a stake in the publisher. Hoogovens continued to rise in response to a cautiously positive new year address by its chairman, picking up Fl 1.60 to Fl 51.90. MILAN was easier on profit-taking after the last month's gains amid some uncertainty over the outcome of a parliamentary confidence vote on January 12. The Comit index fell 4.19 to 620.32, the mood soured by political in-fighting over the date of the general election. Blue chips were broadly lower, with trading again dominated by Montedison in turnover of 32m shares, three times as high as for any other stock. The price dipped L24 to L930 after the cumulative rise of more than 25 per cent over the last two weeks. Nordic bourses had a buoyant day, with particular strong performances from HELSINKI and OSLO, up by 4.1 and 2.1 per cent respectively. Finnish equities were lifted by funds previously invested in fixed interest instruments, while Norwegian stocks were lifted by higher North Sea oil prices, and a stronger dollar. VIENNA detached from Frankfurt for the day and hit its highest point since June, 1991, the ATX index climbing 13.14 to 1,162.7. ISTANBUL reached its fourth consecutive record high, the composite index ending provisionally at 22,394, up 605.9 or 2.8 per cent from Monday, its previous all-time high, following tax changes in the money market. WARSAW slowed down, but the WIG index rose 300, or 2.3 per cent to 13,345 on buying from small investors. Traders said that the very active turnover of 2,100bn zlotys might be a sign that big investors were stepping up selling. LISBON burst into action after a quiet period, the BTA index jumping by 65.4, or 2.5 per cent to 2,685.3. The ship repairer, Lisnave, soared by Es85, or 6.7 per cent to Es1,265 after an announcement in the bourse's official bulletin said that its main shareholder, Mr Jose Manuel de Mello, would buy up any shares left over from an Es6bn rights issue.

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / 500 VSEL jobs to go at Barrow Shipbuilder VSEL yesterday said a further 500 jobs would be cut in its rolling programme at its nuclear submarine yard in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The jobs will go by May. A workforce of 6,000 will continue on the three remaining Trident submarine contracts and an order for the AS90 self-propelled gun for the army. Two Vanguard class submarines (above) have already been completed. VSEL said earlier predictions that the number of workers would eventually decline to 5,000 were still expected to be accurate. Mr Ray Davies, the company's personnel director, said: 'We regret very much having to make today's announcement, but I think that people now appreciate that we have no alternative other than to respond to our reducing workload if we are to remain competitive.' The yard's workforce has been cut from 14,000 during the past three years in a town heavily reliant on shipbuilding. Mr Alex Ferry, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said the cut was not unexpected as VSEL had been warning of further job losses. The cuts highlighted the need for the government to help defence-related companies diversify, he said. 'It is difficult to argue with the management to retain people when there is no work.'</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Personal View: Productivity leads America's recovery There is a quiet transformation now shaping the basic fabric of the US economy. The evidence: an impressive turnround in productivity, the magic elixir that hold the key to any nation's standard of living. Over the past year and a half, business productivity has risen at a 2.5 per cent rate - about double the rate that would have been expected in this anaemic recovery and all the more encouraging when compared with average increases of only 0.2 per cent from 1987 to 1991. Productivity improvements in the US stem from the most powerful economic force of all - global competition. Record trade deficits forced manufacturing companies to slash costs with a vengeance. Now the pendulum of global competition has swung into the service sector, with deregulation and globalisation prompting a new wave of restructuring - hitting banks, airlines, telecommunications, retailers, insurance, advertising, accounting, and the legal profession. The dark side to this outcome has not been lost on America's once sacrosanct white-collar workers. White-collar hiring in services has screeched to a standstill - rising only 0.2 per cent in 1991, easily the weakest performance in more than 20 years. And with private service industries accounting for literally three out of every four workers currently employed in the US, the outcome has been a dramatic compression in overall job creation. What is critical to appreciate, however, is that today's pain could well be laying the foundation for lasting gain. Many positive benefits are already apparent. Reflecting intense cost cutting, business unit labour costs are now up only 0.5 per cent over the past year, a very hopeful sign for the inflation prognosis. Indeed, disinflation is the silver lining of a productivity-led recovery, broadening the purchasing power of beleaguered consumers, and auguring well for further reductions in longer-term interest rates. Needless to say, the beneficial impacts of such a productivity-led recovery may be difficult to appreciate in today's tough economic climate. That is because the US economy is still in the first stage of a productivity revival. The victims of restructuring are fearful of permanent job loss. And survivors are hurting as well - less secure about their job prospects and working longer and harder than ever before. Of course, productivity gains cannot be sustained just by adhering to the slash-and-burn strategies of intensified cost cutting. Such an outcome would lead to a 'hollowing' of corporate America at precisely the time when rebuilding is essential to maintain global market share in an ever-expanding global economy. Thus, the second phase of a productivity-led recovery requires companies to look beyond restructuring - embarking on a bold course of enhanced capital formation and providing workers with the latest in technologically sophisticated tools needed for improved efficiency solutions. There is also a third phase, entailing long-overdue upgrading of the quality of human capital - giving workers a new set of intellectual tools, so they can work smarter, continually pushing out the envelope of discovery and innovation. A key goal in the 1990s should be to craft economic policies that provide further impetus to this nascent productivity-led recovery. Incentives for capital formation are critical, and in this regard President Clinton is to be commended for his support of an investment tax credit, defence conversion and a permanent R&amp;D tax credit. Moreover, Clintonomics has much to say about an upgrading of human capital, stressing the combination of educational reform, apprentice programmes and worker re-training. While these prescriptions seem to match the imperatives of productivity enhancement, the benefits could be lost if the new president tilts away from trade liberalisation to shelter US industry from global competition. Equally disconcerting would be a lack of fiscal discipline  - a possibility if the Clinton administration does not adopt a credible programme of deficit reduction. Policy must also be sensitive to the dark side of a productivity-led recovery. America is now suffering from a profound loss of traditional sources of job creation. In response, new sources of hiring must be stimulated - not by relying on make-work pork barrel projects but through the birth of new companies. Entrepreneurs and other risk-takers will need incentives to fill the looming employment gap of the 1990s. Elimination of capital gains taxes for patient investors in business start-ups - together with an employment tax credit - would go a long way in satisfying this aim. Such targeted incentives are the most affordable of all: no tax break without a job-creating start-up. Most of all, America's new leaders must now come to appreciate that the door is open. If the US is to earn its fair share in an increasingly competitive global market place, it must stay the course of a productivity-led recovery. Ultimately, that's what gives workers the fairest shake of all, getting paid a just reward for their innovative endeavours. The author is co-director of global economics, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co</p>

It quoted a  Cameroonian military official as saying 10 Nigerian boats, each  carrying about 10 soldiers, had attacked a Cameroonian position.  The radio said two of the boats were sunk and one Cameroonian  soldier was killed and one wounded in the exchange nine days  ago. A delegation from Cameroon has since held talks in Nigeria  aimed at reducing tension.</p>

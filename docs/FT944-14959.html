			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: KOP seeks to strengthen capital base by FM3bn Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, said yesterday it wanted to strengthen its capital base by FM3bn (Dollars 648.4m). The move is a final attempt to shake off the legacy of the country's banking sector crisis, which has brought the bank four years of losses. It intends to launch a FM2bn share issue - its third big equity offering in the past two years - and raise a further FM1bn in capital gains from asset sales. Part of the aim is to support an expected growth in lending as the Finnish economy recovers. However, the issue will also restore the bank's distributable equity and allow it to pay interest on FM1.75bn of preferred capital certificates held by the state. Otherwise, the government has the option to convert the certificates into shares, increasing its stake in the bank from 15 to 36 per cent. The share issue, at FM6.40 a share, will lift the bank's capital adequacy ratio above 11 per cent from 9.2 per cent. It is being informally guaranteed by Repola and Pohjola, KOP's leading shareholders who have said they will subscribe for at least FM1bn of the offer. 'This share issue is the culmination of our capitalisation programme,' said Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chief executive. He said there would also be a further effort to squeeze costs to cut annual operating expenses by FM300m. The capital-raising programme follows a worsening of the bank's performance in the first eight months of the year, when operating losses rose to FM1.3bn from FM896m in the same 1993 period. Cumulative losses over the 1991-1994 period exceed FM9bn. The bank said its figures had deteriorated in the second four months because of losses linked to the construction group Puolimatka. A charge of FM800m against Puolimatka was the main item in a total bad debt charge of FM1.67bn, compared with FM1.96bn in the same 1993 period. However, this year's figure was struck after full utilisation of a FM900m provision in the 1993 accounts for future write-offs. The bank's figures were also hit by FM160m in bond losses, compared with gains of FM340m in the same 1993 period. This lowered net income from financial operations by 7 per cent to FM1.48bn. KOP says expected net operating losses of between FM400m and FM500m in the final four months should largely be offset by realised and unrealised investment gains. It still hopes to make a profit next year, although it expects to remain in the red for the first few months.</p>

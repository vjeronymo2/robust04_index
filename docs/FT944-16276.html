			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Labour puts disenchanted Tory defector on parade A black woman who was on the Conservative party's list of approved candidates yesterday defected to Labour, saying she had given up hope of being selected by a party which had become out of date and too rightwing. Ms Joyce Sampson, a civil servant in the Department of Health, also criticised the Conservative party for moving to the right on Europe and on social issues. She described herself as a 'one-nation Tory' who no longer had a place in an increasingly ideological party. 'Over the last few years I have become quite disenchanted by what is happening in the Tory party and the policies being implemented,' she said. She also said that she had 'hit a glass ceiling' in the party - coming up against a lack of progress because of her gender and race. 'It has become very difficult to support the Tory party in a multi-ethnic society when it refuses to discuss race,' Ms Sampson added. 'The Conservative party is dying because it has refused to change.' Five years ago in an interview with a national newspaper Ms Sampson said she had moved up the Tory party hierarchy because race was not an issue. 'Contrary to what people think no one gives a damn (in the Tory party) if you do your job well,' she said in 1989. Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday said he was delighted with the defection of such a prominent Tory high flyer. 'Ms Sampson's defection to Labour underlines our early success in recruiting new members,' said Mr Prescott. 'We are increasing our members by 1,000 a month while the Tories are losing 1,000 members a month.'</p>

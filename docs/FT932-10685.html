			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Gartmore seeks insider dealing review MR PAUL Myners, chairman of UK fund manager Gartmore, yesterday claimed insider dealing is common in the City and called for a 'radical review' of the way the stock exchange and other authorities investigate the abuse. He said stock exchange investigations into allegations of insider dealing were poorly organised and may lack the right resources. 'The investigators don't go into enough depth and are very easily satisfied by superficial answers. I'm concerned that theft is taking place, and it's doing a great deal of damage to confidence in our financial institutions,' he said. Mr Myners raised his concerns in a letter in today's Financial Times, in which he claims the system for catching insider dealers is not working. He was responding to a sharp fall last week in the share price of Tiphook, the transport rental group in which Gartmore held 3 per cent, but has now largely sold out. Tiphook's shares fell from 329p to 293p, or 11 per cent, before the company issued a profits warning last Thursday. The stock exchange is understood to be investigating dealings in the company's shares. Mr Robert Montague, Tiphook chairman, said that before the profits warning only the company's key directors and corporate finance directors at its financial adviser UBS knew about the planned announcement. He said the company did not believe insider dealing had taken place. Tiphook believed the share price fell because of other factors, such as rumours about a loss on an investment in an associate. But some of Tiphook's other institutional shareholders have complained that information has leaked from the company in the past. 'This is not the first time it has happened with Tiphook,' according to Mr Douglas Ferrans, director of UK equities at Scottish Amicable. The stock exchange rejected Mr Myners' criticisms and said standards for investigation and detection of market abuse are very high. 'There is no doubt detection is extremely good. The problem is the UK's enforcement procedures. The legislation is not conducive to prosecutions,' according to Mr Mike Feltham, head of surveillance. He said the exchange detected 'quite a substantial amount' of insider dealing, and suggested a central enforcement agency. Letters, Page 16</p>

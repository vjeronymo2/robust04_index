			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone wanted Mobile telephone operator Vodafone recorded its biggest monthly increase in new connections in December and the shares responded in kind, jumping 13 to a record 607p. The company said 52,500 new subscribers had signed up last month, taking the total number to above 1m for the first time. Analysts had been expecting a figure of around 40,000. Although much of the increase was put down to Christmas buying in the consumer market, there were also indications that demand from business users - which pay higher tariffs - had also been strong. One telecoms analyst said that the December connections, which were up 75 per cent from November's, would focus the market's profit forecasts on to 1996, with some said to be pencilling in a figure of Pounds 450m to Pounds 460m. The group recently reported interim profits of Pounds 174.5m for the six months to September 30. Vodafone supporters said the more impressive 68,500 December connection figure reported by Cellnet, rival mobile phone operator owned by Securicor and BT, had been boosted by a generous sales package. Smith New Court, reiterating its strong buy stance on Vodafone, said the new connection figures showed the mobile telecoms market still had plenty of growth potential.</p>

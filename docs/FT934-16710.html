			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke A company plagued by inaccurate and potentially damaging rumours is undoubtedly placed in a difficult position. If it allows the allegations to be published and issues a denial, it takes the risk that the the rumour may gain currency. On the other hand, taking out an injunction to prevent publication may be viewed as an excessive response. To the extent that Ladbroke was caught between a rock and a hard place, one can feel sympathy. Yet to use such heavy weapons at a time when the company is in transition from the long tenure of Mr Cyril Stein's chairmanship to a new team is perhaps a pity. The new board has the difficult task of making its own mark. Ladbroke has made efforts in recent times to be more open, and a more limited riposte to the recent rumours would have confirmed that new approach. There have been attempts to cast doubt on Ladbroke's finances before. Judging by the 1992 annual report and subsequent interim statement, however, there is little new to worry about. True, borrowings are uncomfortably high, the rise in the dollar last year forced up gearing, and the heavy dividend payment looks out of line with trading prospects. The need to conserve cash is perhaps a barrier to the expansion of the capital-intensive Hilton hotel chain. Yet that is all well known. There does not seem to be a massive cash outflow and the company has the unusual luxury that practically none of its borrowings are secured on particular assets and it has no covenants on these debts. Since Ladbroke has considerable flexibility to resolve its difficulties, it might perhaps try to lighten up a bit.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE THE FEUD, HE KEEPS ON TRUCKING  </P> <P> There's a feud brewing in La Crescenta; been brewing there about 13 years.  </P> <P> Because he never got the Tonka toys he asked for as a child, Paris Fish grew up  with an unrequited love for trucks. Big trucks, like a diesel-snorting Kenworth  tractor. And the trailers that go with it.  </P> <P> When Fish turned 17, he learned to drive -- in an 18-wheeler. That's when he  bought his first truck. He's been buying and selling them ever since.  </P> <P> "They're big Tonka toys," said Fish, whose curly white beard, ample girth and  twinkling eyes give him a Santa-Claus like appearance.  </P> <P> Fish's neighbors are not amused.  </P> <P> They don't like the fact that he parks his equipment on a residential street in  front of their homes. Fish purchased his current "toy" -- a 1950 green and  yellow Kenworth tractor, once owned by a dairy -- in Texas two years ago.  </P> <P> He parks it on the street, near his home in the 4400 block of Raymond Avenue.  </P> <P> He also has a flatbed trailer there.  </P> <P> And a forklift.  </P> <P> Residents say the equipment is unsightly, illegal and a safety hazard, blocking  the view of motorists on a tight curve at Raymond and Community avenues. They  have complained to the County Sheriff's Department, the California Highway  Patrol, the air quality district, the county zoning department and their county  supervisor. About 25 residents in a two-block area signed petitions of protest  in 1987.  </P> <P> Fish, 39, has been hauled into court twice. One time he was charged with being  a public nuisance and faced a jail sentence. He has received innumerable  tickets and his equipment has been impounded.  </P> <P> On every occasion, Fish beat the charges. He won in a jury trial two years ago  and last year a Municipal Court judge threw out the case.  </P> <P> Fish and his attorney have successfully argued that county rules permit him to  keep the equipment at his house, where he has operated a heavy machinery  brokerage since 1975.  </P> <P> Still, Fish's neighbors contend that the business and equipment is  inappropriate in a residential zone and have not relented. At their insistence,  Supervisor Mike Antonovich last year asked that the district attorney again  press charges, according to Ollie Blanning, an Antonovich deputy.  </P> <P> But Michael Noyes, a deputy district attorney who closed the case, said he  rejected a request from the Department of Regional Planning seeking a criminal  complaint against Fish.  </P> <P> "There were no facts in the report, just neighbors complaining," Noyes said.  "Besides, it has been to court several times before."  </P> <P> Blanning said most neighborhood disputes are quieted when the offending party  gives in to pressure and remedies the situation. "But this has not been easily  solved," Blanning said. "It's been like trying to make Jello stick to a wall."  </P> <P> Fish's detractors claim that the jury decision and court ruling were misguided.  </P> <P> "He's wrong," said Carolyn Holmgren, who moved into the neighborhood with her  husband five years ago. "He has squeaked under the law. It's just so  frustrating."  </P> <P> Michael T. Wayland, Fish's attorney, called the complaints from neighbors to  county and law enforcement officials "a gross misuse of public funds. This is a  stupid neighborhood squabble, a private war."  </P> <P> Fish, who accuses his opponents of being "a few quarts short," said they are  just jealous of his hobby of collecting old heavy equipment. "They have never  come up with a shard of evidence that I have done anything illegal.  </P> <P> "These neighbors, they just like trouble," said Fish, who wears a heavy chain  around his neck. "They don't have any hobbies. I'm their hobby. If I moved the  trucks all off tomorrow, they would bug me about the color of my house."  </P> <P> But Fish won't stand still for people bugging him about his trucks.  </P> <P> "I've always liked old trucks," he said. "I've driven them for years."  </P> <P> He also has a 1928 Ford roadster stake truck, an antique wagon and the 1962  Corvette he drove in high school -- all stored in a large building he built  several years ago on his half-acre property.  </P> <P> Fish admits that some of the animosity stems from a transition in the nature of  the neighborhood since he moved there in 1975. Home values have soared along  the street where it was once common for residents to keep horses and park  trucks on the street. Recent buyers are more citified. "They're not what I call  the more old-fashioned rural type like I am."  </P> <P> Fish said he probably would move his wife and three children to a more rural  area outside Southern California "if somebody gave me the price for the house.  I'm not in love with the place by any stretch of the imagination," he said.  </P> <P> Fish's unwelcome collection in the city is not surprising to officials of the  American Truck Historical Society, a national organization of heavy equipment  history buffs with more than 10,000 members.  </P> <P> "Most people who collect the hardware -- the vehicles -- have some place to  keep them, like an old barn in the country," said Roy Stewart, managing  director. "If you're parking them on a street in the city, well, sometimes  neighbors are unhappy about that."  </P></p>

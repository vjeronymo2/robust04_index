			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (11): An empire in the setting sun / Profile of Jardine Matheson THE PURGE of the board of Trafalgar House was completed recently, at the behest of Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, a sister company of Jardine Matheson. Mr Keswick, who with his brother Henry in effect runs the Jardine Matheson empire, became chairman and installed Hongkong Land's finance director, Mr David Gawler, in the same position at Trafalgar. Jardine Matheson is one of the last of the traditional expatriate-run Hong Kong trading companies, whose assets range from hotels and offices in Hong Kong to a controlling stake in the UK supermarket chain Kwik Save. Those unfamiliar with the ways of the Keswicks could be forgiven for thinking that Hongkong Land had just bought Trafalgar. But that is not how Jardine Matheson does business. In a dawn raid on October 1 1992, Hongkong Land took a 14.99 per cent stake in Trafalgar and demanded boardroom representation. Trafalgar reacted by bringing forward some of its management changes. But Hongkong Land tightened its grip by gradually taking its stake up to 25 per cent and had two of its directors, Mr Rodney Leach and Sir Charles Powell, appointed as non-executives. Hongkong Land considered having Sir Charles take over as chairman but decided instead on Mr Keswick. Sir Nigel Broackes, former chairman and founder of the group, described Hongkong Land's decision to take a stake in Trafalgar as 'trying to get effective control without paying a bid premium'. He now believes it was for the good. Mr Leach, who is also a director of Jardine Matheson, said his group's involvement in Trafalgar should not be seen as a prelude to making an outright bid for the company. 'This is a long-term investment. We are not in the business of taking stakes as a prelude to making bids. We do not take the cheap, expedient way. We are interested in what the profits of Trafalgar will be in five years time.' Since Hongkong Land has taken effective control of the group there is no need to question Mr Leach's guarantee. This is born out by Hongkong Land's involvement in Kwik Save. Dairy Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hongkong's Jardine Matheson group, recently increased its stake in Kwik Save to just over 28 per cent. The UK supermarkets chain made record pre-tax profits of Pounds 110.5m in 1992. In July 1987, Dairy Farm succeeded with its Pounds 147m partial tender offer for a 25 per cent stake in Kwik Save. Rowan Morgan, retailing analyst at Nikko Europe, says: 'Over the last five years Kwik Save has produced the fastest earnings growth rate in the sector with the exception of Argyll. The quality of growth has been high, based upon strong like-for-like sales growth and organic store development rather than being dependent upon boosting gross margins.' Net gearing at the last balance sheet was a mere 2.2 per cent and the group is effectively ungeared. The Jardine Matheson empire may have hit on a controversial method of taking control of companies but if it continues to produce the sort of results unveiled at Kwik Save it is unlikely to be stopped.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel B. Kononenko under the rubric </F> "There Was Such a Case": "SOS in the Iranian Sky"]    [Text] Was our country selling weapons in the world  market? The answer is unequivocal--yes, we were selling weapons  and combat hardware. The only thing that cannot be understood  is, why hide it from our own people? Quite a few articles have  been published on this score in the open--but foreign  (!)--press, citing figures that testify eloquently that the  trade was profitable for us. And not only in a financial regard,  but first and foremost in a political one as well. There, as  they say, we were at the top.    An entirely concrete instance compelled me to take up the  once-forbidden topic. I found out about it in a fighter air  regiment armed with MiG-29 aircraft. I was interested, in a  conversation with an engineer of the regiment, how matters stood  with the delivery of spare parts and units to the technical  maintenance unit [TECh]. In reply he only spread his arms--a  total back-up, he said. It turned out that the "back-up"  dictated its own rules. Some equipment in good working order was  removed from an interceptor that had just come into the TECh and  installed on an aircraft on which the regular maintenance work  was almost completed. The newly arrived fighter was expected to  be "stuffed" with parts from another one waiting for preventive  repair. And so it goes around and around from month to month.    "We are selling MiGs abroad and sending the spare parts  there, and we are left with nothing," summed up an officer in a  fit of temper.    It was not all that hard to find out that some pilots in the  regiment have already flown to Iran several times, ferrying  MiG-29s procured by that country to them. The fliers, true, got  no pleasure from these overseas trips--there were too many of  all sorts of conventions in making the ferry flights. The  notorious "just-in-case" was in effect here as well. Everything  was heading toward something bad happening. And it did not take  long.    The latest pair of fighters, piloted by deputy squadron  commander Major A. Yermakov and senior pilot Captain S. Nikulin,  headed off for Teheran at the end of September 1990. The pilots  crossed the border of the USSR at a location coordinated in  advance at the stipulated time. They then took a heading of  120. It became clear that an instrument in the wingman's  cockpit was steadily reading thirty degrees more than the lead  pilot's. The latter unfortunately neglected the report of his  subordinate on this, assured of his own infallibility. And when  he finally thought about it, it was too late to make corrections.    The nominal flight time had expired. Teheran should have  shown up below, with the airfield a little further. But...    Flight operations officer Major A. Berzan, who had arrived  at  the Mehrabat air base earlier to meet his countrymen, looked up  at the sky in vain, listening for the characteristic drone of  the fighters. He, after all, while controlling the fighters from  the ground, had been left "blind"--radar monitoring of the air  traffic in the area of the landing airfield was not being  conducted for the pair of Soviet MiGs. The situation was  clarified by a report over the air by the lead aircraft  regarding a loss of orientation. Yermakov did not conceal the  fact that his last hope in the prevailing situation was an  escort aircraft, using which the possibility remained of  reaching the end point of the route. The commander of the  Iranian air base, however, did not fulfill his promise to help,  and an F-5 that was in reserve for such a situation did not go  up.    The pair of MiG-29s loitered for forty minutes over Iranian  territory. Nikulin suddenly lost sight of the lead aircraft on  one of their turns, after which he independently made the  decision to look for the nearest airfield. The wingman was  lucky. The captain unexpectedly saw a runway right on his  heading and landed safely--now with almost no fuel in the  tanks--at the Savi airfield. "I was born lucky," he commented  laconically at the time on his good fortune.    But Yermakov, who had waited unsuccessfully for a guide  aircraft, tried to land on a highway, but was hindered by the  heavy vehicle traffic. Seeing the hopelessness of the situation,  he ejected after an hour and fifty minutes of flying. "There was  no damage on the ground. The pilot was unharmed," were the  notations in the report.    Maybe so, but we know how to give a good spanking. So they  exhaustively investigated the sad results of a generally  ordinary flight, and the measures taken, judging by the official  documents, were the strictest. Major Yermakov was relieved of  his duties and dismissed from flight work, and the "lucky"  Nikulin was disciplined as well. All's well that ends well.  Nonetheless, in my opinion, the materials from the investigation  did not reflect the main causes that led to the flight accident.  One of them was the unsatisfactory preparation and support of  the ferry flight. The regimental command did not know the  concrete date of the ferry flight to fill out the necessary  documents until the very day of departure of the pilots for  Moscow. The fliers (called back the day before from leave, by  the way) were given just seven days instead of the required 20  to prepare for the performance of this task. Communications  specialists had appealed more than once to higher-ups on the  question of providing reliable radar control of the aircraft  being transferred, but that was not resolved either. It turned  out that the organizers of the flight had simply not stipulated  in the agreement the necessity for the receiving side to turn on  its tracking stations, or the amount of payment for their  operation either... They economized themselves into disaster.    And here is a fact that is quite interesting, although it  was  not taken into account in the final order. Captain Nikulin made  a forced landing at the airfield at Savi, which was not even  indicated on his flight map, and indeed could not have been,  since it was published in 1966, with some changes on it dated  1981. It is incomprehensible why satellites are plying outer  space--perhaps to photograph the license plates of cars...    Yes, the times are such that we have to economize in  everything. But in this case they cannot bring themselves to  call this economy squandering by the true steward. Is that not  why the pilots are so reluctant to agree to the commercial ferry  flights for which the Russian state pays them in dollars? Not  everything is for sale...

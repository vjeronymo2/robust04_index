			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bluebird shares soar SHARES IN Bluebird Toys hit a new high for the year yesterday after the company said that pre-tax profits were likely to be 'substantially higher' than current City forecasts of just over Pounds 5m. The shares, which hit a low of 26p in December 1990, closed at 570p, up 90p on the day. In September, the company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.99m (Pounds 234,000) for the six months to June. At that time Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, said he expected continued growth in the second half as well as a good result for 1993 as a whole. Yesterday he said: 'Now that the majority of our Christmas orders have come in, it is clear that the level of business, both in the overseas markets and the home market, will be such that the company's pre-tax profits are likely to be substantially higher than the current City expectations of just over Pounds 5m.' He said that sales of the company's miniature play sets, marketed around the Polly Pocket and Mighty Max characters, were particularly strong. He added: 'This is not a bubble.' The company has a new range planned for 1995.</p>

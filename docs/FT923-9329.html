			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Hacks struggle in Games cauldron AS I SIT writing in my Press Village room at 10.30am, the thin wall behind my head is gently vibrating. It is not the heavy transport lorries on the motorway flyover 50 yards away causing reverberations in the hot, sticky air. Nor is it the 23-channel, 24-hour sports-spewing TV set downstairs. It is Daily Star sports reporter Bill Elliot next door, dead to the world and edging ever closer to a gold medal for Olympic snoring. After 12 hectic days the Games are nearing their end. So, too, is the staying power of the 5,000 journalists crammed into the Village. Like marathon runners towards the end of their long-distance course, most journalists here have by now hit the 'wall' - the point where energy reserves start to run out. Apart from top sports stories such as Linford Christie's 100 metres gold medal win, unscheduled events like Britain's drugs scandal have kept the 15,000 media personnel at these Olympics up and running at all hours. Even the brightest wits are fading. No one, though, is going to bow out just yet, because global communications have changed the nature of the Olympics. If the Games have become a multi-million dollar business; if they have transformed competitors from amateurs into professionals; and if TV networks, advertisers and sponsors have raised the commercial stakes sky-high, it is largely because electronic and print journalism is creating and satisfying an obsessive sports market in every corner of the world. One example illustrates the point. In 1960 the US TV rights to broadcast the Rome Olympics cost just Dollars 394,000. By 1976 US rights for the Montreal Games had risen to Dollars 25m. This year the US network NBC has paid Dollars 401m. NBC technicians began arriving here last year to install Dollars 20m worth of equipment. Currently there are no fewer than 1,300 NBC staff working in Barcelona. Apart from the expenditure of individual companies, the Barcelona Games' organisers have invested huge sums to cater to the hordes covering the Olympics. But judging from the comments of those journalists who have attended many Games, Barcelona is not quite a sports heaven. 'Why can't they choose cities where we don't have to work in pools of sweat?' asked a puffing reporter as we climbed the hill to the Olympic stadium on Montjuic in Barcelona's near-40`C heat. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of media organisation has been bus transport to and from the Village. Many of the bus drivers have been drafted in from other cities, and know as much about Barcelona's streets as a London cab driver. Personally, I have found the Catalans excellent hosts. Why, then, the odd moan and groan? Perhaps it is that journalists, like anyone else working hard, enjoy a whinge now and then. Should you sit at a breakfast table in the Village shared, say, by a Spanish photographer, an American TV technician and a Taiwanese journalist, the odds are that they are talking sport. They do so not because they have to, but because they are more obsessed by the Games than most of us. They even dream Olympics. If Bill Elliot ever stops snoring, I may dream a little Olympics myself.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: 'Green' row looms over plan for carbon tax PROTECTION for people who live in the country and would be hit particularly hard by higher petrol and diesel prices through a carbon tax will be at the forefront of today's debate about environmental taxation. At a private meeting of Liberal Democrat MPs yesterday morning, Mr Malcolm Bruce, the MP for Gordon, and Mr Alex Carlile, the MP for Montgomery, led calls that the interests of rural constituencies should be stressed in the debate in order to avoid a row over the impact of the policy on some of the party's core support. Support for a modified version of the European Community's proposal for a carbon tax is among the most sensitive issues within the party. It carries the risk of a conflict between the Liberal Democrats' commitment to 'green' policies and the priority they attach to ensuring that people can still live in the countryside. Most of the party's 22 seats are in predominantly rural constituencies. The paper that will be presented by Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesman, suggests various ways of protecting rural people who need a car from the impact of higher petrol prices, such as allowing them to pay lower rates of local taxation, or enabling them to pay lower vehicle excise duty. Given the party's campaign against the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel, he will also be anxious to stress a desire to compensate pensioners for the increase in fuel bills. Investment in public transport will also be highlighted.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANYON FACES LOSS OF PHONES, WAY OF LIFE  </P> <P> My parents were not the first in my family who wished to live at the edge of  the world. My great-uncle, Ed Gwyther, was so seriously wounded in the first  World War that he no longer wanted to be around people. Hearing of land offered  free to injured veterans, he put his large iron stove and his tools on a raft  at the Idaho town of Salmon and floated down the boulder-strewn Salmon River 58  miles to Lake Creek, where he built a log cabin.  </P> <P> Sixty years later, the vast area west of the North Fork of the Salmon River is  still a sanctuary. Some months, you're as likely to see a herd of bighorn sheep  or a bear and her cubs on the road as an automobile. From the tiny town of  North Fork past the tinier town of Shoup and the place my great-uncle built,  traveling west along a steep canyon for more than 50 miles, one sees no power  lines, no operating schools, no churches, no libraries. Mail comes only twice a  week, and there is no newspaper delivery. The nearest daily newspaper and  hospital are in Missoula, Mont., 140 miles north across the steep Bitterroot  Mountains.  </P> <P> Salmon (population 3,308), a 90-minute drive from my parents' place, is the  closest town with a doctor or a store that amounts to much. In Shoup  (population 2), the only post office or town in this part of the canyon, Don  and Donna Myers still pump gas from old glass-walled gravity-flow pumps because  the canyon has no electricity. On warm evenings, the Myerses and their friends  sit out by the pumps and watch the few cars raise dust as they pass.  </P> <P> People come to this part of the world for white-water rafting and tranquillity.  The Salmon is one of the last great western rivers to flow freely, unhindered  by dams. It is not always benevolent; boaters have been killed on what Indians  once called the "River of No Return." In fact, the first white men to attempt  it -- the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1805 -- found it so intimidating that  after a few miles of this rocky, precipitous canyon, they gave up and retraced  their steps to find an easier route to the Pacific.  </P> <P> Almost all the people who live along this section of the Salmon River, many of  them retirees, once lived down on the flatlands in "civilization." Joan and Hod  Groff are typical; they moved here from Montana for a slower life, one where a  person can take the time to appreciate, as Joan says, "the different lights on  the rocks as the sun changes."  </P> <P> Like most of their neighbors, the Groffs want peace and quiet but draw the line  at isolation. That is why they and 16 other canyon families run what telephone  experts say is the last hand-cranked telephone system in the nation, the  nonprofit North Fork Telephone Corp.  </P> <P> In 1952, the families bought this antiquated "system" from the U.S. Forest  Service for $1; it consists of a single line strung between midget telephone  poles or riveted into sheer rock cliffs many yards above the river. The users  maintain the equipment, an arduous task for 60- and 70-year-olds who must climb  the cliffs to repair lines broken by lightning, forest fires, avalanches and  the rockslides touched off by rambling bighorn sheep.  </P> <P> Without this primitive phone system, the 17 families would simply be 17  scattered outposts along 31 miles of canyon. "Our phone line is what ties the  people up and down the river and makes us a community," says Jack Briggs, a  subscriber for 25 years. It also ties them to the 10 women employed as  operators in Salmon by Century Telephone Enterprises, a Louisiana-based holding  company that acquired the Salmon telephone company in 1981. The women are the  ones who must manually connect calls made to and from the canyon phones.  </P> <P> All of this teamwork is an oddity in a rugged area with few social  institutions. The biggest event of the canyon social season is the annual  potluck dinner and meeting to elect new officers for the North Fork Telephone  Corp. When it was held in June, top executives of Century asked to attend. The  families were pleased; some had heard rumors that Century was going to announce  a system with dial tones, private lines and all that "modern stuff."  </P> <P> Women hugged each other in greeting as the meeting began at the old log school  in Shoup. As the families spread out casseroles, potato salad, baked beans and  chocolate cake over three tables, the five telephone executives gave them a  fancy plate of cheeses. But the air of hopefulness evaporated after dinner,  when the executives began to talk from the end of the table. Century had no  choice, the executives were saying; it would have to close the operator  facility in Salmon in mid-December. Century was pulling the plug on the tiny  company: The 17 families would no longer be able to call anyone in the world  except each other.  </P> <P> "It was," says subscriber Marsha Smith, "the shock of a lifetime."  </P> <P> City dwellers might be shocked to see what passes for telephone service in this  canyon. The phones that hang on the walls of canyon homes are bulky black  contraptions with headsets. They have no dials but are operated by turning a  crank. This type of electric magneto telephone was standard in the early part  of the century but was phased out in most urban areas before 1940. Frank  Barsalou, Century Telephone's district manager in Salmon, calls them "1900  telephones in a 1990 system."  </P> <P> Kindness and patience help on this system. Only one party can use the line at  any time. Each subscriber hears loud ringing every time someone makes or  receives a call, so no one is supposed to call before 7 a.m. or after 10 p.m.  except in an emergency. Calls are to be limited to a few minutes. Rain or hot  afternoon sunshine can make voices inaudible, so people learn to make calls on  cool, clear mornings. Natural forces close the line a dozen times a year.  </P> <P> "Our telephone is sort of a joke, but it's very essential for our being able to  live here," says Hod Groff. When I want to call my parents, Herman and Jennie  Nelson, I must first talk to a California operator. The operator often tells me  to dial direct. When I explain that I can't because my parents' number is a  combination of five digits and the letter F, the operator sometimes says  curtly, "Sir, there is no such thing as a non-seven-digit number in the United  States." When subscriber Fred Porter tried to call his Owl Creek Ranch there  from another state, he was told by an operator: "You're just drunk. There is no  such number."  </P> <P> Only Salmon's operators know how to reach those mysterious hand-cranked phones.  The last local operators in Idaho, they are the linchpin in a system that  requires human assistance at every level. The 17 subscribers have developed a  special relationship with them. "They'll always stay on the line to help you,"  says Bonnie Porter.  </P> <P> Jack Briggs, the affable man who runs the Indian Creek Guest Ranch, used to  call the operator every night to get the baseball scores. And one night, years  ago, when he was working temporarily as a miner in Leadore, southeast of  Salmon, the operator called to say, "Jack, did you forget to call your wife  tonight?" When Briggs said that he had indeed, the operator replied: "I'll ring  her now for you."  </P> <P> It seemed as though half of Lemhi County turned out early this month when the  families of the canyon telephone company threw a farewell party for the Salmon  operators at the Outpost cafe and bar, owned by John Booker, vice president of  North Fork Telephone. They washed down barbecue with beer and soft drinks while  reminiscing about times the operators consoled children left alone at home or  offered advice on baking a cake. After mid-December, their jobs -- mostly  assisting with long-distance and credit-card calls -- will be performed by  operators in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Century attributes the elimination of the Salmon operators to the changes that  deregulation has brought among telephone companies. Earlier this year, Barsalou  says, US West, and AT&amp;T notified Century that they would no longer contract  with Century for operators in Salmon because their services could be performed  elsewhere. And Century, with only 3,000 customers, couldn't afford to keep them  on just for the North Fork families.  </P> <P> Because Century never asked the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for  permission to serve the area covered by the hand-crank system, it has no legal  obligation to serve it. Barsalou says it does so purely by a "gentlemen's  agreement. There's no contract, no piece of paper."  </P> <P> Without operators, the only way Century could continue to serve the canyon  would be to lay a modern telephone cable down the river, which it estimates  would cost more than $600,000 -- nearly $40,000 per customer. The cable would  also require federal permission because this stretch of the Salmon is protected  by Wild and Scenic Rivers legislation. All of this would be an unpromising  investment in a phone system that earned Century revenues of $2,820 in 1987.  </P> <P> When the river folks were hit with the bombshell about the operators in June,  at first they were at loose ends about how to proceed. Nevertheless, they were  upset and angry, so they pulled together and mounted a campaign, spearheaded by  Marsha Smith, partly because she owned a typewriter.  </P> <P> Speaking over their crackly line to radio talk-show hosts in San Diego or  Seattle and writing to television news directors and Idaho politicians, they  made their case repeatedly: The phone is essential for residents and for  visiting rafters, hikers, Boy Scouts, hunters and salmon and steelhead  fishermen. Snow and rockslides sometimes block the canyon; the only way to get  help is to call out and hope for a helicopter. My parents, who are both over  80, live across the river from the road to Salmon, a few yards from the  one-room cabin Great-Uncle Ed built. They can get to the road only by pulling a  tiny cable car, hand over hand, above the water. They worry that a crisis could  leave them with no way to call neighbors or paramedics for help.  </P> <P> As the weeks wore on, the arguments and protests of the Groffs, Marsha Smith  and their neighbors began to get through. The Idaho Public Utilities Commission  called a hearing in Salmon in late August; the 17 telephone subscribers drove  upriver to be there.  </P> <P> They felt a sense of victory when the commission said it would ask Century to  maintain their link to the outside until an alternative is arranged. "In  Idaho," explains Commissioner Perry Swisher, "we consider access to a telephone  close to a constitutional right."  </P> <P> And then, a rescuer appeared. The Rural Telephone Co. of Glenns Ferry, Ida.,  declared itself willing to serve the area. Its owner, Jim Martell, says he can  lay cable down the canyon for $300,000. The main trouble the canyon folks see  in Rural's proposal is its greatly increased cost. Their basic monthly service  charge would double to $14.75, and they would also have to pay toll charges for  all calls to the Salmon area, calls that are now free.  </P> <P> If the canyon folk and the Rural Telephone Co. can come to an agreement, and if  the Forest Service approves laying cable along the river, it will open the way  for more than just modern telephone service with no party line. The canyon  dwellers will have the option of paying extra for such frills as call  forwarding, call waiting, conference calling and automatic redialing. As early  as next summer, the Salmon River canyon's telephone service could pass  overnight from the country's most antiquated phone system to one that couldn't  be more modern. In the interim, says Century's Barsalou, his company intends to  contract with a Salmon motel whose switchboard operator will connect the  hand-cranked calls.  </P> <P> "We never could have dreamt this summer that this kind of improvement could  happen," Smith says. The probability of modern telephone service has awakened  the dormant desires of some canyon residents. Why not electricity? some are  asking.  </P></p>

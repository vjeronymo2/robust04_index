			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ferranti business sold Matra Marconi Space, the satellite joint venture between GEC-Marconi and Matra of France, has bought Ferranti International's satellite communications business from the receivers. The price has not been disclosed, but is thought to be relatively low. The Ferranti unit employs about 100 people. It designs and manufactures ultra high frequency satellite data terminals and microwave radio relay systems. The deal follows the purchase by Matra Marconi in July this year of the satellite business of British Aerospace. The merged group, Europe's leading satellite manufacturer, turns over about Pounds 750m and employs a workforce of more than 2,000 people. Earlier this year, Arthur Andersen, Ferranti's receivers, agreed in principle to sell the company's principal defence businesses to GEC rather than to a management buy-out team. Ferranti went into receivership last December after GEC withdrew an offer of 1p a share.</p>

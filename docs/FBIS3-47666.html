			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The coalition government  of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to formulate an  austere state budget for fiscal 1994 to cope with straitened  finances resulting from the recession, government sources said  Monday [17 January].    The sources said the general account budget for the year  beginning April 1 will be about 74 trillion yen, up about 3.0  percent in nominal terms over the original program for the  current fiscal year.    The actual scale of the budget after complicated accounting  adjustments, will fall substantially short of the original  fiscal 1993 budget totaling 72.35 trillion yen, they said.    The government will be forced to issue deficit-covering  national bonds for the first time in five years if proposed  income tax cuts are implemented, they said.    The Finance Ministry plans to finalize its draft budget for  fiscal 1994 by around February 5, with the government adopting  its budget plan around February 10, the sources said.    The ministry at the same time is working out another  pump-priming supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, the third in  a series, they said.    The ministry estimates tax revenues in the coming fiscal  year  at around 58 trillion yen, compared with 55.68 trillion yen  estimated for the current year.    It plans to issue 8 trillion to 9 trillion yen worth of  construction bonds to make up for the revenue shortfall, the  sources said.    The Finance Ministry plans to slash budgetary requests by  government ministries and agencies by more than 700 billion yen  to keep total expenditures to just under 50 trillion yen.    It will approve budgetary requests of some 8.9 trillion yen  for public works projects in the new fiscal year, the sources  said.    The budget for servicing outstanding national bonds will be  held to around 15 trillion yen, down from 15.44 trillion yen for  fiscal 1993, because of lower interest rates, they said.    Local governments will be requested to repay interest-free  loans from the central government worth about 2.2 trillion yen  ahead of schedule in fiscal 1994.    To ease the impact on finances of local entities, the  central  government will offer an equivalent amount of loans with funds  raised through construction bond issues, the sources said.    Construction bonds worth a total 11 trillion yen will be  issued during the new fiscal year, they said.    The total amount of national bonds to be issued will hit a  record 15 trillion yen if bonds to cover income tax cuts are  floated.</p>

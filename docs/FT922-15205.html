			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / German companies see 1993 economic upturn GERMAN companies are expecting the current downturn in the domestic economy to come to an end next year, according to a poll of 401 mainly large companies conducted by the IFO, the Munich-based economics research institute, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The details of the poll suggest that German businessmen are confident that by the summer of next year they will have put high interest rates, poor profitability and high wage demands firmly behind them. Manufacturing companies are expecting a nominal 4 per cent growth in domestic sales and a 7 per cent rise in exports for the whole of next year. To help meet expected demand they are planning to increase investment by 7 per cent next year, compared to just 1 per cent planned for the current year.</p>

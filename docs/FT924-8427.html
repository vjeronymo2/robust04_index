			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Management: Life's little headaches - Health Check If life often seems to be the sort of headache which literally translates itself into a pain in the head, the first step is to identify whether you are being plagued by migraine, cluster or tension headaches. For migraine sufferers, 60-70 per cent of whom are women and many of whom have inherited their condition, onset is normally between the ages of 13 and 40. Intense, one-sided attacks of throbbing pain, associated with nausea, vomiting, aversion to light and lack of appetite, can last anywhere from four to 24 hours. The cause of migraine is vascular - in other words, it is not caused by the brain itself but by dilation of the cerebral vessels. Unlike other kinds of headache, migraines generally worsen with physical exercise. Before resorting to drugs you may want to try eliminating cured cheeses and red wine from your diet - effective in up to 30 per cent of cases. You may also want to try limiting your intake of chocolate, alcohol, highly processed foods, as well as foods containing monosodium glutamate. Other measures might include discontinuing the Pill, giving up smoking and using stress management techniques. The second type, cluster headaches, may be made up of a series of headaches over weeks or months. Typically, the sufferer may experience very severe headaches, usually localised around or behind the eye, lasting between 20 minutes and three hours. They nearly always occur on the same side of the head within a series, and their cause, like migraine, is thought to be of vascular origin. Up to 10 per cent of cluster headache sufferers develop a chronic variety of attacks which endure for a year or more. Because of the short duration of cluster headaches, standard analgesics may not be suitable. The third variety is the tension headache. During an episode of acute stress, when adrenalin is percolating through your system, severe and prolonged muscle contraction creates a band-like pressure sensation, like wearing a hat that is too small. Associated symptoms may include irritability, decreased sex drive and cravings for sweets. Solution for this variety include: exercise, biofeedback, psychotherapy, nutritional purification and relaxation. The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.</p>

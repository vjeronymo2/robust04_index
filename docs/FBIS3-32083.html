			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 31 Jan (EFE) -- The Cuban Workers Federation  (CTC), which is the sole union in the country, today warned that  the payroll reduction required at many work centers "should be  done gradually to avoid traumatic consequences." An editorial  published by the "TRABAJADORES" weekly, which is the CTC  mouthpiece, asserted: "We have to end the negative situation of  inflated payrolls." Nevertheless, it added that factors other  than excess personnel have a greater impact on the inefficiency  of firms. The weekly said: "The payroll is certainly an element  to be considered in the search for efficiency, but it is not the  only one. Currently, it is quite possible that it is not the  most important one in many places."    In this way, the newspaper referred to the future  reorganization of the government system, which will include  ministries as well as firms. The reorganization, which was  announced at least three months ago and still has to be  implemented, would leave thousands of workers without a job.    With this editorial, the union seems to be distancing itself  from top government officials who have publicly expressed that  the problem of excess personnel has to be given foremost  attention because it is the key to improving productivity and  profitability.    According to the CTC, more damaging than excess personnel  are  "the huge shortages" experienced in several firms. This  includes thefts, the squandering of raw materials and fuel, the  low quality of various products, and employee absenteeism.    The editorial concluded by saying: "We cannot streamline any  process without the unions. They are a requirement and a  condition for the process to be implemented effectively,  especially if it is to be an orderly and well-handled process."    Payroll reductions and other pending economic reforms will  be  debated at some 80,000 assemblies called by the CTC all across  the nation starting today. The main issues to be discussed at  these assemblies are: the creation of a tax system, the  elimination of a number of gratuities and subsidies to  unprofitable firms, formulas to reduce the surplus of currency  in the people's hands, and ways to get the peso to recover its  buying power. However, according to an official poll, what  worries CTC members most "is the future of the superfluous  workers who could be fired when the payrolls are streamlined."    Once the assembly debates end, it is expected that a special  National Assembly meeting will be called to start approving  measures -- most of which will have a negative impact on the  people -- that had been announced since last summer.</p>

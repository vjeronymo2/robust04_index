			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 23 June reports an  increasing number of cease-fire violations on the following  Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefields:    From Brcko correspondent Hamiz Deronjic reports that "the  defense lines of the free Brcko territory have suffered constant  heavy enemy fire in the last 24 hours. In the course of the  previous day as well as last night the entire line of Brcko's  defense was the target of the Chetnik infantry arms,  antiaircraft machine guns, and rifles. The enemy started the  shelling early yesterday evening. The most powerful artillery  activities were against Boderiste." "There was no peace on the  central part of the Brcko front either," Deronjic continues,  reporting attacks from Browning guns, portable launchers, and  rifles. Deronjic also reports the "regrouping of enemy forces"  and says that a "high concentration of the aggressor's manpower  has been spotted in the western part of Brcko's defense. The  soldiers of the Brcko 108th Motorized and the 108th Infantry  Brigades are ready to resist any possible attacks of the Serbian  aggressor."    From Gradacac, the Information Service of the (?105th)  Chivalrous Motorized Brigade says that "the aggressor violated  the cease-fire considerably on the Gradacac front last night."  As the service says, from a 120-mm mortar in Gornje Krecane he  fired (?five) bombs at Gradacac and its suburbs, however,  "luckily without any major consequences. At the same time the  entire western defense sector was exposed to sporadic but very  intense fire from antiaircraft guns, antiaircraft machine guns,  and all types of infantry arms. The situation calmed down at  approximately 2200. Our fighters did not respond to the fire."  As it is reported, "the morning in Gradacac is peaceful."    "On the Zavidovici front the Chetnik offensive continues  with  unabated intensity," the Press Center of the 3d Corps reports.  "Following an artillery preparation from all types of mortars  and tanks and the entire antiaircraft arsenal, infantry attacks  were attempted in several directions. Major forces attempted a  breakthrough in the direction of access to Kazici, Donja Blizna,  Gornja Blizna, and on the line Lokve-Zedni Vrh. The units of  the 3d Corps have resisted all the attacks," the press center  reports. "A gross violation of cease-fire was also noted on the  Teslic-Tesanj front, where Tesanjke, Tesanj, the region of Vrt,  (?Salamanov) and [word indistinct] Klanje were shelled. The  intensified movement of buses and trucks in this area heralds  new Chetnik infantry attacks."</p>

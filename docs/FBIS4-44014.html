			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A French Defense Ministry  communique this evening stressed the humanitarian aim of the  Rwandan operation -- to stop the massacre of civilians. [passage  omitted]    The deployment of the forces for the operation is going  ahead  as planned, the Defense Ministry states. A rapid intervention  military medical unit will soon be brought near the action zone.  This evening, nearly 500 men are in place in the Zaire border  zone, the communique adds.    Moreover, a first deployment of the Senegalese Army is  preparing to join French forces. It is expected to arrive  within 48 hours.    Two French Government envoys today met the president of the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which is opposed to French  intervention. Yannick Gerard, assistant director of African and  Malagasy affairs at the Foreign Ministry, and Jean-Michel  Marlaud, the ambassador in Rwanda, were received in Mulindi, the  rebel stronghold in northern Rwanda. The meeting lasted two  hours. The aim was to explain to the RPF leadership the  substance of the French international humanitarian intervention  initiative, and to answer questions, a communique from the  French Embassy in Rwanda said. We do not know how the RPF  reacted.</p>

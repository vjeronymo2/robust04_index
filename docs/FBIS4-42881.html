			<p>BFN     [Text] There is a head-on clash between the government and  RAI. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's attack on the public  service broadcaster was immediately rejected by the opposition  parties, which called for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to  intervene. Scalfaro and Berlusconi are scheduled to meet this  afternoon. Atillio Romita reports:    The Council of Ministers will shortly turn its attention to  RAI, but in the meantime the views expressed by Berlusconi have  provoked the inevitable reactions. The head of government  believes RAI is not only biased but also debt-ridden. He also  believes an anomaly exists in that in a democratic country,  public service television cannot go against the elected  government. The opposition's reaction has been immediate. They  have asked President Scalfaro to intervene. Nappi from the  Communist Refoundation Party has lodged a complaint with the  Rome prosecutor's office against Berlusconi and the Marco  Taradash, chairman of the RAI watchdog committee.    RAI journalists who had been called out by their union,  USIGRAI, and by the Italian Press Federation to protest against  Berlusconi were outside the Chamber of Deputies building in Rome  this morning, with protesting miners from the Sulcis company  based in Sardinia, with are protesting to safeguard their jobs.    [Begin recording] [Giorgio Balzoni, secretary of USIGRAI] If  the aim is to bring RAI under the control of the government,  then I think the government will encounter our most fierce  opposition.    [Vittorio Roidi, chairman of the National Press Federation]  I  believe this morning's demonstration outside the Chamber of  Deputies building can signal the start of a great battle. It  seems to me that the most important thing is that the  journalists do not fight alone. [end recording]    Berlusconi will be received by President Scalfaro this  afternoon to talk about the problem of public service  broadcasting. Gianfranco Fini, the secretary of the National  Alliance, has said that the antitrust laws and RAI were two  interlinked problems that would have to be tackled by the  government.</p>

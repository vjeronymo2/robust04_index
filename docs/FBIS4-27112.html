			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports, South Korean puppet Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu recently went to a certain country in the  Southeast Asia and made an ugly and mean scene by begging the  country to take the role of mediator between the United States  and the DPRK in the resolution of the North's nuclear issue.    Here lies an insidious attempt of the puppets to complicate  the issue by sending a mediator to the talks between us and the  United States for the resolution of the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula.</p>

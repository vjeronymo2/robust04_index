			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: SPIRIT OF FAIRNESS ALIVE AT BOGART'S, WHICH SAYS NO  WAY TO 'PAY TO PLAY'  </P> <P> Among the many endearing qualities that Humphrey Bogart's character, Rick,  displayed in "Casablanca" was his insistence that Sam the piano player be paid  decently for his work.  </P> <P> There aren't enough Ricks on the Southern California rock-music scene, where it  has become common for club owners, under a system called "pay to play," to  boost profits by soaking aspiring local rockers. Emerging bands hungry for  exposure -- especially on the commercially oriented heavy-metal circuit -- have  been required to ante up hundreds of dollars for the privilege of performing.  </P> <P> It's heartening, and fitting, that the Long Beach rock-music club named after  Bogey has had nothing to do with this exploitative practice. Like the crusty  Rick of "Casablanca," Bogart's operates under the principle that fairness is a  vital component of enlightened self-interest.  </P> <P> Bogart's, in short, has done well without doing local musicians dirty.  </P> <P> During the past two years, the 300-capacity club about one mile from the Orange  County line has been the leading nurturing ground for emerging bands on the  local rock scene, while also presenting a broad array of touring talent and  occasional special events that show a creative programming bent.  </P> <P> David Swinson has been the in-house promoter for Bogart's since its transition  in 1987 from a predominantly Top 40-oriented venue to an all-original showcase,  and he deserves a good deal of the credit for helping the club live up to the  "Casablanca" Bogart's standards of club management. Swinson, a concert promoter  since the early 1980s, will leave Bogart's next Tuesday to start the next phase  of his career: launching an independent record label.  </P> <P> "His heart's in the right place," said Ken Phebus, booking agent for the Coach  House who books some of the national headliners appearing at Bogart's. "His  first consideration is the bands."  </P> <P> Under the pay-to-play system, the club's profit motive is served at the expense  of a musician's right to be paid for a performance (the system requires bands  to pay up front for a set number of tickets to their own show; they can then  recoup the money by reselling the tickets. But few bands have the time or  temperament for salesmanship, and many who pay to play do so at a loss).  </P> <P> At Bogart's, Swinson found a way to reconcile profits with ethics. He came up  with his own system -- the "unlimited guest list" -- that has turned local  music into a reliable moneymaker for Bogart's, while also fulfilling a club's  obligation to pay musicians for their work.  </P> <P> Swinson instituted the system after coming up against the same problem that has  led Night Moves in Huntington Beach to institute a $50 pay-to-play fee for  unproven bands: He found that some new bands, content with a guarantee of $50  or $75, would not follow through by hustling to promote their shows by posting  signs or spreading the word to their friends.  </P> <P> Under Bogart's guest-list system, a new band has to do some advance work if it  wants to make money -- but in no case does it have to pay the club or sell  tickets. Instead, the band tells its friends and fans about the show and  compiles a list of invitees who plan to come. Bogart's then admits every person  on the list for free, paying the band $1 for each fan who walks in. The club  turns its profit by selling drinks and food to those "guests" and to any paying  customers who happen by without an invitation.  </P> <P> "I thought that this was a really fair proposition," Swinson said in a recent  interview in his office at Bogart's, a dimly lit upstairs room where the walls  are covered with music posters and the file cabinets are full of tapes sent by  groups looking for bookings. "All they had to do was call friends. They didn't  have to hit the streets with tickets and say, 'Our life depends on it.' "  </P> <P> Some bands have made $100 or more on their first shot and quickly graduated to  weekend bookings with guaranteed paydays. But Swinson also is interested in  bringing back talented acts that may not have immediate drawing power.  </P> <P> "I'm in the business because I love the music," he said. "And when I find a  band that I think has a lot of talent and that I think can do something if they  continue, I'm going to support that band."  </P> <P> Swinson got his start in the music business in the early 1980s, when he opened  White Slug Records, a record shop in Seal Beach. After booking bands for  in-store promotional appearances, he branched into staging shows at area clubs,  including Bogart's. When owner Richard Greco decided to turn the club into a  full-time venue for original rock, he hired Swinson to handle booking and  promotion.  </P> <P> Swinson's approach has been refreshingly eclectic. Consider the coming week's  schedule: reggae tonight with the Wailers, punk rock on Friday with the  Dickies, all-local bills Saturday and Wednesday, heavy metal on Sunday,  country-rock on Tuesday with Rosie Flores and Blue Rodeo, and alternative  rockers Firehose and Swamp Zombies next Thursday.  </P> <P> Before the month is out, Bogart's will have hosted blues acts and roots rockers  as well. Bogart's also has frequently highlighted Southern California's  acoustic-music talent and provided a forum for punk poets and off-kilter  lecturer-raconteurs.  </P> <P> Swinson's venture into booking the likes of Henry Rollins, Timothy Leary, John  Waters and G. Gordon Liddy led to his new career move. He has formed Pro-Deuce  Records with partner William Stankey, a Connecticut-based agent who books  speakers on the lecture circuit. Swinson said the company has an agreement with  Atlantic Records to distribute its first release, a collection called "Sound  Bites From the Counterculture" that will feature segments from Leary, Liddy,  Jello Biafra, Hunter Thompson, Eugene McCarthy and others. Pro-Deuce also is  seeking a major-label distributor for musical releases -- with the nucleus of  its roster likely to be drawn from among bands that Swinson watched emerge at  Bogart's.  </P> <P> "I'm taking a serious roll of the dice, but it's something I need to pursue and  advance my career," Swinson said.  </P> <P> Owner Greco foresees little change. Swinson's friend and assistant, Stephen  Zepeda, will take over as lead booker and promoter. Zepeda has been especially  involved in bringing along the local rock scene at Bogart's.  </P> <P> "We're going to keep things the way we've had them," Greco said. "(Swinson)  worked too hard and did too well for us to change the way he set it up." The  club owner said the only change he foresees is a slight scaling back in  weeknight shows by national acts.  </P> <P> STONES SHUT OUT: The California Angels' drive into pennant contention put  Anaheim Stadium out of contention as the site of the Rolling Stones' Southern  California concerts, according to Brian Murphy, president of Avalon  Attractions.  </P> <P> Anaheim Stadium received close consideration early in discussions about the  Stones' area appearances, said Murphy, whose company will serve as local  promoter for the Stones' Oct. 21 and 22 performances at the Los Angeles  Coliseum. But Murphy said that when it became apparent the Angels might have a  shot at the World Series, which is played in late October, the Coliseum emerged  as the preferred venue.  </P> <P> Greg Smith, Anaheim Stadium's general manager, said that the Coliseum's seating  advantage -- 72,000 for the Stones' shows, compared to 55,000 to 60,000 at  Anaheim -- also was a factor, although Murphy said the possibility of a  conflict with baseball's postseason play was the key to swinging the dates to  the Coliseum.  </P> <P> Anaheim Stadium has not hosted a rock concert since 1987, when there were shows  by Madonna, David Bowie and Bob Dylan with the Grateful Dead. But Smith said  stadium officials are pitching to land a November pop date by artists he said  he could not name.  </P> <P> RHIGHTEOUS RHINO: Rhino Records, the company known for its compilations  focusing on the pop past, has just released "The Righteous Brothers: Anthology  1962-1974)," a retrospective that encompasses 28 songs (32 on CD) tracing the  career of the Orange County-based duo from its origins as the Paramours through  its hit-making period in the mid-'60s, to its 1974 reunion.  </P> <P> McFOLGNER'S?: Coach House owner Gary Folgner may not yet be the Ray Kroc of the  concert-club business, but he's getting there. Folgner, who last year added the  1,000-seat Ventura Theatre to his holdings, recently became a partner in  Calamity Jane's, a 300-seat club in Las Vegas, according to Ken Phebus, who  handles bookings for Folgner.  </P> <P> LIVE ACTION: Bon Jovi and Skid Row return to Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on  Sept. 7, with tickets going on sale Saturday morning at Music Plus outlets.  Tickets go on sale Sunday for an Oct. 6 show at Irvine Meadows by Fine Young  Cannibals and Neneh Cherry. . . . Tickets are on sale at the Crazy Horse Steak  House in Santa Ana for shows by Ronnie Milsap on Sept. 4 and 5 and Bobby Bare  on Sept. 11. The Desert Rose Band plays the Crazy Horse Sept. 18, with tickets  on sale Aug. 17, and tickets will go on sale Aug. 24 for shows by the Nitty  Gritty Dirt Band on Sept. 25 and 26.  </P></p>

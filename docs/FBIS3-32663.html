			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, 8 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The Chiapas  Congress today approved severe sanctions against torture and a  tax exemption as part of the reconciliation process in Chiapas.  This reconciliation process prompted an imminent peace meeting.    Congress President Juan Jose Rueda said the Law to Prevent  and Punish Torture, which the state legislature approved,  establishes sentences of one to 12 years imprisonment for  committing torture.    Governor Javier Lopez Moreno sponsored the measure, which  also invalidates confessions made in the absence of a defense  lawyer and which is within a framework of pacification measures.  These measures include an amnesty for common crimes committed  during the conflict.    The local congress also approved a pardon of state taxes  between January and June of 1994 in the 30 municipalities  affected by the conflict, which began on 1 January with the  emergence of the armed group the Zapatist National Liberation  Army.    According to the measure adopted in Tuxtla Gutierrez, which  is located 1,100 km southeast of Mexico City, taxpayers of the  Lacandona Jungle and the Chiapas Highlands will be exempt from  paying taxes on land, income [nomina], and unlisted businesses.    Governor Lopez Moreno has decided to reform the penal code  following demands made by Indian leaders and farmers in Chiapas  who have criticized this document by calling it the most  "backward" in the country.    A virtual truce has prevailed in the conflict area since 12  January, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari decreed a  unilateral cease-fire as a measure to facilitate actions by  Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis.    Camacho Solis and the armed group are awaiting an "imminent"  and first peace meeting aimed at finding a solution to the armed  conflict, which, according to official figures, has resulted in  many deaths.    Meanwhile, residents of the Teopisca, Huehuetan, Cacahoatan,  Tuzantan, and Mapastepec Municipalities have occupied local  governmental buildings to demand the dismissal of their  respective mayors, whom they accuse of corruption and of  promoting violence.    Teopisca residents on 8 February also blocked the  Pan-American Highway between San Cristobal de las Casas and  Comitan to call attention to their demand, which is similar to  that of the residents of other municipalities located in the  conflict area.    The demonstrators prevented the delivery of medicines,  potable water, and food to the municipality, allowing only  journalists to enter.</p>

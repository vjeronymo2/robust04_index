			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Guidelines for Short-Term Exchanges <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grants will be awarded to support programs of a three to eight week duration. Programs should have a thematic focus. Proposals which address civics education and the American political system are encouraged. Other eligible foci may include, but are not limited to: The arts; language and culture; science; computer technology; leadership training; conservation and the environment; journalism; social and economic issues; agriculture; business administration/management (including enterprise promotion); and homestay programs under the title ``American Community Experience,'' which should include local programming in such areas as state and municipal government, regional culture, etc. Proposals should provide detailed information on activities planned in both the U.S. and the partner country. It is important for program activities to be of a substantive nature. These may include excursions, cultural activities, and opportunities to experience community life. It is very desirable for each group of NIS students to have a segment of their program in Washington, DC or a state capital. Care should be taken to avoid proposing a program which is too heavily weighted toward ``touristic'' activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One-for-one reciprocity is not a requirement, but is encouraged. Proposals should also provide written evidence that the U.S. organization has the commitment of a reliable counterpart organization in the partner country willing and able to engage in the proposed activities. Homestays are desirable. The minimum stay in country for all programs is three weeks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The core of the proposal narrative should articulate the purposes of the project, as they relate to the objectives stated above in the ``Overview,'' and should describe the program elements. Guidelines for preparing the narrative are available from USIA (address and telephone number provided above). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects requesting support for tours of performing arts groups or sports teams are eligible only if the primary purpose of the program is mutual education and there is extensive structured interaction and cultural exchange between international participants and their hosts. Tours of performing arts groups or sports groups for whom the primary activity is performance or competition will not be eligible. Outdoor camping projects must have a thematic focus. Proposals must include a plan for evaluating the program in terms of its value to the participants. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, programs should maintain a ratio of not more than one adult per every ten young people. (If fewer than ten students are being sent on either side of an exchange, those students are entitled to one adult escort). Programs requesting an exception to the 1/10 ratio must provide a justification. One justifiable exception would be for those projects that include leadership development and training for adult leaders. Organizations wishing to pay for additional escorts from their own funds are free to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantee organizations are responsible for developing a sustainable partnership with an organization in the NIS; designing and implementing the components of the exchange; managing all travel arrangements, logistics, insurance coverage, passports, visas, etc; and disbursing and accounting for funds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

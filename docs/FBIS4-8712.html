			<p>BFN     [Text] Unlike the Belgrade authorities, Montenegro will not  withdraw accreditation from foreign journalists, said  Information Minister Bozidar Jarebic. He added this action was  mostly to the detriment of those who withdrew accreditation.  There are many other ways of reaching agreements with  journalists. That way Serbia finally showed that isolation was  its permanent political choice.</p>

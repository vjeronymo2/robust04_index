			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Why jute is made to feel a poor relation - The IJO's problem financing even modest development programmes The US, one of the largest importers of jute goods, has announced that it is to give up membership of the 10-year-old International Jute Organisation by the end of June. Its departure will leave the IJO - set up to promote the second most important natural fibre after cotton - with five jute producing countries and 22 importers. The development takes place at a time when the IJO is planning to intensify efforts to recruit new members from among the 'many important importing countries and producers who remain outside the organisation,' in the words of Mr KM Rabbani, its executive director. He says that the 'proposed US withdrawal from IJO is part of that country's policy to stay away from commodity related organisations.' Its decision, he believes, may not have got anything to do with the working of the organisation 'which has managed to stay extremely lean'. He says that the cost of running the Dhaka-based IJO is about Dollars 1m a year. Undoubtedly, however, the US pull-out will make the task of enlarging the membership of IJO difficult. The IJO is primarily concerned with the identification of projects relating to 'agriculture, industry and market promotion', arranging funds for them, and ensuring that the research results lead to the improvement of jute's competitiveness in relation to other packaging materials. But mobilisation of finance has proved increasingly difficult. Mr Rabbani says that four agricultural, four industrial and four market promotion projects are awaiting funding of a little over Dollars 7m. Of the 12 projects, the IJO has strongly recommended three to the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC). They are the varietal improvement of jute and kenaf for increased productivity; development of jute based packaging and jute intermediates as substitutes for wood, plywood and other packaging materials; and market development and promotion of jute goods in western Europe. The estimated cost of the three projects is a mere Dollars 2.17m. The CFC is expected to be the main source of funding and the fact that it cannot meet the requirements for these modest projects has now become a matter of serious concern to the IJO. The member countries of the IJO seem unlikely to enlarge their project-related financial assistance, but they may help the IJO in obtaining funds from multinational organisations.' The annual funding requirement for projects is between Dollars 3m and Dollars 4m, says Mr Rabbani. In spite of the financial constraint which IJO has lived with since it was established it has been able to implement a number of projects involving a total funding of nearly Dollars 5.5m. The most important of them was the collection, conservation and exchange of germplasm (part of the genetic material) for the development of improved varieties of jute, kenaf and allied fibres. A bank with 2,600 varieties of germplasm has been created at the Bangladesh Jute Industries Research Association headquarters in Dhaka. Mr Rabbani expects that in the 'next three or four years, it should be possible to produce seeds through cross breeding which will lead to a significant improvement in the productivity of jute'. He says that 'the improvement in agricultural productivity at a low cost to the farmer' is vital in view of the 'declining trend in the real price of jute.' The only way for the jute producers to sustain their income is by getting higher yields, at a time when more and more land is being switched from jute to food crops. Jute is increasingly concentrated on marginal and less fertile land which has placed a premium on productivity. Two IJO projects relating to the strengthening jute and kenaf seeds (Dollars 651,107) and the improved retting, or softening, and extraction of jute (Dollars 895,000) now under implementation could help productivity. Mr Rabbani says: 'We will be preparing a manual for the processing, grading and storage of seeds. If the farmers can be persuaded to use the jute seeder machine developed by the IJO, it would lead to better germination of seeds. In the traditional system of broadcast of jute seeds, the wastage factor is high.' The quality of jute in all producing countries suffers because of unscientific retting and manual extraction of fibre from the plant. Retting of jute in clean water and extraction of fibre by mechanical means will automatically improve the quality of the crop. Mr Rabbani is giving high priority to the retting project. The IJO has so far assigned the projects to the jute research institutions of the member countries. It thinks, however, that there is scope for collaboration with 'scientific institutions that have no direct connection with jute', but which have the capacity to undertake work on the development and promotion of the fibre which producers must feel at present is something of a poor relation in the world of soft commodities.</p>

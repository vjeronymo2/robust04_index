The meeting lasted six and a half  hours, but no decision on the personnel composition of the  government was taken.    From the Kremlin, Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin went  off to their dachas.    Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, INTERFAX reports,  told journalists today that Viktor Chernomyrdin had offered him  a choice of two posts in the new government -- minister for CIS  affairs or economics minister. Shokhin is going to announce his  decision tomorrow.    Today too, Sergey Shakhray, another deputy prime minister,  stated, according to the POSTFAKTUM agency, that he had been  offered the post of minister of nationality affairs and regional  policy. It is not yet known whether he has accepted the offer.    Meanwhile Boris Fedorov's press secretary denied a report  that he has resigned. In a RIA interview, the press secretary  said, literally, the following: Boris Grigoryevich has not  accepted the prime minister's proposal that he should retain  just the post of finance minister, but neither has he resigned.</p>

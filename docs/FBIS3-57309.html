			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station observer Krichevskiy from the </F> "Current Events and Commentary" program -- read by announcer]    [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev will pay an  official visit to China from 26 to 29 January. Station observer  Krichevskiy has the following commentary on this issue:    In addition to the length of his visit to this neighboring  country, we also know the scope of the issues that the Russian  foreign minister will discuss while visiting Beijing.    First of all, these issues are relevant to the preparations  for the second Russian-Chinese summit. Because Yeltsin visited  China before the winter of last year, it is now Jiang Zemin's  turn to visit Russia. The Russian-Chinese summit will settle  several issues relevant to strengthening the two countries'  bilateral ties and their partnership in the international arena.  Kozyrev's visit (?will be) conducive to this matter. He plans  to discuss with Chinese leaders the possibilities of and  prospects for developing economic cooperation and trade and  scientific-technological cooperation, as well the border issue.    For example, the two sides will sign an accord on  establishing border checkpoints [words indistinct] improve the  situation along Russian-Chinese border. The establishment of  checkpoints will also help prevent trouble from arising from the  border trade carried out in areas between adjacent Russian  oblasts and Chinese provinces. As far as economic ties and  trade are concerned, (?both sides) have expressed their  dissatisfaction with their current state. Nobody doubts that  these ties will expand and will become more successful in the  future, even though China's trade volume with Russia already  puts it in second place in this category.    In the area of economic cooperation, there is an  increasingly  pressing need for Russia to study the experiences that China has  gained in carrying out economic reform. We should know why  China's economic development has been gathering speed -- speed  which reached approximately 13 percent last year -- as a result  of its reform, whereas in Russia the rapidity has been  decreasing each year. The discussion of this question cannot be  avoided during Kozyrev's visit. China's experiences in building  special economic zones undoubtedly have been successful.    Incidentally, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev and his  experts and advisers also have plan to visit the Shenzhen  Special Economic Zone, while their talks in the Chinese capital  will deal with international issues.    Russia and China are the two biggest countries in the Asia-  Pacific region. To a great extent, the relaxation of regional  conflicts and [word indistinct] development in economic  relations and trade in this region depend on Russia and China.  Moreover, the deepening of the Russian-Chinese partnership in  all fields, including the deepening of cooperation in military  technology, is not directed at any third country in any way. In  fact, the more solid that Russian-Chinese relations become, the  more stable the situation in the Asia-Pacific region will be.  On the contrary, if Russian-Chinese relations do deteriorate in  any way, this deterioration will have unfavorable effects on the  overall situation in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

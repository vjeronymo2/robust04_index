It was the continuation of the talks that started on 14  January. The aim of these talks is to stabilize the situation  on the borders.    A joint statement was issued in which the sides agreed to  tighten control over the armed formations all along the border  and henceforth not allow any hostile action against each other,  such as the shelling of each other's positions and the violation  of borders.    Chief Border Commissar Gegam Harutyunyan, who was heading  the  Armenian delegation, told an ARMENPRES correspondent that the  dialogue with Nakhichevan is taking place in an atmosphere of  mutual understanding and that this inspires hope that there will  be an end to incidents on the Armenian-Nakhichevan border.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- Russian Former Vice-President  Aleksandr Rutskoy called upon all opposition forces to unite in  a bid to take power in the country.    Speaking at a meeting held today in Moscow "Izmailovo"  sports  complex, the leader of last year hard-line revolt in Moscow,  said addressing leaders of different opposition parties and  patriotic movements: "It is high time to stop arguing who is  right and who is wrong. We have one objective, we have one  motherland... Everyone must realise that unity is power now".    Rutskoy reiterated his declaration of May 9 that the main  task of the opposition is to spare no efforts ensuring that "the  next Victory Day (May 9, 1995) would be marked without the  regime which rules now".    The meeting was attended by the most influential opposition  leaders, such as Viktor Anpilov (Labour Russia), Sergey Baburin  (Russian All-National Union), Ilya Konstantinov (Front of  National Salvation), Generals Makashov and Achalov.    Meanwhile, Russian television aired an interview with  Rutskoy  in which ex-vice-president practically denied the proclaimed  intention to come to power before next spring.    In the televised interview Rutskoy declared a contradicting  plan according to which a would-be social-patriotic party,  apparently headed by Rutskoy himself, shall win up to 90 per  cent of seats in the parliamentary elections in 1995, and then  enter presidential election race scheduled for 1996.</p>

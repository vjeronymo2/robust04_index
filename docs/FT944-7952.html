			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Charles Baynes makes acquisitions for Pounds 7.2m Charles Baynes, the engineer, is spending Pounds 7.2m, in cash, to expand its aerospace components and valves activities. Its Kent Aerospace Castings subsidiary has bought the business and assets of Deritend Aluminium Castings and Triton CNC from Triplex Lloyd and the aluminium investment casting order book of Sterling International Technology for a total of Pounds 5.8m. The group has also bought Rona, a Belgium-based maker of specialist valves, with turnover of about Pounds 3m, from a private vendor for Pounds 1.4m. The acquisitions have been funded by a medium-term loan facility and gearing at December 31 this year is expected to be about 25 per cent. Triplex Lloyd will use the proceeds to reduce net debt and fund restructuring costs. DAC and Triton made pre-tax profits of Pounds 100,000 in the year to March 31. Sterling's aluminium investment castings sales were Pounds 1.25m in the year to March.</p>

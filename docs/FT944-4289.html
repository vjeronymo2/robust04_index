			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Cigarette maker claims win Philip Morris, the US-based cigarette, food and brewing group, yesterday claimed a partial victory in its battle with the Australian government over the nation's anti-smoking laws, after the goverment filed amendments to the 1992 act in parliament. Morris had argued that restrictions imposed by the 1992 law, which in effect banned cigarette advertising, were so draconian that the company was denied the right to take part in debate on political, public and social issues, and 'normal' commercial freedom of speech.</p>

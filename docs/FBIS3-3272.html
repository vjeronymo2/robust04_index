Refuting rumors that Taipei-Pretoria relations are on the  brink of break-up, De Klerk reaffirmed South Africa's desire to  maintain normal diplomatic ties with the ROC.    De Klerk made the remarks during an interview with CNA after  making a campaign speech in Johannesburg.    South Africa's first multi-racial election is scheduled to  be  held nationwide on April 26-28. The African National Congress  [ANC] led by Nelson Mandela is expected to win big in the  elections resulting in the formation of a coalition government  between the ANC and De Klerk's ruling national party.    Mandela and the ANC have strong ties with the Chinese  Communists and have announced on several occasions that they  will sever ties with the ROC in favor of Beijing once in power.    However, De Klerk is expected to remain an influential  figure  in South African politics after the election and has said  "Pretoria cherishes our relations with old friends."</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Banco Santander shows improvement BANCO Santander, Spain's most aggressive commercial bank, yesterday reported net profits of Pta43.2bn (Dollars 452.8m) for the first half of 1992, up 17.3 per cent on the same period last year. Pre-tax profits rose 17.5 per cent to Pta58.2bn. The bank said lending margins had increased 4.35 per cent and fee-based income by 25 per cent, leading to a 9 per cent rise in operating profits at Pta129.3bn. Mr Emilio Botin, chairman, said management had made cost-cutting a priority this year. 'As a result, significant savings have already been achieved, and the growth in operating expenses for the second half of the year should be significantly lower.' Santander's income from mutual fund management rose 55 per cent to above Pta800bn. It claims to control more than 13 per cent of the Spanish unit trust market. Meanwhile, Banco Exterior, the state-controlled commercial bank at the heart of the state's new banking group, Argentaria, has reported a 16.4 per cent rise in first-half net income, to Pta15bn. Exterior said its operating costs, including personnel, had grown 4.8 per cent to Pta32.6bn but this might reflect the added costs of incorporating BCI, the state industrial credit bank, earlier this year Earlier, Banesto, another of the country's key retail banks, reported net profits among its financial group of Pta26.2bn for the first six months of 1992, a 3.76 per cent increase. The bank said first-half results, which exclude its industrial affiliates, showed gross operating profits up 18.62 per cent to Pta65bn after a sharp drop in operating costs.</p>

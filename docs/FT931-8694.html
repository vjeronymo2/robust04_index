			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Freehold proposals are issued THE LORD Chancellor's Department yesterday published proposals on commonhold, a scheme designed to establish a more flexible form of ownership for multiple-occupied buildings in England and Wales. It would allow owners in multi-occupier developments to own the freehold interest in their units and to establish a management system for their development. The proposals seek to address the problems of flat leaseholders, some of whom find leases increasingly difficult to sell as their expiry date nears. Commonhold, the way ahead. Lord Chancellor's Department, 105 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6QT.</p>

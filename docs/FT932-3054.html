			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Arts: Lunch with Mr Bloom - Alannah Hopkin celebrates 'Bloomsday' in the Dublin Castle Crypt Ulysses turns into a spectator sport in Dublin this time of year as the celebrations of June 16 - 'Bloomsday' - on which the events of James Joyce's novel took place - become ever more prolific. How refreshing, then, after innumerable Molly Bloom soliloquies (. . . and yes I said yes I will Yes) to have a dramatisation of Chapter Eight, chiefly remembered as the chapter in which Leopold Bloom, after some prevarication, partakes of a Gorgonzola sandwich and a glass of burgundy in Davy Byrne's bar. This chapter does not immediately call out for dramatisation. Nothing much happens. Bloom, hungry in spite of a now legendary breakfast, having attended Dignam's funeral, walks by the Liffey towards the Grafton Street area knowing that Molly has an assignation with her lover, Blazes Boylan, and afraid of meeting the latter face-to-face. He is distracted by the gulls and buys two Banbury cakes for a penny to feed them. He passes the time of day with an acquaintance, Mrs Breen, is repulsed by the prospect of eating in the Burton restaurant, and settles for Davy Byrne's where he exchanges a few words with Nosey Flynn. After, on his way to the National Library, he does indeed catch sight of the dreaded Blazes Boylan. Carey Harrison, who did the adaptation, must be given full credit for turning this unpromising material into a riveting hour of theatre while remaining remarkably faithful to the original. The cast of five occupy a central square in the low ceilinged crypt with the audience seated on two sides. Sean Tracey's direction makes the best of this limited space. Just how popular Bloomsday has become can be judged by the fact that broadcaster Gay Byrne dedicated a good half hour of his weekday radio programme to an interview with Carey Harrison, and expressed some doubts as to how the son of Rex, and master of similarly cut-glass vowels, would manage Bloom's Dublin accent. Harrison pointed out that, through his mother, Lilli Palmer, he is every bit as Jewish as Bloom, and that in any case Bloom was a Hungarian Jew, not a native Dubliner. In the programme notes he excuses his height (just over 6ft at a guess) by pointing out that at 5ft 9ins Leopold Bloom was 5 inches taller than the average Dubliner of his day, and at 11st 4lb somewhat slimmer that the Bloom of popular imagination. To see Bloom portrayed by someone as tall, slim and attractive as Carey Harrison gives a whole new dimension to Bloom's role as husband and cuckold. We have here a new Bloom. Harrison's portrayal brings out the thoughtful, humanitarian aspects of Leopold Bloom, making him more noble than pitiful, and putting Molly's dalliance with the bounder Boylan into a quite different light. He opts for a neutral stage-Irish accent, which works well with the authentic Dublin accents of the supporting cast. Anne Kent as Molly Bloom, Mrs Breen and assorted voices sounds exactly right. Martin Dunne is an inspired Nosey Flynn; he, David Ganley and Frank O'Sullivan are versatile in their various supporting roles.</p>

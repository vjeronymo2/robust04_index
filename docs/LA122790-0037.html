			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A DAY IN THE PARK  </P> <P> Northridge Park  </P> <P> 10058 Reseda Blvd., Northridge  </P> <P> Size: 24 acres.  </P> <P> Facilities: Indoor basketball gymnasium, three baseball diamonds, outdoor  basketball court, football field, children's play area, picnic area, four  lighted tennis courts.  </P> <P> Hours: 9 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday;  10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> Information: (818) 349-7341.  </P> <P> For Javier Soto, the best thing about being director of Northridge Park is  watching the number of families who regularly use the facilities.  </P> <P> "In the summer, the parents bring their children and the whole family uses the  swimming pool," Soto said. "And now, they come together for picnics, baseball  and youth basketball."  </P> <P> Because the park is so popular with families in the Northridge area, more than  120 courses are offered in the community building. In addition to traditional  arts and crafts and aerobics classes, Northridge Park has instruction in  Hawaiian dance, vegetarian cooking, horseback riding and juggling, as well as a  variety of music classes. The courses last 10 weeks and sign-ups for the next  session take place in early January.  </P> <P> "It isn't just that there's so much to do here," Soto said. "People seem to  love Northridge Park because it's so clean and safe. It really is the perfect  family park." KAREN KINGSBURY  </P></p>

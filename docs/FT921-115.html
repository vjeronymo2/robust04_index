			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Major signals annual tax cut: Kinnock rejects Tory attack by pledging no increase in basic taxation MR JOHN MAJOR held out the prospect of annual cuts in income tax targeted at the lower paid yesterday in a drive to regain the initiative for the Conservatives in the final 10 days of the general election campaign. Dismissing the prospect of a post-election crisis in public finances, the prime minister pledged also that there would be no emergency package of spending cuts to rein back borrowing if the Conservatives won. But as a parallel Conservative onslaught on the impact of Labour's spending commitments on individual tax bills moved the election battle back to the economy, Mr Norman Lamont offered a more cautious assessment. The chancellor said the projections for economic growth and borrowing indicated there would be 'very, very little' room for manoeuvre for either tax cuts or further spending increases before 1995-96. Mr John Smith, his Labour shadow, seized on the remarks to charge that Mr Lamont had 'blown apart' the prime minister's 'promise' of a sustained reduction in income taxes. Last night Mr Neil Kinnock offered a series of pledges designed to counter charges that Labour would preside over a general increase in taxation. Mr Kinnock told BBC's Panorama programme that there would be no increase in the 25 per cent basic rate of tax, that national insurance contributions would be held to 9 per cent and that the top rate of tax would be no higher than 50 per cent. He gave also a commitment not to devalue sterling in the European exchange rate mechanism. The clash over taxation coincided with a new opinion poll giving the Conservatives a one-point lead over Labour. The Harris poll for the Daily Express put the Conservatives at 40 per cent, Labour at 39 and the Liberal Democrats at 17. Recent Harris surveys have tended to favour the Conservatives and the latest compares with an average of other recent polls suggesting a 1.5 point Labour lead. Mr Major's attempt to refocus his campaign came after weekend inquests at Conservative central office had concluded that the promise of an end to recession and of rising living standards offered the best route to winning uncommitted voters' support. His optimistic assessment of the prospect of a 'year-by-year' extension of the new 20p band of income tax was followed by a stark warning of how family incomes would be hit by the 'nightmare on Kinnock Street' of a Labour government. In a speech to a rally in Birmingham, Mr Major combined a sharp personal attack on the Labour leader with the charge that his spending pledges would take Pounds 1,250 a year from the average taxpayer. That was rejected by Mr Kinnock, who insisted that eight out of 10 taxpayers would be better off from the tax and benefit changes set out in his party's shadow Budget. Mr Kinnock today will seek to move the battle on to education by detailing his party's plans to add Pounds 600m to the education budget. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, has seen his party's standing rise strongly on the back of a pledge to inject an extra Pounds 2bn into education, paid for by a 1p increase in the basic rate of income tax. Mr Major signalled that he saw the extension along the income scale of the lower rate band, introduced in the Budget for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income, as his preferred route to the eventual goal of a 20p basic tax rate. Stressing that incremental extensions in the band would cost significantly less than the Pounds 2.3bn bill for each 1p reduction in the present 25p basic rate, he said widening the band concentrated gains on the lower paid. Mr Major was dismissive of concern in the City of a looming crisis in public finances. Asked if he might be forced into spending cuts, he replied: 'I do not think it is an economically sensible thing to do and there is no need for us to do it whatsoever.' Mr Lamont's comments, however, reflected the Treasury's more sober assessment of the recession's impact on public finances. Under its projections, the first opportunity for tax cuts would not come until 1995-96.

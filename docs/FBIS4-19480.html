			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ninth Court of Appeals has endorsed a decision  by a court in 1993 to suspend the publication of the newspaper  OZGUR GUNDEM. In view of the endorsement, the publication of  the newspaper has been suspended for 15 days. Meanwhile, the  endorsement also confirmed the sentences that were passed on  Chief Editor Seyh Davut Karadag and OZGUR GUNDEM's former  proprietor Yasar Kaya. Kaya was fined 124 million Turkish lira.  Seyh Davut Karadag will be sent to prison for five months and  pay 62 million Turkish lira as a fine.    The Second State Security Court in Istanbul decided to  suspend OZGUR GUNDEM's publication for 15 days for publishing an  interview with Kurdish Workers Party leader Abdullah Ocalan  entitled "The Turkish Left Wing and Unity" and an article by  Abdulkadir Konuk entitled "Solidarity Platform" on 2 and 3 May  1993. The Second Court of Appeals endorsed the State Security  Court's sentences against Yasar Kaya and Seyh Davut Karadag,  which were in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 of the  Antiterrorism Law in Turkey.    The newspaper's officials were informed of the court's  decision yesterday. The publication of a daily newspaper will  be suspended in accordance with the Antiterrorism Law for the  first time in the country. OZGUR GUNDEM's publication will be  suspended until 30 April starting today.    The Istanbul branch of the Contemporary Journalists'  Association has criticized the decision to suspend OZGUR  GUNDEM's publication. Arguing that OZGUR GUNDEM has been  silenced after the newspapers FREE FUTURE and BANNER OF TOIL  were closed down in the past, it described the suspension of the  newspaper for publishing many reports that were also carried by  other media as a double-standard policy. Saying that opinions  cannot be removed by the use of force, the branch called for the  lifting of restrictions on the press.</p>

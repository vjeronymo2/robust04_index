			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 21, BNS -- The Latvian Government's  authorized representative -- the European Union (EU) Affairs  State Minister Olgerts Pavlovskis initialled Monday in Brussels  the free trade agreement with the EU, Foreign Ministry's press  center told BNS.    As reported, Pavlovskis considers that the signing of the  agreement is not only of economic importance but also political  one, because the agreement gives guarantees for Latvia's  security. The agreement and the declaration added to it provide  for Latvia to sign also the associated agreement in nearest  future, and then become a full and equal member of the EU. The  period of Latvia's joining the EU can last from six to ten  years, says Pavlovskis.    If the Saeima (parliament) ratifies the free trade agreement  in November, import duty will not be imposed upon Latvian goods  in the EU starting from January 1, 1995. Besides, Latvia will  be able to increase export of its produce to the EU.    Some of Latvian industrial goods will have a 2-4 year long  transitional period to enable their entering the free market.  The free trade principles will not refer to agricultural  products, but three protocols will regulate the trade with them  providing for certain quotas for mutual trade. The protocols  regulating the trade with the agriculture goods say that the EU  plans to endow Latvia trade quotas for beef, pork, butter and  cheese.    Pavlovskis noted that Latvian produce lacks attractive and  qualitative packing, and it could prevent full use of the EU  endowed quotas. But it is very important that the quotas,  granted to Latvia, enable Latvia to sell its production in  Europe.    Pavlovskis considers that worries about the agreements  negative influence upon Latvian agriculture and industry are not  motivated, because Latvia, according to the initialled  agreement, will have a four year long transitional period during  which import duty tariffs will be decreased for the EU  agriculture products.    The Agriculture Ministry's specialists support the ready for  signing additional protocols to the free trade agreement on the  procedure of import duty tariffs decreasing for agriculture  products, because the agreement provides for the order according  to which Latvia's inner market could be defended from excessive  flowing in of agricultural products from the EU.    The EU has determined a zero import duty tariff for Latvian  made textile industry goods, and it endows quotas allowing  Latvia to export only 30 percent of its textile industry goods,  said Pavlovsis. Latvia will grant favorable terms mainly to  goods that are not made in Latvia at all, and also to vegetables  in winter.    The free trade agreement will promote flowing in of foreign  investments to Latvia, setting up of joint ventures with Latvian  producers, whose production could be sold in European states'  markets, said Pavlovskis. Pavlovskis also noted that the quotas  for industrial and agricultural products could be revised every  three years thus effectively regulating the development of  Latvia's foreign trade.    Latvia's 5th Saeima plans to accept the free trade agreement  with the EU in October, 1994. The Latvian delegation will return  from Brussels on June 21.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Manuel D'Ornellas: "Seeking a Rival"] </F>   [Text] In the next few days we will know whether the  sentences passed down yesterday against the military men charged  in the case of the murder of 10 students of La Cantuta  University will be capable of counterbalancing the negative  impact caused by the approval and promulgation of the law or  legal trick that kept this case under the jurisdiction of the  military court.    Moreover, it remains yet to be seen whether these sentences  can repair the tattered image of President Alberto Fujimori  whose loss of popularity is reflected in the poll conducted by  Apoyo, Inc. published in this same issue. As we said last  Sunday, as long as this loss of popularity does not increase  that of other politicians, in theory, it can be recovered.    But it is also a fact that the ups and downs of popularity  can also result in waves of increases and losses that will  become uncontrollable. This was the case of the growing  popularity gained by Fujimori's candidacy that, toward the end  of the 1990 electoral campaign, at a given point became  devastating. The same happened with Alan Garcia when he tried  to place the banking sector under state control and his  popularity dropped month after month, after having reached the  highest level of popularity ever reached by a Peruvian leader.    It is true that in both cases there was a political  polarization that does not exist nowadays. In both cases, Mario  Vargas Llosa's strong personality played a key role in this  political polarization. Vargas Llosa was responsible for  Garcia's loss of popularity. Vargas Llosa himself also witnessed  how an unknown candidate deprived him of an electoral victory of  which he was certain.    Now Fujimori does not have a rival who could capture the  support he is losing as is revealed by the very poll that shows  his loss of popularity. Not even the promoted and respected  image of [Javier] Perez de Cuellar attracts a significant  portion of the support the chief of state is losing.    Undoubtedly, some believe that Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont  would be the person -- from every viewpoint -- to gain from an  eventual polarization with Fujimori.    So far, however, this polarization has not materialized.  Maybe because Belmot is still not regarded as a firm  presidential candidate for the elections which are only one year  ahead of us. If Belmont were to officially launch his  candidacy, the race with Fujimori to gain the peoples' support  would be well worth witnessing.</p>

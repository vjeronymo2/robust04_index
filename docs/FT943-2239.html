			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Observer: Cuba novella Another sign that the Havana-Washington hurricane is metamorphosing into something a little less threatening - Cuba is posthumously rehabilitating Ernest Hemingway. The Nobel laureate was thrown out in the early, heady days of the 1959 revolution, an act which some think contributed to his later suicide. Not that he was ever utterly persona non grata. His love of fishing has been locally commemorated by the use of his name for an annual international game fishing tournament. Many weighty blue marlin have been hooked, hung and photographed in honour of Papa Hemingway. But now his old home, 11 miles south of Havana, is being transformed into a small museum, where visitors will be able to see such oddities as an aged, well-preserved typewriter on a stand - Hemingway often wrote standing up. Another, smaller museum is being created out of the writer's room at the Ambos Mundo Hotel. Maybe Fidel Castro has even discovered the pertinence of one of Hemingway's tales: The Old Man and the Sea.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Benn loses seat in NEC election MR TONY BENN, MP for Chesterfield and a leftwing icon for two decades, lost his seat on the party's national executive committee yesterday after 34 years. The election result was greeted with cries of 'shame' and a standing ovation. Mr Benn, 68, said ballot results 'speak for themselves'. Mr Benn's defeat overshadowed a mixed verdict on the party's 'modernising' wing, led by Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor. The poll was topped by Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, who has emerged as a leading shadow cabinet supporter of 'traditionalist' opposition to the modernisers. Mr Blair increased his share of the vote in the constituency section, but failed to improve his standing from sixth of the seven members elected. Mr Brown moved down the table from third to seventh, reflecting opposition among constituency delegates to his attempts to distance Labour from the 'tax and spend' manifesto on which it fought the 1992 general election. However, Ms Harriet Harman, a shadow treasury spokesman and close associate of Mr Brown, was elected for the first time in second place with 548,000 votes. Ms Harman, who benefited from a rule change reserving one of the seven seats for a female candidate, scored a convincing victory over Ms Dawn Primarolo, a leftwing health spokesman, who polled only 58,000 votes. The other successful candidates, Mr Neil Kinnock and Mr Robin Cook, both increased their share of the vote. Mr Kinnock slipped from first to third, while Mr Cook moved up from fifth to fourth. Mr Benn refused to be drawn on the recent rightwards drift of the NEC, from which all supporters of the leftwing Campaign Group have been removed. However, he said that interventions from the floor of conference, which tend to be more leftwing than those from the leadership, offered a better guide to the party's future. Mr Benn's defeat marks the end of an era on the NEC, which he joined in 1959 as a rightwinger. He later came to epitomise a radical brand of socialism, but had lost influence since Labour's shattering election defeat in 1983.</p>

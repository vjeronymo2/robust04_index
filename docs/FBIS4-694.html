			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 12 SAPA -- The Goldstone  Commission announced it will hold a public inquiry on Friday [15  April] into illegal purchases or attempted purchases of arms  from the electricity supplier Eskom. The inquiry comes in the  wake of revelations by Eskom that there had been an attempt by a  staff member to sell arms to a dealer who intended passing them  on to kwaZulu. "With regard to that incident, Eskom promptly  launched an efficient and thorough investigation which has  reached an advanced stage. The information thus far gathered  has been made available by Eskom to the commission. It has been  ascertained that these arms were destined for kwaZulu,"  Commission Chairman Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said on  Wednesday. "After consultation with Eskom, the commission has  decided to hold a public inquiry into the matter on Friday, 15  April 1994."    He said the inquiry will centre on any unauthorised  purchases  or attempted purchases from Eskom to any organisation or person  and into their purposes. The investigation will cover the  period from July 1, 1989 to the present time.    The commission has requested several parties to furnish it  with all relevant information at their disposal at the inquiry  on Friday. They are: Eskom; the kwaZulu government; the kwaZulu  Police; the South African Police; the National Intelligence  Service; J Garb and Co (PTY) LTD; Soyeh International (PTY)  Limited; Shotgun Willies; Gintans Security; National Union of  Mineworkers; National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa;  Iron and Steel and Allied Industries Union and other trade  unions; South African National Civic Organisation.

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers share price tumbles SHARES in Bristol-Myers Squibb, one of the world's largest pharmaceuticals companies, tumbled yesterday on speculation that the company expected its third-quarter earnings to be at the low end of expectations. However, the company later denied it had provided any estimates for the third or fourth quarter. Bristol-Myers also said it had not changed its outlook since June when it warned its annual earnings would fall below expectations. At close of trade the stock was down Dollars 2 to Dollars 66 7/8 . Wall Street has been revising its expectations for Bristol-Myers since June. The company then warned of disappointing single-digit second-quarter earnings and sales growth. Yesterday's stock price erosion was less dramatic than the Dollars 7 1/4 shed then. Before yesterday, most analysts had expected the company to earn between Dollars 1.15 and Dollars 1.29 a share in the third quarter, against Dollars 1.08 a year earlier. Although they expect full-year earnings per share to advance about 7 per cent this year from Dollars 3.94 in 1991, the rate of growth is considerably below Bristol-Myers' usual pattern of reporting about 15 per cent earnings growth. It also calls into question the company's ability to be a serious rival to Merck, the biggest US drugs company, which generally posts earnings improvements in the 15 to 20 per cent range. Earlier in the year, Bristol-Myers blamed inventory reduction by wholesalers for its disappointing results. According to analysts, the company has also been hit by higher levels of discounting by managed health care groups, which are increasingly insisting on lower prices for drugs. In addition, sales growth has been held back by higher inventories of anti-cancer and cardiovascular drugs. Concern about Bristol-Myers performance had little impact on other drug stocks.</p>

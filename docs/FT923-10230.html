			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Dixons' Pounds 1m to aid study into ethics of business MR STANLEY Kalms, the elec-tronics dealer who turned a modest photo business into the Dixons group of 1,500 shops, said yesterday the company was donating Pounds 1m to the London Business School to promote the study of business ethics. That is small beer in comparison with the tens of millions spent by Dixons in deadly contests waging and resisting hostile takeovers. But it might, perhaps, help to make the takeover market a little more gentlemanly when it begins again after the recession. For Mr Kalms, who never attended university and began in his Polish-born father's photo business at the age of 16, joint ventures with the likes of London Business School are novel. But - no stranger to heated disputation - he would have a distinctive contribution to make to the LBS seminar circuit. The Dixons funding will be used to create a chair - one of the first of its kind in the UK - and a 'major research and teaching programme' in business ethics and social responsibility. The aim, says the LBS, is to create 'a European flagship programme in the area'. Its claims on that score will not go undisputed. Manchester Business School believes it got there first, with its Co-op Bank chair of Corporate Responsibility, set up last year and about to be filled. The LBS stresses 'pressures' and 'processes' as the core of business ethics; the words 'right' and 'wrong' do not appear to feature. 'Businesses have responsibilities to many different constituencies - employees, customers, shareholders, local residents, the wider public and the environment - creating conflicting pressures,' says Professor George Bain, the dean at the LBS. 'It is vital that managers are made aware of how to manage the process of reconciling those pressures.' Dixons is no stranger to ethics controversies. In the late 1980s it was caught up in a storm about the surveillance of former employees during a hostile takeover bid. A private detective employed by the company was jailed for bugging, unbeknown to Mr Kalms, the phones of former employees. Explaining his donation, Mr Kalms said ethics training should be 'a part of the ordinary process of skill development for managers'. Maximising return for shareholders? 'You should still maximise it, but in a framework of responsibility,' he responded. If MBA students at the LBS will do their 'ethics management' between stints on marketing and balance sheets, the Co-op and Manchester Business School appear more at ease with the ancient verities. Mr Terry Thomas, the Co-op Bank's managing director, explained the purpose of their funding: 'The post-war years have seen the development of the mind of the corporation: it's now overdue for the heart and soul of companies to receive equivalent attention.'

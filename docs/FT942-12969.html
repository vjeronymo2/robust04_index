			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Protests fly as new BAe chief appointed Small shareholders of British Aerospace yesterday staged a vociferous protest against the appointment of an American as their new chairman at the company's annual meeting. Although the company secured an overwhelming majority of proxy votes in favour of the appointment of Mr Bob Bauman, the former chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceutical group, a special resolution to enable a non-UK citizen to become chairman of BAe was defeated by a show of hands at the meeting to the embarrassment of the company's other directors. Under new rules, a non-UK citizen can become a non-executive chairman or director of the company but all executive directors continue to require UK citizenship. When Mr John Cahill, the outgoing chairman who never seemed comfortable chairing his last AGM in his brief two year tenure of the BAe top job, proposed the special resolution, a shareholder asked how could one ensure that Mr Bauman had not been programmed by the CIA to oversee the sale of BAe to McDonnell Douglas of the US. Mr Cahill said the search for the new chairman had been exhaustive. 'Whether or not he works for the CIA will be determined by our security forces', he said. Mr Bauman will receive a salary of Pounds 50,000 a year, will have options on 120,000 BAe shares at a price of 550p, and would work at least two days a week, said Lord Hollick, chairman of the renumeration committee, after one shareholder suggested Mr Bauman would only work one day a month for BAe at that salary. Two protesters had to be dragged out by security guards while others kept interrupting the proceedings with opposition to Indonesian arms sales because of the East Timor conflict. More were protesting outside the hotel during a meeting which had more than its moment of farce.</p>

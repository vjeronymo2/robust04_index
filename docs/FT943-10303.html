			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Showa Shell steps up dividend Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese oil refining and marketing affiliate of Royal Dutch/Shell, hopes by the end of this year to eradicate burdensome foreign exchange losses, and is increasing its dividend. In February last year Showa Shell disclosed that its traders had run up losses of some Y165bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in unauthorised currency dealings which left it with a Dollars 6.44bn exposure to the dollar. The company has since been attempting to unwind these, and said yesterday it hoped to clear all write-offs by the end of 1994 - at least a year earlier than expected - on a remaining exposure of just over Dollars 1bn. A charge of Y21bn was taken in the first half, leaving Y29bn outstanding. The writedowns brought a 42 per cent slide in pre-tax profits to Y10.6bn for the six months to June. Lower crude oil values triggered product price cuts which left interim revenues 8.8 per cent lower at Y680.8bn, and higher distribution costs weighed on profitability. However, a better financial position allowed net earnings per share to emerge higher at Y16.38 compared with Y15.62, and the dividend is being increased to Y4 from Y3. For the full year Showa Shell expects to pay Y9 per share against Y8. The company, which has been selling shares from its portfolio holdings, did not adjust earlier earnings forecasts.</p>

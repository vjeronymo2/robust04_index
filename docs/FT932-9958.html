			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: WH Smith rebounds Shares in retailer WH Smith had a roller-coaster session, starting weakly, then ending the day showing a 27-point turnround. Worries over any Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into compact discs initially hit the shares, which were down 8 at their worst, before news of a number of upgrades drifted into the market and the mood changed dramatically. The company has been talking to analysts prior to going into closed period and the impression received was of improved trading, in particular at Our Price and Waterstones. In addition, because of low earnings per share growth this year, part of WH Smith's share option scheme for employees will not be triggered, saving the company around Pounds 4m, according to analysts. The 'A' shares ended 19 ahead at 465p. Kleinwort Benson and Hoare Govett upgraded their forecasts by Pounds 10m, the former to Pounds 110m, the latter to Pounds 110.5m and it moved from hold to trading buy.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK  </P> <P> PETE TOWNSHEND "The Iron Man." Atlantic ***  </P> <P> Who better than Townshend -- rock's most eloquent man/child even as he's  matured from '60s teen rebel to '80s elder statesman -- to take the voice of an  adventuring boy in an adaptation of Ted Hughes' Oz-meets-Orpheus children's  tale? After all, the story deals in Townshend's own essential themes: wonder  vs. temptation, and submission to confusion vs. submission to comfort.  </P> <P> Townshend is only slightly more slave to the narrative than he was on his own  notable concept albums, with several of the songs standing among Townshend's  best. Only the curious, ominous disco-in-hell update of the Arthur Brown's  "Fire" (one of two tracks reuniting the Who) seems out of place.  </P> <P> But the variety of voices carrying the story proves something of a distraction.  Even the larger-than-life voice of John Lee Hooker -- perfect casting in the  title role -- seems forced into the ruminative "Over the Top," though it's  delightful on the menacing "I Eat Heavy Metal." Townshend's expressive voice  could have handled all the characters and given a more consistent thread to the  album. Still, "The Iron Man" is a rich experience for -- as they say --  children of all ages. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia reaches deal with Yakutia on diamond profits THE RUSSIAN government and the diamond-producing region of Yakutia - now called Sakha - have signed an agreement that has been hailed as a model for the decentralisation of government authority to the autonomous republics of the Russian Federation. The agreement, signed by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister of Russia and Mr Mikhail Nikolayev, President of Yakutia, allows a sharing of the diamond revenues from the region, which produces almost all of the country's diamonds. A new joint stock company, 'Diamonds of Russia-Sakha', will be 40 per cent controlled by Yakutia, with 32.5 per cent of the shares held by the Russian government. The agreement appears to end a long struggle between the autonomous republic and the central government on control of the diamonds, in the course of which an agreement giving both governments an equal share in the proceeds of diamond sales was repudiated by Yakutian officials. The republic has claimed independence from Moscow. Mr Gaidar said that the agreement 'proves that economic structures are being decentralised in Russia'. Various regions and autonomous republics within Russia, including the oil-producing Tyumen region, have demanded more freedom in controlling and benefitting from hard currency exports. Almazyuvelirexport, the diamond trading company that markets Russian diamonds through an agreement with the South African company De Beers, which controls most of the world diamond trade through its London-based Central Selling Organisation, is to be incorporated into the new company. Mr Leonid Gurevich, head of a parliamentary commission set up to oversee diamond sales, said that the industry urgently required new investment. He said this would form one of the conditions set in forthcoming negotiations with De Beers on a renegotiation of the contract between the South African and the Russian companies.</p>

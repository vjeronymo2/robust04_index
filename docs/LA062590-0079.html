			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP;  </P> <P> JIMMY BUFFETT LEAPS AROUND THE BOWL  </P> <P> Jimmy Buffett has never been a model of musical consistency. Like much of his  past work, his concert Saturday night at the Hollywood Bowl contrasted  literate, well-crafted songs with cheap and easy party anthems.  </P> <P> Moving in fits and starts from song to song, Buffett tossed out an array of  material filled with eccentric images -- feeding frenzies among sharks, Gypsies  on the loose, cheeseburgers in paradise and a last mango in Paris.  </P> <P> He did his biggest hit, "Margaritaville," of course, but he also added the less  well-known -- and more provocative -- "Changes in Latitudes, Changes in  Attitudes," "Son of a Son of a Sailor" and "Off to See the Lizard."  </P> <P> The near-capacity crowd loved everything, especially Buffett's anthems to booze  and raunch. But the best moments came when his off-the-wall verbal wizardry  moved away from crowd-pleasing shtick into the probingly interior stories and  visions that are the most intriguing aspects of his music.DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

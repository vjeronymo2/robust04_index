			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ortiz posts sharp decline in earnings ORTIZ, the French food group behind Miko ice cream, suffered a rapid decline in net profits to FFr12.7m (Dollars 2.35m) in 1992 from FFr53.5m in 1991 because of the squeeze on consumer spending. The group, which produces Vivagel delicatessen products, has, like other food companies, been badly affected by high interest rates and rising unemployment on the French consumer goods market. Consolidated sales fell by 1 per cent to FFr5.31bn in 1992 from FFr5.38bn in 1991. The 1992 figures were also affected by a number of structural changes within the group. Ortiz said net profits had been depressed by heavy marketing expenditure for both the Miko and Vivagel brands and the cost of reorganising its distribution system. Ortiz said that, in spite of the fall in 1992 profits, it was confident about its future prospects, notably because of the impact of the cost cutting implemented in 1992, which should have a positive effect on this year's results. Canadian-based John Labatt has sold the Tuscan division of Johanna Farms to Dairy Enterprises. The purchase price and other details of the transaction were not disclosed, Reuter reports from Toronto. The Tuscan dairy division consists of Tuscan Industries in New Jersey and New York, which operates out of two plants and employs 660. Dairy Enterprises is a newly formed company in which James Schreiber, Michael Marcus and affiliates of the Steinhardt Organisation are investors.</p>

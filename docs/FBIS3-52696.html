In statements made to MENA, the Lebanese defense minister  said that the Lebanese Army has taken all the necessary measures  to confront such Israeli attacks, which are expected at any time.    In his statements, Dallul said that Israel always tends to  exacerbate the situation in south Lebanon before every round of  talks. Israel will try this time to steal the limelight from  the U.S.-Syrian meeting, which is important in determining the  future of the comprehensive and just peace in the region, Muhsin  Dallul added.    Dallul's statements come in response to remarks made by Uri  Lubrani, coordinator of the Israeli Government's activities in  south Lebanon. Lubrani expects the Lebanese resistance to  increase its operations during the next few days. According to  security reports from the south and western al-Biqa', the  Islamic resistance forces have been placed on a state of maximum  alert as a precaution against any Israeli attacks on its  positions in the Lebanese towns and villages adjacent to the  occupied border strip.    In his statements to MENA, the Lebanese defense minister  said  that Lebanon believes that the Arab defense ministers should  meet as soon as possible to reassess the military situation in  light of recent developments. Dallul said that Lebanon will  welcome an invitation by Arab League Secretary General Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to convene this meeting.</p>

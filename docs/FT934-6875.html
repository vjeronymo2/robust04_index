			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / People: Walker takes over at Swalec The new group chief executive of South Wales Electricity, Andrew Walker, is clearly a man who ignores the herd and sails his own course. In 1975, a time when many students and young people were campaigning against companies - in particular Barclays Bank - for their connections with South Africa, Walker, recently graduated from Cambridge, showed an independent mind and went off to Johannesburg to work for the South African Chamber of Mines. His task was to increase gold mining productivity, using his engineering degrees. At 42, Walker, a former pupil at Ampleforth, now takes over at South Wales Electricity, recently re-named Swalec, a company with a market capitalisation of some Pounds 660m. He joins on Thursday though he will actually take over in January 1994, following David Jones's move to be chief executive at the National Grid Company. Walker has long had ties with electricity generation, having been sponsored by the Central Electricity Generating Board during his first degree. While in South Africa he joined Dowty, remaining with the company through a variety of posts until leaving in August this year. Swalec had been talking to Walker about taking up the new post for the past six weeks. According to Wynford Evans, Swalec's chairman, Walker will be expected not just to 'control our core business but also to lead in developing our opportunities in cable, television and telephony, as well as to pull our contracting subsidiaries in better order'.</p>

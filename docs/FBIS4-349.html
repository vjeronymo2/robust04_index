			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The assassination yesterday of the presidents of  Rwanda and Burundi has plunged the Rwandan capital into total  chaos. [passage omitted]    The Rwandan prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyamana, has been  killed in the center of Kigali, near the presidential palace,  but the circumstances of her death remain unclear. The UN  mission, UNAMIR, has not been allowed to inspect the site of her  death. Some sources said this morning that she had tried to  take refuge in the UN Program for Development headquarters,  while others say that she was killed while under the protection  of Senegalese blue helmets. [passage omitted]    There are reports of house-to-house massacres, and small  groups of youths have been seen roaming the streets armed with  machetes and clubs. The Jesuit community in Kigali also seems  to have been specifically targeted. Seventeen Jesuit priests  were savagely murdered at the Christos Center. A group of  soldiers divided those present, separating the Rwandan priests  from the foreigners. A jeep full of officers arrived a few  moments later, and then the soldiers gave the order to execute  the Rwandans, both Tutsis and Hutus without distinction. This  is what we were told by one of the surviving priests.    This evening, we have also heard from UNAMIR that members of  the Rwandan Patriotic Front, who had been billeted in the  compound of the former parliament since the Arusha accords, have  come under attack from members of the gendarmerie. There has  been hand-to-hand fighting, but we still do not have any toll  for today's violence.</p>

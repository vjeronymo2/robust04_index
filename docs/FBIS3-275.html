			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello today granted  his usual Friday news conference to the Mozambican and foreign  media. Viewing the latest developments in the Mozambican peace  process, the UN special representative said he was happy that  the government had decided to start demobilizing its forces  without waiting for the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]  to do the same. Aldo Ajello noted that this is a sensible and  important initiative and he added that work must start now to do  away with what he described as technical red tape, so that  government and Renamo can start demobilizing their troops as  soon as possible. Those troops are currently confined to  assembly areas.    [Begin Ajello recording, in English with passage-by-passage  translation to Portuguese] I have said that the decision of the  government is extremely positive and I would like to stress this  point because I think that it is one of few gestures of  confidence that we have recorded since the peace process began.  I think that Mr. Dhlakama understood that and I think his  statement this morning was correct.    Mainly, what the government did was to recognize Renamo's  good faith. Renamo was having problems producing its lists of  men to be demobilized, but it really wanted to demobilize them.  The government offered to get the process under way  unilaterally. It was a good and wise decision. At the same  time, it helps to build confidence all around.    As for Renamo, I have its first list here. This list was  drawn up in conjunction with our officials, so that each soldier  will have his own serial number, thereby allowing us to identify  each soldier. We will do everything that is needed to [words  indistinct] all that data is on our computers. You must be  aware that there have been some misunderstandings concerning  this list. However, I do not think they will be repeated.    I can see, though, that the government's gesture has  produced  a positive gesture from the other side, even if this is only a  small list. Nonetheless, our people are working on upcoming  lists. [end recording]    UN Special Representative Ajello said that the Finance  Ministry is working hard to process documentation relating to  the subsidies to which soldiers on both sides are entitled.  That UN official also disclosed that 45 percent of the  government forces expected at the assembly areas have already  been registered. A total of 50 percent of the Renamo forces  have already been registered. In his opinion, the existing gap  is being rapidly bridged.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television It is usually at 9.00 or 9.30 that programme clashes occur and you have to resort to the VCR, but today it happens at 8.00. BBC2 shows My Name Is Albert Watson, a profile of one of the world's top - though little known - photographers. Born in Scotland and living in the US, Watson has 70 Vogue covers to his credit and some of the best known photographs of rock stars including the Rolling Stones. At the same time Channel 4 screens the last in the current series of dance programmes, Tights, Camera, Action] Lea Anderson introduces her own choreography in La Spectre da la Rose. Also at 8.00 on BBC1 Jonathan Ross Presents David Copperfield. This will serve as a handy puff for the American conjuror who is bringing his show to London this autumn. And we should not forget The Bill, one of television's most consistent drama series though not, as some seem to imagine, a 'soap' (8.00 ITV). Tarantula omelettes are never going to catch on, but the Survival Special which gives news of the dish may well get a big rating, spiders being one of those creatures, it seems, that viewers love to hate (9.00 ITV).</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fresh worries on rates leave Dow lower Wall Street US stocks retreated yesterday as worries about a further possible increase in short-term interest rates drove bond prices down, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 19.98 off at 3,891.68 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 0.77 to 470.69. The Nasdaq composite shed 2.04 to 789.11. NYSE volume came to 309.9m shares. The session began quietly, with no fresh economic news due until today's report on January durable goods orders. The clean slate brought relative tranquility to the US Treasury market, and bonds and stocks drifted lower in uninspired trading. The tone in part reflected the reassuring effect of Tuesday's testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. He said the Fed was likely to lift interest rates again, but he left vague the timing of such a move, which appeared to comfort investors. Just after midday, however, the Treasury market began to focus on Mr Greenspan's remark that durable goods orders were a factor that could spur inflation. Traders soon were speculating that today's data could trigger the next strike by the Fed. That fear sent bond prices sharply lower during the afternoon, and stocks followed their lead. By the end of the session, the Dow industrials were near their lowest levels of the session, with Alcoa, United Technologies and Goodyear Tire among the biggest losers. Retailing issues were among the most widely traded. Wal-Mart added Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 29 amid expectations of more restrained growth for the discount store chain. Home Depot was also in play yesterday, after releasing strong quarterly results during the previous session. The do-it-yourself warehouse chain gained Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 42 3/8 . In banking, First Interstate Bancorp shot up Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 amid speculation that it was holding merger talks with another company. Wells Fargo, often suggested as a potential partner with First Interstate, slid Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 136 7/8 . Fibreboard rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 on the Amex on a report that a Minnesota investment group was considering a bid for the building materials supplier. Brazil The Sao Paulo market closed just 0.9 per cent higher in nervous trade after a strong wave of profit-taking late in the session had erased most of an early fresh advance. The Bovespa index, 5.3 per cent stronger at mid-morning, showed a gain on the day of 93 points at 10,630. Prices fluctuated sharply due to renewed nervousness over the final congressional vote due to be taken later that day on economy minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's social welfare fund bill. Canada Toronto showed no clear trend yesterday in the wake of the federal budget which was announced after the stock market close on Tuesday. The TSE 300 index lost 2.8 at 4,368.3 but rises led falls by 428 to 338. Volume was 82.5m shares. Analysts said the government's projection of a CDollars 39.7bn budget deficit for the 1995 fiscal year starting April 1 was in line with market expectations. Business groups gave the budget mixed reviews, mostly for failing to take bolder action on deficit reduction.</p>

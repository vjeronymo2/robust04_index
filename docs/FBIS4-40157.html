			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- "Nobody knows how the recent  crisis over Sarajevo would end if it were not for the initiative  of President Boris Yeltsin", Radovan Karadzic said on Tuesday  regarding Russia's support for Bosnian Serbs. At a meeting with  Andrey Kozyrev in the Russian Foreign Ministry he said the  Russian people had been Serbs friends over centuries.    Radovan Karadzic arrived in Moscow to receive a literary  prize named after Mikhail Sholokhov that was awarded to him by  the Russian Writers Union. Karadzic said he intends to meet  representatives of various political trends. He said he will  never forget priority role of the Russian Government and Russian  diplomacy in the quest for peaceful solution to the Bosnian  conflict. He said Bosnian Serbs are aware of Russia's  objectivity so they believe it will not be biased in the  approach to the events in the region.    "It is very difficult to end the civil war. Not only the  armies but also civilians are involved in hostilities", Karadzic  said. "We are sick and tired of the crisis lasting for several  years. We need peace in order to build a democratic society and  free economy".</p>

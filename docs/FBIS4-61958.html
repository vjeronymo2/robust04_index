			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Today, the official visit of a Latvian Government  delegation to France continued. The delegation is led by Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs. During the visit, there was discussion  with French officials of the possibilities for the two  countries' cooperation in the economic, defense, and security  spheres, as well as Latvia's participation in the European  stability pact. Today Birkavs met French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur. Birkavs tells us about this from Paris, specially for  Latvian Radio:    [Begin Birkavs recording] Here the main achievement is that  within the framework of the European stability pact, (?we have  gained) certain political guarantees in connection with the  agreement signed on 30 April. It is clear to us that after  signing a (?free) agreement on the European Union, France and  Germany together support the signing of a treaty of association  with the European Union this year. When we started talking  about the Council of Europe, in which Latvia must also  participate, the French side believed it was a question that was  not to be discussed practically, because only a citizenship law  is necessary, and we immediately received the support of  European countries in this connection. What is also very  positive is that we have attained the role of associate partner  in the Western European Union [WEU], and that gives (?the right)  to take part in the military operations of the WEU, their  planning, in direct contacts with the planning office of the  WEU, and also a whole range of issues connected with Latvia's  security.

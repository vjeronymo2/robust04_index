			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Major and Blair clash on Aitken Mr John Major and Mr Tony Blair clashed yesterday over allegations of impropriety against Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary. Amid rowdy Commons exchanges, Mr Major accused Mr Blair of 'descending into the gutter of public life', as the Labour leader demanded a public hearing of allegations against Mr Aitken and other ministers. In the first serious Commons row since Mr Blair succeeded John Smith as Labour leader, Mr Major bluntly refused to discuss the allegations and accused opposition MPs of political grandstanding and peddling gossip. The row blew up after Mr Aitken refused to duck questions about newspaper allegations that he had lied to the cabinet secretary about reports that he had paid only half his bill at the Paris Ritz, owned by Mr Mohamad Fayed, the owner of Harrods. Ignoring advice from Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, that he need not respond, Mr Aitken told Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, that he completely denied the 'scurrilous accusations', printed in The Guardian. 'I hope this house, which is a very fair-minded place, will accept both my assurance and the cabinet secretary's assurance, and put an end to the hysterical atmosphere of sleaze journalism by The Guardian,' he said. The claims of impropriety dominated prime minister's question time. Mr Major, giving unequivocal support to Mr Aitken, refused to identify an unnamed informant alleged to have made allegations on behalf of Mr Fayed. As Tory MPs jeered, Mr Blair claimed Mr Neil Hamilton, the former corporate affairs minister, had been sacked following 'unfounded' allegations but Mr Aitken had been retained in spite of 'unsubstantiated' allegations. 'What is the basis on which you decide to retain or dismiss your government ministers  -the truth of the allegations or merely the number of them?' he demanded. Mr Major said: 'I understood that when you became leader of the Labour party we were going to see a new style in politics. I had not expected to see you step down into the gutter of public life quite so soon.' Mr Blair shot back: 'You will only get a grip on this problem when you understand that there has to be a proper method of investigating the allegations of Mr Al-Fayed in which the public has confidence, and that means an open, full investigation in public view.' Mr Major told Mr Blair: 'We now know where we are with you. We know precisely what way you plan to play politics. You say you don't believe the allegations are substantiated - yet still you are prepared in here to peddle them.' Rising for the third time - the first occasion on which he has done so since becoming Labour leader - Mr Blair declared: 'It is not me that has dismissed two of your ministers - it is you.' He added: 'Nobody on this side is saying whether these allegations are true or false, merely that they should be investigated. Why won't you allow that to happen in public?' Mr Major told him: 'You say the matters may not be true. They may be unsubstantiated gossip and yet you want them peddled in public so that people's reputations may be harmed.'</p>

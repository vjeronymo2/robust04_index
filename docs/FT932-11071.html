			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Sunday trading 'endangers 19,000 jobs' UNRESTRICTED Sunday shopping would lower retail prices and raise shopworkers' average wages but lead to the loss of 19,000 jobs in the retail sector, according to an independent study commissioned by the Home Office. It says tighter restrictions, favoured by unions, small shops and religious groups, would create some jobs. But industry efficiency would suffer, retail prices would rise and average wages would fall. The study says about 40 per cent of shops currently open on Sunday in England and Wales, when about 6 per cent of weekly shopping is done. But it finds the trend has not perceptibly increased total retail sales and doubts they would rise even if Sunday trading were wholly deregulated. However, the study, which uses an economic model based on data supplied by retailers, finds that the various options for changing the law now being considered in Westminster would have widely differing effects on retailing costs, employment levels and patterns of shopping. The study was published as 245 MPs from all the main parties signed a parliamentary early-day motion yesterday urging the government to support a private member's bill which calls for stricter curbs on Sunday trading. The motion noted that the bill - introduced by Mr Ray Powell, the Labour MP for Ogmore, and backed by the Keep Sunday Special campaign - had been amended in committee to allow Sunday opening by DIY outlets, garden centres and convenience stores of up to 3,000 sq ft. The study says that total deregulation - one of the options favoured by the government - would cut retail prices by 0.3 per cent, saving the average household Pounds 18.40 on its annual shopping bill. But because the overall volume of trade would remain about the same, shops would have to be more competitive to cover opening for an extra day. That would would lead to some retailers going out of business and about 19,000 jobs disappearing, the report said. The study, by the London Economics consultancy, forecasts that almost two-thirds of shops in England and Wales would trade on Sunday if it were made legal. It does not cost the amended version of Mr Powell's bill, but it says that in its original, more restrictive, form, the bill would have added 0.4 per cent to retail prices, costing the average household Pounds 25.80 a year. The original bill would have created 22,500 retailing jobs, but cut the average wage by Pounds 172 a year. It would also have led to expanded retailing capacity. The Shopping Hours Reform Council welcomed the study as a victory for consumers, and said it supported its own proposals for partial deregulation. But John Lewis Partnership, which does not open on Sundays, called it 'highly slanted'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, commissioned the study last year after offering parliament three options for Sunday trading reform. These range from the present curbs to total deregulation. The government's bill is expected to be included in the legislative timetable for the next parliamentary session. Mr Powell's bill reaches the Commons report stage later this month, but is thought unlikely to survive.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       WHAT THE PROPOSALS WILL MEAN  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Powell Bill   Powell Bill   RSAR   SHRC     Full                       (tight)      (liberal)                Deregulation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGE IN RETAIL EMPLOYMENT   Medium term             -900      -1,000     -2,100   +900     +1,400   Long term            +22,500     +21,000    +12,900 -5,300    -19,100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LONG-TERM CHANGE IN WAGES                         Pounds      Pounds     Pounds  Pounds    Pounds   Annual total             28m         24m       -16m     7m       45m   Per employee            -172        -167       -125     51       135  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COST TO HOUSEHOLDS      Pounds      Pounds     Pounds  Pounds    Pounds   Per household          25.80       23.60      15.70    6.70    -18.40                        Percent     Percent    Percent  Percent   Percent   of retail prices         0.4         0.4        0.3    -0.1       0.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: London Economics  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

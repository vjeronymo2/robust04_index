			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 May -- Many aspects of partnerly  cooperation between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance will  be decided during Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's  forthcoming visit to Brussels, during which he will attend the  NATO Council meeting. This was stated today by Vitaliy Churkin,  Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, after talks between  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alain Juppe, French  foreign minister.    Vitaliy Churkin stressed that Russia has not officially  raised the question of special status for itself in the event  that it joins NATO's Partnership for Peace program. At the  moment, consideration is being given to an appropriate way of  reflecting a special form of relations between Russia and NATO.  The Russian side believes that these relations will be  extensive and meaningful. The official name for this program of  cooperation also has to be decided. The scope of the  interdepartmental consultations on our side goes far beyond  anything which the countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS  states, which have already joined Partnership for Peace, are  prepared to discuss with NATO. Among other things, Russia's  nuclear status has to be taken into account, the deputy minister  said.    Vitaliy Churkin described Pavel Grachev's forthcoming visit  to Brussels as unprecedented. The defense minister will meet  the 16 ministers of defense of the countries belonging to the  North Atlantic Assembly.</p>

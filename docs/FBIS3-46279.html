			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251): "1993 State Plan for </F> Production of Petroleum, Natural Gas Overfulfilled"]    [Text] Our country's onshore petroleum industry is facing  greater difficulties in prospecting and tapping, potential  resources to be tapped are decreasing, and construction funds  are insufficient. In such circumstances, China's oil industry  continues to maintain a stable growth momentum. In 1993,  production of crude oil and natural gas exceeded planned targets  laid down by the state: Crude oil output reached 139.2 million  tonnes, or increased by 1.04 million tonnes over the previous  year, and this marked the largest increase in output over one  year. Natural gas output reached 15.4 cubic meters, an increase  of 200 million cubic meters over the previous year, which were  101.2 percent and 101.3 percent respectively of the state's  planned targets.    At present, various oil fields in the east of the country  are  still experiencing a period of difficult development, the  average comprehensive water content stands above 79 percent, and  the annual fall in output is about 21 million tonnes. On the  one hand, the China National Petroleum Corporation will continue  to adopt advanced technology, will pay attention to the  reasonable adjustment of exploitation, and try by every possible  means to lower the overall rate of decrease and the natural rate  of decrease. On the other hand, through the in-depth  implementation of the Regulations on Enterprise Reform, it will  adjust the production contract policy for the last three years  of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period so that reform may promote  further the development of production.    Since last year, promoted by reforms, various oil fields  have  made efforts to increase oil output by overcoming difficulties.  Oil fields in the east have actively carried out measures to  "stabilize output through water control." Last year, Daqing Oil  Field produced 55.9 million tonnes of crude oil, and increased  output by 244,000 tonnes over the previous year. It has  stabilized its output at a level above 50 million tonnes for 18  consecutive years. Oil fields in the west also increased crude  oil output by 1.739 million tonnes, although there was a  shortage of transport facilities.    In 1993, the oil and gas prospecting situation of our  country's onshore petroleum industry also maintained a rising  trend. Geological oil and gas reserves discovered and verified  exceeded planned state targets by 22 percent and 44 percent  respectively. Total discovered reserves continued to increase.</p>

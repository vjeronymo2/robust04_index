			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Management: Be a better builder - David Sainsbury reviews a book expected to be this autumn's top business title in the US The ideas of Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad are already well-known to regular readers of this page. Harvard Business Review subscribers are also familiar with them, from a series of brilliant articles, two of which, 'Strategic Intent' and 'The Core Competence of the Corporation', have won the annual McKinsey award for the review's best article. Now they have used the material in those articles as the basis of an exciting and valuable book on how companies build up leadership positions in new industries. It is a book they are well-equipped to write: Hamel is professor of strategic and international management at the London Business School and Prahalad is professor of business administration at the University of Michigan. They are experienced consultants, and the book draws heavily on the work they have done for companies such as Motorola, EDS, Philips and Whirlpool. Competing for the Future* is a book about corporate strategy, but it is not a book about corporate strategy as it is taught in most business schools and practised in most companies. The authors are not concerned with how to position the firm optimally within an existing industry structure, but with how companies create new industries. They see this process as having three distinct but overlapping stages. The first of these is competition for industry foresight and intellectual leadership. This is competition to gain a deeper understanding of technological, demographic, regulatory or lifestyle trends and discontinuities that may transform industry boundaries and create new industries. Second, there is the race to accumulate the necessary core competencies, to overcome technical hurdles, to attract coalition partners, to construct the necessary product or service delivery infrastructure and to get agreement around standards if necessary. The third stage is competition for market position and market share. A big advantage accrues to the company that is the first to penetrate global markets, and the way to get there quicker is 'expeditionary marketing'. Market research provides a valuable way for refining existing product concepts, but it is not very helpful where new products are concerned. The way to learn faster than competitors is, therefore, to develop an effective system of product iteration. This whole process of building a leadership position can take 15-20 years. For example, JVC, a subsidiary of Matsushita and the world leader in VCRs, began developing videotape competencies in the late 1950s and early 1960s, after Ampex, a US company, had produced the first videotape recorder in 1959. But it was not until the late 1970s, nearly 20 years later, that JVC had a winning product with its VHS-standard machine. In this process of building up a leadership position the authors assign a key role to the acquisition and deployment of core competencies. They define a core competence as a bundle of distinct and defensible skills and technologies that enables a company to provide a particular benefit to customers. At Sony, for example, the benefit is 'pocketability' and the core competence is miniaturisation. The possession of these competencies enables companies to move into new product areas. Also, because they represent cumulative learning rather than great leaps of inventiveness, it is difficult for competitors to 'time compress' competence building and catch up. The authors also attach a great deal of weight to the motivation and ambitions of companies, and they argue that starting resource positions are a poor predictor of future industry leadership. While a traditional view of strategy focuses on the 'fit' between existing resources and emerging opportunities, the companies which build up leadership positions are those that have a 'strategic intent' that creates, by design, a substantial 'misfit' between resources and aspirations. Strategy is about stretch as well as about fit. When British Airways proclaimed just after its privatisation in early 1987 that it wanted to become 'the world's favourite airline' many people would have said this was not a realistic ambition. But by 1992, Business Traveller magazine was rating BA as the best transatlantic airline, and number two worldwide only to Singapore Airlines. This book is a useful antidote to much current management thinking. As the authors say, it is a book for those who are 'more inclined to build than cut'. They believe that the US and Britain have produced an entire generation of managers concerned only with downsizing, delayering and divesting, and that the time has come to put more emphasis on creating the markets of the future. Otherwise managers will find themselves on a treadmill trying to keep one step ahead of the steadily declining margins and profits of yesterday's businesses. The ideas put forward in this book are stimulating and original and many of them are already being used by successful companies. But they need to be handled carefully by businessmen and women seeking to apply them. While companies should be ambitious, the book at times become too inspirational. If one's 'strategic intent' is strong enough and one is imaginative enough, then there is apparently nothing to stop one becoming the leader of one's industry. Any small business can become a Honda or a Sony. But for many companies more modest ambitions may be more appropriate. They may be limited by the talent and skills of their management team. Second, while the authors have sought to show how their ideas can apply to all industries, they are undoubtedly at their best when discussing world-class electronics and IT companies, where most of their consulting has been done. I have no doubt that their ideas can be applied more widely, but they will need to be modified. The chief executive of a medium-sized engineering company will find a lot here that is useful and interesting, but he will need to adapt the concepts carefully to the circumstances of his own company and industry. I predict that this book will be a big success, and that many businessmen will gain competitive advantage from reading it. It provides a more coherent view of strategy than Kenichi Ohmae's The Mind of the Strategist, is more original and stimulating than In Search of Excellence, and is certainly more enjoyable to read than Michael Porter's volumes on Competitive Strategy and Competitive Advantage. *Harvard Business School Press.

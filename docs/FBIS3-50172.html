Miroslav Karas, our Warsaw  correspondent, reports:    [Karas] After his arrival by air shortly before noon, Michal  Kovac first met his Polish counterpart for a half-hour talk.  Lech Walesa stressed to journalists that this was the first  visit of the president of independent Slovakia to Poland. We  are neighbors, and we want to be good neighbors. We have a lot  of internal political and economic problems, but their solution  will bring us common results. I wish that nothing concerning us  be undertaken in Europe without us. Regional cooperation is the  future for the Europe of the 21st century, which will lead to  the disappearance of borders, the Polish president said.    According to Michal Kovac, the Slovak Republic considers  friendship with Poland one of the most important cornerstones in  the building of the international position of Slovakia. For the  first time in history, a situation has been created in which not  only Slovakia and Poland, but more countries of the Central  European region, have common and identical interests, the Slovak  president said and added that, even if we are trying to overcome  the division of Europe, we realize that it will be a long-term  and complicated process, and one has to realize the fact that  the countries of the Visegrad Group have their specific  interests in this process.    In this connection, Kovac stressed that the Slovak Republic  realizes the great significance of the mutual cooperation of the  Visegrad Group countries in the sphere of security. Accepting  the Partnership for Peace plan, which we will be concluding with  NATO individually, should be an incentive for better cooperation  and exchange of experiences. I am convinced that cooperation of  the Visegrad Four is the most important thing we can contribute  toward becoming bona fide members of NATO, Slovak President  Michal Kovac said.    In the afternoon, he met Polish Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak, the minister of foreign economic relations, and Cardinal  Glemp.</p>

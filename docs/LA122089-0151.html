			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BONN TO EXCHANGE 4 SPIES FOR 24 WESTERNERS HELD IN E. GERMANY  </P> <P> In one of the biggest East-West spy swaps since World War II, Bonn will release  four people jailed as Communist agents in exchange for 24 Westerners held in  East Germany, West German government officials said today.  </P> <P> A spokesman for West German President Richard von Weizsaecker said two former  secretaries jailed after they passed state secrets to their KGB lovers had been  pardoned. He could not say whether they had yet been freed.  </P> <P> Bonn's minister for inner-German affairs, Dorothee Wilms, visiting Dresden with  Chancellor Helmut Kohl's delegation, confirmed the spy swap but would not give  further details.  </P> <P> "I hope this means the chapter of prisoners and agents is now ended," she said.  "That is the prerequisite for the two governments to cooperate in trust."  </P></p>

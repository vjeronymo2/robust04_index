			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Case for stricter accounting of German corporations Sir, With reference to John Craven's article (Management: 'Testimony to the German system', February 18), enthusiasts of the German model of corporate governance have long praised the system for its allegedly superior long-term performance. Mr Craven, chairman of merchant bankers Morgan Grenfell, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary, now claims that the German model merits praise for its superiority against others with respect to its capacity for short-term handling of corporate failure, like the one that occurred at Metallgesellschaft AG. What Mr Craven can book as a natural advantage in the successful rescue of Metallgesellschaft AG is seen by many in this country as the cornerstone of an organised system of unaccountability that has created much of the rigidity and stagnation that we face in German society. The talk here is of the virtually closed and highly centralised system of decision-making in the German model of corporate governance. There is an urgent need to end the cosy relationships in German corporatism and to remind everyone of the individual responsibility owed to a business. It is not acceptable that public banks, as occurred in the rescue of Metallgesellschaft AG, are actively engaged in securing the gambling risks of badly controlled managers from private corporations. Since the current German model of corporate governance seems to be built on weak moral grounds you should not be surprised to hear more energetic calls for stricter accounting rules.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Takayuki Higuchi] </F>   [Text] "Negotiations with Japan are always concluded after  having all-night sessions for about three days on final days.  Japanese negotiators like to work overnight. Probably, they  always camp out to be trained for all-night negotiations."    With Japan-U.S. summit talks just ahead, U.S. negotiators  are  strengthening their criticism of Japanese bureaucrats over  Japan-U.S. comprehensive trade talks, where progress is hardly  being made. However, Joan Spero, U.S. under secretary of state  for economic and agricultural affairs, sarcastically criticized  Japan's slow negotiation style at a news conference held at the  Japan Press Club on 12 January.    Spero "analyzed" Japan's negotiation attitude, saying, "When  they play judo, Japanese always assume the defensive position.  She said: It seems that they think there are steps they have to  go through in negotiations, too." At the initial stage, they  flatly refuse our demands, saying "there is absolutely no  discrimination against foreign companies and the markets are  open to all." But, they would say "let's talk a little" if the  United States makes counterarguments by citing data and  examples. Thus, the second stage of discussions starts.    She added that Japanese "hardly show their hand." In this  way, she made a cutting remark at negotiation technique of  Japanese bureaucrats.    She said that unlike "Americans, who immediately reveal  their  intention because they are good-natured people," Japanese  negotiators start to bring all-night discussions to a settlement  at midnight on the very last day of negotiation period.    As she said this, reporters at the news conference burst  into  laughter. But, Spero explained the current situation, saying:  "(The trade talks) are still at the first stage and we are  arguing whether the Japanese markets are open or closed to  foreign companies." She concluded the news conference by saying  that "we are trying to get enough sleep now to be ready for the  final all-night sessions" so that we will not be beaten by the  tough Japanese bureaucrats.</p>

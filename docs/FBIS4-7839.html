			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Mladen Ivanic of the Banja Luka Economic </F> School: "Theoretically Untenable"]    [Text] In a similar way the Krajinas "have already  been" in Germany's monetary system, because they could have  German marks--by exchanging other currencies or by exporting  goods and services--just as is the case now with Yugoslavia and  the dinar.    More than a month has passed since the new economic program  was launched on the territory of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia [FRY]. At the same time, on the territory of the  republic of Srpska [RS] and the republic of Serbian Krajina  [RSK], there has been virtually no money of any kind for three  months now (except for the German mark, naturally), and so the  economies of these areas have functioned without their own  money. It is not necessary to talk about what kind of fatal  consequences this has had for the state of fiscal discipline. It  is interesting that that situation has been explained by the  authorities, which in normal conditions would quite certainly  have lost their position long ago because of the absence of  money, wages, and taxes, in terms of the need to create the  preconditions for union with Serbia and Yugoslavia, by failing  to issue their own money.    That logic would mean that the economy should be put in a  difficult position so that inclusion in the FRY's monetary  system would be a cheap solution. It is necessary to recall,  however, that even at the moment that this article is being  written, the dinar has not fully functioned in the areas west of  the Drina, even though those in power have announced that  several times. It seems that "Mother Serbia" is much more  reserved toward her daughters, than the daughters' desire for  their mother to take them back under her auspices.    That is also demonstrated by several facts.    First, the RS and the RSK do not appear in the program  anywhere. All the balance-sheets for public and budget spending  have been created for the FRY independently, and one of the  tasks was reducing "aid" to the Krajinas to 5 percent of the  social product.    Second, not one economist from the countries west of the  Drina participated in creating the program, nor was the state of  the economy in those areas a subject of interest to the  economists who worked on the program.    Third, although the authorities in both countries west of  the  Drina adopted a decision a long time ago on inclusion in the  monetary system, it is still not functioning, primarily because  of fear in the FRY that inclusion of the Krajinas would disrupt  the system's stability and jeopardize the program.    We have already stated that after lengthy and arduous talks  and numerous political problems, however, a decision was made  (apparently reluctantly) that the new dinar would also function  on the territories of the RS and the RSK. The precondition for  that was that they would deposit foreign exchange funds in the  National Bank's foreign exchange treasury. Faced with the lack  of any other alternative, the authorities in these two republics  agreed, and withdrew the last of the foreign exchange from their  otherwise already empty foreign exchange reserves and sent it  across the Drina. In the case of the RS, that is estimated to be  about 20 million marks. Those funds, which were difficult to  find, are not even enough for a month for all the budget  beneficiaries. The Krajinas were not in a position to provide  more, however, because they simply do not have it.    Whether it is decent to demand foreign exchange from areas  that are at war, even for an amount of dinars that will in any  case remain in the Krajinas and thus not burden demand in  Serbia, is a completely different question. One thing is  certain: In a similar way the Krajinas "have already been" in  Germany's monetary system, because they could have marks--by  exchanging other foreign exchange or by exporting goods and  services--just as is now the case with Yugoslavia and the dinar.    After the initial purchase, the economy and the budget  should  secure the necessary dinars from regular transactions. For an  economy laboring under the war and enormous public spending, and  which is operating at 15-20 percent of capacity at most, that  position is both theoretically and practically untenable.  Therefore, and especially because of the situation with state  finances, Avramovic's program will have very negative  consequences for the economy of both Krajinas. Naturally, the  program is not responsible for this, but rather the situation in  the economy is such that it is fascinating how people have  succeeded in financing the war so far. The program will lead to  a more rapid collapse of the inflationary illusion that the  economy is functioning.    The concept for the RS's and RSK's inclusion in the monetary  system provided for several control mechanisms by which the FRY  tried to protect itself against a possible lack of financial  discipline, which in a way could also be insulting to those in  power in the countries west of the Drina. Thus, in practice, the  national banks of these future "republics" of Yugoslavia are  disappearing; the auditors of the federal payment transactions  service are beginning to monitor the work of the local services;  through the "unified record account" the influx and outflow of  money from the Krajinas to Yugoslavia and vice versa will be  monitored daily, weekly, and monthly. One can assume that the  formula of a "unified record account" could also serve as a  pretext for possibly blocking payment transactions in the event  that the account is overdrawn.    Furthermore, it has been realized in the Krajinas that the  whole concept of the program has to be transferred consistently,  and thus laws and decrees are being almost literally copied. To  the best of the professional public's knowledge, not one of the  members of the team or the state officials who are working on  its implementation in the FRY has been present in these areas,  or has suggested any sort of solutions.    Even everything said so far would not be that much of a  problem if the degree of economic unity were complete, and if  the budgets of all the republics were prepared and supplied  according to the same principles. In this way, the monetary  system is unified; for the time being customs duties are still  in operation; the fiscal system is different, with the income  side, since the regulations have been adopted, dependent upon  measures in the FRY and Serbia, while the expenditure side of  the budget has been left to the local governments.    All of this indicates that the implementation of the current  program will have very difficult consequences for the economy  and state in the RS and the RSK. Instead of a magic wand, the  waving of which would ensure a miraculous leap into a society of  abundance (which retirees, the army, education, and health care,  which have not received wages for a long time now, are expecting  anyway, under the influence of the media), these areas will be  affected by a further decline in production and even more by an  empty state treasury, with all of its repercussions for a  country at war, whose expenditures are quite certainly twice as  high as the available social product. Any other situation would  be equivalent to a miracle.</p>

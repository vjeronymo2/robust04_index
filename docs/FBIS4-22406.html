			<p>Azeris   <F P=102>   944K1013A Baku VYSHKA in Russian 2 Apr 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> 944K1013A </F> <F P=104>  Baku VYSHKA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> ["Statement by the Press Service of the President of the </F> Republic of Azerbaijan"]    [Text] In March 1918, organized armed actions by Armenians  against the Azeri civilian population took place throughout the  territory of Azerbaijan. These actions, which were organized by  the leaders of the Bolshevik party, the Dashnaktsutyun Party,  and other Armenian terrorist organizations, were aimed at the  physical extermination of Azeris, the destruction of monuments  of spiritual and material culture of Azerbaijan, and ultimately  the Armenization of indigenous Azeri territories.    Anti-Azeri pogroms and acts of violence and terror were  perpetrated throughout the territory of Azerbaijan between 1917  and 1920. However, they became the most cruel during March 1918  in Baku, Shemakha, Kuba, the villages of Shemakhinskiy,  Kubinskiy, and Geokchayskiy Uyezds, Karabakh, and some other  regions of Azerbaijan. In these regions the Armenian barbarians  brutally wiped out more than 50,000 peaceful Azeris and burned  down monuments of Azeri ethnic culture, mosques, and state  offices.    The March 1918 events were tragically peculiar in that the  inhumane ideology of Armenian national-chauvinism blended with  the criminal practice of terror and genocide of the Azeris and  ethnic cleansing and Armenization of Azeri lands aimed at  achieving Armenians' economic and political domination over  Azerbaijan. It is also characteristic that virtually all strata  of the Armenian population, which rallied on the basis of the  pathologically developed idea of hatred for Turkic nations,  primarily Azeris, took part in these events.    The bloody synthesis of the ideology and practice of  Armenian  national-chauvinism has been built upon in the current state  policy of the Republic of Armenia, which has ethnically  "cleansed" its territory and is waging a large-scale war on  Azerbaijan; it has occupied about 20 percent of the territory of  Azerbaijan and forced more than 1 million Azeris to become  refugees.    In conjunction with the above, the Republic of Azerbaijan,  resolutely denouncing the Armenian policy of secret and open  genocide of Azeris pursued throughout the 20th century and  condemning the ideology and practice of Armenian  national-chauvinism as a crime against the Azeri people, against  peace and humanity, calls on the nations and parliaments of the  world and leading international organizations to make a  qualified assessment of the March 1918 events and to consider  the issue of moral and legal responsibility of the ethnically  "clean" Republic of Armenia for the policy of war, terror, and  genocide pursued with regard to the Azeri people.</p>

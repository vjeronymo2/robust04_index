			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Bouncing cheques shake up Taiwanese market's nerves In Taiwan, where reliable financial indicators are hard to come by, the bounced cheque ratio moves markets. For the island's underground financiers and above-ground brokers, yesterday's ratio announcement was bad news: a 10-month high at 0.58 per cent. It was a report of a brokerage's bouncing cheque that prompted a 14.7 per cent fall in stock prices earlier this month. For a Chinese society with traditional regard for financial tangibles, defaulting on a cheque carries a social penalty and, until a few years ago, was a criminal offence. The ratio is compiled by the Central Bank of China, which measures the bouncing by number of cheques issued and the total amount dishonoured. By value, September's defaults reached 0.41 per cent of the total, the same as August, which was the highest since November 1993. Credit against post-dated cheques is the most common form of short-term financing in Taiwan. The instrument is commonly used as collateral for loans from underground financiers (black-market moneylenders) especially for share purchases, hence the correlation between stock market confidence and the rate of cheque defaults. This month's share payment default scandal was started by a TDollars 200m (Pounds 4.9m) bounced cheque from a local brokerage firm, presented to the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The episode set off a chain reaction among other brokerages and their clientele, and the defaults over a couple of days were estimated at TDollars 7.6bn. A US banker explained that a company's bounce history is an important source of background information. Taiwan does not have an established credit information or rating system, and checking records for defaults is one of the few formal ways of assessing creditworthiness. The ratio, the banker said, is akin to the bankruptcy rate in the US and an index of 'prosperity' in a society that had hoarded foreign reserves of Dollars 90.99bn as at the end of August. Post-dated cheques have an important role. In Taiwan, the cheque is not just used for paying the electricity bill. For instance, if equipment is leased for three years, the lessee might sign 36 cheques totalling the agreed amount, post-dated monthly, to cover the contract. Until 1987, defaulting on a cheque was a criminal offence. The law was changed, but the power of the paper and the stigma remain.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAN'T SUE NEGLIGENT OFFICIALS IN ABUSE CASES, COURT RULES  </P> <P> The Supreme Court ruled today that public officials may not be sued when their  gross negligence permits a child to be abused by a parent.  </P> <P> By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a state does not have a constitutional duty to  protect people, including abused children, who are not in the state's custody.  </P> <P> Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said, "As a general  matter . . . we conclude that a state's failure to protect an individual  against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the  (Constitution's) due process clause."  </P> <P> In an unusual emotional dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun exclaimed, "Poor  Joshua! It is a sad commentary upon American life and constitutional principles  . . . that this child, Joshua DeShaney, now is assigned to live out the  remainder of his life profoundly retarded" and without an opportunity to sue  the state.  </P> <P> Social workers were accused of violating Joshua's constitutional rights by  failing to come to his rescue after repeatedly receiving evidence that he was  being beaten.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a Duty  </P> <P> But Rehnquist said the state's awareness of the boy's plight does not mean it  has a duty to protect him.  </P> <P> Only "when the state takes a person into its custody and holds him there  against his will" does the Constitution require officials to take  responsibility for the individual's safety and well-being, Rehnquist said.  </P> <P> "While the state may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua faced in the  free world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to  render him any more vulnerable to them," he said.  </P> <P> Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day  O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justices William J. Brennan  and Thurgood Marshall joined Blackmun in dissent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taken to Hospital  </P> <P> A suit in Joshua's behalf was filed against the Winnebago County, Wis.,  Department of Social Services and two of its employees after Joshua was treated  at a hospital for head injuries that destroyed half his brain, leaving him  profoundly retarded and institutionalized for the rest of his life.  </P> <P> A social worker had visited the DeShaney home on March 7, 1984, a day before  the severe beating, and was told that several days earlier Joshua had fainted  in the bathroom for no apparent reason. But according to court records, the  social worker did not ask to see the boy.  </P> <P> The boy's father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to two to four  years in prison.  </P> <P> Today's Supreme Court ruling upheld a federal appeals court decision that threw  out the suit.  </P> <P> In another case decided today, the court ruled that states may not prohibit  political party leaders from endorsing primary election candidates. The  justices, by an 8-0 vote, struck down a California law as an impermissible  infringement of constitutionally protected freedom of speech. The court also  struck down as unconstitutional California laws limiting the term of office for  party leaders and dictating the makeup of state party central committees.  </P></p>

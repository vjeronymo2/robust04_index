			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae by senior </F> KBS reporter Yi Yong-il and KBS social affairs reporter Pak  Chan-uk at the KBS-1 Television studio in Seoul on the "News  Focus" program; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter Yi Yong-il] How are you, Mr. Minister.  I understand that you recently visited Japan, Russia, and  Germany and returned home last week. Will you explain the  results of your visit to these countries?    [Defense Minister Yi] As you mentioned, I visited Japan,  Russia, and Germany for 10 days from 25 April to 5 May. The  results of my visit can be summarized into the following three  points. First, my visit to Russia was the first occasion for an  ROK defense minister to visit Russia. As you know, the Russian  Federation is the successor to the former Soviet Union, and the  treaty for friendship and mutual assistance it concluded with  North Korea is still valid.    My talks with the Russian defense minister were ultimately  aimed at discussing measures for preventing North Korea's  erroneous judgment and for deterring its provocation. I am not  certain whether it is an appropriate hypothesis or not, but  suppose that the minister of the People's Armed Forces of North  Korea visits Washington and meets with U.S. Defense Secretary  Perry, and they reach an agreement on a certain issue and sign  an accord, I would certainly be uncomfortable. My talks with  the Russian defense minister to exchange views on issues  pertaining to security in Northeast Asia and the world were  primarily designed to seek agreement on measures to prevent  North Korean misjudgment and provocation.    Second, as you know, the most urgent issue at present is the  North Korean nuclear problem. Our stand toward this issue is  just. In other words, we maintain that North Korea must return  to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] system at an early  date for a solution to the problem. North Korea must also show  the transparency of its nuclear issue. For this, it should  allow complete inspections of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] and mutual inspections between North and South  Korea so that the transparency of the nuclear problem can be  displayed to the entire world.    Meeting with the defense ministers of these three countries,  I noticed that they shared the completely same view on this  issue. In particular, my Japanese counterpart stressed that the  North Korean nuclear problem is not only the problem of the ROK  but also that of his own country, and Germany also has a similar  view.    Third, my visit can be reviewed based on working-level  exchanges. Military exchanges can be categorized into two parts;  first is manpower exchange and second is material exchange. We  agreed to expand manpower exchanges. In other words, we agreed  that by giving opportunities to core members of each country's  Armed Forces to visit the other countries, we should encourage  them to have a good understanding of the development of the  military science and military theories of the other countries.  This can be described as part of the results of my visit.    I would like to emphasize to the people at this point that  the defense and security of the ROK assumes the ROK-U.S.  security system as its main axis. Therefore, my recent visits  to these countries do not mean an alienation [sooe] from or  neglect of security relations with the United States.    [Reporter Yi] Reporter Pak, as you know, North Korea  unilaterally informed the UN Forces that it will withdraw from  the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] in Panmunjom and will  withdraw the Polish mission from the Neutral Nations Supervisory  Commission. As a result, people suspect the true intention  hidden in its abrupt act. Will you tell us about how the recent  North Korean moves have been reported by the news media?    [Reporter Pak] Yes. Although it can be hardly described as a  strange act, North Korea has certainly shown abnormal acts one  after another from some time ago, thus straining the position of  our side. North Korea began to show such an act on 28 April. In  a Foreign Ministry statement that day, North Korea abruptly  proposed to the U.S. side that the present Armistice Agreement  be replaced with a peace agreement in order to prevent a war  from occurring on the Korean peninsula. Such an abrupt act by  North Korea continued on the next day, too.    Colonel Kim Hyon-ki, senior secretary of the North Korean  side of the MAC, proposed to Colonel Chilton of the U.S. Army,  senior secretary of the UN Forces side of the MAC, to meet him  as a representative of the U.S. Army, not as a representative of  the MAC.    Needless to say, the U.S. Army, in a reply message, stressed  that it refuses the North Korean side's proposal stressing that  the North Korean demand violates the Armistice Agreement.    Nevertheless, North Korea soon sent a unilateral message  that  it will withdraw from the MAC and that it will also withdraw the  Polish mission, a North Korean side member country of the  Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.    [Reporter Yi] Was it true, reporter Pak, that the North  Korean side deployed armed soldiers within Panmunjom?    [Reporter Pak] Yes, that is true. It was the afternoon of  that day. While shifting the guards in the joint security area  at Panmunjom, the North Korean side brought in this area about  40 soldiers who were armed with individual weapons including  rifles and helmets. The Armistice Agreement stipulates that  officers may carry out their mission by carrying a pistol but  soldiers are not permitted to arm themselves. According to the  UN Forces Command, this was the first time since the incident of  the brutal slaughter of American soldiers with axes took place  in 1976.    On the afternoon of 30 April, North Korea staged a special  air exercise. North Korea had about 20 fighter planes take off  that day and stage an exercise of attacking simulated enemy  planes. In addition, the North Korean planes flew toward the  South farther than during the regular exercise, and approached  the area 27 kilometers north of the armistice line, which is  designated by our Army as the last security boundary line, thus  making our Army tense.    Because of this situation, our home ministry requested each  broadcasting station, including KBS, to stand by for emergency  broadcast. As a result, a very strained situation was created,  just for a while.    [Reporter Yi] Mr. Minister, I believe that you have received  a series of reports on such moves by North Korea, as reporter  Pak explained. How do you observe these situations and how our  Army coped with them?    [Defense Minister Yi] I will add some explanation on the  background. The situation North Korea is facing today is, in a  nutshell, that North Korea is suffering three kinds of  hardships. These are, as we all know well, economic  difficulties, shortages of food and oil, and international  isolation. The communist and socialist forces who supported  North Korea in the past have all disappeared. Third, the  hardship of decision making. If North Korea is fully opened,  its present social system can hardly be maintained and if it  does not open itself, it will continuously suffer its present  economic difficulties. Thus, North Korea is faced with the pain  of making a decision. In order for North Korea to resolve these  triple hardships, it is using the nuclear card. In other words,  with this nuclear card, it is trying to evade international  isolation, to gain some economic assistance, and to maintain the  survival of its political system.    Each of these situations, pointed out by reporter Pak  earlier, are psychological tactics to be implemented by using  the nuclear card. What has appeared clearly in North Korea's  attempting to overcome such pains by using the nuclear card is  its intention to isolate the ROK. In other words, North Korea  is persistently trying to directly contact the United States and  isolate the ROK. Therefore, all the situations that took place  recently can be regarded as a move to isolate our ROK from  joining in the resolution of the problems. However, we need not  be embarrassed by such a psychological trick and strategy, if I  may define it as such.    As defense minister, I am thoroughly aware of what is  happening in North Korea, including the movement of troops,  material, and equipment, as well as the type of exercises and  other things. I regret that I cannot tell you all of them  because they are military secrets. All this comes to my  attention through the joint 24-hour intelligence surveillance  system between the ROK and the United States.    In conclusion, I would like to point out that although North  Korea is resorting to psychological tactics, it has no intention  to trigger systematic provocations. Even if North Korea embarks  on a systematic provocation, I will notice it immediately.    [Reporter Yi] What is the present status of the issue of  resuming the Team Spirit exercise?    [Defense Minister Yi] I will briefly explain first about the  nature of the Team Spirit exercise. It would be the 18th  holding of the exercise if this year's Team Spirit exercise was  held. This exercise is purely defensive with no offensive  nature. If a nation has an army, it should conduct training for  its army. It is quite natural.    However, with a view to joining the nation's great strategy  for a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem, we have  postponed four times under two conditions. During talks with  U.S. Defense Secretary Perry who visited our country last month,  we agreed to resume the Team Spirit exercise in November if  positive progress is not seen in resolving the North Korean  nuclear problem. There is no change in our position.    [Reporter Yi] Let us direct our attention, reporter Pak, to  the internal affairs of our Army. Accidental discharges of  weapons and other accidents occurred in succession recently in  the Army. What do you think the reason for this is?    [Reporter Pak] As you pointed out, various accidents,  including accidental discharges, have taken place in the Army  recently one after another. On 3 May, a college student  participating in reserve forces' training was killed by a bullet  fired from an M-16 rifle, and last Saturday, four days later,  three civilians were severely injured by the accidental firing  of a mortar shell in the mortar firing range. Besides, three  soldiers who were repairing an iron fence were killed by a mine  explosion. The problem is that none of these accidents were  clearly explained and revealed.    It is only 10 months ago that some 20 officers and men of  the  active and reserve forces were killed by the explosion of an  artillery shell at the artillery firing range in Yonchon,  Kyonggi Province. Another accident of an artillery shell  landing in the playground of a high school followed late last  year. Each time, the military authorities repeatedly stated  that they would do their utmost to prevent further accidents.  But their statements resulted only in the repetition of  accidents. In view of proper weapons management being the basic  safety principle in the Army, the recent accidents involving  weaponry arouse the people's concern with the possible  easy-going attitude of the Army.    [Reporter Yi] People are worried that such accidents may be  an outcome of relaxed military discipline. Needless to say, the  people trust and love the Army. However, viewing the accident  at the reserve forces training site, the people suspect that the  military might have attempted to conceal or not reveal the  complete truth about the accident. What is your plan to prevent  further accidents, including accidental discharges of weapons,  Mr. Minister?    [Defense Minister Yi] I, as defense minister, want to ask  the pardon of the people. At the same time, I express sincere  condolences to those who were victimized in the recent  accidents, as well as to their bereaved families.    I would like to point out at this point that the military  and police are conducting a joint investigation of the accident.  Based on the result of the investigation, I will thoroughly  call to account those responsible for the accident and will see  to it that appropriate follow-up actions are taken.    One thing for which I seek the people's understanding is  that  the Army is a group of young men who live together while  handling various dangerous equipment and materials. Statistics  from the accidents that have occurred over the past 10 years  show a noticeable reduction in overall accidents. I will see to  it that military discipline be further tightened among soldiers  and those concerned.    [Reporter Yi] I hope that the military will continually  enjoy  the people's love and trust. Thank you, Mr. Minister, for  joining us despite your busy schedule.</p>

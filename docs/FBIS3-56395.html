He can make  it through the rain" -- this figurative description coming from  a journalist gives you an extremely accurate idea of the U.S.  ambassador in Moscow: 62-year old Thomas Pickering is a  top-flight professional.    His involvement in Bill Clinton's talks with Boris Yeltsin  is  not only a case of paying tribute to the norms of protocol.  Pickering's prestige among the U.S. political elite is  exceptionally high. Despite having spent just over six months  in the Russian capital, the ambassador's view of what is  happening in our country carries weight in the White House and  is given consideration by Clinton.    The unanimity of views is impressive. Americans, Russians,  Israelis, and Arabs point to his brilliant analytical mind, good  memory, rapid responses, and ability to conduct a conversation.  "Pickering is a textbook diplomat," a U.S. correspondent in  Moscow believes.    His post in Russia is the seventh ambassadorial posting for  a  lawyer and historian with two university degrees. He first  heard himself addressed as "Mr. Ambassador" in 1974, when he was  appointed head of the U.S. mission in Jordan.    Since then he has been to Nigeria, El Salvador, and Israel,  led the U.S. mission to the United Nations, spent time in India,  and lastly Moscow. "Late in the evening of 1 August 1990 I was  attending a farewell dinner at the home of Britain's permanent  UN representative," Pickering said. "The report of the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait found me there. The Security Council worked  the whole night through and at 0600 hours adopted the first  resolution condemning Saddam Husayn." From that day on the  diplomat became a television star. Journalists literally did  not leave his side. The general opinion is that Pickering's  openness played a cruel trick on him -- Secretary of State James  Baker ultimately decided that his subordinate's popularity was  greater than his own. With the result that in 1992 Pickering  was dispatched to protect U.S. interests in Delhi.    His appointment to Moscow heralded a kind of triumphal  comeback for him. Fears whether Pickering, who had not  previously tackled Russia, would be able to rapidly bring  himself up to speed were dispelled. Smolensk Square does not  conceal its respect for the ambassador. "He is very active and  in just a few months has been able to set up such broad contacts  at the highest level that some people who have spent two or  three years in Moscow might envy him," an informed Russian  diplomat said during a private conversation.    The Foreign Ministry believes that, in tandem with Richard  Miles, the new minister-counselor (the number two man at the  embassy) and an expert on Russia, Pickering is capable of doing  a great deal to develop bilateral relations.    Of course, impeccable professionals do make blunders. It is  rumored that, in the morning of 13 December, total confusion  reigned at the traditional meeting of leading embassy staffers.  No one was prepared for the dramatic Russian election result.    It is a desire to avoid these kinds of surprises in the  future, rather than hypothetical disappointment with Yeltsin and  Gaydar, that accounts for the Americans' desire to expand  contacts with various political forces. Pickering carefully  avoids answering questions like "Will you invite Zhirinovskiy  for cocktails?", although he does not conceal the fact that his  subordinates have had contacts with "liberal-democrat"  representatives. [Communist Party of the Russian Federation  leader] Gennadiy Zyuganov was one of the guests at a reception  in Vice President Gore's honor.    "Less shock, more therapy" -- since the 12 December  elections this phrase, highlighting Washington's renewed  approach to offering Russia financial and technical aid, has  become a stock phrase. Pickering confirms that the money  granted to our country will be used to create social support and  professional retraining centers designed to ease the impact of  future unemployment. Conversion, the reconfiguration of  enterprises, and the creation of new jobs all figure in the  programs funded by the West and the United States directly.  "The attention given to the social aspect of reforms does not  mean that we can forget to combat inflation," the ambassador  remarked. "It is necessary to rid ourselves of this evil for  other than economic reasons. Historical experience reminds us  that the development of hyperinflation jeopardizes the existence  of democracy."    Pickering is actively learning Russian (his sixth foreign  language after French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, and Swahili) and  traveling a great deal -- in just over seven months he has  managed to visit St. Petersburg, Tula, Nizhniy Novgorod,  Ulan-Ude, Irkutsk, and the Far East. On weekends the ambassador  and his wife go out of town -- they are very interested in  Russian estate and church architecture.    The ambassador loves Baroque music (particularly Bach),  collects books on military history and biographies of famous  people, and loves reading thrillers, particularly spy novels.    "Some day Thomas Pickering will undoubtedly be deputy  secretary of state," a U.S. journalist friend said when he  learned that Clinton had appointed his personal friend and  Russian specialist Strobe Talbott to this post at a reception in  the vice president's honor. "Admittedly, he will most likely  never get the post of head of the Department of State -- that is  generally given to political appointees."</p>

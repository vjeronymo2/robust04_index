			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun (TASS) -- Qian Qichen called the  agreement on the visit by China's chairman Jiang Zemin to the  Russian Federation which will begin on 2 September as the main  achievement of his meetings and talks in Moscow. He stated this  at the press conference held at the Foreign Ministry press  center at the Zubovskaya square.    He especially mentioned the initialling of the agreement on  the western section of the Chinese-Russian border. According to  the Chinese foreign minister, in the past few years bilateral  relations and especially business links have developed  considerably, "they far exceeded former Chinese-Soviet ties."    Answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question on China's  policy towards the Central Asian countries, former USSR  republics, Qian Qichen said that since these countries achieved  their independence their contacts with China, previously of  indirect nature, have now become direct. Especially good  relations are being established in the sphere of trade. "We  would like to continue to strengthen our relations with these  countries, at the same time hoping that their ties within the  CIS framework and with the Russian Federation will also continue  to develop," said the Chinese minister.    Speaking of Russia's accession to the Partnership for Peace  treaty, Qian Qichen noted that the Russian Federation, which is  a major European state, maintains extensive links with its  neighbors in Europe, especially after the ending of  confrontation between the two military blocs. "We regard with  understanding the fact that Russia maintains relations of  partnership with the countries of Europe. We hope that such  relations will promote the strengthening of peace and stability  in the region and also throughout the world. We believe that  these relations will not in any way harm the development of  links between Russia and China."    Qian Qichen said that he had not discussed questions of  selling Russian weapons to China today. This subject, he said,  will not be raised during Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to  Moscow, either.    Speaking about the situation around the Spratly (Nanwei)  islands, which are claimed by several southeast Asian countries  as well as by China, Qian Qichen expressed the opinion that at  the present stage discussions should be halted an a start should  be made to the joint exploitation of this region.    Speaking of nuclear problems, the minister stressed that  China is a party to the treaty on the nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons and is strictly guided by its provisions. The  PRC, he stressed, is in favor of advancing the talks on  concluding a convention on the total banning of nuclear weapons  and intends to promote the signing of this treaty before 1996.  As far as nuclear tests are concerned, China is in favor of the  total elimination and complete banning of nuclear weapons tests.</p>

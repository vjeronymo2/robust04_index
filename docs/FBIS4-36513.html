			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>   [Text] Damascus today strongly criticized the Jordanian  paper AL-RA'Y, which in recent articles has called on the  Jordanian Government to conclude an agreement with Israel as  soon as possible to make sure Jordan is not isolated and its  role is not marginalized, especially since Arab coordination  among the frontline states does not exist, as the paper put it.    In its editorial today, the government newspaper, TISHRIN,  said that these opinions are preparing the way for the peddling  of a really bad plan. The paper added that such a plan would  isolate Jordan from the Arab world and tamper with its national  unity. These calls are made by hired writers to inject Zionist  poison into Arab awareness with the objective of pushing it  toward capitulation.    The official Syrian newspaper refuted the opinions of the  writer of the article, who said that Syria has abandoned Jordan,  that it is only considering a separate solution, and that an  agreement between Syria and Israel is imminent. The paper said  that these statements are prematurely seeking to distort the  essence of the Syrian position. This is because Syria has never  called for throwing oneself into Israel's arms, and has always  announced its commitment to the principle of a comprehensive  solution and the need for the implementation of Resolutions 242,  338, and 425, and for Israel's withdrawal to the pre-4 June 1967  border in return for comprehensive peace.    The paper wondered: What progress has been achieved to make  the Jordanian writer call for expediting the signing of a  separate agreement with Israel before it is too late? The  negotiations with Israel are still moving in a vicious circle.  The U.S. secretary of state has admitted this and said that the  gap is too deep between the two stands. Even Rabin said that  matters on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are at a stalemate.    TISHRIN said: Arab coordination does exist, and Syria was  the first to insist on coordination among the Arab parties.  Even Jordanian officials have recently spoken, following King  Husayn's visit to Damascus, about the importance of coordination  and integration with Syria. This means that the writer of the  articles considers the statements of Jordanian officials on  their adherence to the principle of a comprehensive solution and  coordination with the Arab parties mere maneuvering for local  audiences for the time being.</p>

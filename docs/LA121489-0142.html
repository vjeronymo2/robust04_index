			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> CRIME INITIATIVE QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> An anti-crime initiative that sparked debate over whether it threatens the  right to abortion was certified in Sacramento for the June statewide ballot.  Secretary of State March Fong Eu said the proposed crime victims justice reform  act got 665,162 valid signatures, almost 70,000 more than needed. The  initiative, backed by Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), is opposed by Atty. Gen.  John K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat and possible rival of Wilson in the 1990  gubernatorial race. Van de Kamp says a provision removing the right-to-privacy  guarantee could be used to repeal legal protection for abortions. Wilson  disagrees.  </P></p>

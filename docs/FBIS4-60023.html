			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, May 20 (AFP)--The Palestinian Fatah  movement--the main component of the PLO--has swapped its  revolutionary rhetoric for words more suited to climate of peace.    Two weeks after the Cairo accords on Palestinian autonomy in  the Gaza Strip and Jericho, the traditional references to  "struggle in all its forms" were replaced Thursday [19 May] by  an appeal for "effort and perseverance in the building of the  homeland".    A communique issued here by the Fatah revolutionary council  also made history by using the name "Israel" for the first time  instead of its usual "Zionist enemy".    The Fatah ruling body said that in future it would fight on  a  "cultural and economic" level. "That will be the real test  between us and Israel," it said.    Fatah renewed its call for "unity" in Palestinian ranks and  in support of "Arab brethren" during the shift from armed  warfare to "realisation on the ground".    The estimated 100 members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council  endorsed the accords signed in Cairo on May 4 and set up some 15  ad-hoc committees to assist the Palestinian authority in the  autonomous territories, informed sources said.    Fatah holds most of the seats in the 24-member autonomous  "government", 18 of whose members are already known.    The Fatah committees will be responsible for transferring  350  Palestine Liberation Organisation cadres starting next week.    Their other tasks will include assisting the Palestinian  authority in its future negotiations with Israel and preparing  elections to the autonomous council next autumn, the sources  said.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS pays part of standing debt for New Zealand goods THE COMMONWEALTH of Independent States yesterday paid NZDollars 10m (Pounds 3.1m) of its outstanding debts from an estimated Dollars NZ600m which it owes New Zealand for dairy, wool and related products that were sent to the then Soviet Union up to 15 months ago. Currency difficulties, which made it impossible for the CIS to settle these debts, have led to commercial strains between the two countries, and a virtual cessation of trade. The Soviet Union was formerly one of New Zealand's major customers for wool, sheepmeats and dairy products. Yesterday the retiring CIS ambassador to Wellington, Mr Yuri Sokolov, said that the payment was a breakthrough and a sign of good faith. The money had been owed to the New Zealand Dairy Board, which 12 months ago arranged credit of NZDollars 200m for staggered shipments of 100,000 tonnes of butter and 8,000 tonnes of whole milk powder. Mr Sokolov said the initial payment came one day after a group of leading industrial nations agreed to give the CIS a line of credit worth NZDollars 44bn. The former Soviet Union also owes substantial sums for wool shipped between February and July last year. That was arranged under a credit facility arranged between the ANZ Bank and wool merchants. Sovenz, the trading arm of the New Zealand Dairy Board, is also owed money. Russia plans to import 4m tonnes of refined sugar in 1992, 'to prevent a crisis' and maintain per capita consumption at 40 to 45 kg a year, according to a government document released at the Congress of Peoples' Deputies, reports Reuter from Moscow. The document said 1992 output of refined sugar from beet was expected to be 2.5m tonnes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 17 February (MTI) -- Hungary's Government  has decided NATO's AWACS surveillance aircraft may not stay in  Hungarian airspace during any air strikes on Bosnian Serb  positions, Andras Kelemen, state secretary of foreign affairs,  told reporters today.    The government has asked Parliament's Defense and Foreign  Affairs Committees to discuss this position. Prime Minister  Peter Boross will inform NATO Secretary-General Manfred Worner  on the committees' conclusions immediately, the state secretary  said.    The Hungarian Government agrees that the bloodshed in Bosnia  should be brought to an end, if required, even by resolute  military action. In the absence of a NATO guarantee, however,  Hungary cannot take part in such an act. In view of the 400,000  ethnic Hungarians living in Vojvodina and other parts of Serbia,  Hungary would like to avoid even the suspicion of a connection  with any military action.    Under the Hungarian Constitution, participation in a  military  action requires parliamentary approval. Since the government  has not asked for such approval, the idea that someone use  Hungarian airspace for an air strike in Bosnia cannot be raised  in the framework of constitutional order, Kelemen said.    The AWACS aircraft patrolling in Hungary are monitoring the  fronts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina but are not authorized  to provide logistical support for any air strike, Prime Minister  Boross told NATO Headquarters last week. He indicated that  modifying the mandate of AWACS fell within the scope of the  Hungarian Parliament.    "NATO has not asked us to allow AWACS aircraft to control an  air strike on Bosnian Serb positions. Nor will the government  ask Parliament to extend the AWACS patrols' mandate," Kelemen  said.    The state secretary added that a Hungarian role in a  possible  NATO air strike in Bosnia could trigger anti-Hungarian hysteria  in both Serbia and the "Krajinas" under Serbian control.    Hungary's charge d'affaires in Belgrade has duly informed  the  Yugoslav Foreign Ministry on the Hungarian Government's  position. On Monday [14 February] the Hungarian Foreign Ministry  informed Yugoslavia's charge d'affaires in Budapest.    Kelemen said the Hungarian Foreign Ministry did not plan to  recall the families of Hungarian diplomats accredited to Serbia  and Montenegro. The Belgrade Embassy, he said, has not reported  that any Hungarian citizen would be in danger.    In reply to a question, the state secretary said that the  Hungarian position on the AWACS planes did not influence the  peace partnership established between Hungary and NATO last week.</p>

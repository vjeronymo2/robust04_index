			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government and traditional rulers drawn  from all over the country have today been meeting in Abuja. The  head of state, General Sani Abacha, is presiding over the  meeting. State House correspondent Oji Ogbonaya Oji was at the  opening session:    [Begin recording] [Oji] In his remarks, Gen. Abacha said  that  the meeting was a followup to the recently concluded nationwide  tour by the chief of general staff to brief community and  opinion leaders on a wide range of issues of national  importance. The arrangement, the head of state explained, was  borne out of his administration's regard for consultation and  dialogue as an instrument for the crisis resolution:    [Abacha] We invite you as our fathers to join the patriotic  effort, to resist the tempting design of those who seek to bring  us back to those uncertain times. No amount of incitement  should provoke Nigerians to pitch us up against each other  again. If the experience of our 30-month old war is not enough  to deter us, the devastation of society in Liberia, Somalia,  Rwanda, and Yugoslavia should restrain our action in the  pursuance of whatever causes.    [Oji] Gen. Abacha described the constitutional conference as  central to the administration's program of disengagement from  politics. He said that the administration has encountered and  (?promoted) all sorts of criticism but welcomed the ideas of all  those who have criticized objectively. The head of state,  however, warned that some self-seeking individuals had embarked  on dangerous and desperate adventures without any regard to the  consequences of their action:    [Abacha] The Constitution calls for [words indistinct] to  help serve the cause of democracy with a clear [words  indistinct]. A true democrat is someone who abides by the rules  of civilized behavior, the rules which call for dialogue and  consensus. Our desire to follow this cautious resolve should  not be mistaken for weakness. The evidence is there for  everyone to see that the current spate of senseless bravado  [word indistinct] unbridled attack and smear campaign in the  entire history of the nation. Democracy is built on the rule of  law and [word indistinct] sociopolitical order. It should be  made abundantly clear that the use of organized violence and  aimless confrontation as choice for achieving democracy as  become outmoded. Diplomacy and dialogue have taken their place.    [Oji] Gen. Abacha stated that the use of organized violence  and confrontation to achieve democracy was counterproductive.  He said his administration cannot be blackmailed out of office  and urged all Nigerians to give the transition program a chance  to succeed.    The meeting is being attended by prominent traditional  rulers  from various parts of the country including the Sultan of  Sokoto, Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki; the Alafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidu  Adeyemi; the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Opala Okagbue; the Shehu of  Bornu, Alhaji Mustapha El-Kanemi; the Olu of Oyo, Abase Jalo II;  and Eze Akanu Ibiam from Abia State.

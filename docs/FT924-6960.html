			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / France and Taiwan cement Dollars 2.6bn jet fighter deal TAIWAN has obtained a long-awaited agreement from France to buy 60 Mirage 2000-5 multi-role jet fighter aircraft for Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn), according to newspaper and radio reports from Taipei. Neither the Paris government nor Dassault, the French aerospace group which makes the Mirage fighter, would comment on the deal, the latest stage in the island's attempts to boost defences against a military build-up in China and as such likely to spark a diplomatic row between Beijing and Paris. But they did not deny the report. It comes two months after a US decision to sell up to 150 F-16 jet fighters to Taiwan for Dollars 5.8bn, seen as a factor in resolving French hesitation. If confirmed, this will be the second big recent French defence sale to Taiwan, after last year's Dollars 4.8bn sale of 16 frigates, never officially announced. The Mirage sale would also include 1,500 missiles, bringing the total contract value to Dollars 3.8bn, said Taiwanese press reports. China has objected strongly, causing Paris to pause before jeopardising already strained relations with a powerful ally. The Beijing Foreign Ministry yesterday warned that China was 'firmly against' such a project. However, China took no significant steps against France over the frigate sale, beyond voicing loud objections, and has countenanced recent defence equipment sales to Taiwan from Germany, Belgium and Italy. France is China's second largest aid donor after Japan, with FFr30bn (Pounds 3.7bn) of credits and cheap loans outstanding.</p>

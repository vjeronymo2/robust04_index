			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Belgian sports goods group in liquidation DONNAY Industrie, the Belgian sporting goods group, yesterday went into liquidation after struggling for months to stem its losses and to solve its financial problems. The company, which is best known for its tennis racquets and its sponsorship contract with Mr Andre Agassi, the US tennis star, has a troubled financial history. Donnay went out of business in 1988, only to be rescued from the receivers by Bernard Tapie Finance, the holding company controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French industrialist then making his name in financial circles by buying up bankrupt businesses. Mr Tapie later extended his sporting goods interests by buying Adidas, the German company. Donnay was restructured under Mr Tapie's ownership. He sold its industrial interests in 1991 to Carbon Valley of Italy, and then sold the rest of the company in the same year as part of his divestment programme. The Donnay trademark is owned by the Walloon regional government. Despite rationalisation and reorganisation, Donnay has remained in the red in an intensely competitive international market.</p>

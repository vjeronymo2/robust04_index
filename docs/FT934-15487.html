			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Testing three months for Salinas: Mexico is nervous over Nafta JUST over a year before he has to give up office, President Carlos Salinas of Mexico faces perhaps the most critical three months of his six-year presidency. The fate of his grand project to tie Mexico's economy to that of the US through the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is to be decided by the US Congress before the end of the year; he has to choose the man who will in all probability succeed him; and he must revive an economy that ground to a halt in the middle of this year. Nervousness in Mexico's government and business community is palpable. If the treaty is rejected, economic revival could be threatened and legitimate victory for Mr Salinas's candidate in next August's election less certain. Mr Salinas himself has raised the spectre of a backlash against the US, and reversal of the improvement in Mexico-US relations. Mr Salinas's nightmare - that his presidency will be clouded by a final year of economic and political disarray - looks unlikely to materialise, but it is still a possibility. The president says Nafta is important to Mexico, but denies he has overemphasised the treaty or that the country's economic future is over-dependent on it. In an interview at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, Mr Salinas said Nafta 'will provide us with the opportunity to grow at a higher rate. You must understand that having 85m people in Mexico and adding almost 2m a year to the population makes economic growth not a goal but a necessity'. However, Nafta 'was not the only thing' going on in Mexico. The president emphasised his government's economic and electoral reforms, advances in the educational and health systems, and improved trade relations with many parts of the world, which would continue whether Nafta was approved or not. Even many of Mr Salinas' critics agree that his reforms have placed the country's economy on its soundest footing for decades. Inflation is down to single figures as the government has eschewed deficit financing. The imminent independence of the central bank should heighten the chances that this will continue. International reserves are at record levels, reducing the chances of a currency crisis if Nafta fails. After several years of fiscal and monetary austerity, the government is finally pushing more money into the economy to spur growth: under the annual pact agreed this month with business and labour unions, the budget will move from surplus this year to balance next, and the minimum wage will be increased by more than 15 per cent. However, officials are adamant that they will not push for growth at any cost, and if Nafta is rejected they will not devalue to try to kick start the economy. 'For us, zero growth and no devaluation is better than 3 per cent growth at the cost of a devaluation,' said a senior government aide. The government was prepared to accept higher interest rates that would almost inevitably follow a collapse of the trade treaty. This attitude may be reinforced by the perception among senior officials that, despite low growth this year, the government and its policies remain relatively popular. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) won a landslide victory in the July gubernatorial elections in the State of Mexico  -which it lost to the leftish alliance of Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the 1988 presidential election. Mr Cardenas will again provide the main opposition to the PRI in August's presidential election and - while he has toned down his own anti-US rhetoric  -could be expected to make political capital out of a failed treaty and slow growth. The collapse of Nafta might therefore make the campaign closer than it would otherwise be. It is not yet clear who will be the PRI's candidate. The current front-runner is Mr Lus Donaldo Colosio, the social development minister. His critics argue that his views are a mystery and his intellect untested, but Mr Colosio is popular in the ruling party and close to the president, and has built important alliances within the government, including with Mr Salinas's powerful aide, Mr Jose Cordoba. However, in the past, front-runners have ended up losing and although outsiders cannot be ruled out, Mr Manuel Camacho, the mayor of Mexico City, is the second favourite and Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, the third. Mr Aspe's weakness is seen as his aristocratic demeanour and even his supporters say he would make a better president than candidate. Mr Camacho is suspected of populist instincts and would probably very soon have to establish an alliance with someone with good economic credentials such as Mr Aspe. The most striking thing though is not the differences between the men but their similarities - all are US-educated males in their 40s, who worked under Mr Salinas in the 1980s when the president was budget minister. Moreover, the alliances among senior politicians are such that whoever wins, the shape of the next cabinet is likely to be similar to the current one. The choice of candidate is likely to be Mr Salinas's and only ostensibly the party's. The next president, Mr Salinas said, 'has to be a person who has very high political skills and very solid technical formation. In the world of today no head of state can neglect the importance of understanding the economic forces working within society and certainly in international relations.' He also underlined his view that if the US Congress has not passed the Nafta treaty by January, he will regard it as dead, and that no renegotiation would be possible. In saying this, the president is clearly hoping to sway US congressmen who say they favour some kind of free trade agreement with Mexico, but not the one currently under consideration. If the accord does fall, there will undoubtedly be ramifications: relations with the US will be hurt, interest rates will be higher and economic growth possibly slower than otherwise. One minister also worried out loud: 'A lot of people in the bureaucracy are opposed to Nafta and I'm concerned that they will use the defeat of Nafta to hurt its supporters.' While this suggests the near-term outlook for Mexico would be difficult, it does not portend a catastrophe.</p>

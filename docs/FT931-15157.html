			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Electric shocks Dixons must wonder when its American nightmare will end. The Dollars 320m (Pounds 210m) purchase of the US Silo chain in 1987 has proved a terrible folie de grandeur. Even the company has now given up pretending it has the answer. It is closing some stores in middle America, tinkering with new retailing ideas and replacing the US management, but it will be at least a year before Dixons itself knows whether it has a business worth resuscitating. Meanwhile, there are alarming signs that the company's touch has not improved. Silo is moving into the highly competitive home office equipment market where margins are slim. It also intends to confront the likes of Circuit City head on in the big cities, when it is at least arguable that it has a better chance of making money in the backwoods. Besides, there is also an uncomfortable sense that Dixons would close the whole operation if only it could afford it. Unfortunately that would cut fixed assets by almost half, severely straining the balance sheet. The alternative is at least a five-year haul, with endless management time being wasted, the majority of shops being moved and more money being poured into new fittings. The drag on the shares caused by the US fiasco can only be made worse by the worry that Silo's losses may increase. At least Dixons has its UK business to keep it warm, but even the expected rebound in earnings as the economy recovers may not be as sustainable as it looks. Dixons earns substantial profits from highly optional warranty premiums, and import price increases may well deter buyers, however hard the industry tries to bamboozle customers with changing model specifications.</p>

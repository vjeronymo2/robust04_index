			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul on 19 April,  the puppet Navy Operational Command staged a so-called joint  chemical, biological, and radiological exercise with the 23d  Chemical Battalion of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces. In  this war exercise, which was aimed at waging a port blockade in  Chinhae District, the racals clamored about a perfect posture,  improvement of the capability of technique and tactics for an  actual war, and the like, thus, inspiring war fever.    That the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet  clique  which are frantically running wild in arms buildup for a  northward invasion are constantly waging a new military  commotion proves that the rascals are further driving the  situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The Japanese Self-Defense  Forces (SDF) is boosting support of a night-landing practice  (NLP) by U.S. military aircraft at Iwo Island, popularly known  as Iwojima, about 1,300 kilometers south of Tokyo.    It was the first time the SDF backed the solo exercise by  planes from the U.S. aircraft carrier Independence. Previously  the SDF had cooperated with the U.S. Forces as part of a joint  military drill.    The U.S. Forces previously conducted NLP at Atsugi Naval Air  Station in Kanagawa Prefecture. But Japan and the United States  agreed to move the landings to Iwojima starting last year due to  complaints of noise from residents around Atsugi.    This year's practice is one of the largest, with 25 deck  planes and some 400 pilots participating.    In cooperation, the Air Self-Defense Force has dispatched 10  transport planes to carry U.S. ground crew officials and  materials, while the Maritime Self-Defense Force offered 20  officials to back up air control and ground support and a rescue  plane in case of an accident.    Japan has also spent some 17 billion yen to construct  lodging  and hangars for the U.S. forces in Iwojima. The U.S. is  expected to spend about 33 million yen for NLP this year,  according to official sources.    Speculation is that the SDF support is to pave the way for  concluding the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA)  with the U.S., in which the two forces provide each other with  materials.    Conclusion of the ACSA suddenly became an issue due to  concerns that North Korea may be building nuclear weapons.    The Defense Agency said the SDF Law and Japan-U.S. Security  Treaty permit Japan's support of U.S. night-landing practices  at Iwojima.</p>

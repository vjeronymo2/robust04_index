			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The formation of the transitional government in  Liberia is now long over and is in danger of becoming unstuck  altogether as a split in the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement  for Democracy in Liberia] widens. There have been reports of  fighting around ULIMO's headquarters in Tubmanburg between  Mandingos backing Koromah and the Krahns supporting Johnson. We  received reports yesterday that Charles Taylor's NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia] was also involved in the battle of  Tubmanburg in support of Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn wing of  ULIMO, something Charles Taylor himself has strongly denied.  Over there the UN called us up to give us their version of  events. On the line to Monrovia, Audrey Brown asked General  Daniel Opande, chief UN observer in Liberia, whether he could,  in fact, confirm that NPFL forces had been involved in the  fighting around Tubmanburg.    [Begin recording] [Opande] We have no evidence of NPFL  having  gotten themselves involved in helping a faction of ULIMO to  fight another faction. That I can confirm.    [Brown] But are you stating this categorically or are you  saying that you don't have any information of this?    [Opande] Well, the reason why I am saying categorically is  because, if it is the fighting that is going on in Tubmanburg,  we are deployed in Tubmanburg and we have a clearer picture of  what is happening around there and the information we have  through our own investigations confirm that there are no other  factions from outside that organization who are involved in the  fighting.    [Brown] So, is the fighting still going on now?    [Opande] No, Tubmanburg is very, very quite, you know,  today. There was a fighting yesterday, you know, in fact, in the  night until a little earlier in the morning. It died down and  it has remained completely quiet. Life is returning back to  normal and today is even much quieter.    [Brown] How many people were killed or injured in this  fighting? Was it very serious?    [Opande] Well, from the information we have there may have  been people injured, there could have been people killed, but we  have no evidence of how many were injured and how many were, you  know, killed. We don't have any firm information yet.    [Brown] Are you not involved in treating people who are  injured and clearing away people who have been killed?    [Opande] When people are injured sometimes they report to  our compound and ask for help. Yesterday none turned up. Our  headquarters is very close to the only hospital which is in  Tubmanburg. We have gone into the hospital and we have seen no  new people who have been injured or any deaths reported there.    [Brown] So, what are you doing to prevent more flare up and  more fighting amongst ULIMO factions?    [Opande] We have been in touch with ULIMO leadership -- both  political and military leadership. We are in touch with them  nearly every day and we are trying to encourage reconciliation  so that there is no more fighting either within themselves or  fighting between one faction and another.    [Brown] We have information that the Liberia Peace Council  [LPC], which is another armed faction in Liberia, has overrun  Zwedru in Grand Gedeh County. Have you information of this?    [Opande] We have had this information for quite some time  now that there is activity between LPC and NPFL around Zwedru.  They've been fighting for the control over that particular town  and fighting is going on around that area but we have no  confirmation that Zwedru has been taken over by LPC. Our  information is that there is fighting going on around, you know,  that town between NPFL and LPC.    [Brown] It does seem that there is altogether too much  fighting going on in Liberia where you are supposed to be  disarming people. Does this worry you that there is so much  fighting still carrying on?    [Opande] Definitely, any fighting that is taking place at  this time worries us a lot and we have been working right around  the clock talking to all the factions and trying to see to it  that the fighting is brought to an end.    [Brown] They don't appear to be listening to you, is it  frustrating thus?    [Opande] It is very frustrating but we hope that they will  come to their senses and they will stop this unnecessary  fighting at this stage. [end recording]</p>

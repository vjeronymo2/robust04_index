			<p>BFN     [Text] Today Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev received  Max van der Stoel, high commissioner of CSCE for affairs of  national minorities, who is currently visiting Almaty in  connection with the seminar on human measurement. An open  exchange of opinions on a wide range of problems of mutual  interest took place. During the conversation Nazarbayev said  that the Republic ascribes major importance to the activity of  the CSCE and is ready for all-around cooperation with such a  prestigious international forum, first of all in the  humanitarian sphere. Nazarbayev positively assessed the growing  attention of the heads of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in europe to the region of Central Asia. In his  opinion, a CSCE seminar in Almaty very convincingly testifies to  this fact. The seminar will undoubtedly become one more step on  the way to developing a constructive dialogue between the  countries of the vast European region with regard to all  problems of security and cooperation. As far as demographic  changes are concerned, said the president, they have occured in  Kazakhstan during the years of Soviet power as a consequence of  forced collectivization, industrialization, and development of  virgin and fallow lands. From the former USSR's European region  only, over 2 million people have moved here to Kazakhstan. But  nobody in our country divides people into our own and strangers.  Every Kazakhstani has equal rights and opportunities and can be  sure of his tomorrow.    Van der Stoel, in his turn, highly assessed the policy  pursued by Kazakhstan with regard to interethnic relations and  voiced his support for the president's stance with regard to  legal status of his citizens. At the same time the high  commissioner expressed his wish to familiarize himself in full  detail with the experience accumulated in the Republic as far as  creation of the interethnic accord and stability atmosphere is  concerned. First of all, Max van der Stoel was interested in  the outcome of the election and correction of the violations  noted by the CSCE observers during the election.    Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed his known stance on the  matter. He said legal assessment to all deviations from the law  will be given by the court. The court namely is working on it.  In particular, with regard to cases noted in three  constituencies, the court is examining the matter now.    Vice President Yerik Asanbayev, Deputy Prime Minister  Tolegen  Zhukeyev, and Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev also  participated in the meeting.</p>

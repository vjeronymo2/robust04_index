			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Owen gloomy over Bosnia: Region heading for a 'humanitarian disaster', says mediator LORD OWEN, the European Community's mediator on the former Yugoslavia, yesterday said no initiative could avert a disaster in the region this winter unless it embraced a peace settlement, and he saw no early prospect for a resumption of peace talks. 'All three sides have made the decision to go on fighting,' Lord Owen told a news conference in Geneva. 'We are heading for a very nasty humanitarian disaster this winter and the question is not if, but when,' he said. Meanwhile, a defiant Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, yesterday ruled out participation in a new peace conference on former Yugoslavia while Serbia remains under UN sanctions. The United Nations 17 months ago imposed trade sanctions, including an oil embargo, on Serbia for its role in the violent carve-up of Bosnia. In an interview published yesterday in Belgrade newspapers, Mr Milosevic vowed not to 'forgo our national and state policies because of international pressures and sanctions.' But Lord Owen told a news conference in Geneva that without a negotiated peace settlement the war would continue and so would interference with food and fuel supplies destined for the civilian population. 'If there is no settlement, many thousands will lose their lives this winter,' he said. The EC envoy expressed particular regret that President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia had publicly revealed the existence of secret talks in Norway this week between the Zagreb government and rebel Serbs, calling the timing 'unfortunate'. Mr Geert Ahrens, who represented Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations mediator, at the talks, said yesterday that no further meeting was planned after the breakdown of the talks on Wednesday. Lord Owen, meanwhile, described as 'nonsense' the 'no peace, no war' scenario some have painted for Bosnia. There might be 'some dulling of the war' during the winter, but all three sides had a strategic interest in preventing power and other supplies from aiding the others to rebuild military strength. In September, the Bosnian government side rejected a peace plan based on a three-way ethnic division of the country. But Lord Owen said it almost baffled belief that so many lives could be put at risk over 'a very small' percentage of land, which would raise the Moslem share from about 30 to 34 per cent. Bosnian Moslem troops yesterday marched into Vares, central Bosnia, consolidating their hold over the region. Soldiers planted a green flag with Arabic lettering in the main square of Vares after Bosnian Croat forces abandoned the town, said eyewitnesses.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar exploits D-Mark woes A STRONG dollar dominated active foreign exchange market trading yesterday after a combination of favourable US economic news and higher crude oil prices pushed it upwards through an important chart point of DM1.6250. In London, the US currency advanced 2.55 pfennigs against a generally weaker D-Mark to close at DM1.6345, while sterling dropped 2.7 cents to Dollars 1.8010. In New York, the dollar ended at DM1.6370 and the pound at Dollars 1.7948. The German unit also lost ground to the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, and weakened against the Portuguese escudo in the European exchange rate mechanism in spite of repeated sales of escudos by the Bank of Portugal at 82.91 and 82.9 escudos to the D-Mark. The dollar's rise was fuelled by strong buying on a growing belief that the US economy is returning to reasonable growth. This perception has been underpinned by bullish economic data, including news of a stronger than expected rise in consumer confidence on Tuesday, favourable 10-day US car sales figures, and improved retail sales and industrial production. These factors encouraged expectations of an upward revision of first quarter gross domestic product data being reported tomorrow. News yesterday of a strong 1.4 per cent April rise in US durable goods orders initially helped sentiment, even though closer inspection of the figures revealed a very large defence component. The potentially inflationary implications of higher oil prices also worked in the dollar's favour as analysts reasoned that a further easing by the US Federal Reserve was highly unlikely in the near term. The dollar's penetration of the DM1.6250 chart level prompted covering of short positions and encouraged some market operators to anticipate an early assault on the next chart point of DM1.6450. The D-Mark was beset by other woes. It lost ground to the French franc following news that France's seasonally adjusted trade surplus jumped to a record FFr7.79bn in April from FFr1.06bn the month before. It weakened against the Swiss franc after Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss National Bank president, said he wanted to see the Swiss currency stronger to combat inflation. The yen rose against the D-Mark in a continuing technical reversal of the latter's recent strength against the Japanese currency. The Bank of Portugal intervened for the third straight day in D-Marks to stop the escudo bursting through its upper fluctuation limit in the ERM against the Danish krone, the weakest currency in the European Monetary System. The pound was a minor beneficiary of the D-Mark's weakness. Although it fell sharply against the dollar, it finished  1/4 pfennig higher in London at DM2.9450 -  1/2 pfennig short of its central rate in the ERM.</p>

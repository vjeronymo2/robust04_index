			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTRASQUAD GAME CAN'T SHOWCASE TWO OF UCLA'S RECRUITS;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: INJURIES HAVE SIDELINED O'BANNON, ZIMMERMAN. TARVER HAS 16 POINTS.  </P> <P> UCLA's annual intrasquad basketball game usually gives fans their first chance  to see the Bruins' new players in action.  </P> <P> Thursday night, a crowd of 4,788 in Pauley Pavilion watched two-thirds of  UCLA's highly regarded recruiting class sit on the bench, Ed O'Bannon nursing  his injured left knee, Rodney Zimmerman his injured right knee. The other top  recruit, guard Shon Tarver, had 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the  Blue team, which lost, 106-98, to the White.  </P> <P> O'Bannon is out for the season.  </P> <P> The Bruins aren't sure about Zimmerman, a 6-foot-9 center from Air Academy High  in Colorado Springs, Colo.  </P> <P> Zimmerman's knee locked on him twice last month, initially during a drill on  the first day of practice Oct. 15. He is scheduled to undergo arthroscopic  surgery today at the UCLA Medical Center.  </P> <P> The Bruins are hopeful that Zimmerman's injury is minor and that he will be  able to return in time for their opener against UC Irvine Nov. 23 in the first  round of the Great Alaska Shootout.  </P> <P> It is feared by some close to the team, however, that Zimmerman's injury might  be serious enough to keep him out for the season.  </P> <P> Coach Jim Harrick said that today's procedure, which will be performed by Dr.  Gerald Finerman, will be exploratory in nature.  </P> <P> "He just wants to see what's bothering the kid," Harrick said. "He anticipates  there may be something torn."  </P> <P> Even if no tear is found, Harrick said, Zimmerman will be given two weeks off.  He has acute tendinitis in his knee.  </P> <P> "It's been a bad month," Harrick said.  </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> Forward Don MacLean had 39 points and 11 rebounds to lead the White team.  Forward Tracy Murray led the Blue with 38 points and nine rebounds. . . . Guard  Mitchell Butler scored 30 points for the White. . . Coach Jim Harrick will not  use a high-post offense for the first time in his career. He has switched to a  1-2-2 alignment. "I felt we had an abundance of wing players, rather than post  players," Harrick said. "It just fits our personnel a little better."  </P> <P> Even if Rodney Zimmerman is out of the lineup for an extended period, 7-foot-6  Mike Lanier, a transfer from Hardin-Simmons, will probably be redshirted this  season, Harrick said. Lanier, whose nose was broken early in the second half  Thursday night, had three points and five rebounds in 20 minutes. . . . UCLA is  carrying four walk-ons and may keep all of them, Harrick said.  </P></p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The tentative optimism evident in the bund market towards the end of last week may be sustained in the next few days. 'The tone to the market is much better than it has been for weeks now,' Yamaichi International says. 'With yields close to 7 per cent and in a noticeably more stable environment, institutional domestic investors are beginning to return.' Investors are likely to focus on the Bundesbank's repurchase agreement on Wednesday. The 'repo' rate has dropped by 25 basis points since the last discount rate cut and now stands at 5.10 per cent. If the repo continues to fall at 5 basis points a week, the stage may well be set for another cut in the discount rate as early as July. This could counteract the pessimism among investors about the direction of German monetary policy. 'The likelihood is still that the Bundesbank drags its heels on the repo to avoid being boxed into a discount rate cut, but the prospects of a pleasant surprise in July are clearly improving,' says Ms Allison Cottrell at Midland Global Markets. On the other hand, the European parliamentary elections could dampen investor interest in bunds if the results suggest a poor outcome for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his ruling coalition in the national elections later this year.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UNITED WAY AIMS HIGH, PLEDGES BROADER ROLE  </P> <P> United Way of Orange County has set a fund-raising goal of $20.5 million during  its 1989 campaign and has pledged to take a more active role in drawing public  attention to specific issues, officials announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> A more aggressive position on issues is needed to respond to the upsurge in  health and social problems that have accompanied county economic and population  growth, officials said.  </P> <P> "This year is critical for the organizations supported through the United Way  campaign," said 1989 campaign chairman Ronald L. Merriman, managing partner of  KPMG Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co. "Our response to these problems must begin now  if we are to close the gap between services available to people and the growth  of problems."  </P> <P> United Way provides money for 121 health and social service organizations with  proceeds from the campaign.  </P> <P> Mostly through payroll deductions, the organization last year raised $18.6  million, an 11% increase over the 1987 total. Despite increases in overall  giving in recent years, the campaign has not met its goal in each of the last  four years, falling about $600,000 short last year.  </P> <P> Officials said they are somewhat concerned that county corporations still  contribute far less per capita than comparable areas. The national amount  raised per capita, for example, averages about $17, while the rate in Orange  County averages $8.  </P> <P> Officials attribute the gap to such varied reasons as the multitude of business  areas in the county, rather than a single defined "downtown," and a relatively  youthful economic base that has not established a tradition of giving to  charity.  </P> <P> To help meet new funding goals, the campaign this year will target the Asian  and Pacific business communities and high-income individuals, groups that have  been untapped in the past, officials said.  </P> <P> The local campaign will also focus on such key issues as substance abuse, child  care and health care, which were identified as priorities in a community  survey.  </P> <P> The survey of service providers, community leaders and more than 1,000 county  residents was the first to sample community opinion since a similar one in  1985.  </P> <P> Service providers ranked child care, drug abuse, housing assistance and  low-cost housing as top priorities, in that order.  </P> <P> Community leaders counted drug abuse, transportation, low-cost housing and  temporary shelter as foremost concerns.  </P> <P> Among the general public, however, drug abuse, homelessness, child care, health  care, acquired immune deficiency syndrome and race relations emerged as the  most pressing concerns.  </P></p>

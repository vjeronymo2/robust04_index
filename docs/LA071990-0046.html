			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> RECOGNITION FOR TEEN URGED  </P> <P> County fire officials said this week that they will seek a commendation for a  13-year-old Malibu girl whose quick thinking may have helped to save the life  of a propane deliveryman after an explosion at the girl's home.  </P> <P> Lisa Izad is said to have helped deliveryman Michael A. Link, 26, jump into the  family swimming pool, dousing the flames that engulfed him when a gas line  exploded as he was making a delivery at the home July 10, Battalion Chief Jerry  Meehan said.  </P> <P> Link, who lives in West Covina, was in Sherman Oaks Community Hospital this  week, recovering from second-degree burns to his face, arms and hands, fire  officials said.  </P> <P> Meehan said Lisa ran to the laundry room of the house, where the explosion  occurred, and directed Link to the pool while her mother, Carol, used water  from the kitchen sink in a vain effort to douse his burning clothes.  </P> <P> "It seems that her ability to think quickly may have saved him from being  critically burned or even killed," Meehan said.  </P></p>

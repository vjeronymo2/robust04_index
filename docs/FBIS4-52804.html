			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Monitoring the Unrestricted"] </F>   [Text] The much-awaited investment law which allows a  transfer of foreign currencies abroad, sent signals of  Cambodia's warm welcome to investors.    Seen as one of Cambodia's bid to woo investors, funds may be  remitted freely out of the country.    Even investors who do not export their goods or services and  deal solely in local currency are entitled to the benefits of  this regulation, as they can convert their revenue into foreign  currencies without restriction.    But there is a need for the legislation, when passed, to be  backed by strong legislative support pertaining to the  definition of investment returns which can be remitted home.    If there was a strong need for legislative support, there is  a more urgent note to provide a framework within which the  transfer of investment will work.    In Cambodia, the responsibility lies with two bodies to  perform these functions. They are the National Assembly and  Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC).    CDC, a regulatory body set up to study and make  recommendations on investments and development, is presided over  by the First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.    Its main function is to advise investors, define incentives  that investors are entitled to, grant them approval and very  quickly check any questions that the investors might invoke.    With CDC, the bulk of responsibility of administration and  bureaucracy will generally be taken away from ministries and be  delegated to the organisation to function as a "one-stop  investment service" centre.    Therefore, CDC should take the initiative to carefully  structure a set of rules to act as a guide to investors on dos  and don'ts.    This is the time to put Cambodia's house in order. There is  no point in crying over spilt milk and making amends after going  wrong.    This is especially important as CDC will also serve as the  industry and trade justice council.    If CDC can lead the way in putting order to Cambodia's  economy, it will not only benefit the country, but also lend  credibility to the organisation.</p>

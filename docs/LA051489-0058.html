			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> I flew to Tahiti the other night with Ted Cook of Islands In the Sun. He was  dressed in his usual aloha shirt and jeans, and he was returning to Tahiti  because that's where his heart is. Twenty-five years ago Cook left his job as  an aerospace engineer in Los Angeles to vacation in the South Seas. It was, he  says, the beginning of a beautiful love affair.  </P> <P> The day he got back to Los Angeles the freeways were clogged. A brownish haze  hung over the city. Suddenly, everything that had seemed so terribly important  made no sense. Inching his way in the bumper-to-bumper traffic, he vowed to  return to the South Seas.  </P> <P> A few months later Cook flew back to Tahiti and made a home movie that was  shown to clubs and on television when he returned to Los Angeles. By now he had  quit his job and moved aboard a sailboat in Long Beach, using the public phone  on the dock as his office. Each time it rang, he ran to the booth, announcing  breathlessly: "Islands In the Sun."  </P> <P> Quitting his job was easy. Paying the bills was something else. His accountant  told him flatly, "There is no way in the world you can make money."  </P> <P> Cook told the bean counter to take a stroll. "He almost ruined my dream."  </P> <P> Cook was obsessed with the idea of returning to Tahiti as frequently as  possible. It took nearly 10 years to begin making a profit with his tours, but  he kept his vow. Since that fateful journey when he was 28 years old, he's  returned to Tahiti more than 200 times.  </P> <P> In the bar of the Beachcomber Hotel in Papeete a plaque reads: "Here sits a  legend," referring to Ted Cook. There's another at the Maeva Beach Hotel.  </P> <P> During a quarter of a century, Cook has shepherded more than 100,000 travelers  to Tahiti from all 50 states, Canada, Mexico and dozens of other countries.  Over the years he's moved deeper into the South Seas: to Fiji, the Cook  Islands, Australia and New Zealand. He describes himself as "the guy with the  bare feet and the briefcase," and the only time you'll see him in a tie is at a  wedding or a funeral. And maybe not even then.  </P> <P> Cook recalls the day years ago in Los Angeles' bumper-to-bumper traffic: "I  felt if I didn't give it a chance, I'd always wonder what might have happened."  </P> <P> What happened, of course, is that he became a legend.  </P> <P> For a free copy of a 48-page magazine produced by Cook that features Tahiti and  tours of the South Seas, write to Islands In the Sun, P.O. Box 1398, Newport  Beach 92663 or telephone toll-free (800) 854-3413.  </P> <P> Island Dreams  </P> <P> For other background on French Polynesia, write to Tahiti Nui Travel, 1750  Bridgeway, B-101, Sausalito, Calif. 94965, or call toll-free (800) 922-6851.  Other information about French Polynesia is available from the Tahiti Tourist  Promotion Board, 12233 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 110, Los Angeles 90064.  Telephone (213) 207-1919. It can supply you with brochures on the various  islands.  </P> <P> In Tahiti, look up John Hardie of Paradise Tour (he's the guy with the big  smile who greets arriving passengers at Faaa Airport). Hardie provides  limousine service, operates buses, rents cars. His cheapest auto rental is $22  a day plus mileage. Write to Hardie c/o Paradise Tour, Vallee de Tipaerui, B.P.  2430, Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia. (His tours around the island are  legend).  </P> <P> Unspoiled  </P> <P> It's the impossible dream. Since the first jet set down on Tahiti more than a  quarter of a century ago, not a single high-rise has risen on any of the  islands of French Polynesia. Not on Tahiti or Moorea. Not on Raiatea or  Huahine. No, not even on Bora Bora, the legendary island that was an  inspiration for author James Michener. While the beaches of Hawaii and the  Caribbean have been sacrificed to developers, French Polynesia has been spared.  </P> <P> Until now.  </P> <P> Writing in the Tahiti Sun Press, editor Al Prince reported that "Japanese  investors have finally discovered French Polynesia," with blueprints for a  300-room hotel on Moorea and the expansion of the Hyatt Regency Tahiti and the  Tahiti Beachcomber, both on Tahiti. A couple of 18-hole golf courses are  planned, and new jet service already has begun from Tokyo.  </P> <P> Currently, Hawaii's Sheraton Waikiki contains nearly as many rooms as all the  hotels on all the islands of French Polynesia combined. During 10 days, Hawaii  receives roughly the same number of tourists that Tahiti welcomes in an entire  year. So hurry. Papeete is no longer a backwater South Seas village, and  developers are closing in on this peaceful corner of the world.  </P> <P> Dining in Tahiti  </P> <P> Meals are first-rate at Restaurant Captain Bligh (about seven miles from  downtown Papeete). This is the home of Tahiti's Lagoonarium, an underwater  showcase for viewing dozens of sea creatures: shark, parrotfish, manta rays,  moray eels, turtles, zebra fish and butterfly fish. An evening package that  includes admission to the Lagoonarium, dinner (with wine), a Polynesian show  and round-trip transportation from your hotel is $35. The dinner show at the  Maeva Beach Hotel figures out to $29.50. Others: Acajou and Auberge du  Pacifique (French), the Jade Palace and Le Dragon d'Or (Chinese), La Belvedere  (for spectacular sunset dinners on a hillside overlooking Papeete) and Le  Pescadou (for the best pizza in Papeete).  </P> <P> Game Fishing  </P> <P> Chris Lilly, 41-year-old skipper of the game-fishing boat Tea Nui, is an  ex-Southern Californian who promises anglers "an experience they may never  forget." Searches out marlin, tuna, wahoo, mahi-mahi. Charges $600 for a full  day (up to six persons). Lilly also does picnic excursions, surf safaris. His  Bertram flybridge cruiser is powered by a couple of turbo diesels. Details from  Tea Nui Charters, Pirae B.P. 51069, Tahiti, French Polynesia.  </P> <P> Bora Bora  </P> <P> On Bora Bora the big hotels offer guests free use of snorkeling equipment,  outrigger canoes, windsurfers, bicycles and video films. Receptionists will  also get you a car, a moped, scooters. Guests cruise the lagoon aboard  glass-bottom boats or double-decker launches. Erwin Christian of Moana  Adventure Tours accompanies the guests of Hotel Bora Bora on reef and  around-the-island trips. Also does shark-feeding cruises and snorkeling  safaris, and sails with guests to small islets for picnics. Write to Moana  Adventure Tours, P.O. Box 5, Vaitape, Bora Bora, French Polynesia. Hotel  Sofitel Marara and Hotel Moana Beach Bora Bora offer similar services. Both  operate double-decker launches on picnic/sunset/dinner cruises.  </P> <P> Shopping on Bora Bora  </P> <P> With the exception of the hotels, there's little shopping on Bora Bora. A rare  find is Galerie Masson (a few doors from Hotel Moana Beach Bora Bora). Galerie  Masson, owned by Rosine, Tahitian wife of the late French artist Jean Masson,  displays her husband's paintings as well as her own hand-painted pareaus  (sarongs), pillow cases, necklaces.  </P> <P> Moana Arts stocks photography by Erwin Christian, books, black pearls,  clothing. The Pofai Shoppe near Hotel Bora Bora sells souvenirs, pareaus,  jewelry, Tahitian tapes, film, snack items. Handicrafts by local artisans  (woodcarvings, shell jewelry, woven hats/handbags) are displayed at The Artisan  Center of Bora Bora on the quay in Vaitape. For black pearls, air-brushed  T-shirts and other souvenirs, stop by Martine's Boutique.  </P></p>

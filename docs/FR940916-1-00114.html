			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.419. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section contains the requirements for performing a conventional passenger train brake system test using yard air, which are identical to the requirements contained in &sect;232.323 regarding the performance of brake tests with yard air on conventional freight trains. Consequently, the discussion related to &sect;232.323 is equally applicable to this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.421. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section outlines the requirements for performing Class 1 brake system tests on repetitive conventional passenger and commuter trains. FRA recognizes the unique characteristics of some commuter and passenger trains that repeat the same trip several times a day without breaking up the consist. Because the trains in these types of operations are not broken up and remain connected to an air supply continuously, it is highly unlikely that their air brake equipment would deteriorate beyond Federal requirements in one day if they were in safe and proper working order at the beginning of the day. Therefore, FRA proposes to require that conventional passenger and commuter trains that repeat the same trip more than once a day need only be required to have an initial terminal brake test, performed by a qualified individual, prior to the first departure of that train each calendar day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA intends to require that Class 1 brake tests of repetitive conventional passenger and commuter trains include requirements for inspection of the same components as those imposed on conventional passenger trains in &sect;232.407. FRA agrees with the assertions of several commenters that the current power brake regulations do not address the inspection of MU equipment. FRA also recognizes that many of the trains covered by this section are operated with MU equipment. Consequently, in order to provide inspection guidance for this type of equipment, FRA proposes specific tasks that must be performed on the brake systems of MU equipment as part of the Class 1 brake test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section &sect;232.423. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section addresses the additional brake system tests for repetitive conventional passenger and commuter trains. The proposed requirements for the performance of Class 2 brake tests, running tests and single car tests are identical to the requirements proposed for conventional passenger trains contained at &sect;&sect;232.411 through 232.417. However, this section does contain requirements regarding the performance of Class 2 brake tests on MU equipment. Furthermore, this section requires that a Class 2 brake test on repetitive trains be performed after the trains complete one cycle or reach a turnaround point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.425. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section contains the requirements for performing Class 1 train brake system tests on excursion trains. Although FRA recognizes the unique operations in which these trains are used and the often limited resources of those operations, FRA feels that the performance of a Class 1 brake test is necessary for any type of train service to ensure the safe operation of trains. Consequently, FRA intends to require that Class 1 brake tests on excursion trains include the requirements applicable to conventional passenger trains contained at &sect;232.407.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA recognizes that some tourist and excursion train operations do not have the resources to obtain personnel with the qualifications of those employed by passenger and freight railroads. FRA also acknowledges that these trains do not travel at the speeds or the distances that are maintained by conventional passenger or commuter trains. Thus, FRA does not intend to impose the minimum personnel qualification requirements contained at subpart C of these proposed regulations on excursion train operations. However, because the personnel qualification requirements will not be applicable to these trains and due to the age of the equipment generally operated in these types of trains, FRA proposes to require that excursion trains not be operated in excess of 30 mph and that such trains receive a Class 1 brake inspection at least every 250 miles. If a tourist, excursion, or scenic railroad intends to operate its trains in excess of 30 mph, then those trains will be required to follow all the proposed regulations applicable to conventional passenger trains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.427. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section contains the requirements for the performance of additional brake system tests on excursion trains. FRA proposes to require that Class 2 brake tests, running tests, and single car tests on excursion trains be conducted in accordance with the standards applicable to conventional passenger trains contained in &sect;&sect;232.411 through 232.417 respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart F  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This subpart proposes that railroads be given the flexibility to develop the inspection and test standards for intermediate speed and high speed trains. These could be performance-based standards that serve the same purpose and provide equivalent assurance that the brake system will function as intended as the conventional train standards. These standards must take into account the increased risk of operating trains at higher speeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

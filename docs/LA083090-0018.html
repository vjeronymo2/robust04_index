			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE;  </P> <P> A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> PLAYGROUND WILL CATER TO HANDICAPPED  </P> <P> Three years after the idea was proposed by the Kiwanis Club of Santa Ana the  plan is being put into action: A park is being built within Thornton Park on  Segerstrom Avenue to provide a playground for handicapped children, where  basketball courts have adjustable hoops and swings can accommodate wheelchairs.  </P> <P> The Kiwanis Club proposed the 6 1/2-acre, "barrier-free" facility after members  had worked with students at Santa Ana's Carl Harvey School for physically  handicapped children.  </P> <P> Located on a grassy, 30-acre stretch of land in the park's northern section,  the facility will include two basketball courts, a playground, special trails  to the park's lake and a camping area with bathrooms accessible to the  handicapped.  </P> <P> The Kiwanis Club will not be able to fund the project by itself and is seeking  the support of other organizations. The estimated cost of the park, according  to club president Angel Rivas, is at least $300,000, most of which will go into  buying playground equipment.  </P> <P> "There's no park like this in the county," Rivas said. "Once this is built,  handicapped kids from throughout the county can come here and play."  </P> <P> The South Coast Symphony Youth Orchestra in residence at the Orange County High  School of the Arts is currently seeking talented young musicians to participate  in the group's coming international tour to East and West Berlin.  </P> <P> The ensemble, under the direction of Scott Speck, will leave next summer for a  10-day trip, which includes concerts on both sides of the crumbled Berlin Wall,  as well as other picturesque locations around Germany.  </P> <P> This will mark the second international tour for the group. Last year's season  included a four-concert trip to Quebec, Canada. The group and its members have  also performed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music  Center.  </P> <P> Now in its 17th season, the South Coast Symphony Youth Orchestra joined OCHSA  on the Marina High School campus in Huntington Beach in 1988. In addition to  its weekly rehearsals, orchestra members have the option of attending chamber  orchestra practice, advanced sectional rehearsals taught by professional  orchestra musicians and classes in music history, theory, orchestration,  composition and conducting -- all free.  </P> <P> For information about the orchestra or to schedule an audition, contact OCHSA  at (213) 596-1435.  </P> <P> "You can't measure time in days the way you can money in dollars because every  day is different." -- Jorge Luis Borges, Argentine author  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US and EC blame each other over tariff cuts TRADE negotiators in Geneva said yesterday talks on tariff reduction between the leading trading nations were making little progress, with the US and the EC blaming each other  - and to a lesser extent Japan  - for the deadlock. Mr John Schmidt, chief US negotiator in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, described the state of the negotiations between the Quad nations  - the US, EC, Japan and Canada  - as 'stagnant'. Noting that the latest EC tariff offer was still below the average level achieved by the other Quad partners, he said its meagre market access proposals for farm goods threatened to block an overall tariff package by the agreed date of November 15. EC officials counter-attacked yesterday, arguing that US tariff proposals fell far short of reduction commitments made by the Quad countries in Tokyo last July. Brussels says it is prepared to improve on its offer tabled this week, which amounts to an average one-third cut in tariffs, but cannot do so politically without further US concessions, These are unlikely to be forthcoming soon, EC officials added, because senior Washington officials are giving priority to getting the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress, Comparative figures produced by Brussels yesterday show that the EC already has fewer industrial tariff peaks (duties of 15 per cent or more) than its Quad partners, at lower rates and covering a smaller volume of trade. On the peaks themselves, weighted by the amount of trade, the EC is offering a 37 per cent average cut against 36 per cent for Canada, 26 per cent for Japan and just 7.3 per cent for the US. These figures exclude chemicals which are covered by a harmonisation proposal and would make the US offer look better, and fish, on which the EC has so far made no offer, which would make the EC proposal look worse.</p>

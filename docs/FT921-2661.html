			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Watchdog criticises car adverts SOME car suppliers use advertising which could encourage dangerous driving as well as making safety claims which could be misleading, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled yesterday. The authority says in its report for January that it upheld complaints over an advertisement by VAG UK, the Volkswagen-Audi distributor, which claimed that 'the Audi 100 is the safest luxury car ever tested'. The authority found that the car had been tested only for frontal collisions. Its report also states that an article supplied by VAG to support its safety claims 'did not conclude that the Audi had beaten the other models tested'. The authority upheld complaints against Renault UK for focusing on the alleged rapid acceleration and top speed of the Clio model, singling out the use of 'blistering' and 'exhilarating' for criticism. Nissan Europe is criticised for advertising the Nissan 300 ZX model in a way manner 'capable of encouraging drivers to attempt overtaking manoeuvres in tight situations'. The report also criticises Citroen UK for an advertisement which might 'reinforce the widespread misconception concerning the use of lanes on a motorway'. A campaign by Vauxhall, which included the claim that the new Astra has a 'pedestrian-friendly front' and referred to the vehicle as 'thiefproof', is also criticised. The authority also upheld complaints against the environment and energy departments. They concerned a campaign which linked global warming to the storms of 1987, 1989 and 1990. The authority said any future advertising should make clear that any connection was a matter of opinion. ASA Monthly Report 10. ASA, Brook House, 2-16 Torrington Place, London WC1E 7HN. Free.</p>

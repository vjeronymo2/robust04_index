			<p>BFN     [Text] Interior Ministry officials have been instructed to  keep a close watch on dissident Burmese students and ethnic  minority groups as part of preparations for the ASEAN  Ministerial Meeting next month in Bangkok to which Burma has  been invited as an observer.    A ministry source said there have been reports that  dissident  Burmese may try to protest the presence of Burmese  representatives and try to obstruct them from attending the  meeting that begins July 11.    Foreign Affairs Division director Praphakon Samiti said some  Burmese students at Ban Maniloi, also called the Burmese  Students Centre, which is located in Ratchaburi province's Pak  Tho district had telephoned private organisations and the mass  media, and tried to project a negative image of the centre.    There are now about 150 Burmese students at the centre, 20  of  them women.    Deputy Interior permanent secretary for security affairs  Chaloem Phromloet, meanwhile, has ordered Ratchaburi authorities  to take preventive measures and at the same time instructed  Burmese students and people living in the vicinity of Ban  Maniloi, who have lately been locked in confrontation, to  exercise restraint and try to settle their problems in an  amicable way.    To that end, he has issued the following instructions:    -- Students who feel they are not being justly treated  should  lodge a complaint with the provincial governor who may set up a  committee to investigate their complaint.    -- Students are to refrain from causing trouble, hurting  authorities or damaging anyone's property otherwise they will be  subject to legal action.    -- Provincial authorities are to seek cooperation from local  villagers to ensure that they don't beat up Burmese students, or  they will face legal action.</p>

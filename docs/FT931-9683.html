			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Serious economic risks in premature monetary union: Eddie George Speech MR EDDIE George, deputy governor of the Bank of England who becomes governor in July, yesterday made his first policy address since the announcement of his promotion last month. In a speech at the DG Bank in Frankfurt, he said: 'The drama over sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism left many people - both at home and abroad - with the impression that the UK is still both soft on monetary discipline and lukewarm in its commitment to Europe. I aim to persuade you that this impression is quite wrong on both counts. 'Sterling's ERM suspension was the result of exceptional divergence between the domestic policy needs in Germany and the UK. It had nothing to do with the UK being soft on monetary discipline. 'When the break (with the ERM) came last September, people could be forgiven for thinking that it represented a radical change in the objectives of monetary policy. In reality, in this respect, the ERM was an important part of the framework of monetary policy. The substance of policy had throughout been, and remained, to achieve and maintain price stability in the medium and longer term. 'I have no sympathy at all for those supposed pundits who continuously complain that policy is obscure or even non-existent and that we are living from hand-to-mouth. 'And I have no sympathy for those commentators who scrutinise the fine print of every official statement trying to detect the most minute differences of emphasis as between growth and stability from one day to the next. 'I do not know of anyone involved at any level in the process of monetary policy decision-making or its implementation, who does not share the conviction that price stability is a necessary precondition for sustainable growth of output and employment. 'In fact, since we left the ERM, the aim of monetary policy has never in my recollection been more clearly or precisely stated in the UK. The aim is, in the chancellor's words, for 'a rate of inflation in the long term of 2 per cent or less' and, for the remainder of the present parliament, 'to keep underlying inflation within a range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent', and 'to be in the lower part of that range by the end of the parliament'. 'Having a clear objective is not in itself enough, though it is not a bad starting point. Confidence must be earned through deeds rather than words, and I recognise that this will take time. 'In commenting on my own appointment as governor, the chancellor stated that the new governor's central responsibility would be 'to support the government in its determination to bring a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation, the only sound basis on which sustainable growth and secure jobs can be built'. We take both these responsibilities extremely seriously within the Bank. 'Recent progress (in UK inflation) is especially encouraging in that it reflects a very considerable improvement in domestic cost performance. Pay settlements and average earnings are running at their lowest rates for some 25 years; and with productivity - especially manufacturing productivity - improving over the past year faster than in earlier recessions, unit labour costs, for so long the Achilles' heel of the British economy, have scarcely risen at all in manufacturing in recent months. Recent cuts in interest rates have been justified in terms of the government's immediate and longer-term objectives for inflation. 'We took (sterling's recent depreciation) fully into account in reaching our judgment about the appropriate policy stance. 'Depreciation, even if it proves to be temporary, is itself a source of potential inflationary pressure, so that there can be no question of benign neglect in relation to the exchange rate. 'But it is not the sole influence on inflation, and it need not threaten the target for inflation, so long as domestic costs remain firmly under control  -as, as I have explained, they currently are. 'And it may well be that sterling's recent fall will tend to reverse itself as cyclical developments narrow the interest rate differential between the UK and its continental partners. 'In this connection - on the basis of all the information currently available to us - the government and the Bank are at one in seeing little justification, and very little room, for further adjustment in our own stance. 'The turbulence within the ERM over the past six months or so points up the real dangers of moving ahead too quickly to a harder ERM, and beyond that, to exchange rate fixity before adequate convergence has been achieved. 'We remain concerned that premature steps to monetary union would involve serious economic risks. It is unlikely that sterling will rejoin the ERM in the short-term until closer and more durable convergence between the domestic policy needs in Germany and the United Kingdom has been re-established.'</p>

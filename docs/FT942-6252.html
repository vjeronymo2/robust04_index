			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Rise in UK factory prices 'fuelled by recovery' Signs that the British economic recovery may be fuelling inflationary pressures emerged yesterday after a business survey warned that manufacturing bottlenecks had significantly raised factory prices in May. The UK purchasing managers' survey, released today, said prices were pushed up for the sixth successive month because factories were unable to meet the recent surge in demand. Shortages of pulp, paper and steel had created particular difficulties in the packaging and production industries, it added. In another sign of inflationary pressure, the annual growth rate of M0, the narrow measure of the money supply, rose to a seasonally adjusted 7.1 per cent in May, the highest figure since April 1990. M0 has been growing outside the government's monitoring range of 0-4 per cent for some time. The Bank of England does consider M0 to be a forward indicator of inflation but it has argued that the annual growth rate has been distorted by the move to low interest rates, which have reduced the cost to consumers of holding cash. But analysts said the figures indicated that the economy was still growing strongly and therefore the likelihood of a further base rate cut had been even further reduced. The strength of this growth was underlined by the purchasing managers' survey, which showed that factory output, new orders and employment all rose to the highest levels recorded during the survey's three-year history. Mr Peter Thomson, director-general of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which organised the survey, said: 'May seems to have been the busiest month for UK manufacturers for a long time.' This was creating problems for some UK factories, the survey suggested. Although levels of stocks had remained broadly flat in May, delivery times had lengthened to record periods because many manufacturers were unable to meet demand requirement in time. These findings are slightly at odds with a recent survey from the Confederation of British Industry, which suggested that most manufacturing sectors still had spare capacity and inflationary pressures remained low. Manufacturers last night endorsed the report's picture of rising sales and lengthening order books and delivery times but insisted severe supply constraints remain rare. The Confederation of European Paper Industries said the UK appeared to be at the forefront of a very strong surge in demand for paper products which began in the first quarter. Mr Alan Collins, president of the British Constructional Steelwork Association, said: 'Supply and demand is more in line which has enabled prices to rise by 8-10 per cent since the beginning of this year.' Mr Dennis Webb, chief executive of Beazer Homes, Britain's fourth largest housebuilder, said: 'We have seen no evidence of material or labour shortages hitting housebuilders.'

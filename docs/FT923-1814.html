			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Usual rules do not apply: Europe In their attempts to develop a policy towards the civil war in Yugoslavia, western governments are operating under three severe handicaps. The first is that they bear a serious responsibility for having accelerated the war by their serial recognition of would-be independent states. Second, they cannot make good this responsibility because they have no operational leverage for bringing the conflict to a halt, at least none that they can exercise without mobilising hundreds of thousands of men, with any chance of success. But the third and most serious handicap is that they dare not admit the gruesome truth that the situation probably has to get worse before it can get durably better, and that the 'ethnic cleansing' which all condemn may in fact be a necessary precondition for any lasting settlement. Perhaps the earlier errors were unavoidable in the circumstances in which they were committed; perhaps the Germans could not escape a national obligation to press for early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia; but even if that is now water under the bridge, it still leaves the Germans, and thus also their partners in the European Community, with responsibilities for trying to cure the damage which they cannot possibly fulfil. After such an unpromising starting point, the twin-track approach which has been evolving in the European Community and the United Nations is probably about as constructive as one might reasonably expect. On the one hand, there is the diplomatic strategy fronted by Cyrus Vance for the UN and David Owen for the EC, which aims to persuade the warring factions to give up the bloody conflict and come instead to the conference table. On the other hand, the United Nations is now making a seriously determined effort to push through the programme of humanitarian aid with some small backing of military force. The tender-hearted may feel that this twin-track programme is far too little compared with the need. Moral revulsion at the barbaric tribalism of this multi-sided conflict, plus the urge to protect the innocent or at least alleviate their sufferings, together seem to call for much deeper engagement to put an end to an unacceptable situation. The tough-minded, by contrast, would argue that the outside world is already trying to do far too much, in a situation where it can have no effective leverage on the conflict, and that any further involvement carries a manifest danger of getting sucked into a politico-military quagmire, with potentially disastrous consequences. Such realists have the deepest misgivings over the latest UN plan to send troops to back up the provision of humanitarian aid; for they fear that this could lead uncontrollably to military involvement in the fighting, but without any framework of a realistic political strategy. Between the competing claims of morality and realism, the present twin-track programme is in fact about the best that can be offered in extremely unpromising circumstances. The outside world cannot bring peace; but it can lay down some principles of international law, and hold out a useful procedural framework ready for the day when most of the combatants decide they would prefer peace to war. In the absence of peace, the outside world cannot prevent the death and deprivation of many innocent civilians on all sides; but it must do what it can to alleviate these sufferings, and it should do a lot more than it is now doing, because it could save many hundreds of lives. But this twin-track policy only makes political sense on two conditions. The first is that the UN humanitarian aid programme is kept rigidly and manifestly distinct from any monitoring or peacekeeping operations, because it is essential that the combatants should have no reason to believe that the aid escorts are really a peacemaking force in disguise. This means accepting that the aid escorts cannot fire back, even at the cost of taking casualties. The second condition is that we must recognise that the conference arrangements being offered are unlikely to serve any useful function until the fighting in some sense comes to rest. It is right for the outside world to insist on high-minded principles such as self-determination and the protection of minority rights. But the bottom line is that peace negotiations will probably not start in any serious way, until the combatants see the prospect of stable political and territorial arrangements. Since the root cause of the fighting is the secular mutual hatreds of the warring communities, one of the prime preconditions of stable political and territorial arrangements will be a high degree of ethnic homogeneity. The outside world is never likely to admit that ethnic cleansing, which means large movements of peoples, and non-respect of minority rights, could be a necessary part of any peace settlement, because it is morally repulsive and contrary to principles to which most civilised governments formally subscribe. But if the choice is between ethnic cleansing and a negotiated peace on the one hand, and continued slaughter and suffering of the innocent, in the name of the protection of minority rights, on the other, it seems clear where one's choice should lie. This is a serial civil war, and in civil wars, the usual rules do not apply.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "P.S.": "Healthy Competition; Are Polish Banks </F> Afraid of Foreign Competitors?"]    [Text]Foreign banks do not constitute a major threat  to Polish financial institutions -- said Marian Krzak, chairman  of the Association of Polish Banks during a meeting at NOWA  EUROPA in April. "I do not believe that the foreign banks could  enter Poland all of a sudden and comprehensively." Chairman  Krzak thinks that their entry into our market is unavoidable,  while their presence here may be an opportunity as it would  force others to compete with them. What do representatives of  Polish banks think of that competition? Are they afraid of  it?    I am not afraid of healthy competition -- it can only change  the market in a positive way -- Wojciech Haase, deputy chairman  of Bank Gdanski SA told NOWA EUROPA. But unfortunately, we have  seen some negative phenomena recently: Some of the foreign banks  active in Poland began applying dumping prices, which may have a  bad impact on the market. For instance, use is being made of  calculating mandatory reserves according to the status on the  last day of a month. But sooner or later, fundamental  principles of competition will be defined. Just like foreign  banks, Bank Gdanski is trying to act according to international  standards, mainly in the area of treasury operations. A code of  principles to be applied on the money and foreign currency  market, should ensure a fair play type of competition.    Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank in Lublin was established as an  American bank. We are not particularly afraid of competition --  said Barbara Rudzinska, the bank's press spokesman. Three years  ago, we were high above the level of our Polish competitors even  when it comes to architectural design. Our clerks were also of  high quality and we tried to implant similar notions throughout  our domestic branches. All these innovations successfully met  the test of practice -- our customers got to like us and other  Lublin banks followed in our footsteps. We became a carrier of  foreign competition ourselves. Of course, what is on the  outside is not everything. A program of bringing the bank back  to health -- which has been applied intensively -- contains many  new elements which increase our competitiveness toward both  domestic and foreign banks.    Competition from foreign banks is an issue of the future  broadly speaking. So banks have time to get ready for it. That  will occur as the system's consolidation continues -- in which  Kredyt Bank actively participates: Some examples are Bank  Ziemski, Bank Regionalny in Rybnik, and there may be another  similar move in the near future -- says Tomasz Uchman, Kredyt  Bank's press spokesman. Facing up to the competition also  entails a need to strengthen capital. Our bank can be an  example to follow also in that regard. The issue of shares was  carried out successfully, the bank's credibility will now be  confirmed and publicly verified through the stock market.  Thanks to the operation, our own financial means increased to  over 1 trillion zlotys, which is high for Poland. It is also  worth mentioning that Kredyt Bank has established reserves for  lost credits in the amount required by the National Bank of  Poland [NBP] as early as at the end of last year, that is,  before the issue prospectus was published. True, it caused a  drop in our results -- with net profit amounting to just 19  billion zlotys -- but the reserves at the level of 230 billion  zlotys increase our credibility. This year, reaching the  planned profit of 100 billion zlotys, seems realistic. In our  activity, we try to make other indicators -- those of solvency,  security, or the level of bad debts -- comply with NBP's  requirements and regulations of the European Union [EU]. Once  Poland becomes EU's member, only strong, secure, and efficient  banks will be able to meet the challenge of competition.    Professor Andrzej Olszewski, deputy chairman of Prosper Bank  SA, is probably the only pessimist among bankers: Foreign banks  have greater capital at their disposal -- which they can direct  toward profitable activities -- and that is competition. Polish  banks can finance ventures using share capital and their own  assets, while foreign banks have the possibility to earn bigger  money. As far as the competitiveness of services is concerned,  foreign banks are not particularly interested in deposits by  individuals, but in financing merchandise and investment  turnover. They have sufficient capital for that, while Polish  banks have to receive deposits from the population in order to  accumulate such capital levels. The population in turn is  looking for security that foreign banks and those banks that  have NBP's guarantees, are more likely to provide, not -- as a  general rule -- privately-owned banks.</p>

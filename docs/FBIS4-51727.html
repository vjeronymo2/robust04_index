			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the  Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party in a statement  issued Monday sharply denounces the feverish acceleration of the  development of nuclear weapons by the Kim Yong-sam group,  branding it as an undisguised perfidy in reducing the joint  declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula to  waste paper and a never- to-be-condoned criminal act aimed at  destroying the nation.    Recalling that the South Korean ruling quarters have pursued  a policy of developing nuclear weapons from the early 1970s, the  statement warns that if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula  owing to the reckless military provocations of the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets, it will, no doubt,  develop into a nuclear war, inflicting an irrevocable nuclear  scourge upon the Korean peninsula and its surrounding countries.    The statement demands that the Kim Yong-sam group promptly  stop the development of nuclear weapons which would bring  horrible disasters to the nation and dismantle the pressurized  heavy water reactor (PHWR) and multi-purpose research reactor.    Noting that the United States is the very one standing in  the  way of the solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula, the statement urges the United States to come out to  the DPRK-USA negotiating table for a fundamental solution of the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.    The International Atomic Energy Agency which has so far  resorted to a double standard, abandoning the principle of  impartiality in nuclear inspections, should apologize for the  fact that it has joined the United States in its anti-DPRK  campaign and closed its eyes to the development of nuclear  weapons through the PHWR for military use and the multi-purpose  research reactor by the South Korean puppets, the statement says.</p>

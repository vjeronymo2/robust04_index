Dwoskin made no statement at Chiang Kai-shek International  Airport.    Progress in the talks, which will begin Thursday at the head  office of the state-run Taiwan Power Company, is expected to  help Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), government sources said.    The talks will focus on Taiwan's tariff rates on 699  industrial and agricultural products, which U.S. negotiators  hope to see slashed in half. The U.S. is also seeking caps on  tariffs to keep them at or below 10 percent for industrial  products and 20 percent for agricultural goods.    The two sides failed to reach an agreement on tariff cuts  during talks in Washington last month. Vice Economic Affairs  Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said earlier this month that the  government will first cut tariffs on 252 industrial items by an  average of 17.5 percent and on 154 agricultural products by an  average of 12.5 percent.    Sheu will head the Taiwan delegation for this round of  talks,  which will last through Saturday.    Trade officials said discussions will include bringing  tariffs on more than 8,000 items in line with GATT requirements.    Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 as a separate customs  territory and is expected to be admitted to the Geneva-based  world trade requlatory body by the end of this year.</p>

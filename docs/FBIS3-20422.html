			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Deng Yiming (6772 0001 7686), affiliated with </F> the CASS Rural Development Institute: "The Impact of GATT  Reentry' on China's Grain System"]    [Text] The GATT is aimed at eliminating tariffs and  nontariff barriers to effect free trade throughout the world,  thus realizing the full development of international commodity  exchange and production. But all countries throughout the world  sharply subsidize grain producers, imposing tariffs and quota  protection on international grain trade, which severely distorts  real grain prices, affecting the growth of grain production.  <H3>  The Impact of International Grain Protectionism on China's  Grain System </H3>   The longstanding lack of restraint by basic GATT principles  and provisions on grain production and international trade has  severely distorted the production and international trade in  grain of all countries. 1) Developed market-economy  grain-exporting countries have used price supports, export  subsidies, farm (grain) import tariffs, and quantitative  quotas for domestic grain producers to distort world  grain-market prices. 2) These grain-protection policies have  brought pluses and minuses for China. The pluses are that China  is a net grain importer, while grain world-market prices have  fallen due to the grain-protection measures of developed  grain-exporting countries, enabling China to import grain  cheaply. The minuses are three: 1) Cheap grain imports are a  blow to domestic grain producers and add to our national  financial burden. Until grain is deregulated, this impact will  be somewhat less, as grain prices are set by the state, cutting  the impact of world grain-market price variations on China. But  once our grain market is deregulated, with grain-market prices  being determined by supply and demand, cheap grain imports will  be even more of a blow to our grain producers. 2) China is  generally a net farm-product exporter. While developed  market-economy countries can acquire certain advantages from  grain imports for domestic production and trade protection,  other farm-product export opportunities and export earnings will  drop, which is generally a minus for China. 3) Grain-protection  policies will add to China's grain-market price instability,  mainly because once China deregulates its grain market, our  domestic market will have to link up with overseas markets.  Overseas market volatility will spill over very easily to our  domestic market, thus touching off domestic-market price  instability.  <H5>  The Impact of GATT Membership on China's Grain System </H5>   1. The Positive Impact    1. The ultimate objective of GATT negotiations is to effect  worldwide free trade, which is the only way to ensure the most  efficient disposition of resources on a global scale. But  trade protection interferes with this efficient disposition of  resources. A UN Food and Agriculture Organization's simulated  study results show that if all developed market-economy  countries completely lifted all of their trade restrictions,  prices would rise 20 percent for wheat, 16 percent for coarse  food grain (such as maize, sorghum, and millet as distinct from  wheat and rice), and 14 percent for (husked) rice. Except for  the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if all wheat-trading  countries adopted free trade, world wheat prices would go up 11  percent, with market price volatility down 35 percent. Based on  this simulated study, once China joins the GATT, if developed  grain-exporting countries could lift their trade restrictions  (which would be extremely difficult), grain prices would  generally rise, which would be a plus for China's grain  producers. But if China simultaneously lifted its trade  restrictions, conceding some of our domestic grain market,  particularly while China's grain costs or prices were higher  than world market prices, large amounts of overseas grain would  pour in, shocking China's grain market, which might have a  negative impact on our producers.    2. As grain protection eases in degree, the general rise in  farm product and grain prices not only will raise farm product  export earnings (with China being generally a net farm-product  exporter), but also might indirectly raise peasant income, which  may increase investment in grain. So China's grain production  can take advantage of this opportunity to speed up grain  development.    2. The Negative Impact    1. As farm tariff protection weakens and nontariff barriers  are dismantled, our domestic grain market will necessarily open  wider, with GATT member nations exploiting the opportunity to  grab China's grain market, which will have a crucial impact on  China's overall balance of grain supply and demand.  Particularly as China has not yet completed the conversion  from a "dual-track system" to market forces or the transition in  grain from a product economy to a commodity economy, Chinese  grain, which is produced on a small scale, high in cost, low in  labor productivity, and poor in quality, will be in a  disadvantageous market-competition position with overseas grain,  which is high in quality, low in cost, and high in labor  productivity.    2. As control over grain imports is eased, particularly  while domestic grain prices are higher than international ones,  China's southeastern coastal provinces and cities (our  grain-market zone) will very likely import foreign grain, which  will shrink our domestic grain market, exacerbating our  "grain-selling difficulties."    3. As China is a large grain importer, grain trade  protection enables us to acquire grain cheaply. But as trade  protection is eliminated, the general rise in grain prices will  confront us with two options: 1) Paying more money for grain  imports. 2) Reducing imported grain and increasing domestic  grain self-sufficiency. While raising domestic grain  production will require government investment in grain and  higher domestic grain prices, this will mean greater sacrifices  for grain consumers and domestic taxpayers, which would be a  minus for consumers.  <H5>  Adapting to "GATT Reentry" by Intensifying Reform </H5>   1. In light of its basic principles and prerequisites, the  GATT is actually a market-economy-based free trade system. In  respect to this basic principle, China's grain market reforms  are still sharply lagging. While over 700 counties in one-third  of our provinces and cities have deregulated their grain  markets, our basic system still remains a "dual-track one." In  order to join the GATT, we will have to speed up our  market-reform pace as, unless we complete our market reforms  before becoming a GATT member, we will be unable to complete the  linkup of domestic to overseas grain markets.    2. We need to link up our domestic grain market to the  international grain market. This market linkup is based on  China's grain-market reforms achieving the desired result, to  operate through the same forces as the international market.  Completing the domestic-overseas market linkup on this basis  will mean doing the following particular jobs: 1) We will have  to push our grain foreign trade organs and domestic grain  business enterprises toward the market, by establishing a sound  market network oriented to international service. 2) We need to  adjust our grain product mix to raise our grain quality. While  Chinese rice, soybeans, and corn are exportable, their lower  quality leaves them quite lacking in world competitiveness. So  we need to widen the price differences for quality, practicing a  uniform international standard for export grain, and eliminating  the two standards, domestic and overseas. 3) We need to import  overseas fine varieties and grain production technology, to  reach international standards for variety and technology.    3. We need to establish and perfect as quickly as possible  China's two-level grain reserve system. As linking up the two  markets will mean that international grain-price volatility will  spill over domestically, establishing a domestic grain buffer  reserve will help to ease the shock of international grain-price  volatility on our domestic market.</p>

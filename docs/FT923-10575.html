			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Mexican threat over Irish beef The Mexican government is threatening to confiscate and destroy about 5,000 tonnes of Irish beef, worth about Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.2m), which has been exported to Mexico by meat export companies in Denmark, Ireland and Britain, according to Mr Niels Juul, of the Danish Bacon and Meat Council, write Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen and Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The beef, from EC intervention stocks, is at present either in cold store in Mexico or on ships waiting in the Mexican port of Tampico. However, a Mexican official denied yesterday that the government intended to destroy or confiscate the meat. Of the shipment, 524 tonnes would be allowed to be sold; 2,300 tonnes would have to be sent back immediately and the rest at a later date to Ireland. Samples of the meat had been tested and found biologically contaminated. In the EC view, increasing resistance among Mexican farmers to beef imports from European stocks appears to be behind the Mexican action.</p>

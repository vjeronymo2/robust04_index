			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Guarantor who had to pay Several years ago, I agreed to be a guarantor in respect of a company overdraft. But the business failed and I was obliged to compensate the bank to the full extent of my guarantee. Is it possible for the sum thus paid to be used in offsetting a current liability for capital gains tax? If so, are copies of correspondence sufficient evidence to forward with my tax return? And can the 'loss' be indexed? There is no indexation relief on guarantor's payments. Section 136(4) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979 (re-enacted as section 253(4) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992) says: 'If, on a claim by a person who has guaranteed the repayment of a loan which is . . . a qualifying loan, the inspector is satisfied that (a) any outstanding amount of, or interest in respect of, the principle of the loan has become irrecoverable from the borrower, and (b) the claimant has made a payment under the guarantee . . . in respect of that amount . . .(then) this act shall have effect as if an allowable loss had accrued to the claimant when the payment was made; and the loss shall be equal to the payment made by him . . . less any contribution payable to him by any co-guarantor in respect of the payment so made.' It is a pity you have waited nearly five years before making your claim. However, you should submit one forthwith, without waiting any longer. In addition to the correspondence, you should give the inspector the name and address of the company and any other details which may help in tracing the company's tax files. The inspector will want to see exactly how the money was used by the company  -to check (for example) that the whole of the payment which you made relates to a 'qualifying loan'. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kinyarwanda </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A meeting has been in progress since 1100. The  meeting is between President Juvenal Habyarimana and the leaders  of the five political parties participating in the current  government, namely the Revolutionary National Movement for  Democracy and Development [MRND], Republican Democratic Movement  [MDR], Social Democratic Movement [PSD], Liberal Party [PL] and  the Christian Democratic Party [PDC].    The president said at the beginning of the meeting that the  agenda consisted of two items. The first item was to see how  the current government could function so that, pending the  establishment of the transitional government, our country could  be saved from slipping into anarchy, a process which has already  started due to the current insecurity; to study ways of enabling  the government to function efficiently, so as to halt our  country's economic decline; and to study ways by which the  current government could continue to function well, while  continuing its consultations with the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] in implementing the peace accords. The second item on the  agenda of the meeting between the president of the Republic and  the representatives of the five parties participating in the  government is to seek ways of immediately establishing  broad-based transitional institutions. Here is what the  president of the Republic had to say about the above issues:    [Begin Habyarimana recording] When I called this meeting, I  had two things in mind. [Words indistinct] which are also of  priority importance. But the first thing I see, as we have all  noticed, is that the current government is not operational.  Now, in the face of problems in the areas of security and the  economy, we must look into ways of making the government  operational, so that these problems can be resolved.    If we keep things as they are now, if we do not show the  government how to function, people might turn against each  other, [words indistinct] civil war, leading even to anarchy.  That is the first thing I am concerned about: Our country  should not slip into anarchy.    The second thing is that leadership institutions must be  established, namely, the transitional National Assembly and the  broad-based transitional government. Now, why have they not yet  been put in place? How can we speed up the process? This is  another thing we can study.    Some have asked why we did not invite the RPF to this  meeting. As far as I am concerned, the work of the current  government does not concern the RPF at all. It concerns the  parties which formed the government. There are two sides which  are party to the peace agreement, the government and the RPF.  When our problems are solved....[pauses] You see, if you ask  the RPF why things are not making any progress, they answer: We  do not have any problems. The problem is with the government  side. So you people who formed the government are the ones who  should study the problems of the government side and try to find  solutions. [passage indistinct]    Once the government's problems have been solved and it feels  that the remaining institutions can be set up swiftly, then we  will call the RPF and tell them that the problems that existed  on the government side have been solved, so come along so that  we can establish....[pauses] Otherwise, if you call them, they  have their proposals and they put them forward, but the  government side does not have proposals [words indistinct]. So  let us look for proposals, [words indistinct] on the government  side. Once we have them, [words indistinct], even tomorrow,  although I have another program for tomorrow, then on Sunday [27  February], maybe if we schedule it for the afternoon, although  you might say Habyarimana is putting pressure on us. I will do  what you decide upon, but do not say that I am putting pressure  on you after I have agreed on matters with you. What is needed  is to see how the current government can solve the existing  problems, and that is why I (?invited) the prime minister, who  heads the government pending the establishment of these  institutions, although we want them set up swiftly but only  after settling the problems facing the government. [end  recording]    It is worth noting that the meeting was attended by both  prime ministers, that of the current transitional government,  Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and that of the broad-based transitional  government, Faustin Twagiramungu; representatives of the MRND,  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Edouard Karemera, Ferdinand Kabagema and  Joseph Nzirorera; representatives from the MDR party included  Dismas Nsengiyaremye, Frodwald Karamira and Donat Murego; the  PDC was represented by Jean-Nepomucene, [name indistinct] and  (Theobald Rwasa); the PL was represented by Justin Mugenzi,  Landwald Ndasingwa, Stanislas Mbonampeka and Agnes Ntamabyaliro;  for PSD there was Frederic Nzamurambaho, Felicien Ngango,  Theoneste Gafaranga, and Emerance Mutuyimana; on the side of the  presidency of the Republic there was Enock Ruhigira and Juvenal  Renzaho. We have just learned that the meeting has ended. We  will give you a report on it in our 2100 news bulletin tonight.</p>

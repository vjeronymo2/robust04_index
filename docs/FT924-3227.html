			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Prepared for worst at any time: The businessman Michael Winterflood, managing director, Cannon Steels, structural steel fabricator, north London. 'We have definitely put off decisions. Anything could happen for the worse at any time. I certainly can't see it changing for the better. What we have got now is what we have to live with. We are never going to see the 1980s again. 'We aren't going to take on any more labour. There was a time when we made long-term decisions, but at the moment we will book a Christmas drink and that is about it. The one thing that would help is the one thing the government can't do - and that is to promise not to put interest rates back up again now. No one believes that they won't. I can just see Norman Lamont appearing on the steps of the Treasury in two years' time to explain why they have reversed the cuts. 'I don't think people are convinced by the latest reductions. I'm sure they were done in good faith, but people don't think they will still be this low in two years' time. If you knew rates would stay put, you might consider buying that new machine or taking on that extra worker. 'People are not ambitious any more. All they want to do is preserve what they have got. They look at people speeding ahead and think they will soon come a cropper.'</p>

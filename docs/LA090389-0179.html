			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. TACKLES 'WHOLE LANGUAGE' REFORM;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS CLOSING BOOK ON 'DICK AND JANE' ERA  </P> <P> When Orange County's 28 school districts open for the fall semester this week,  students and their teachers will return to a near-revolution in education.  </P> <P> From high school accounting classes to elementary school art courses, a  fundamental change is taking place in schools this year in the way children  learn to read and write. Called the "whole language" approach to education, it  is part of a series of statewide reforms. And for one thing, it means no more  "Dick and Jane."  </P> <P> Spelling and grammar textbooks are out. Whole literary works are in for  elementary schoolchildren. High school students will have to do more writing in  all their classes, from industrial arts to physical education.  </P> <P> "We no longer will have a (primer) that has stuff like, 'See Spot run,' or that  asks you five spelling words," said Dennis Gibbs, director of elementary  education for Irvine Unified School District. "There no longer will be a  vocabulary list that every fifth-grader should know. Now, you will read a piece  of literature, and within that context you learn spelling words, you learn  vocabulary."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Back to Basics  </P> <P> This new approach is part of the state's back-to-basics reforms, which call for  changes in the language arts curriculum this year. Some school districts are  implementing the program in stages, but in just about every Orange County  district, teachers have been preparing for the new wave by attending workshops  and seminars all summer.  </P> <P> As teachers last week readied new lesson plans and attended one last seminar on  the sweeping reforms before the opening of school, administrators grappled with  other pressing issues, such as growth. Enrollment overall in county schools  will increase by nearly 2%, to 353,522, but it marks the sixth consecutive year  of growth in the schools.  </P> <P> For Capistrano Unified School District in the fast-growing South County, it  meant adding 52 portable classrooms, or the equivalent of two elementary  schools.  </P> <P> "South County is booming, there's no getting around it," said Jackie Cerra,  spokeswoman for the Capistrano district, where enrollment this fall is  projected to jump 8% over last year, making it one of the fastest growing  districts in Orange County. (Placentia Unified leads the county with a  projected growth this fall of 9%, but much of that is attributed to its merger  with Yorba Linda School District.)  </P> <P> The Santa Ana Unified School District, the county's largest, is opening a new  high school -- the all high-tech Century High in southeastern Santa Ana -- as  part of an ambitious building plan to accommodate continued growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> South County Growth  </P> <P> And the problem of growth is expected to get worse before it gets better. A  state report released two weeks ago that examined birth rates and population  trends predicts Orange County school enrollment will soar 27% in the next  decade.  </P> <P> Yet at the other end of the scale, a handful of Orange County districts are  suffering from a decade of deep declines in enrollment, and as a result, are  struggling to make ends meet without cutting into educational programs.  Huntington Beach Union High School District, for example, will begin the school  year with about 50 fewer teachers than last year. The cutbacks -- both through  attrition and laying off of temporary teachers -- has prompted students and  parents to protest that many of the school's best and brightest teachers were  leaving, jeopardizing arts and science programs.  </P> <P> Still, the biggest change facing students and their teachers this year is the  new emphasis on reading and writing.  </P> <P> The subjects aren't new to schools, of course. But this year, spelling, grammar  and phonics no longer will be taught separately; instead, they will be taught  as part of learning to read books or excerpts from literary works. And students  will be have to write about what they learn. At both junior high and high  school levels, writing and more reading will be emphasized throughout the  curriculum.  </P> <P> For the Garden Grove Unified School District, the reforms meant spending $1.5  million to buy all new textbooks for language arts throughout the schools. And  these new books are, for the most part, anthologies of literature, not texts  produced for the express purpose of teaching a particular skill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reading-Writing Emphasis  </P> <P> Last year, four Garden Grove schools instituted the new curriculum as a pilot  program. Now, every school in the district will emphasize reading and writing.  And writing will be emphasized in every class, not just in courses in language  arts.  </P> <P> "We're all using writing as a tool for learning, because writing mirrors  thinking," Michael Carr, a writing specialist who is also a teacher in  Carlsbad, told a group of 45 Garden Grove teachers at one workshop last week.  </P> <P> "There is nothing wrong in the way you and I were taught, but there was an  over-reliance on testing, an over-reliance on short answers," Carr told them.  "You need to know that what we got was an emphasis on editing skills, not on  thinking skills."  </P> <P> Instead, Carr said, teachers should be making assignments that encourage  creativity and challenge thinking in all subject areas.  </P> <P> Even in her computer and business accounting classes, teacher Benita Dill of La  Quinta High School in the Garden Grove district said the new curriculum will be  evident.  </P> <P> "Take accounting: You might ask the students to write about the difference  between manual accounting and computerized accounting; and why they think one  method is better than the other," she said. "We don't want them just  regurgitating something. We want them to show us, not just tell us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Work for Teachers  </P> <P> The new curriculum also means more work for teachers.  </P> <P> More writing means more papers to grade, Dill said. If a teacher has 150  students a week, the workload can be formidable. For some, it also may mean  rewriting lesson plans they have relied on for years.  </P> <P> "In Garden Grove, the staff is getting older, and I would imagine that there is  some resistance to this," she said. "It's a lot of work, and I know some  teachers are looking at some of the models and saying, 'Oh, my God, I've got  enough to do already.' "  </P> <P> The whole-language approach signals a swing of the educational pendulum from  the methods of the '70s, when reading and writing was taught by breaking the  task into small, measurable skills such as diagraming sentences.  </P> <P> Educators say poor test scores showed what a dismal failure that approach was.  And a 1985 national study, "On Becoming a Nation of Readers," revealed that 70%  of the reading time in elementary classrooms was devoted to tasks such as  filling in blanks or underlining answers on work sheets.  </P> <P> A key aim of the new approach is to teach writing skills within the context of  real literature, said Susan Despenas, deputy administrator in the elementary  division for Santa Ana Unified, which is spending $38 per elementary student on  anthologies.  </P> <P> "We want kids to love to read -- that's the bottom line," Despenas said. "In  order to do that, they have to learn to appreciate literature. We want to make  them lifelong readers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Wanting More'  </P> <P> Irvine Unified's Gibbs said the materials used in school should leave the  students wanting more.  </P> <P> "We won't even pass out the books (on) the first day of school. We want to  explain to them what they're getting, because we want them to get excited," he  said. "We want parents to say, 'My child is dying to get that book and start  reading.' Maybe this will be the first time in recent memory where that is  happening."  </P> <P> Gibbs said they hope to "encourage children to listen, to speak, to write and  to think when they are interacting with literature."  </P> <P> "The intent is to make reading and this whole process come alive -- to make it  as exciting for children as it is for people who are avid readers when they  enjoy reading a good piece of literature," he said.  </P> <P> In Capistrano Unified schools, teachers will be reading from 3-by-3-foot  versions of books such as "Amelia Bedelia" for second-graders or "Horton  Hatches the Egg" for first-graders, while students follow in their own, smaller  versions of the same book.  </P> <P> Afterward, they might listen to tape recordings that explore some of the  phonics used in the stories, or work on computers to compose stories, with  first-graders using phonetic spellings where they have to, said Bill Eller,  assistant superintendent in charge of instruction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Risk-Free Environment'  </P> <P> "We want to teach them to write in a risk-free environment," he said,  explaining that spelling will be emphasized more in second grade and beyond.  "They (first-graders) can read their own stories beautifully, even if we can't  understand them, and children can read each other's stories, and they make  absolutely perfect sense."  </P> <P> In Eller's view, it's time that teaching methods for reading and writing caught  up with the complex world of fast-paced communication in which today's children  live.  </P> <P> "Many teachers have taught reading or learned to read the way you and I did --  'See Dick Run.' But if you think about that concept for a moment, it's very  simplistic way to look at the world, in three-word sentences," he said.  </P> <P> "There is this complex world out there and these kids can absorb it. Kids can  communicate in the sophisticated world and they operate quite nicely. But  somehow, with the (old style textbooks), we restrict them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ENROLLMENT IN ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unified School Districts (grades K-12)  </P> <TABLE

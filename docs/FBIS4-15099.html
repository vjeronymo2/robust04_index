			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By parliamentary correspondent ITAR-TASS Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 5 Apr -- "Because of the unacceptability of  certain points," deputies of the Federation Council rejected  today a federal law adopted by the State Duma "On Financing  Federal Budget Spending in the Second Quarter of 1994."    In accordance with the Russian Federation Constitution, in  this situation, chambers "can set up a conciliatory commission  in order to overcome the differences." Deputies have instructed  the budget committee to start negotiations with the State Duma  regarding forming such a commission and preparing a new version  of the two points of the law, which the Federation Council has  rejected.    This decision was made five minutes before the lunch break  in  the chamber's day session. Sergey Aleksashenko, deputy finance  minister, informed deputies that because there was no federal  law on financing in the second quarter, the ministry will stop  "as of tomorrow morning all financing operations, starting with  the salary of the Russian Federation president." He explained  that the Finance Ministry needs a law entitling it to spend  money. However, there was no reaction from deputies rushing out  for lunch.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOOK FOR THE UNION LABEL  </P> <P> Workers of the world -- at least those who own a VCR -- unite. Celebrate Labor  Day this year with an appropriate home video.  </P> <P> Plenty of films touch on the life and times of the American labor movement. A  good place to start is with two dynamic portrayals of two hard-working stiffs  as different as night and day:Marlon Brando's poor waterfront roustabout and  Sally Field's poor Southern textile worker.  </P> <P> "On the Waterfront" (1954, 108 minutes, "CA/Columbia Pictures tape and laser  video disc)is Budd Schulberg's brutally raw account of New York harbor unions.  </P> <P> This Academy Award-winning film (eight Oscars including best picture) boasts  one of the mostimpressive casts ever assembled for a motion picture: the  unforgettable Marlon Brando as theaverage Joe who finally takes on a corrupt  labor boss (Lee J. Cobb in one of his nastiestportrayals); Rod Steiger as  Brando's brother (to whom ex-boxer Brando moans in one of thefilm's most  lampooned scenes, 'Charlie, oh Charlie, you don't understand. I coulda had  class.I coulda been a contenduh'); Eva Marie Saint as his innocent girlfriend,  and Karl Malden as thefrustrated priest. They were directed by Elia Kazan in  his prime, with powerful music byLeonard Bernstein and stunning black-and-white  cinematography by Boris Kaufman.  </P> <P> "Norma Rae" (1979, 113 minutes, CBS/Fox Home Video tape and laser video disc)  makes viewers want to stand up and shout for workers' rights. Ron Leibman  offers a realistic portrait of a labor organizer who cares more about the cause  than the people in that cause, who recruits Sally Field and shepherds her into  the fight against management.  </P> <P> Field offers a sympathetic portrait of a woman fighting for what she believes  is right against almost impossible odds, both in the factory and at home.  </P> <P> This Martin Ritt film and the Kazan film are perfect for the small screen  because they focus on relationships.  </P> <P> "Blue Collar" (1978, 114 minutes, MCA tape and laser video disc) is a blunt  look at assembly-line worker oppression. Integrated into a melodrama involving  three car factory workers who finally resort to robbery, "Blue Collar" is a  gutsy look at union and management, each ripping off the worker who is caught  in the middle. Paul Schrader overdirected this ripe melodrama. Richard Pryor,  Harvey Keitel and Yaphet Kotto offer first-rate performances.  </P> <P> "F.I.S.TS (1978, l45 minutes, CBS-Fox tape and laser video disc) is Norman  Jewison's well-intentioned, well-produced story of the rise and fall of a union  boss. But this ambitious portrait of a Jimmy Hoffa-like labor leader isn't  helped much by Sylvester Stallone's one-dimensional performance. Peter Boyle  shows what the film could have been as a Teamster boss.  </P> <P> "Black Fury" (1935, 92 minutes, Key Video tape) is a dated yet still effective  picture about strikes, with Paul Muni as a coal miner who champions safe  working conditions as he goes up against union corruption.  </P> <P> If all of this is too serious for you on a day of rest, then try the lighter  side of the working class. "9 to 5" (1980, llO minutes, CBS-Fox tape and laser  video disc) is the working woman's revenge on an insufferably pompous male  boss. Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda are the three office women who  plot to get rid of Dabney Coleman.  </P> <P> "The Pajama Game" (1964, 85 minutes, Warner tape and laser video disc) is the  1957 Broadway musical screen version of workers in a pajama factory who demand  a pay raise. Doris Day and John Raitt are symbols of labor and management and  their love-hate relationship seems appropriate. The songs make the film  memorable, including "Hey, There," and "Steam Heat."  </P> <P> "I'm All Right, Jack" (1960, 104 minutes, British, HBO tape) is the classic  1959 British satire on labor-management relations in England. Peter Sellers'  labor leader will be a familiar figure to anyone working on either side of the  Atlantic. The cast is in top form: Terry-Thomas, Richard Attenborough and  Margaret Rutherford.  </P> <P> Two more films, each more than a half-century old, are so funny they just might  remind you that things may not have changed that much after all. Rene Clair's  1931 "A Nous la Liberte" (87 minutes, Hollywood Home Theater tape) is a classic  satire on the machine age. It was one of the inspirations for Charlie Chaplin's  "Modern Times" (1936, 89 minutes, Playhouse tape and disc) in which an assembly  line worker goes berserk. Chaplin's last silent film (with music and sound  effects added), it is an attack on the machine age many workers still will  appreciate.  </P></p>

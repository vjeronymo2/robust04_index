			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: French want 'good compromise' PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand said yesterday France wanted a 'good compromise' in global trade negotiations, but declined to predict whether a Uruguay Round accord would be ready by December 15, Reuter reports from Stockholm. On a visit to Sweden, Mr Mitterrand said France had a legal right to veto a US-EC accord on cutting farm production and subsidies, but would prefer not to do this.</p>

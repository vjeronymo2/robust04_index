			<p>BFN     [Text] All diplomatic and service passports will change as  of 1 April, but ordinary passports will continue to be valid.    Manuchehr Mottaki, Iranian deputy foreign affairs minister  for legal, consular and parliamentary affairs said the reason  for the changing of passports was to insert concepts of the  Islamic system and stop possible misuse.    Mr. Mottaki added: The new diplomatic and service passports  will be introduced as of 1 April, and ordinary passports from  the second half of the current [Iranian] year [beginning 21  September]. He added: The diplomatic and service passports of  the government employees serving abroad are valid until the end  of the current year [ending 20 March 1995] and the government  employees who have received visas from other countries and are  still in Iran will be given new passports.    On the characteristics of the new passports, Mr. Mottaki  said: The new passports are smaller than the old ones. They  have been given special numbers, and certain chemical substances  have been used to reduce the possibility of forging or misusing  them to zero.    He stressed: In order to expand our consular cooperation and  ties in a principled manner, we welcome the removal of visa  restrictions with some countries.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / People: Sword gives edge to Hall's board John Sword, former chief executive of Massey Ferguson, has joined the board of Hall Engineering (Holdings), taking over as managing director of the Shrewsbury-based group on October 31. Hall, whose interests range from steel stockholding to construction products and automotive engineering, head-hunted Sword. The current managing director, Brian Hinkins, retires this month having reached 65. He will stay on the board until next April's annual general meeting. Sword, 51, below, is a well-known name in industry, especially in agricultural and construction equipment, after 11 years at Massey. He left the Midlands-based, US-owned tractor maker in July last year and spent several months developing a Pounds 230m buy-out of the company from its parent, Varity Corporation. To Sword's intense disappointment, however, Varity sold Massey this April to Atlanta-based Agco, even though the European investor group led by Sword claimed to be offering a higher price. Sword has a strong management record from his years at Massey, and in a previous nine-year spell at GEC, where he was managing director of Ruston Diesels on Merseyside. Appointed to run Ruston at the age of 30, Sword transformed its fortunes, quadrupling sales and restoring profitability.</p>

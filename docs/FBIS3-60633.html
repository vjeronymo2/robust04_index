			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong] </F>   [Text] A rumor from the Washington political circle  strongly suggests that South and North Korea are seeking the  resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue through secret,  behind-the-scene contacts, in addition to the on-going  working-level contacts between the United States and North Korea  in New York. The observation is gaining unusual interest.    According to a reliable source in Washington on 30 November,  working-level representatives of the ROK and North Korea are  discussing pending issues, including the resolution of the North  Korean nuclear issue which is at a stalemate, and the resumption  of the South-North dialogue, in either Seoul, Pyongyang, or a  third country city such as Beijing or Moscow. The source says  there is also a possibility that a secret nuclear envoy of the  ROK Government might have been in North Korea and have had  contacts with high-ranking North Korean officials to seek a  breakthrough in the nuclear issue. It is also rumored, but not  confirmed, that the ROK side's representative to the contact  with North Korea is one of President Kim Yong-sam's aides whose  surname initial is "H" or "J".</p>

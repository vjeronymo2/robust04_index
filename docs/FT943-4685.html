			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Takeover talk fills gap as trading slows Wall Street Stocks drifted to mixed levels yesterday afternoon as a softer dollar prompted further weakness in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.12 higher at 3,898.70, thanks to strong showings by a few blue chip stocks. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up just 0.87 at 471.86 and declining issues led Big Board advances by 1,129 to 960. New York SE volume was a sluggish 199.9m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged ahead 0.46 to 456.00 and the Nasdaq composite hardened 0.25 to 759.48. On the morning after the long Labor Day weekend, stocks had difficulty in mustering any forward momentum. The negative tone which had dominated Friday's session continued to hold sway, with the market still confused by the damage which had followed the release of last week's employment data. Even though the Labor Department report showed much weaker than expected growth in payrolls last month, it also included some worrying signs of incipient inflation. That news triggered a moderate sell-off in bonds, which in turn dragged down share prices. Yesterday, the decline in bonds showed no signs of abating. With no fresh economic figures due out until the end of the week, attention instead shifted to the foreign exchange markets, where the US currency slipped against the yen and D-Mark. As the Treasury bonds fell anew, stocks searched in vain for any news which might lift sentiment. Takeover speculation again helped to fill the void. In the session's most attention-grabbing development, shares in Hilton Hotels surged Dollars 5 1/2 , or 9.3 per cent, to Dollars 64 1/4 on a published report which claimed that an investment group was seeking to buy the hotel company and split it up. Meanwhile, Eastman Kodak climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 after agreeing to sell its clinical diagnostics business to Johnson &amp; Johnson for Dollars 1bn. J&amp;J softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 50. Two other stocks helped to push the Dow Industrial Average firmly into the positive side. American Express gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 30 1/4 as investors welcomed the company's plan to issue a new credit card. General Motors contributed to the index's upturn by advancing Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 after posting a 22 per cent increase in August car sales. Chrysler appreciated Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/2 on a 9 per cent sales improvement. Technology shares were mixed. In semiconductors, Texas Instruments retreated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 74 5/8 while Motorola moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 53 1/4 . Canada Toronto share prices were mixed in moderate trading, as late buying lifted the key index into positive territory. The TSE 300 composite index finished a slight 2.95 points ahead at 4,347.17 but losing issues outscored rises by 388 to 321. Volume amounted to 53.9m shares valued at CDollars 593m. Overall, eight of the 14 sub-indices ended higher, with the gold, transportation and forestry groups leading the way. The gold shares index put on 1.5 per cent as the New York spot gold price gained 80 cents at USDollars 388.25 an ounce. Real estate stocks had the day's biggest decline, 1.0 per cent.</p>

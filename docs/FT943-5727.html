			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television Tom Vernon says that a bicycle is not for going places, a bicycle is for stopping, and that principle has already led to him presenting a string of entertaining series. If you feel, as I do, that Fat Man In France which begins this evening must be a repeat, the reason is that Vernon began as a radio person and won awards for his 'Fat Man On A Bicycle' series which did, indeed, include France. He begins his television series, now as director and producer as well as presenter, in Brittany (7.30 BBC1). It sounded as though Channel 4 had invented yet another way of avoiding the word 'repeat' when it decided to call five programmes from the early 1960s The Lost Betjemans, but there does seem to be some justification in this instance. Devoted to five towns in the west country, they have not previously been nationally networked. They begin (8.00) with Marlborough where the poet went to school. The third series tonight depending upon the eye of the idiosyncratic onlooker is Michael Moore's TV Nation (9.30 BBC2). It investigates the peculiar passion of so many ex public schoolboys for the swish of bamboo on buttock.</p>

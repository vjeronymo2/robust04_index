			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (5): Less grim than signs suggest - The Corporate Sector ANYONE who read the recent round of interim statements from the heads of large French companies could be forgiven for thinking that corporate France was in a sorry state. The French economy is still in recession. There is no sign of an upturn in domestic demand and the franc is too strong to trigger an increase in exports. The companies quoted on the CAC-40 Index are now nearing the end of their fourth successive year of earnings decline. Yet the full picture is not quite as grim as the interim statements suggest. Analysts have already written off 1993 as yet another year of depressed earnings, but they expect 1994 to mark the start of the recovery. Moreover corporate France is in sound financial shape. The corporate sector is now in a positive cash position for the first time in decades, according to the Bank of France. These positive signs have sent the CAC-40 Index soaring for much of this year. Foreign investors, particularly the US and UK institutions, have poured new capital into France. A number of French companies, notably the Axa insurance group and Schneider electrical engineering concern, have taken advantage of their strong share prices by staging capital-raising exercises. The sepia-tinted analysis of the French corporate sector should not be overstated. Many companies are still under intense financial pressure. The domestic market has been sluggish for some time but until last autumn, French industry did at least have the consolation of strong export growth, thanks to the combination of years of low inflation and a competitive currency. Last autumn's currency crisis put a stop to that. The franc's relative strength since September 1993 has not only reduced reported profits from international subsidiaries but has dealt a devastating blow to sales of French products in weaker currency countries such as the UK, Spain and Italy. The export squeeze is one of the main difficulties facing LVMH, the luxury goods group, which recently issued a profits warning for the full year after announcing a fall in first half profits. Peugeot, the car maker, blamed adverse exchange rates for its first half losses, as did Michelin, the tyre group. Renault, the other major French motor company, saw its recovery checked by a steep fall in interim net profits. The picture is equally bleak on the domestic front. Consumer spending is still stubbornly static. There is also no sign of an increase in industrial investment, partly because French companies are continuing to bask in the benefits of their heavy investment in the late 1980s and partly because the depressed state of demand leaves them with little incentive to increase capacity. A number of retail groups, including Pinault-Printemps and BHV, have recently announced reduced interim profits. The banking and insurance groups are still being forced to make steep provisions because of the property crisis and the alarming rate of small company failures. Credit Lyonnais, the most vulnerable of the big banks, recently reported a FFr1bn interim net loss. Unsurprisingly, the toll of job losses has continued. The number of people out of work has risen by more than 200,000 since the start of this year to reach over 3.22m, or 11.7 per cent of the workforce. A number of large groups have accelerated their rationalisation drives, including Air France and Michelin. LVMH is embroiled in an ugly battle with the champagne trade unions over its plans to shed staff for the first time in the champagne industry's history. The Balladur government hopes that unemployment will stabilise next year, albeit at a frighteningly high level. Even the most pessimistic private sector economists expect to see some growth for French gross domestic product in 1994. Corporate profits should also improve. James Capel in Paris anticipates a 40 per cent increase in CAC-40 earnings for 1994 (fuelled mainly by the financial sector) after a 14.8 per cent fall in 1993. Corporate activity is already picking up. The government's privatisation drive has triggered a flurry of negotiations over cross-shareholdings and strategic stakes as companies volunteer to be noyaux durs, or 'hard core' shareholders, in the privatisation candidates. The government was spoilt for choice in selecting noyaux durs for Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the first privatisation issue. It is now lining up candidates for future sales. Privatisation has also heralded a series of 'parallel' deals. Renault has finally completed its long-awaited merger with Sweden's Volvo. Union des Assurances de Paris speeded up talks with the Suez holding company to finalise its deal over control of Colonia, the German insurer, before its privatisation gets under way. Meanwhile Lafarge Coppee and Generale des Eaux have joined the queue of private sector companies raising capital from the Paris markets, so that they can take advantage of any strategic opportunities that arise while the franc is still strong and the stock market is buoyant.</p>

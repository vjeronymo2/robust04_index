			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Environmental Minister Toepfer Opens First </F> German Plastics Hydrogenation Facility in Bottrop    [TEXT]Bottrop--With a symbolic push of the button, on  April 12th in Bottrop the Minister for the Environment Prof. Dr.  Klaus Toepfer set in operation the first commercial installation  for recycling plastic packaging as raw material. For Dr.  Eberhard von Perfall, as CEO of Ruhrkohl Umwelt GmbH in Essen,  this was the realization of a "dream of true recycling": 32,000  metric tons of synthetic oil will now be produced from 40,000  metric tons of mixed plastic waste annually.    Two years ago Wolfram Brueck was happy that the operators of  the Bottrop coal-oil facility (KAB) were able to show him a way  out of the terrible dilemma of waste disposal of mixed plastic  waste. This was because the Managing Director of Dual Systems  Deutschland (DSD) in Cologne did not find in the plastics  industry nearly the recycling capacity urgently needed for  long-term compliance with the recycling quotas set by the  legislature. With the start of using plastic as raw material in  Bottrop, he can now believe in a change. Since the beginning of  the year, the KAB has been changing polymer packaging waste back  into syncrude [synthetic crude oil]--a recycling product which  is scarcely distinguishable from light mineral oil and can be  used again without loss in quality as a high-grade oil refinery  product.    Eight hundred kg of oil are produced from one metric ton of  mixed plastic, according to the estimate of the current  facility's level of efficiency in processing material made by  Dr. Eberhard von Perfall to the guests at the official start of  operations on April 12th. At the same time, the CEO of Ruhrkohle  Umwelt GmbH in Essen, which operates the facility together with  Veba Oil AG, Gelsenkirchen, stressed the great gain in energy.  He claims that only about 10% of the energy content (in  terms  of the energy which would be released if the plastic waste were  incinerated) is lost though hydrogenation.    "We are not in essence entering new territory here," said  Dr.  Hubert Heneka referring to the already tested technique.  According to the President and CEO of Veba Oil AG, a technique  which has been refined over decades is being used to solve a  current waste problem: the reconversion of used packing plastic  back into the original oil components. Using the modified  Bergius Pier process, from 1981 to 1987 the KAB already  converted around 250,000 metric tons of hard coal into liquid  products. After coal hydrogenation could no longer be continued  for economic reasons, the operators modified the facility for  hydrogenation of petroleum residue using the Veba-Combi-Cracking  process(VCC). In 1991 authorization for processing used waste  oil, used solvents, and varnish or paint sludge was broadened to  include the recycling of materials containing PCP.    In April of 1992 the recycling of plastic waste was at last  at hand. The insensitivity of the VCC process toward the content  of the material involved was the technical prerequisite [for  this to work], the pressure for recycling coming from the  government's packing guidelines was the economic prerequisite. A  major trial which was carried out at that time in which for the  first time 60 metric tons of plastic waste was hydrogenated  together with heavy petroleum residue confirmed the basic  suitability of the process. But according to Heneka, it also  made it clear that procedural steps developed for coal  hydrogenation were too expensive for industrial recycling of  plastic waste. Therefore an primary system had to be  conceptualized and made, by means of which the polymers supplied  as granular material are transferred as a fluid permitting them  to be pumped together with the petroleum residue into the  hydrogenation section. Heneka: "It is only this newly developed  step in the process, the depolymerization, which now satisfies  the requirement of recycling five metric tons per hour on a  continuous basis."    After 12 months under construction, the expanded facility  with a total annual capacity of around 200,000 metric tons was  ready for operation to recycle 40,000 metric tons of waste  plastic per year. Operators had invested around 20 million  German marks in modifications of the KAB, particularly in the  core of the plastic preparation process, the depolymerization  reactor.    Here, completely cut off from the external world, the large  plastic molecules are thermally split at temperatures of 350 to  400C, so that they can be pumped without problem along with  vacuum residue, additives and hydrogen into the actual  hydrogenation system.    In the hydrogenation reactor, syncrude (synthetic crude  oil),  hydrocarbon gas and hydrogenated bitumen are produced at a  processing pressure of 300 bar and [a temperature of] 470C.  The hydrochloric acid released from the PVC during  depolimerization is reclaimed as liquid hydrochloric acid in an  auxiliary system and handed over marketing.    A pipeline directly links the KAB with the nearby [oil  refinery of] Ruhroel-Raffinerie in Scholven. In conjunction with  the Kokerei Prosper [coke-oven plant], the delivery of the  product as well as the service of the facility is thus  efficiently assured.    Still, the KAB operators have not yet passed the break-even  point in plastic waste recycling. With an annual throughput of  40,000 metric tons of plastic waste, the syncrude produced in  the Bottrop hydrogenation plant is about three to four times as  expensive as comparable crude oil on the Rotterdam market. Dr.  Hubert Heneka: "We currently need a turnover of around 800 GM  [German marks] per metric ton. But we want to take the offensive  in this business and ensure for ourselves a large share of the  market in plastic waste recycling." The speaker from Veba Oil  hopes to be able to cut costs in half if the legal requirements  for expanding the capacity can be managed quickly with the city  of Bottrop. Presuming that a rapid agreement can be reached, an  annual capacity of 120,000 metric tons for recycling of plastic  as a raw material would already be available in 1995.    But Kurt Schmitz, the mayor of the urban district of  Bottrop,  "has trouble imagining" at this time an expansion of the  facility. Substantial problems with acceptance already had to be  overcome when the KAB first began [working with] the disposal of  problem waste.    Through the contributions made by DSD in recycling, the  process today is, however, already paying off for the operators:  according to the words of its managing director Wolfram Brueck,  Dual System Deutschland currently pays 757 German marks per  metric ton of plastic delivered for recycling in Bottrop. The  common goal is to make it economically competitive with  incineration.    Environmental Minister Toepfer, who put the incineration  costs at around 500 marks per metric ton at this time in  Germany, was convinced at the official start-up of recycling  plastic as raw material in Bottrop: "The horrific numbers of the  high utilization costs are gradually becoming a thing of the  past."</p>

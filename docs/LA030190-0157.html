This month's Interview magazine cover subject is  scheduled to be a guest disc jockey today on WHTZ in New York and he will no  doubt be the target of some jokes when he hosts "Saturday Night Live" on March  17. Lowe's new movie, "Bad Influence," in which he plays a man who videotapes a  couple having sex, opens March 9. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / GKN glee as Westland wins Pounds 190m payout Westland, the UK helicopter manufacturer, yesterday settled a 14-year legal battle with the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation. The AOI has agreed to pay Westland, now part of the engineering group GKN, Pounds 190m in compensation for a cancelled helicopter order in the late 1970s. The deal cuts the Pounds 577m GKN paid for Westland earlier this year. A settlement was signed in London by Mr Alan Jones, a GKN director and former Westland chairman, and senior officials from Egypt and members of the Saudi royal family. It follows a number of court decisions in Westland's favour, most significantly the enforcement of a Pounds 115m interim payment by French authorities in June. The case arose because the AOI dropped an order for 250 Westland Lynx helicopters after Egypt signed the Camp David peace agreement with Israel. Analysts yesterday said they were surprised by the speed of the settlement and suggested that GKN had won control of Westland 'very cheaply'. GKN's chairman, Sir David Lees, said he was delighted with the settlement which was more than he had anticipated when he had bid for Westland in February. 'We bid ex the AOI settlement really, but it has fortunately worked out cum,' he said. Sir David also said the bid materially improved Westland's chances of doing business with the four member states of the AOI - Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. City analysts think that Saudi Arabia offers the best prospect of export sales, with the kingdom thought to be interested in the anti-submarine warfare version of Westland's EH101 helicopter. When GKN bid for Westland, shareholders were offered 335p a share in cash by GKN or 290p plus a share in any AOI settlement. So far additional payments of 60p have been promised, and a final 10p-15p may be possible. Those opting for the AOI settlement would then receive 360p-365p, rather than the 335p cash alternative. However, less than a quarter of 1 per cent of Westland shareholders voted to accept that offer, and GKN will only have to pay out a total of about Pounds 350,000 of the Pounds 190m settlement to shareholders. Sir David acknowledged that he had bought Westland for a very reasonable price and said prospects for other helicopter orders were encouraging. The Apache, which would be made under licence by Westland, is front-runner in the competition for a Pounds 2bn attack helicopter for the British Army. The RAF has shown strong interest in Westland EH101 transport helicopters.</p>

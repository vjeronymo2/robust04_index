			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Eurotunnel stands by projections Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, yesterday firmly stood by the projections given in its May rights issue prospectus as the French markets watchdog began its second inquiry into the company this year. 'The report put together in May contained all the information that we had available at the time,' the company said. 'We said the figures were subject to change but they were right at the time of the rights issue.' The response came after the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French regulator, on Thursday night made public a letter to Eurotunnel announcing the start of an investigation after the close of the London and Paris stock exchanges. It is concerned about the validity of the May projections and why the company did not report sooner on the financial impact of a series of delays since then. The release surprised Eurotunnel, which expressed concern that the details had been made public. However, it is believed that the COB policy over the past few years has been to make release details of any formal inquiries which are wide-ranging and therefore likely to leak out to the press.</p>

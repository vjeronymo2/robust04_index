			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Pay frozen for biggest council's 104,000 staff Strathclyde, Britain's largest council, said yesterday that its 104,000 staff will receive no pay increase this year and blamed the government's capping of its budget. Local government leaders fear that other councils may also find it difficult to meet pay rises of 2 per cent to 3 per cent - while conforming to the government's policy of a freeze on public-sector pay bills - because of budget constraints. Mr Robert Gould, Labour leader of the council which includes Glasgow, said: 'Strathclyde just cannot afford to include pay increases in the council budget this year. It is deplorable that the government have placed us in this difficult position.' Strathclyde's final budget and the size of its regional council tax for the 1994-1995 financial year will be fixed at a special meeting of the council scheduled for March 9. But council leaders said yesterday their budget had been set tightly by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, at Pounds 1.9bn. Every 1 percentage point pay rise would cost the regional council more than Pounds 3m. Councillors say the government's 1994-1995 grant settlement for Strathclyde takes no account of any pay awards for the staff. Mr Gould said: 'We are worried that (the pay freeze) will lower staff morale at a very critical time for local government. Strathclyde remains committed to honouring nationally negotiated pay settlements and we will do everything we can to press the government to provide the necessary resources.' The council's policy and resources committee is demanding that Mr Lang meet local authorities to reconsider what it sees as his failure to include an element for pay within the 1994-1995 grant settlement. Unison, the main public services union, reacted angrily last night to Strathclyde's announcement. Mr Mark Irvine, the union's local government head in Scotland, said: 'The proposed pay freeze is completely unacceptable. We will be seeking an urgent meeting with the secretary of state for Scotland to discuss the financial crisis facing local government in Scotland.' The union said it understood the financial difficulties facing Strathclyde and other councils in Scotland but warned that it could not accept that low-paid local government workers should receive no pay rise at all in 1994.</p>

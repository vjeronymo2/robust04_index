			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Fresh cash for joint Czech and Slovak bank The Czech and Slovak governments have injected new capital and strengthened the balance sheet of Ceskoslovensko Obchodni Banka (CSOB), their jointly-owned foreign trade bank. The move is the latest in a series designed to improve the operational efficiency and profitability of the bank and set it on course for privatisation. The governments have injected Kcs4.05bn (Dollars 135m) into the foreign trade bank of the former Czechoslovak socialist republic, and transferred Kcs40bn of bad and doubtful debt into two new 'collection units,' to be funded and managed by CSOB. The bank also implemented credit write-downs which, together with the capital injection, raised its capital adequacy ratio to 6.25 per cent at the year end. The ratio should rise to 7 per cent by the end of 1994. The bank, which finances over half the foreign trade of both republics, is 73 per cent-owned by the Czech government, which provided Dollars 100m of new capital, and 26 per cent by the Slovak government, which provided the remaining Dollars 35m. One per cent of shares are held by bank employees. It will report an increased operating profit for 1993 before providing for bad debts, but an overall loss for the year. Unlike with other Czech and Slovak banks, which have been permitted to transfer all or part of their bad debts to specially-created consolidation banks, the two governments began to restructure CSOB in December 1992 by assuming liability for Kcs95bn of state-related assets and Kcs74bn of state-related liabilities. These included domestic loans made to state enterprises under the central planning rules, and doubtful foreign loans to former socialist states and big arms purchasers such as Iraq. N. M. Rothschild has been advising the bank on financial restructuring with a view to eventual privatisation.</p>

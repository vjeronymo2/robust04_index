			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 14 May (MTI) -- On authorization from the  Hungarian Government, the Hungarian Embassy in Brussels  forwarded an official communique to the Belgian news agency  BELGA on Saturday, in connection with the articles carried in  the Friday and Saturday issues of the LE SOIR newspaper.    The communique states that the primitive allegations made by  those persons arrested recently by Belgian police in a gold  selling case form a mix of crude lies and fabrications. The  Hungarian authorities firmly reject these, as attempts that are  suited to disrupt the ongoing Hungarian election process, and at  creating a bad reputation for Hungary.    As MTI reported on Friday, Hungary's National Police Command  (NPC) dismissed the Friday news in the Belgian LE SOIR of a coup  being plotted for the second round of Hungarian elections as  totally groundless. LE SOIR said, quoting well-informed  sources, that during an action to thwart the sale of 30 kg of  false gold Belgian security forces had found documents allegedly  referring to plans of purchasing weapons to be used in a "coup  attempt" at run-off elections on May 29.    The Belgian newspaper has not yet provided concrete details  or evidence confirming the news. Police will do its utmost to  prevent the second round of parliamentary elections from being  disturbed by any unexpected events, the NPC said on Friday.    According to a Saturday report filed by MTI's Brussels  correspondent, following the brief report on Friday, LE SOIR  continued the false gold sale affair, and the alleged related  weapons purchasing action, in a more detailed article on  Saturday, but still relying on unofficial sources. Saturday's  article specially mentioned the alleged Hungarian implications.  It was in connection with this that the Hungarian Embassy in  Brussels issued its official denial, based on authorization from  the Hungarian Government.    The article in Saturday's LE SOIR repeats that in the course  of a search carried out in the home of one of the persons  concerned in the selling of false gold, police found a telefax  message about orders for large amounts of ammunition, grenades  and missles, that bore the name of an American weapons trading  firm.    According to the article, two of the five persons arrested  in  the false gold case were Hungarians (a woman and a 50-year-old  man), however, it is not clear from the article if they are  Hungarian citizens or of Hungarian origin only. (The Hungarian  consulate in Belgium does not believe the persons concerned are  Hungarian citizens, as Belgian authorities have in no way  contacted the Hungarian foreign representation in the matter by  Saturday noon, although the arrests were made on Wednesday.)    The article attributes a central role to the "Hungarian"  woman, who heads an export-import office in Munich. The article  mentions as an example that the Belgian man in whose home the  fax message was found confessed that this woman was behind the  order, and that she said she was organizing the transaction on  behalf of the Hungarian Government.    According to LE SOIR, the Belgian man also added that the  woman held out the prospect that the order would be realized  after the second round of the Hungarian parliamentary elections  on May 29.    The Belgian security organs and Interpol are carrying out  coordinated investigations into the affair, writes the Belgian  newspaper. Similary to Friday's LE SOIR article, the Saturday  report also lacks any official confirmation or sources.</p>

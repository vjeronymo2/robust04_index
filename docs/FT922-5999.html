			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brent oil price breaks through Dollars 20 barrier NORTH SEA oil prices broke through the Dollars 20-a-barrel barrier to reach a six-month high following the unexpected agreement by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna last week to roll over its second-quarter output ceiling. Saudi Arabia had widely signalled its intention before the meeting to press for a rise of 1m barrels a day. In the event it agreed to maintain the existing ceiling of 22.98m b/d. Brent crude for July delivery rose 90 cents to Dollars 20.45, the highest price since December last year. 'The market has been very firm, on the conclusion that last week's agreement marks a fundamental shift in Saudi oil policy,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head of Smith Barney's energy desk in London. 'It looks as if there is further pent-up demand, and we could see it reaching Dollars 21 in the short-term.' He warned, however, that it might be premature to talk of a 'fundamental' shift in Saudi policy, or of longer-term increases of Dollars 2 or Dollars 3 in the Brent price. Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson, believed that the agreement 'epitomised Saudi Arabia's willingness to move into line with the Opec majority' and treat Dollars 21 a barrel for the Opec basket of crudes as a real target. That would mean a Brent crude price of around Dollars 23. Analysts point out that Saudi Arabia may indirectly have achieved as much as it wanted without needing to raise the ceiling. The agreement allowed for an increase of 300,000 b/d in Kuwaiti production, while Saudi Arabia said it would continue to produce slightly more oil than it was officially allocated. Most estimates put Opec's true second-quarter output at about 23.5m b/d, likely to rise to 24m b/d by the end of the third quarter. That would effectively be in line with both Saudi wishes and the lower end of expectations of third-quarter demand. However, stock-building before the winter is likely to boost third-quarter demand by at least 500,000 b/d and keep prices firm. Beyond that, observers feel that Saudi Arabia's actions may be explained by short-term political factors - such as a desire to avoid another clash with Iran. The kingdom may also have decided to flex its political muscles and demonstrate the control it - and Opec - can still exert on oil prices before next month's Earth Summit in Rio. Opec is firmly opposed to EC proposals for a carbon tax which it believes would badly hurt its revenues.</p>

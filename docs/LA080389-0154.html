			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY;  </P> <P> RTD SEEKS RULING CHANGE  </P> <P> Two RTD unions have asked a judge to reconsider a ruling that allowed the  Foothill Transit Zone to expand bus service in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow has postponed the effective date of his July  decision from this week to Aug. 11, but will probably make his final decision  by Friday, said William P. Forsythe, Foothill Transit's executive director.  </P> <P> Last month, Chernow ruled that Foothill Transit, a joint operation of 20 area  cities and the county, was legal. Unions representing 7,000 Southern California  Rapid Transit District drivers and mechanics challenged the transit zone's  creation, arguing that it threatened union jobs and was an illegal breakup of  the RTD.  </P> <P> Foothill was approved by the county Transportation Commission, which oversees  county transportation policy, in late 1987 as a low-cost alternative to the  RTD. Since December, Foothill has operated two express routes from Diamond Bar  and Glendora to downtown Los Angeles at lower fares than the RTD had charged.  </P> <P> Noting that the precedent-setting case had political overtones and presented  novel questions of jurisdiction, Chernow originally stayed his decision for two  weeks to allow for an appeal.  </P> <P> Foothill hopes to take over up to 20 of the RTD's San Gabriel Valley lines by  mid-1990, and was expected to enlarge its service by adding five local lines at  the end of August.  </P></p>

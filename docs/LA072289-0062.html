			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET WARSHIPS IN PORT FOR A TASTE OF U.S. HOSPITALITY  </P> <P> With the American flag snapping atop its mainmast, the guided-missile cruiser  Marshal Ustinov, flanked by two smaller Soviet warships, sailed Friday into the  home port of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet on a good-will mission that will give  1,000 Soviet sailors a five-day taste of Virginia hospitality.  </P> <P> "Peace has got to start somewhere," said Todd Oiesen, a 19-year-old fireman  aboard the vessel Harry E. Yarnell, who swapped a white seaman's cap and a can  of Coca-Cola for two colorful pins from a young Soviet sailor.  </P> <P> "This visit is part of making that peace," Oiesen added. "I'm definitely proud  to have them here."  </P> <P> The visit by the Marshal Ustinov, the destroyer Otlichny and the oiler Genrikh  Gasanov marks the first time in 14 years -- and only the second time since  World War II -- that Soviet warships have visited the United States. In 1975,  two guided-missile destroyers spent six days in Boston while two U.S. Navy  vessels sailed to the Soviet port of Leningrad.  </P> <P> The three Soviet ships sailed into a U.S. naval nerve center at a time of great  change in Soviet society, giving the mission more significance than the earlier  visit, U.S. and Soviet officials said.  </P> <P> Yuli Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, who was on hand to  welcome his countrymen, said the visit "underscores the great, deep changes in  Soviet-American relations.  </P> <P> "It is a big event . . . a clear, tangible manifestation of the new spirit, the  new thinking" in relations between the two superpowers, Dubinin said.  </P> <P> From the mightiest officer swathed in gold braid to the lowliest cadet in a  tasseled cap, the Soviet seamen seemed delighted with their new roles as  ambassadors of friendship -- and just as pleased to make port after a 22-day  sail from their home base in the northern reaches of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "Seas and oceans do not only separate continents, they also unite peoples  living on these continents," said Vice Admiral Igor V. Kasatonov, the first  deputy commander in chief of the Soviet Northern Fleet, who oversaw the voyage.  </P> <P> "We stand for converting the seas and oceans of the Earth into the zone of  cooperation, of mutual assistance and friendly contacts," he said.  </P> <P> Kasatonov walked down the Marshal Ustinov's gangplank and was escorted by his  American hosts to a small table bearing a loaf of freshly baked bread and a  dish of salt, traditional Russian tokens of hospitality. Bowing formally,  Kasatonov took a bite of bread and dipped it in the salt.  </P> <P> "I think we're lucky to come here," said Roman Tachenko, a 21-year-old seaman  from a suburb of Odessa. "They are two great countries," he said through an  interpreter. "We must cooperate and solve all great questions together."  </P> <P> Tachenko and his comrades will get to experience everyday life in this city --  scheduled lunches at McDonald's and Domino's Pizza; trips to a shopping mall, a  supermarket and a hardware store, and a minor league baseball game one night.  There are special events as well -- daily excursions to the Busch Gardens theme  park near Williamsburg and a pig roast tonight, complete with an outdoor  concert and fireworks.  </P> <P> "The goal for the Navy and the city has been to put on a show," said Lt. Cmdr.  John W. Lloyd, a Navy spokesman. "We want to look our best."  </P> <P> The Soviets, for their part, are offering public tours of two of their ships  this weekend, although cameras will be prohibited on board. A Soviet  song-and-dance troupe will perform during the visit, backed up by the 20-piece  Soviet Navy band that played Sousa selections at dockside Friday.  </P></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Observer: Oiling wheels The secret's out. Enterprise Oil finance director John Walmsley, who caused a bit of a stir in August by handing in his notice without another job, has resurfaced - back at his old firm. Walmsley, 47, is helping Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair Morton put together a group of City whiz-kids to work on the great ideas starting to flow from Morton's government-sponsored Private Finance Panel. Walmsley has known Morton since his Arthur Andersen days, and Enterprise Oil chairman Graham Hearne, Walmsley's old boss, used to work with Morton at the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation. Helps explain why the PFP has taken rooms in Enterprise's Trafalgar Square HQ. However, Walmsley's willingness to take an unpaid job for the good of the nation is not totally altruistic. His new platform gives him super access to all the nooks and crannies of government, the City and big business. What better way to look for a permanent job?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zoran Grgurevic from Doboj] </F>   [Text] Muslim forces have continued to carry out intensive  attacks on all fronts around Doboj. The fiercest attacks are  taking place on the Ozren-Vozuca front, where the Muslims are  trying to breach the Serbian defense lines from the direction of  Zavidovici and Banovici and thereby link the Zenica and Tuzla  regions. In addition to the Serbian lines, they are also  targeting civilian settlements using shells of every caliber,  filled with chemical agents and chlorine. In order to protect  civilians, some 1,200 children of 1-15 years of age and over  1,000 old and exhausted elderly people and women have been  evacuated to Mount Ozren. The tough Serbian fighters from  Ozren, residents of Vozuca, are in position. They are fighting  so that their families can return home.    Unfortunately, among the Muslims there are also the  so-called  peacekeepers. The Muslims were not only satisfied with attacks  on Vozuca. After their attacks on the Teslic front failed, they  turned their guns on Teslic itself and have intermittently,  every hour, been shelling the city center. They have been  mercilessly pounding the town since this morning and using  chemical agents. The command of the army of the Serbian  republic in Teslic has evidence of this. The residents are in  shelters, but the damage to property is enormous. Civilian  casualties have fortunately been only slight. UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] helicopters have been carrying out  reconnaissance flights on the Trebava front, east of Doboj. The  visible concentration of Muslim forces from the direction of  Lukavac indicates that major attacks will take place there, too.    The fighters of the army of the Serbian republic are firmly  holding their lines, ready to launch counterattacks if these  attacks on the headquarters of the army of the Serbian republic  continue.    This afternoon, Croats, the 110th Brigade of the Croatian  Defense Council from Tesanj, attacked the city center of Doboj,  forcing guests visiting from the Athens district of (Halgoris),  Doboj's twin town, to take refuge in shelters. The shells,  which are still landing on the town, have wounded three  civilians, one seriously.</p>

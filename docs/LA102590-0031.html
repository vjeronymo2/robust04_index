			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PLUTONIUM WASTE CONTAMINATION FOUND NEAR PARIS  </P> <P> Concrete drums containing nuclear waste have leaked plutonium into the ground  near an area where hundreds of children play each day, a newspaper reported  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The daily Le Parisien said the discovery of plutonium in soil samples shows  there is a radioactive threat to residents of Saint Aubin, a town on the  outskirts of Paris.  </P> <P> But the official Atomic Energy Commissariat, in charge of France's nuclear  program, said the plutonium discovered measured well below minimum danger  levels.  </P> <P> Le Parisien reported that an independent German scientific team from the  University of Bremen conducted random samples on about nine pounds of soil  gathered near the site.  </P> <P> About 2,500 concrete barrels containing nuclear waste have been stacked at the  site since the early 1970s.  </P> <P> Le Parisien said at least 500 are cracked and have been leaking radioactive  waste for years.  </P> <P> The energy agency said that the maximum level of radioactive elements found by  the researchers was less than 1/30th of the minimum considered to be dangerous.  </P></p>

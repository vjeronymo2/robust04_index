			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Union links with Tories urged MR DAVID HUNT, the employment secretary, has appealed to the trade unions to cut their exclusive links with Labour in favour of more formal contact with all the main political parties, including the Conservatives. Mr Hunt said: 'The unions have had a very poor return on the money they have invested in the Labour party and now they are getting cold-shouldered. 'If the trade union movement really means business it should detach itself from the Labour party and should set up links with the Conservatives and all main political parties.' Mr Hunt, who had a close working relationship with the Welsh TUC when he was Welsh secretary, stressed that 'my door is always open' to Mr John Monks, who takes over as TUC general secretary next month. He said: 'The trade union movement now has an unrivalled opportunity to build a more positive and constructive dialogue with employers and the government.' Union leaders will be suspicious of Mr Hunt's overtures, especially as his predecessor Mrs Gillian Shephard sounded equally positive but then passed what the unions regard as another round of repressive employment legislation. Mr Hunt does not rule out further legislation but said that after consultation with unions and employers 'the message coming across is that there should be a time for reflection and consoli-dation'. Union leaders will be reassured by that. They have also expressed interest in Mr Hunt's recent statements supporting a world social charter and a national consensus on tackling long-term unemployment. On unemployment he said: 'There is undoubtedly more that can be done to reduce the barriers to people returning to work - but such action does have a price.' Following a recent trip to America he said he was particularly interested in the practice of 'mentoring' by which companies adopted long-term unemployed people. Monday interview, Page 28</p>

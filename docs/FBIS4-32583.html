			<p>BFN     [Text] Tibor Pongracz, chairman of the board of directors  of the State Assets Agency [AVU], has resigned. The state  secretary for privatization is the fourth member of the board of  directors to step down from his position. The 11-member body  has thereby decreased in size to seven.    Tibor Pongracz told NEPSZABADSAG that the prime minister  accepted his resignation with effect from 1 July. The AVU's  board of directors is still capable of making decisions because  six members are sufficient for decisionmaking.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Court rejects base closure challenge The US Supreme Court yesterday rejected a challenge to the complex procedure for agreeing military base closures, saying it had no authority to review the president's decision on the issue, writes George Graham. The challenge, brought by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, threatened to upset the delicate base-closing mechanism, under which the defence secretary presents recommendations for the closure of military bases to an independent commission, which holds public hearings and then draws up its own list. That list is then sent to the president, who may reject it in its entirety but not pick and choose among its recommendations. Congress, too, may reject the whole list, but again, may not pick and choose. The whole procedure was designed to stop members of Congress blocking the closure of military bases within their districts.</p>

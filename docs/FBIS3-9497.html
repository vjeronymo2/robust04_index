			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Podgorica, 23 Mar (TANJUG)--We hope that the  Yugoslav crisis is reaching its final stage, the stage of an  antiwar and political outcome, Montenegrin Foreign Affairs  Minister Miodrag Lekic told POBJEDA today.    He added that it would be logical to expect--following the  agreement on the federal and confederal links between the  Muslims and Croats that enables the Croats in Bosnia to have  state and institutional links with their mother  country--something similar to be offered to the Serbs also so  that they can link up with their natural homeland, Serbia. By  taking such an approach, the international community, while in a  way restoring Yugoslavia--that is, linking parts of that  formerly complex country--wants to prevent the creation of an  Islamic fundamentalist Bosnia and to secure natural links  between identical peoples.    Asked whether Montenegro's Ministry for Foreign Affairs will  be disbanded, Lekic categorically said that the ministry was  working as usual and that the termination of its work and  existence was totally out of the question.

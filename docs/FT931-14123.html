			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Higgs and Hill The flurry of excitement surrounding housebuilder Berkeley Group and Higgs and Hill was over almost before it started yesterday. Berkeley sold its stake in Higgs at a tidy profit as soon as market awareness of its interest caused a spike in the price. Nevertheless, the episode highlights anomalies in the valuation of some construction companies. Many housebuilders have long traded at a sizeable discount to stated assets  -and with good reason. The market has been unable to assess the true worth of assets as companies have collapsed and land prices have crumbled. Valuing shares has been rather like trying to pin the tail to the donkey. But Berkeley's purchase of Higgs' shares was prompted by the belief that the disparity between asset value and share prices had gone too far. With Higgs' sound enough finances and book assets of Pounds 2 per share valued at below 40p, it is difficult to disagree. The point may have been reached when it is cheaper for growing housebuilders, such as Berkeley, to acquire land by buying undervalued rivals than to buy land directly.</p>

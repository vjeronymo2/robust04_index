			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Mitsubishi in Taiwan chip venture - Japanese group makes early foray into Asian semiconductor plant investment Mitsubishi Electric yesterday announced it is to invest in a joint venture semiconductor facility in Taiwan to produce advanced memory chips. It will be one of the first big investments by a Japanese semiconductor maker in an Asian manufacturing facility outside Japan. Mitsubishi is to co-operate with Umax Data Systems, the parent company of Taiwan's largest printed circuit board maker, and Kanematsu, a Japanese trading company. The Taiwanese stake in the joint venture will be about 60 per cent, with Mitsubishi taking 15 per cent, Kanematsu 16 per cent and Japanese venture capital funds the remainder. Mitsubishi's move reflects growing competition in the memory chip market to increase capacity in order to meet forecast demand. It also consolidates Taiwan's status as one of Asia's leading high-technology manufacturing bases. The joint venture facility will be in an industrial park north of Taipei, and will start production of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chips next autumn. Mitsubishi's investment decision was based on Taiwan's increasing importance as a manufacturing base for computers, the main users of memory chips. Taiwan probably makes about one-third of the world's PCs, a Mitsubishi spokesman said. Taiwan's comparatively well developed infrastructure and the availability of gas, water and electricity were also a factor, Mitsubishi said. A third element was the enthusiasm of the Taiwanese government, which is keen to develop an indigenous semiconductor industry. Although Taiwan is a big manufacturing base for computers, it does not have sufficient semiconductor manufacturing capacity to meet computer industry demand. At the same time, a large part of its growing trade deficit with Japan has been in electronic components, such as semiconductors. The joint venture in Taiwan will enable Mitsubishi to share the cost of setting up a semiconductor manufacturing facility. Although the total investment in the facility was not disclosed, building a semiconductor plant was not likely to cost less than Y50bn (Dollars 512m), Mitsubishi said. The project will also give Mitsubishi a valuable overseas manufacturing base for memories, which are expected to become the dominant product in the market from around 1995. The company has plans to expand semiconductor manufacturing at its facility in Japan but its overseas operations are seen to have lagged behind those of other leading Japanese semiconductor makers. Mitsubishi's investment follows announcements by NEC, Hitachi and Toshiba of increased investments in memory chip production. Japanese chip makers believe market demand will continue to be strong, particularly with the advent of multimedia technologies which require a lot of memory capacity.</p>

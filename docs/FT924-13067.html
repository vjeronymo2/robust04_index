			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Spain seeks EFA postponement: UK worried about cost of delays to European fighter project SPAIN has told its partners in the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) that production should be postponed 'by some years' because of budget pressures and the changed strategic environment. However, it said that it still wanted to pursue its collaboration with Britain, Germany and Italy on producing a joint aircraft. The Italian government has also underlined the constraints on committing new funds to the fighter. The UK hopes to clarify the situation when defence ministers attend a meeting of Nato's nuclear planning group in Scotland next week. Italy and Spain currently occupy the middle ground between Germany, which wants to scrap the current Pounds 20bn project in favour of a smaller collaborative fighter, and Britain, which wants to stick to the EFA design. The four partners agreed in August to continue working on prototypes but to put off further development contracts until reviews on industrial costs and military requirements were completed. More than Pounds 5bn of the Pounds 8bn allocated to development has been spent. The Spanish Defence Ministry said it wanted to extend the freeze on new contracts. British officials accept that plans to bring the new fighter into service in 1998 have now become unrealistic. That schedule would require committing funds to set up production around the middle of next year. Although the initial sums involved would be relatively modest, this now appears difficult to achieve, with all four partners - including Britain - facing severe pressures on public spending. Britain is concerned that further delays may add to the fighter's eventual cost. Under the current programme, production orders would be placed in 1995. Later production would add to the problems faced by British Aerospace in filling the gap between the current Tornado programme and EFA. Spain's Defence Ministry is facing a cut of almost 10 per cent in real terms in its 1993 spending, under a restrictive budget going through parliament. 'We remain interested in EFA for political, technological and military reasons but in the present economic climate we are literally giving the project all that we can and there is simply no more money available,' the ministry said.</p>

The firing represents a key state in  test and development of the anti-missile Surface-Air Medium  Range Ground Weapon system (SAMP/T).    The Aster missile has been designed to intercept and  structurally destroy new generation aircraft and air-surface or  surface-surface missiles having high maneuvrability and high  speed. It is a two-stage powder missile with highly agile  second stage obtained by a Pif-Paf piloting system combining  aerodynamic and force piloting to destroy enemy missile. The  SAMP/T system, built around ground based Aster missiles is  designed for protection of the battlefield area, air bases,  command stations and all sensitive targets. By the end of this  century, the first operators will be the French and Italian  Armies and the French Air Force. For the latter, it will be  superseding the American Hawk system.    Consequently, the vertical launch procedure of the Aster 30  has now been approved. Various subassemblies involved in a  firing of this type: The missile itself, the launcher container  tube on the ground and the launch ramp have been tested in  configuration similar to operational version. AEROSPATIALE was  in charge of the test which is part of a project for the  development of ground and naval medium-range surface-air defense  systems. In this program, EUROSAM (AEROSPATIALE, ALENIA,  THOMSON) is prime contractor.</p>

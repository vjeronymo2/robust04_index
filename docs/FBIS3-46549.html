"Many nations have shed ideological confrontation to seek  reconciliation and cooperation, and at the same time adopted  pragmatism, placing their national economic interests as top  priority," Han said. "An era of boundless competition and trade  wars opened with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. With the  hastening of internationalization, global problems such as  disarmament, human rights, environmental protection and the  fight against poverty are becoming important issues," he said.    International relations in the post-cold war world shifted  the focus from political and military affairs to economics and  trade problems, the minister said. Seoul also places its  emphasis on practical economic interests to join the world's  advanced economic powers.    He recalled an agreement at last month's South Korea-U.S.  summit for a "thorough and broad" approach to solving the North  Korean nuclear problem.    While promising to keep to this principle, Han said that an  international action such as by the United Nations Security  Council was inevitable if North Korea did not come forward  favorably in the dialogue efforts.    South Korea enhanced its ties with both Asia and the Pacific  at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in  Seattle in November and the new year will see more participation  by Seoul in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),  especially in regional security dialogue, Han said.</p>

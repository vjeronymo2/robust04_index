			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOURCE OF JULIAN WATER CONTAMINATION STILL A MYSTERY  </P> <P> Almost a year has gone by since Scott Monroe, owner of Bailey's Wood Pit  Barbecue in Julian, was drilling for water and came up with gas instead.  </P> <P> Since then, the mountain community's wells have been tested, and traces of  benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, have been found in three of its nine wells.  Officials believe the benzene, a component of gasoline, leaked from an  underground fuel tank.  </P> <P> Although many residents say the contaminated wells have not hurt tourism and  the local water is now safe to drink, the mystery of how the supply went bad  remains unsolved. Monroe, meanwhile -- a 12-year resident of the community --  is stuck with a $6,500 well full of contaminated water.  </P> <P> "The town's running out of water, and I'm really hot about this," he said. "I  have water in my well, but I can't use it because it's contaminated."  </P> <P> Health and water officials say they still don't know how long the water has  been tainted or whether the leak is continuing. Harry Seifert, general manager  of the Julian Community Services District, which distributes the water,  estimates the contamination can be traced back at least three years.  </P> <P> Although Chevron U.S.A. installed a $42,000 carbon filter to purify the water  soon after the contamination was discovered last fall, the company is uncertain  how long residents may have been drinking bad water, Seifert said.  </P> <P> In the past year, Chevron -- one of several oil companies that have operated  near the site of the town's underground fuel tanks -- has spent more than  $120,000 on Julian's water problems. It has been conducting weekly tests to  determine the extent of the leak, and it also imported 320,000 gallons of water  into the district last September while the carbon filter was being installed --  all free of charge.  </P> <P> Chevron has agreed to continue pouring money into the project, despite the fact  that there has been no conclusion that the contamination came from one of its  tanks, or even from a tank belonging to other Julian gas stations. Company  officials emphasize that they have not been found responsible, but say there is  always the possibility Chevron was involved.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the company closed down its service station at the corner of Main  Street and Washington last month. Chevron officials said the shutdown is not  connected to the contamination, and that the station was closed simply because  it was not a profit-maker. That leaves one gas station in town, although during  the past 40 years there have been as many as five at once.  </P> <P> "It's hard to tell where the stuff came from," Seifert said, noting that all  five stations were within a two-block area in town, which is just four blocks  long and three blocks wide.  </P> <P> "Chevron stepped in when there was no proof of anyone's responsibility," he  said. "They stepped to the front as far as taking care of the problem."  </P> <P> Seifert speculated that the company may be motivated by memories of another  leak during the late 1970s in which a Chevron tank briefly contaminated a town  well.  </P> <P> "The (contamination) traces are old enough so that we can't exactly trace it,"  he said of the current problem. "There is no evidence that points to one  specific source of contamination."  </P> <P> Kim Wiseman, an environmental engineer with Chevron, said the company, which  has operated a service station in the heart of Julian for more than a dozen  years, took on the chore simply as a civic duty at a time when Julian was  facing a crisis.  </P> <P> Wiseman said that, once the source of the leak is found, the company will "seek  compensation for funds that have been spent thus far from the responsible  party."  </P> <P> Although Chevron continues to absorb the cost of the cleanup, residents say  it's been business as usual in Julian, a rustic community famous for its  apples, apple pie and apple-buying tourists.  </P> <P> The town prides itself on remaining in a time warp of the early 1900s, a place  where folks can get away from the smog and traffic of big-city life and enjoy  green mountains and dirt trails.  </P> <P> But local officials worry that its reputation is becoming somewhat tarnished  and that the town is being jokingly referred to as the "Julian Valdez" -- a  reference to the giant Exxon tanker responsible for the worst oil spill in U.S.  history.  </P> <P> After a year of testing, water and health officials are still searching for the  source of the leak and the best way to deal with the contamination. Seifert  said the water district has hired an attorney to handle any litigation that  might arise.  </P> <P> "Who knows how long the water's been contaminated?" said Julian resident Joe  Romano, a member of the water district board. "What matters is that millions of  gallons of water were poisoned. It may take us 20 years to recover, if ever."  </P> <P> Romano complained that Chevron is positioning itself as "the rescuers, not the  perpetrators."  </P> <P> Dan Avera, deputy director of San Diego County's environmental health services  department, said Julian's problem is considered severe because the community  depends totally on underground water. It is one of the few areas in the county  that doesn't import water.  </P> <P> However, Avera said the health hazards posed by the benzene are minimal.  </P> <P> "The amount of benzene is just over the acceptable levels, but just barely," he  said. No reports of health problems have been sent to the health department  yet, he said.  </P> <P> Residents in Julian, as in the rest of the state, are facing a fourth year of  drought, and they say they are more concerned about that shortage than about  the contamination.  </P> <P> Monroe posted a sign outside his barbecue restaurant: "Due to the water  shortage, we are serving all dinners on paper or plastic. Sorry for the  inconvenience." Other businesses in town are also taking measures to cut down  on water use, including installing portable toilets.  </P> <P> Because Julian's shortage is compounded by the contamination, water officials  have placed a moratorium on water hookups and in the heart of the community.  </P> <P> The water district serves about 500 people within a 5-square-mile area, Seifert  said. The district uses about 50,000 gallons a day, more on weekends because of  tourists.  </P> <P> Seifert said district customers have cut consumption 30% in the first six  months of this year.  </P> <P> Chevron installed the temporary filtration system a week after the tainted  water was discovered, Wiseman said, "simply to get a drinking water supply  system on line while investigations are going on."  </P> <P> A more sophisticated and efficient machine, estimated to cost more than  $100,000, is being designed and built by Chevron to replace the carbon filter,  it is hoped within the next nine months, Seifert said.  </P> <P> "Our goal is for Julian to have a safe drinking water supply," Wiseman said.  </P> <P> According to James Silver, owner of the lot where the Chevron station stood, a  gas station has stood on the spot since 1914, when gasoline was pumped from  wooden barrels. Before then, a saloon occupied the property. The prime lot is  now bare of buildings, and Silver said he is unsure about the fate of the  property.  </P> <P> When the benzene was first detected, Chevron delivered 4,500 gallons of bottled  water to the community and trucked in 315,000 gallons from Palomar Mountain  that was pumped into the district's tanks. The company footed the $35,000 bill  and distributed the water free, said Jane Fruin, a supervisor of environmental  engineering at Chevron.  </P> <P> Before the filter was installed, residents were warned by health and water  officials about the contamination and were advised to drink only bottled water,  Seifert said.  </P> <P> "I've worked with gasoline all these years, I've drunk it, I've smelled the  fumes, and it hasn't killed me yet," said Norm Cozens, owner of the six-pump  Alliance Gasoline, now the lone station in town.  </P></p>

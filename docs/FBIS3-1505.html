			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- Panic and rumour  abounded in Johannesburg on Tuesday [29 March] in the wake of  violence that wracked the city during a march in support of Zulu  King Goodwill Zwelithini on Monday. The running gunbattles in  the CBD [central business district] that left as many as 36  people dead and hundreds injured affected the equilibrium of  Johannesburg's normally stoic central city business people.    Rumours of a regrouping of marchers led to several shops  shutting on Tuesday morning and as sirens from ambulances, on  their way to routine calls, sounded on the downtown streets  pedestrians scurried for safety and shopkeepers closed their  doors or rolled down their metal window covers. Rumours of  driveby shootings came in from all over the city and although  there was sporadic gunfire in the CBD, the reaction to it was  exaggerated. Streets became congested as people jostled for  positions in the traffic in a bid to flee central Johannesburg.    Police were able to confirm one driveby shooting on Tuesday  at the ANC's [African National Congress] headquarters, Shell  House. Witwatersrand police spokesman W/O Andy Pieke said the  occupants of a white car reportedly fired shots at shell house  at about noon. Police rushed to the scene but found no one  injured. Gunfire had broken a car's windscreen, he said.  Police found no trace of the car allegedly involved in the  shooting.    The ANC said Shell House had came under fire from snipers in  opposite buildings. "The building was similarly occupied by  snipers on Monday during an aborted attack on the ANC head  office by IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters," the ANC said  in a statement.    The area was cordoned off by police and traffic officers.  According to people in the vicinity of the shooting a white  minibus fired at the entrance to Shell House and there was  gunfire from buildings opposite the ANC headquarters. ANC  security guards returned fire, SABC radio news reported. The  occupants of the white vehicle allegedly fired random shots at  pedestrians and beat up passersby, traffic officers said. No  one was seriously hurt.    Office workers in at least one highrise block near the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange said their management had decided to  evacuate the building in the mid-afternoon on the advice of John  Vorster Square police who said "bad elements" were in town. The  decision drew criticism from some senior personnel working  frantically to make up time lost during Monday's violence. One  manager said it appeared both police and management were working  on the basis of rumours.</p>

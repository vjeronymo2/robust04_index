			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: CML warning on second half surprises City Shares in CML Microsystems fell 23 per cent yesterday to 247p after the group issued a warning that profits for the second half of the year would be moderately below the Pounds 2.37m returned for the first, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. The warning, which followed a relatively upbeat outlook for the year by the group in November caught the City by surprise. CML makes electronic equipment for cellular communications and traffic control, and sells its products in international markets through agents who anticipate sales and produce an annual sales schedule in January. The sales schedule for this year showed many of its customers, particularly those which buy semiconductors for cellular communications and radio, deferring orders. Although there had been surprise that CML seemed to be feeling the effects of the recession much, analysts were alarmed by the high level of rescheduling - at about 25 per cent - particularly as historically the fourth quarter is the busiest for the group.</p>

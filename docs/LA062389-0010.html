			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> GRAND FLAG, GREAT LIBERTIES  </P> <P> Odious as the flag-burning protest was, it is useful to recall what else was  happening in Dallas that summer of 1984. Ronald Reagan arrived for the  Republican convention and stepped into a rally where his advance men had draped  perhaps the biggest American flag ever, hanging down 12 stories inside the  jammed lobby of the Anatole Hotel. Reagan said that the GOP was "America's  party," and in Dallas and in that fall's campaign commercials, the flag was  made the symbol of the Republican Party.  </P> <P> Of course, the GOP game of capture-the-flag did not begin or end in Dallas in  1984. During the Vietnam War, when there was another epidemic of flag abuse,  some of those who supported the war effort started wearing lapel flags. By  1972, those flag pins came to imply support of Richard Nixon versus George  McGovern.  </P> <P> If the flag stands above politics, for one nation indivisible with liberty and  justice for all, it commands the respect of all. But if it becomes a partisan  banner, someone who disagrees with that partisan purpose is going to treat it  as such.  </P></p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Credit figures add to signs of recovery THE BRITISH consumer has regained an appetite for buying goods on credit, adding to signs of growing consumer confidence and encouraging hopes that the UK economic recovery can be sustained. Net lending to consumers increased to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 232m in March from Pounds 54m in February, the highest since April 1991, according to Central Statistical Office figures released yesterday. The March figure was also more than twice City expectations that consumer borrowing would rise by a net Pounds 90m in the month. The CSO monthly net lending figures cover consumer borrowings from finance houses, other specialist credit companies, building societies (excluding mortgage lending) and on bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems. The amount of new credit advanced to consumers by these lenders was Pounds 4.73bn in March, the highest monthly figure since such statistics were first published in 1987. The new credit figure compared with February's total of Pounds 4.42bn and the Pounds 3.98bn of new consumer credit granted in March last year. Yesterday's statistics were welcomed in the Treasury where a spokesman said they were consistent with other evidence of rising consumer confidence such as retail sales, strong growth of bank notes and coins in circulation, and opinion poll evidence of increased consumer optimism. They coincided with official producer prices figures showing that underlying inflationary pressures were less than expected last month. Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist of Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking group, said the credit figures were very significant. 'They show that consumers are confident enough about jobs and the general economic situation to go out and borrow again which is essential if the recovery is to gain pace'. In the middle of last year, consumers were net repayers of credit. The strong March figure brought net lending to consumers by finance houses, building societies and through the Visa and Mastercard systems to Pounds 436m in the first quarter compared with Pounds 226m in the final quarter of last year and Pounds 142m in the first quarter of 1992.

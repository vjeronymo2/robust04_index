			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Belarusian Foreign Ministry Receives </F> Note From Russia"]    [Text] The Belarusian Foreign Ministry has received a note  from the Russian Foreign Ministry saying that "the Russian  Government adopted a decision to keep in line with generally  accepted international practices, according to which official  and working visits by heads of states and other representatives  of the executive bodies of the CIS states, just as with other  states, are subject to preliminary agreement through diplomatic  channels. Visits to Russia -- not agreed upon previously -- by  leaders of executive bodies of foreign states will be considered  by Russia as private visits." As BELAPAN has been told by the  Department of Bilateral Relations within the Foreign Ministry,  this is an ordinary document specifying relations between  sovereign states. In the opinion of representatives of the  Belarusian Foreign Ministry, all contacts between our Republic  and Russia should be coordinated by the Belarusian Foreign  Ministry. By the way, the Russian side will also observe  similar rules.</p>

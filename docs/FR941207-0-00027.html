			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal requested general comments as well as specific comments on the nature of collateral arrangements and the extent to which collateral might be recognized in conjunction with bilateral netting contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board received nineteen public comments on the proposed amendment. Eleven comments were from banking organizations and five were from industry trade associations and organizations. In addition, there were three comments from law firms. All commenters supported the expanded recognition of bilateral netting contracts for risk-based capital purposes. Several commenters encouraged recognition of such contracts as quickly as possible. Many of the commenters concurred with one of the principal underlying tenets of the proposal, that is, that legally enforceable bilateral netting contracts can provide an efficient and desirable means for institutions to reduce or control credit exposure. A few commenters noted that, in their view, the recognition of bilateral netting contracts would create an incentive for market participants to use such arrangements and would encourage lawmakers to clarify the legal status of netting arrangements in their jurisdictions. One commenter noted that the expanded recognition of bilateral netting contracts would help keep U.S. banking organizations competitive in global derivatives markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While generally expressing their endorsement for the expanded recognition of bilateral netting contracts, nearly all commenters offered suggestions or requested clarification regarding details of the proposals. In particular, the commenters raised issues concerning specifics of the required legal opinions, the treatment of collateral, and the grandfathering of walkaway clauses and novation agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Legal Opinions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Almost all commenters addressed the proposed requirement that institutions obtain legal opinions concluding that their bilateral netting contracts would be enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. Commenters did not object to the general requirement that they secure legal opinions, rather they raised a number of questions about the form and substance of an acceptable opinion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters requested clarification as to the specific form of the legal opinion. Commenters wanted to know if a memorandum of law would satisfy the requirement or if a legal  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> opinion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be required. They questioned whether a memorandum or opinion could be addressed to, or obtained by, an industry group, and whether a generic opinion or memorandum relating to a standardized netting contract would satisfy the legal opinion requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that an opinion secured on behalf of the banking industry by an organization should be sufficient so long as the individual institution's counsel concurs with the opinion and concludes that the opinion applies directly to the institution's specific netting contract and to the individual contracts subject to it. A few commenters requested confirmation that legal opinions would not have to follow a predetermined format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scope.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters identified two possible interpretations of the proposed language with regard to the scope of the legal opinions. They asked for clarification as to whether the opinions would be required to discuss only whether all relevant jurisdictions would recognize the contractual choice of law, or whether they must also discuss the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy or other instances of default. One commenter suggested deleting the requirement for a choice of law analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters objected to the proposed requirement that the legal opinion for a multibranch netting contract (that is, a netting contract between multinational banks that includes contracts with branches of the parties located in various jurisdictions) address the enforceability of netting under the law of the jurisdiction where each branch is located. These commenters stated that it should be sufficient for the legal opinion to conclude that netting would be enforced in the jurisdiction of the counterparty's home office if the master netting contract provides that all transactions are considered obligations of the home office and the branch jurisdictions recognize that provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Severability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters expressed concern about the proposed treatment for netting contracts that include contracts with branches in jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting is unclear. In such circumstances, commenters asserted, unenforceability or uncertainty in one jurisdiction should not invalidate the entire netting contract for risk-based capital netting treatment. These commenters contended that contracts with branches of a counterparty in jurisdictions that recognize netting arrangements should be netted and contracts with branches in jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting is not supported by legal opinions should, for risk-based capital purposes, be severed, or removed from the master netting contract and treated as though they were not subject to that contract. These commenters noted that this treatment should only be available to the extent it is supported by legal opinion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conclusions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal required a legal opinion to conclude that ``relevant court and administrative authorities would find'' the netting to be effective. Many commenters that discussed this aspect of the proposal expressed concern that this standard was too high. They suggested, instead, that the opinions be required to conclude that netting ``should'' be effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

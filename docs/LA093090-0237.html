			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Q: My wife and I own 600 shares of Trans World Airlines Inc. preferred stock  that we bought between 1978 and 1982. It has a "call" price of $15 and recently  has been quite shaky amid a lot of unfavorable rumors about the airline.  </P> <P> We are not strangers to the stock market, nor do we panic easily. However, we  are apprehensive about this stock. Is the dividend safe? -- Westminster, Colo.  </P> <P>  A: Nobody knows what will happen to TWA. The one thing on the side of  shareholders is that Carl C. Icahn, who owns virtually all the airline's stock,  has a lot of his own dough invested in this firm. So he's likely to be very  careful to see that it survives.  </P> <P> Nobody has ever said that TWA might simply go out of business. Icahn has said  that he might shrink it through the sale of assets because he's finding it hard  to remain competitive. And the TWA unions fighting Icahn -- particularly the  pilots -- are charging that Icahn is trying to sell pieces of the airline to  enrich himself. One sale, of the Chicago-to-London routes to American Airlines,  has been tied up at the Department of Transportation partly because of union  opposition.  </P> <P> On the operational side, TWA wasn't doing particularly well before the recent  rise in jet fuel prices. And it's not doing any better now. (The whole airline  industry is experiencing difficult times.)  </P> <P> I asked Icahn recently whether the preferred stock dividend was safe. He dodged  the direct question, but then went on to say how much cash the company had and  that, while the airline business was suffering through tough times, TWA was  making all the right moves by shrinking.  </P> <P> Then I asked one of the foremost airline analysts on Wall Street about your  dividend. "I think the preferred stock is going to be OK," he said, mainly  because there is plenty of cash and assets backing this company up.  </P> <P> I suppose whether you hold this stock or not will depend on your hearing -- if  all the noise is going to bother you, you probably should sell.  </P> <P> Q: I am very interested in "playing" the stock market, albeit in a small way.  Could you please advise me on what steps I should follow? I plan to limit my  initial investment to $100. Can I eliminate the need for a broker? -- Glendale  </P> <P> A: It's hard to "play" anything nowadays with just $100, much less invest in  the stock market.  </P> <P> What you should do is find a "no-load" -- meaning, no fee -- stock mutual fund  that permits people to invest as little as $100. This is a conservative way to  get started, but you will be "playing" the market. Your library should have  books that list all the mutual funds in the country.  </P> <P> Or, you could buy a few shares of a blue chip company. But a good deal of your  money will get eaten up by the brokerage commission. If you use a discount  brokerage firm, you can reduce the sales fee.  </P> <P> I've asked the American Assn. of Individual Investors in Chicago to send you  some literature aimed at helping beginners understand the stock market. You  will be receiving a book called "A Lifetime Strategy for Investing in Common  Stocks."  </P> <P> Good luck.  </P> <P> Q: I have two certificates of deposit in two different banks. They are each set  up as revocable trusts for two nieces.  </P> <P> The government has changed the way it insures these trusts. The new rules are  complex. I wrote to my banks but got no answer. I also wrote the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corp., but it didn't answer either.  </P> <P> So I am writing to you. Can you find out if my revocable trusts for my nieces  are OK and if the FDIC will pay the insurance if the bank goes broke? --  Brawley  </P> <P> A: It took the FDIC a couple of days, but they finally figured this one out.  </P> <P> Claude Rollin, a senior attorney with the FDIC, says that all of your accounts  together (that is, added up) are insured for a total of up to $100,000 in each  of the banks.  </P> <P> So if you have $100,000 in an account in your name and another $100,000 in a  trust for one niece at the same bank, only $100,000 of your money is insured.  If the bank closed, you'd be out the other $100,000. The same is true for the  second niece at the second bank.  </P> <P> But the circumstances would be different if the trusts -- actually called  "testamentary accounts" -- were in your name, plus that of a spouse, child,  stepchild, adopted child or grandchild, instead of a niece. In the other cases,  each trust account by itself would be insured for up to $100,000.  </P> <P> In this case, your personal account would be insured for $100,000, and the  trust account with child, stepchild, etc., would be covered by another $100,000  in insurance. If the bank goes out of business, you'd get all your $200,000  back.  </P> <P> If your accounts exceed the $100,000 limit because of the money placed in trust  for your nieces, you should simply move the excess funds to another bank. Then  all of your money would be insured. JOHN CRUDELE  </P></p>

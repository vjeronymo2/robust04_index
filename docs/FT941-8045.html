			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Iraqi oil team 'to visit Paris' Two French companies have invited a high-level Iraqi oil team to Paris, the first such formal invitation by a Western country since the 1991 Gulf War, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said yesterday. Iraq had accepted the invitation - issued by Total and Nationale Elf Aquitaine - and would send Senior Undersecretary Taha Humud as delegation leader. MEES said the two companies had held many meetings in Baghdad since mid-1991 on developing the two giant fields of Nahr Umar (Total) and Majnoon (Elf) but more negotiations would be needed before draft agreements were finalised. No agreement can be signed until United Nations sanctions are lifted.</p>

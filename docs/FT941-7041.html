			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fall in demand batters profits at Bridgestone Bridgestone, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, yesterday reported a 53 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits, to Y37.3bn (Dollars 354m) last year from Y79.5bn in 1992. Group sales for the year tumbled 8.4 per cent, from Y1,745bn to Y1,599bn over the same period. The company is struggling with a collapse in demand in its domestic market, where it controls about 45 per cent of the car tyre sector. Bridgestone said demand from car manufacturers had fallen because of the poor state of the economy and increased imports. The replacement market had also declined, it added. Domestic prices have been under pressure, and the group's product mix deteriorated as Japanese consumers increasingly traded down. Non-consolidated domestic sales fell 13.6 per cent from Y543bn to Y470bn. The strength of the yen has prevented Bridgestone's domestic operations exporting their way out of trouble. Mr Isao Imaizumi, managing director, said the average dollar exchange rate in 1993 was Y112, up Y15 on the previous year. Non-consolidated exports fell 11.5 per cent, from Y181bn to Y160bn. Bridgestone said unit sales to Europe had fallen, but had increased to North America, Asia and Oceania. Consolidated tyre sales fell from Y1,324bn last year, to Y1,191bn - the same as in 1988 - while turnover at the non-tyre operations fell from Y421bn to Y407bn. Cost-cutting saved Y20bn, but consolidated operating profits nevertheless fell 22.8 per cent to Y93.2bn from Y120.6bn. Consolidated net earnings after tax dropped from Y28.4bn to Y28.38bn, while earnings per share fell from Y36.79 to Y36.77. The group forecast consolidated sales would reach Y1,570bn this year, and that net earnings would rise to Y30bn. It predicted earnings per share would be Y38.86. The company dropped an extraordinary dividend of Y2.5 per share paid last year, declaring a dividend of Y12 per share.</p>

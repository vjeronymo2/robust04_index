			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (15): Japanese group prepares for expansion - How Sony, the electronics manufacturer, selected a purpose-built, 180,000 sq ft headquarters in the UK THE driver's eyes lit up. Crouching lower behind the jolting wheel, our galumping Land-Rover was magically transformed into a vintage Bentley, roaring along the strip of weed-strewn concrete. In a blink it was over, and the ghost of Ascari dissolved back into an anonymous chauffeur - 'that's the bit everyone likes best,' he murmured, as if the show was for bored passengers, rather than his enjoyment. But a slight smile remained around the eyes. This small crescent of banking is all that remains of the Brooklands circuit at Weybridge in south-east England, revered during the golden pre-war age of motor racing. Even faster fliers took over when Vickers then British Aerospace flattened the track to make way for its jets. But it, too, has now gone. The intruding runway could be ripped out if the new owners have their way, ironically outlived by a few hundred yards of the banking it made redundant. Brooklands is about to write another chapter in the history of technology and relocation. Just as cars gave way to aircraft, electronics are now moving onto the site. Sony, the consumer electronics and entertainment group, has chosen the site for its new UK headquarters in one of the largest office pre-lets seen on a British business park. The deal, involving a purpose-built 180,000 sq ft complex at an initial rent of Pounds 29 a sq ft, comes as a breath of fresh air for current owner Trafalgar House which has just bought out British Aerospace's half share in the 350-acre site. The recession has dampened enthusiasm for business parks as companies hold back expansion plans, but Sony proves that some businesses are still in the market. But only for the right space in the right location. The Japanese group only moved into new premises at Staines, west of London, in 1984 and never expected to be ripping up roots again so soon  - 'but life moves on,' says Mr Malcolm Willings, the deputy managing director. 'We want to have everything under one roof - management, administration, sales and so on. We need a high level of intercommunication between staff. 'This is why we centralised in Staines. But by early 1990, things had fragmented again because of expansion. 'We were in four locations and the capacity of those buildings were strained. We were using up vital training and meeting areas.' Meanwhile, rent reviews were coming up and decisions had to be made on the best way to spend money, so a new hunt started. 'We looked at around 60 new places and drew up a short-list, asking developers for basic designs,' says Mr Willings. Honing down that list in a market thick with desperate developers was not as difficult as it might seem. Firstly, Sony looked no further than commuting distance outside the M25 and only in the south-western sector running out of London. "This is where our staff live, and we want to keep them,' says Mr Willings. Proximity to Heathrow was also important - 'I use it every week'. So was continued good access to central London, where the bulk of customers are based. The site also had to be big enough for expansion - no more unplanned upheavals because capacity begins to run out again in the late 1990s. Good surroundings and architecture were essential because the company likes to project a high quality image. Several leading business parks fell by the wayside - 'they were either too big, drowning out individuality, or the designs were questionable,' says Mr Willings. 'We were really looking for a small park which would provide a presence and a building which would not look strange or dated in 20 years.' All the more strange that he chose Brooklands, one of the country's largest development sites. But Trafalgar House has hived off an area called The Heights, creating a separate 750,000 sq ft office campus with its own charisma. The rest of the site also breaks away from the conventional office park, as it is given over to housing, industry and retail. Trafalgar has just sold six acres to Marks &amp; Spencer for a 10,000 sq ft store next to 85,000 sq ft already being created by Tesco. That means staff will have somewhere to shop - an important consideration which often makes workers reluctant to leave town centres. That part of the park also has 1m sq ft of distribution and industrial occupiers. Other factors which helped force Brooklands to the top of the short-list were Covell Matthews Wheatley's 'ageless' designs and provision for more than 860 parking spaces - 'they are also well hidden by excellent landscaping,' says Mr Willings. 'It could so easily have turned out like an ugly sea of cars.' The building will be created by Trafalgar for occupation by 550 staff from the end of next year. They will provide management, marketing and administrative sales support for Sony's electronic goods, as well as co-ordination of European television operations. The company will also take enough land for an extra 50,000 sq ft of offices when required. The deal involves a 'very short' rent-free period and includes an option for Sony to purchase the freehold if it wishes. 'It will enable us to plan into the next century,' says Mr Willings. Long before then, Trafalgar hopes to enhance Brooklands even further as a relocation centre. It wants to build another 700,000 sq ft of business space, an hotel with conference and leisure facilities and lay out a 70-acre park next to the River Wey. 'Our strategic plan is to create a first-class headquarters business environment while still providing all the amenities and shopping essential for a stimulating working environment for high-calibre staff,' says Mr David Calverley, managing director of Trafalgar House Property. It would be apt to see a few Bentleys back at Brooklands again - and the odds are that few managing directors will be able to resist that sliver of banking as they make for the car park.</p>

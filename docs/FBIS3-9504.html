They agreed UN peace  keeping units in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] have completely justified their preventive  mission and peace preserving role in Macedonia. They also  pointed out the importance of preserving the peace in Macedonia  for the stability in the Balkans. Following the talks with  President Gligorov, General De Lapresle stated for the  Macedonian Radio: "UN's mission in Macedonia has a historic  character and, owing to President Gligorov's wisdom, they  deployed peace keeping forces as prevention for a first time. I  would like to express gratitude to UNPROFOR soldiers and their  commanding officers, who are directly responsible for the  success of the mission. I especially greet General Tellefsen of  the Nordic Battalion, the U.S. contingent, all UN monitoring  teams, and all civilian authorities. The contingent in  Macedonia will remain multinational with units from all nations  previously included. We are discussing only small changes to  replace the Swedish contingent with adequate number of U.S.  troops. In any case, we will not take into account decisions  opposed to agreement between the United Nations and the country  in question. I will personally do everything in my power for  preserving of the peace in this region," General De Lapresle  said.</p>

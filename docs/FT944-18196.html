			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Cabinet reshuffle for Seoul Mr Hong Jae-hyong, South Korean finance minister, was promoted yesterday to deputy prime minister for economic planning in a reshuffle of the country's economic ministries. He succeeds Mr Chung Jai-suk, who resigned due to ill health 10 months after he was named to the post. Mr Park Jae-yoon, senior presidential economic adviser, was appointed the new finance minister, while Mr Han Lee-hun, the vice-economic planning minister, will replace Mr Park. The three senior officials have been among the main architects of proposals to deregulate South Korea's economy and promote financial liberalisation. 'The scope of the cabinet reshuffle has been minimised with a view to maintaining the current economic policy,' a presidential spokesman said. Analysts expect little change in economic strategy, though the new team may try to speed planned reforms. Mr Hong has held various economic posts since 1963.</p>

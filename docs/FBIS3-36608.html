			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by GIA (GEORGIAN INFORMATION SERVICE) correspondent </F> Galina Chikovani on the press conference given by Dzhaba  Ioseliani, head of the Georgian delegation at the Geneva talks  on the Abkhazian conflict, chairman of the Interim Committee for  the State of Emergency Under the Head of State, leader of the  Mkhedrioni paramilitary organization, on 2 February; place not  given: "Dzhaba Ioseliani: `The New UN Resolution on Settling  the Conflict in Abkhazia Is an Important Phenomenon'"]    [Text] Dzhaba Ioseliani went on the offensive at the  beginning of the press conference held on 2 February.    "Abkhazia is Georgia's pain and a journalist should not  ignore any question pertaining to it. Moreover, such important  events and documents as the negotiations in Geneva and the  communique and resolutions adopted by the UN demand constant  attention on the part of the media. Belated news evokes  justified indignation and confusion."    Objective information should be provided on the fate of the  300,000 refugees and thus satisfy journalists and the interest  of 5 million people. The journalists reacted to these justified  remarks in silence and silence is a sign of agreement.    Then Ioseliani acquainted those present with UN Security  Council Resolution 896.    "The main thing," he explained, "is for the refugees to  return to their homeland without being presented with any  preliminary conditions. Let anyone return who does not present  any kind of danger [a condition advanced by the Abkhazian side]  -- this is an absolutely absurd idea. Who determines this  danger? This violates the chief principle of the UN: the  protection of human rights.    "No less important," continued Mr. Dzhaba, "is that the  resolution condemns any forms of changing the demographic  composition of Abkhazia and the Republic of Georgia, including  by means of settling people who did not live there before."    The news that the UN supports the deployment of UN  peacekeeping forces or other forces sanctioned by the UN in the  conflict zone aroused great interest.    The peacekeeping forces will become a guarantee for the  return of refugees to their native land.    "It is essential to point out that this resolution," said  Mr.  Dzhaba, "adopted on 31 January of this year is the outcome of  the meeting in Paris between our head of state, Eduard  Shevardnadze, and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali."    Naturally, the journalists raised many questions in  connection with the visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to  Georgia.    "This is indeed an historic event. A legal basis will be  laid for all our relations."    Many questions related to the political status of Abkhazia.    "Georgia has never abolished the autonomy of Abkhazia;  however, nor has it agreed with the feudal reasoning of the  Abkhazian separatists."    Everyone was interested in hearing his views on recent  events  [the killing of several Mkhedrioni leaders and the planned  disbandment of the organization]. Mr. Dzhaba similarly did not  refuse to give an answer to this complex question.    "It is indeed difficult for me to speak about this. It suits  some people to speak out against the Mkhedrioni but let them not  forget that the Mkhedrioni has lost more than 600 young men  during the last four years. Our idea focused on the creation of  a Georgian army, based on a national army, one led by  professionals.    "As for the Rescue Corps [into which the Mkhedrioni has been  incorporated], we still have few professionals; therefore, we  are sending young people to other countries to be trained and to  acquire experience."</p>

Army Major Julasiri Kastiri, of the Army's 35th Infantry  Battalion, said only two of the MILF fatalities were identified.  They were Commander Camid Abalos and Commander Tatuan Mantukan,  both of Barangay Kudal, Bagalungan, Maguindanao.    The identity of the child, who was hit by stray bullet, was  also not immediately known.    Kastiri said some 100 MILF guerrillas on Friday came to  Barangay Balatikan, burned two houses and carted away personal  belongings of the farmers including an undetermined number of  cattle.    MNLF rebels also operating in Barangay Balatikan defended  the  village and engaged the MILF guerrillas in a two-hour firefight.    The MILF rebels were led by Commanders Pakil Ayunan, Jack,  Pendatun, Taez and Sumakon. Leaders on the MNLF side were  Commanders Abdul Karim, Bacri and Kainudin Batoon.    Commander Pakil Ayunan is reputedly North Cotabato's most  wanted criminal, tagged by police as the culprit in the massacre  of 18 Christian farmers in Carmen town last 25 December.    He was also said to be responsible for a series of cattle  rustling and harassment in the province.    The encounter site was five kilometers away from a  government  irrigation project in Barangay Maridagao where the MILF rebels  were engaged as security men of a Korean construction firm,  Shinsung Corporation.    A platoon of army troopers was dispatched to Balatikan to  normalize the situation there after hundreds of residents fled  to nearby villages.</p>

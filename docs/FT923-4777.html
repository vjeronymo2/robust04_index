			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fast printers to cope with the load Printing lengthy reports or documents, so often a slow and tedious process, could be quicker and less fiddly using the latest laser printers from Compaq. The Pagemaq 15 and Pagemaq 20 are capable of printing 15 and 20 pages per minute respectively. Both have a paper capacity of 1,500 sheets, thus minimising trips to the printer to reload. The new printers connect directly to Novell and Apple networks and can cope with input from five sources simultaneously. The incorporation of Adobe PostScript and PCL5 page description languages means only one printer is required to satisfy the needs of two different software systems. The Pagemaq 20 is aimed at networks of up to 20 users each; it retails at Pounds 3,295. The Pagemaq 15 is slightly cheaper at Pounds 2,625 and may be better suited to smaller concerns.

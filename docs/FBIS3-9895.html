			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] GRANMA newspaper has stated that a group of persons  of Cuban origin who live abroad and proclaim they want to annex  the Caribbean island to the United States lack the essential  ethical conditions to participate in the conference The Nation  and the Immigrant Community, which will be held in Havana in  April.    An article signed by journalist Nicanor Leon Cotayo and  published in GRANMA's Saturday edition reports that  annexationists of Cuban origin who live in the United States  deploy a campaign to maintain a blockade against the people of  the largest island in the Antilles.    The article -- entitled "Keep Out, Annexationists" -- says  that in a poll recently performed in Miami 40 percent of the  people stated they reject the blockade against Cuba and that the  number of people who protest against this unfair measure is  increasing significantly in the United States. GRANMA  emphasizes that the annexationists' views coincide with those of  extreme-right U.S. politicians of the last century.</p>

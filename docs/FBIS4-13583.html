			<p>BFN     [Text] An Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, spokesman  has told AL-BILAD the impounding of the passports of Muhammad  Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah, respectively the group's  representative and media spokesman in Jordan, does not mean the  documents are being literally withheld, as certain media organs  have interpreted the move. The measure was meant as a  precautionary step to ensure their safety in Jordan. No  measures of a disciplinary nature have been taken against Hamas,  according to the spokesman.    Political observers are surprised by recent subdued Hamas  statements following the recent Israeli threats to Jordan.  Since then, Hamas has been publicly drawing closer to a line,  advocated by certain Palestinian factions in 1974, that falls  short of recognizing Israel inside the green line. Observers  are surprised by recent Hamas statements indicating the group  supports peace, but not the way the peace process is being  conducted. Equally surprising was a Hamas call for the  Americans to take the whole Palestinian polity into  consideration, in other words, to initiate a dialogue with it.  Hamas thinks certain U.S. Administration officials are seeking  to destroy the bases on which the peace process was launched.  The observers are amazed Hamas has reduced the American-Arab  disagreement over Washington's open bias toward Israel to one of  personal differences. A Jordanian parliamentary deputy said  this is a serious retreat on the part of Hamas, whose statement  implies recognition of Israel and is a poor investment of recent  Hamas-claimed military operations.    For its part, Hamas said its position is not new and that it  calls for an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza and  elections to choose a leadership for the Palestinian people. It  will be up to this elected leadership to implement the will of  the people.    Hamas said its most recent statements were not released in  Amman in order to ease tension and to spare Jordan Israel's  groundless accusations. Hamas has announced it will stop  attacks on civilian targets if Israel proves amenable to the  solution proposed by Hamas. Hamas said this does not amount to a  retreat but a temporary arrangement that does not imply  recognition of Israel. Hamas was not forthcoming when asked by  AL-BILAD about Israel's stand about the equation. The group  said it proposed a 10-year truce after Israel pulls back to the  1948 border. In the interim, the two sides would formulate an  overall conception of a final settlement that does not  necessarily provide for recognition of Israel's sovereignty over  Palestine.</p>

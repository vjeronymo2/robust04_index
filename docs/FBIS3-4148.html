			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng met  with Lawrence Weinbach, chief executive of Arthur Andersen &amp;  Co.  SC of the United States, here this afternoon.    Founded in 1913, the Chicago-based Arthur Andersen Company  is  one of the six accounting and consulting giants in the world,  whose services span the globe.    The Chinese premier voiced appreciation for the company's  vital China business activities in the past 15 years.    China's economy is growing rapidly and there is great  potential for it to expand foreign economic and trade  cooperation, Li noted.    "We welcome direct foreign investment," he said, adding that  China has advantages in labor, consumer market, resources and  other aspects.    Economic development makes it all the more necessary for  China to set up a modern enterprise system, Li said.    China is ready to draw from advanced foreign experience and  willing to conduct cooperation with reputable financial,  accounting and consulting companies, Li said.    The country hopes to get their help in asset evaluation,  accounting and the raising of foreign funds, he noted.    During the meeting, Li also briefed Weinbach and his party  on  China's stance on Sino-U.S. relations and the issue of the most  favored nation (MFN) trade status.    Weinbach assured Li that no matter what happens, his company  will not change its commitments to China.    China's reform and opening-up and its economy have achieved  a  lot, attracting an increasing number of enterprises from all  over the world to cooperate with China, he said.    The U.S. business community holds that it is abnormal for  the  U.S. and China, two of the world's most influential countries,  not to maintain good ties and support the extension of MFN to  China. They will make efforts to remove obstacles to the  development of U.S.-China economic and trade ties, he said.    His company will continue its support for the improvement  and  development of bilateral relations, Weinbach noted.</p>

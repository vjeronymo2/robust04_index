			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Corning blames Dow venture for flat returns CORNING, the US specialty glass group, yesterday reported flat third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 107m, or 57 cents a share, compared with Dollars 106.7m, or 57 cents, a year ago. Stripping out one-time gains of 1 cent a share in the 1992 quarter and 4 cents a share a year earlier, Corning said its earnings per share rose 4 per cent in the latest quarter. Sales grew 20 per cent in the three months, to Dollars 1.15bn from Dollars 963.5m. For the first nine months, Corning earned Dollars 257.2m, or Dollars 1.36, against Dollars 231.2m, or Dollars 1.24 last year. Sales advanced to Dollars 2.87bn from Dollars 2.43bn. Mr James Houghton, chairman, said earnings from consolidated operations showed strong growth in the quarter. The modest earnings performance, in spite of strong sales growth, was blamed on a Dollars 15m decline in earnings from Corning's equity companies, particularly Dow Corning. Equity income from Dow Corning, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning which was once the leading US manufacturer of silicone breast implants, dropped Dollars 12m in the quarter. Although Dow Corning did not take any charges linked to its now defunct silicone breast implant operations, the joint venture yesterday reported a 60 per cent drop in third quarter net income. For the latest quarter, Dow Corning's net income was Dollars 16.4m, against Dollars 40.5m, on sales of Dollars 500.6m against Dollars 458.7m. About half of the profits fall was blamed on losses in financial transactions linked to the recent upheaval in European financial markets. Weak operating results accounted for the rest of the earnings decline.</p>

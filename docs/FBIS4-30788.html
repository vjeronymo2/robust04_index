			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The trial of former Albania's last  communist president and nine former state and party communist  functionaries continued proceedings today. Marash Mirashi:    [Mirashi] At the beginning of today's hearing, Chairman  Celiku requested explanations concerning the indictment from  defendant Aranit Cela. In a very long speech in which slogans  were not absent, the former prosecutor general, chairman of the  High Court of Appeals, and deputy chairman of the Exile-Eviction  Commission for half a century, presented himself to be innocent.    Defendant Cela is charged with abuse of position resulting  in  violation of the fundamental freedoms and rights of citizens and  illegal arrests as a result of the application of the State  Security platform approved by the Politburo of the Party of  Labor. He is charged with a large number of illegal exiles.    Defendant Aranit Cela is also accused of illegal convictions  regarding exiles and evictions, exiles that go back as far as 45  years. What is worthy of stressing is the fact that Cela  committed exiles and evictions without a court's decision,  without declaring the persons guilty. Defendant Cela himself  declared that they had also exiled persons that represented only  a potential social danger, such as the case of innocent persons  pursued or surveyed by the State Security. In this framework,  we have carried out exiles en masse of the inhabitants of border  areas under the pretext that they, one day, could cross the  border, Cela said.    According to the prosecutor, defendant Aranit Cela  approached  the evidence of the indictment.    Prosecutor Fana said that in the judicial language, social  danger is a sack for everybody.    The same charges fell on former prosecutor general Rrapi  Mino. Among the monotonous rhythms of an oblong speech, the  heat, and the claims of innocence by defendant Mino, the  reporters, through a complete indifference, almost emptied the  hall.    Defendant Rrapi Mino stated that he had never violated the  law. After several questions by Chairman Celiku, the answers of  the defendant Mino proved to be very disoriented.    With his intrusion based on charges, Prosecutor Fana, in a  very correct way, presented facts and arguments of the committed  murders. The counsels for the defense followed the tune of their  clients. At this, today's hearing closed. The next session  opens at 0900 tomorrow.</p>

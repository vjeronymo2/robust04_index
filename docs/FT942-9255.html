			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Seeing it from both sides  -Richard Gourlay continues his series on business angels with a visit to a nursery Some marriages may be made in heaven, but the relationship between private investors and entrepreneurs is almost invariably stormy. Sarah Anderson can vouch for this, having seen it from both sides of the business. Founder of Mayday Staff Agency Services, an employment bureau for the catering industry in which outside investors took a stake, she is now lead investor in a start-up business, Teddies Nurseries. Anderson is convinced the nurturing of business relationships is crucial if private investors and the entrepreneurs they back are to stand a chance of succeeding. 'When a business is running well, the entrepreneur thinks they are putting everything in and the investors are vultures,' says Anderson. 'When it goes badly it is the other way around, with resentment that they are not pulling their weight.' It was the arrival of her children that launched Anderson's career as a business angel and has inspired a number of her subsequent investments. 'I was bored with running Mayday full-time, got married and pregnant,' she says. 'In 1990 I started going to meetings of potential investors at LINC' - the Local Investment Networking Company run by a group of government-backed Enterprise Agencies. Teddies Nurseries was one of the companies that gave a presentation at LINC's regular investor seminars. Its entrepreneurs - Nicholas Botterill and Amanda Ramage - wanted to open a chain of high-quality, branded day-care centres. The first flagship operation would be launched in a residential area. The rest would be set up near large office blocks to service what they hoped would be a boom in corporate spending on child care for staff. 'I could recognise a good plan because I had been running a business,' says Anderson. 'They were very young, bright and one had been a management consultant with Stoy Hayward. I liked the people and the product and it was a start-up which I wanted.' Starting with 20 per cent of the equity, the entrepreneurs were encouraged by a ratchet agreement that would have given them control of the company if they performed to plan. However, Botterill and Ramage quickly ran into the quicksand of London's planning laws. It took longer than expected to find buildings with the right planning consents. The first Teddies in Fulham - now full and thriving - was late in opening, the second in Twickenham only opened in October, 10 months late. 'Each centre makes more money than we ever projected but the ratchet was flawed because it was based on a time scale which when extended made majority ownership impossible to achieve over the five-year period,' says Ramage. Whatever the reason, the missed targets and the argument over whether the ratchet should be changed, soured relations. The business ate cash and Teddies needed re-stuffing with money. 'The ratchet was clearly not going to be available to them so they were not incentivised,' says Anderson. 'I always felt the investment was something that might be lost,' she says. 'I was far more angry about the relationships that were going wrong and that it was no longer fun.' Anderson decided refinancing would not be pouring good money after bad. The business, now successfully operating two full nurseries, has recently broken even, and the concept is now proven. But Ramage is trying to find new investors to buy Anderson out. 'If I had my time over again I would negotiate the contract differently but I am perfectly happy with the way we found the investors and the people we went in with,' says Ramage. Both sides made mistakes in negotiating the original contracts, she says. This tension is familiar territory for Anderson. At Mayday she had to put up with outside shareholders. For ten years she had been 'happily working' for Compass, the catering company, ending up as a personnel and training manager. Asked to find ways to make money from the personnel department, she suggested an internal staff agency to replace outside contractors through which Compass was putting Pounds 500,000 of business a year. Six weeks after Anderson had set up the agency as a subsidiary, she persuaded the chief executive she was doing him a favour by taking this 'lousy business' off his hands. For the princely sum of Pounds 7,600 to buy the goodwill she was running her first business. Though she did not need the finance, Anderson's father came on the board and the venture capital company he was then working for took a 10 per cent stake. 'My view of private investors was very antagonistic,' says Anderson. 'I felt I did all the work and that was why I had a successful company. I look at it slightly differently now.' While Mayday has been a success - with turnover of Pounds 2m and 21 permanent staff - and Teddies is coming good, Anderson has had one 'unequivocally disastrous investment'. Attempting to repeat Mayday's London success in Cambridge and Bristol, Anderson backed two entrepreneurs to set up and run a subsidiary. Their sales forecasts proved unrealistic and Pounds 35,000 later the business failed, Anderson says. 'I learned you need to be brave enough to pull the plug early,' Anderson says. 'We should have pulled the plug after six months. An individual's capability does not change very dramatically over time.' Anderson has also raised commitments for money to set up childrens' activity centres. Again London's planning laws tripped her up and she is now leading her backers into a similar project in Guildford she found through LINC. And coming full circle Anderson has also started investing in herself again. With a neighbour she is launching into the manufacture of a folding childrens' lavatory seat called a Toodle-loo. A start-up, a single product, an uncertain route to market: It has everything that makes bankers and institutional venture capital suppliers run a mile, but all the features that private investors like Anderson embrace.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fearful bourses shaken by roller-coaster ride Bourses took a frightening roller-coaster ride, led down initially by a near percentage point drop in US bonds after Continental market hours last Friday, writes Our Markets Staff. The gloom thickened on weekend comments suggesting that UK interest rates would soon be on the way up, said Mr John Blackley at James Capel in London. Bond markets around the Continent took fright, fell on heavy selling, and equities followed suit. In the European afternoon, US Treasuries fell, firmed, andfell back again on profit-taking. Germany's September bund future followed this pattern, said Mr Blackley, falling 110 basis points, and recovering to only 36 points down; but it lost ground again, showing a drop of 68 at 90.37 late in the day. FRANKFURT's technical analysts offered a dismal prospect after the Dax index fell 81.90, or 4 per cent, to 1,969.82 during the session. If support did not hold at 1,950, said one, 1,750 was the next stop. As it happened, bonds then staged their intraday recovery and the Ibis-indicated Dax recovered to 1,986.42 after an intraday low of 1,953.15. However, a number of analysts were saying that the index might test 1,950 again today. Hopes of German economic recovery had been tarnished by a succession of corporate disasters, said observers, in Metallgesellschaft, Schneider and, most recently, Procedo. Banks weakened with Deutsche down DM38.50, or 5.3 per cent to DM693.50 and Dresdner DM26, or 6.9 per cent lower at DM350. Meanwhile, the drop in the dollar below DM1.60 hit Lufthansa, DM13, or 7.4 per cent lower at DM163. Turnover fell from DM25.6bn, inflated by last Friday's DTB contracts closures, to DM8.9bn. MILAN saw heavy selling ease late in the day but the Comit index still finished 27.27 or 3.9 per cent lower at 671.63, sharply below the 690 support level. Among the blue chip losers, Fiat fell L218 to L6,038, in the wake of weekend comments by Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, who said that the government had not yet discussed the issue of incentives for the motor market. Mediobanca lost L748 or 4.9 per cent to L14,411. The merchant bank has yet to set a definite price for its rights issue later this week although it had indicated at least L15,000 per share. PARIS fell sharply, but ended off its lows on short covering, the CAC-40 index falling 32.91, or 1.7 per cent to 2,903.04 after a drop of over three per cent at worst. Turnover was heavy at FFr5.7bn. Traders said that much of the selling came from French retail investors who had suffered losses on bond holdings held in savings plans. Transnational partnerships were shaky, Euro Disney hitting FFr14 before recovering to go ex rights and 70 centimes higher at FFr16.25. Eurotunnel's rights issue, meanwhile, seemed to be running into more serious trouble as the shares closed another 45 centimes down at FFr25.20, after a low of FFr23.85. ZURICH was dragged down by interest rate worries, the weak dollar and derivatives related selling. The SMI index fell 82.6 or 3.1 per cent to 2,545.0, after picking itself up from an intra-day low for the year of 2,512.8. However, analysts commented that since the index had now convincingly fallen through support at around 2,565, the way could be open for a further decline to around the 2,400-point level. The interest rate outlook continued to hit banks. CS Holding bearers fell SFr22 to SFr511. SBC lost SFr16 to SFr363 after Credit Suisse downgraded its 1994 earnings estimate following reports that SBC had lost SFr100m in a currency deal. AMSTERDAM fell 2.5 per cent to its low for the year, the AEX index losing 9.78 to 382.84. Cyclical stocks were among the hardest hit with Nedlloyd, the shipping line, Fl 3 or 4.5 per cent lower at Fl 64 and KLM Fl 2.20 or 4.4 per cent down at Fl 47.30. Shares and options in KPN, the partially privatised telecommunications and postal group, were heavy sold by retail investors. The shares lost Fl 1.60 to Fl 47.70. MADRID recovered from a 3.8 per cent drop to end with the general index down 5.19, or 1.7 per cent at 302.60 after a low of 296.01. Turnover continued to climb, at Pta53.2bn. The food and construction sectors seemed to sustain most damage; Tabacalera, after disappointing results recently, fell another Pta165 to Pta3,475 for a six-day fall of nearly 15 per cent. WARSAW dropped 5.9 per cent as hopes of a recovery, which grew after the previous session, gave way to a renewed lack of confidence. The WIG index fell 492.7 to 7,893.8.

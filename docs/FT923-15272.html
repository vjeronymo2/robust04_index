			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (4): A pause for restructuring - Japan, M&amp;A activity has been cooled by the downturn The fever associated with Japanese mergers and acquisitions activity in the 1980s has been cooled by the collapse of Japanese real estate and stock prices. With the downturn of the domestic economy and sharp falls in earnings, Japanese companies have become more concerned over domestic core businesses and have started to concentrate efforts on internal restructuring. According to Daiwa Securities, the total number of transactions fell by 34.3 per cent to 516 in 1991, while total value of deals fell 66.6 per cent to Y1,186.5bn. At the same time different perceptions have also brought about changes regarded as improbable in the 1980s. Foreign purchases of Japanese companies - considered a dream at the height of Japan's bull market - are increasing sharply. 'In the late 1980s, 75 per cent of the purchase cost of a Japanese company would be the real estate value,' says an investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston. With share prices around 60 per cent below their bull market peaks and land prices halved Japanese assets have become a realistic opportunity for overseas investors. Foreign purchases of Japanese companies last year fell to a total of 13 deals, but grew by 2.7 times in value to Y58bn. In the first three months of this year, seven deals have been completed, with the value totaling Y10.9bn, up by 3.8 times from the previous year. 'The demand from foreigners is increasing, but the number of Japanese companies available is currently very low,' says Mr Yoshiharu Ohi, head of global marketing at Daiwa Securities. But he adds that a further fall in share prices and restructuring within industries could increase opportunities. Foreign companies with international businesses which have comparative advantages over Japanese counterparts have expressed interest in buying into Japan. 'The trends are apparent in sectors where there are no global Japanese companies,' says Mr William Nichol at Barclays Bank. Pharmaceuticals and chemicals are areas where the western companies are showing interest. Japanese drugs and chemical companies lag behind their western counterparts and the expanding Japanese market provides incentive for foreign companies. Last year Monsanto of the US acquired 12 per cent stake in Hokuriku Pharmaceuticals for Y14.5bn, while Ciba Geigy took 20 per cent stake in a small agri-chemical maker. Foreign companies are buying into Japanese distributors to overcome structural difficulties. Hasbro, the US toy maker, recently acquired Nomura Toy, a privately run toy design and marketing company. Pfizer, the US pharmaceutical and chemical group, also said it would buy Koshin Medical, a privately owned distributor of medical equipment. Mergers and acquisitions have slowly become accepted among the Japanese as an option for better business. Mr Keiichi Kawakami, deputy general manager of Bank of Tokyo's corporate advisory division, says Japanese companies are no longer 'allergic' to them. As for mergers and acquisitions of foreign companies by Japanese corporations, activity has been subdued. Last year, the number of transactions fell by 44.3 per cent to 258, while the total value fell 78.6 per cent to Y683.4bn. The absence of big deals, such as Sony and Matsushita's acquisition of US film studios and Fujitsu's takeover of International Computers Limited, has deflated the total value of transactions. 'Japanese companies are coming to terms with investments made in the 1980s,' says Mr Kawakami at BOT. They are restructuring foreign acquisitions and some are ready to sell non-core businesses. The takeover of Firestone, the US tyre maker by Bridgestone, the leading Japanese tyre company, is an example of the many poor purchases made by Japanese corporations. They are also reviewing overseas acquisitions, especially real estate-related investments. In addition, the sharp rise in the cost of capital has discouraged a return to the international market. Nevertheless, Mr Ohi of Daiwa says that many companies still indicate interest in deals which would satisfy strategic needs in their core businesses and 'negotiations are quite active'. While Japanese companies are still keen to invest in south-east Asia because of the region's high growth potential and low labour costs, interest in eastern European and Russia has been low as a result of unfamiliarity and the higher risks involved. Mr Ohi points out that Treuhandanstalt, the German agency for privatising former East Germany's state enterprises, has elicited little interest from Japanese companies. 'The Japanese fear the former eastern German companies could lack basic functions of a capitalised company,' he adds. Among Japanese companies, however, the fall in asset prices and the sluggish economy have heightened interest in mergers and acquisitions. Although the total number of deals fell by 19.7 per cent to 245 in 1991, their value rose by 31.5 per cent to Y445.1bn. The reas on was the increase in rescue-type deals involving companies facing severe financial problems as a result of extensive investment in the stock and real estate markets. Traditionally, companies in trouble have been salvaged by their main banks. But the latter have not been able to cope with the number of companies struggling with mounting debts, since the banks are themselves also grappling with a rise in non-performing loans. Ishihara Construction, a listed company, was burdened with expanded debts arising from loan guarantees extended to Kyowa, the steel-processing company, which failed with outstanding debts of Y150bn. It was bought by Misawa, a subsidiary of Misawa Homes, the housing company. Aside from corporate rescues, Sanwa Bank says that the number of companies wanting to buy quality companies at cheaper prices to strengthen core businesses have increased. Meanwhile, the traditional practice of Japanese companies avoiding the use of financial advisers for transactions is gradually changing as the growing complexity of deals and need for corporate information has provoked a shift in attitudes. 'The role of financial advisers will become more important since Japanese companies are growing to understand the importance of information,' says Mr Ohi. He adds that the number of advisers will increase, as will their roles.</p>

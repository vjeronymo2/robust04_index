			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS COUNTY SUPERVISORS;  </P> <P> 2 RIVALS AGREE MORE THAN DISAGREE  </P> <P> Although the purpose of the forum was to accentuate their differences, Ventura  County supervisor candidates Bill Davis and Vicky Howard found Friday night  that they agreed more than they disagreed.  </P> <P> Both candidates, speaking at a forum at the Simi Valley Council Chambers,  opposed a regional government to oversee Southern California counties. And both  opposed the proposed merger of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas  &amp; Electric because they believe that Edison would expand operations at its  two Oxnard plants, resulting in increased pollution in Ventura County.  </P> <P> The two candidates also said they do not believe an adequate site exists in  Ventura County for a commercial airport.  </P> <P> "I think we all in Ventura County would like to have a commercial airport,"  Davis said. "The problem is where to put it. I think I would probably say  Palmdale is the best answer . . . You could provide quick rail service or bus  service to it. I think that is probably going to be the best Ventura County can  do." Palmdale is in northern Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Both also opposed proposed pay raises for Ventura County supervisors, who now  make about $45,000 a year.  </P> <P> The candidates did offer differing views on transportation. Howard said the  county needs to push hard to have California 118 and the Moorpark Freeway  widened.  </P> <P> Davis, on the other hand, suggested that the county and officials from its 10  cities work to devise a master transportation plan to create an interconnecting  bus service between all cities in the county.  </P> <P> Howard and Davis emerged from a field of five candidates in the June primary to  qualify for a runoff in the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> Davis, who received 25.4% of the vote in the primary to Howard's 36.9%, said in  a recent interview that he is confident he has closed the gap. One indication  that his support is growing, he said, is the fact that he has been able to  raise and spend about $10,000 more on his campaign than Howard during the past  three months.  </P> <P> "I think we're running neck and neck right now," Davis said.  </P> <P> Howard has maintained that her experience gives her an edge in the race.  </P> <P> In addition to her eight years on the City Council, Howard serves as the city's  representative on the County Transportation Commission and as a member of the  Local Agency Formation Commission.  </P> <P> Ironically, it was Howard who recommended Davis for a seat on the city's  Planning Commission in 1985 and supported his appointment to the City Council  in 1988.  </P> <P> Although Davis has acknowledged a debt to Howard for getting him involved in  politics, he said he is by no means her protege.  </P> <P> While serving on the council Davis said he helped establish a rent subsidy  program for low-income seniors and co-authored a voter-approved measure that  amended the city's slow-growth ordinance to allow more development of  affordable housing for the elderly.  </P> <P> The Ventura County League of Women Voters sponsored the forum.  </P> <P> The 4th District includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Clara  Valley. Terms run for four years.  </P> <P> Current 4th District Supervisor James R. Dougherty announced earlier this year  that he would not seek reelection.  </P></p>

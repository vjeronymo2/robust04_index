			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Packaging sector rise signals upturn EXPECTATIONS of an economic upturn have been strengthened by indications of sharp growth in recent months in the production of cardboard packaging, Peter Marsh writes. The material is used in a wide range of consumer and manufacturing sectors, and the amount produced is considered a good advance indicator of economic trends. According to Maurice Palmer Associates, a consultancy specialising in packaging, cardboard production increased 3.1 per cent in the final quarter of last year compared with the same period in 1991. For last year as a whole, production grew by 2.1 per cent compared with the previous year. The consultancy believes consumer goods production will show a 2 per cent year-on-year rise in the first quarter of this year. About 3.4bn sq m of cardboard packaging were produced in Britain last year, with virtually all of this sold to UK-based companies in industries including food, drinks, household goods, medicines and factory equipment.</p>

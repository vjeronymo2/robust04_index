			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / BNP intends to build on poll win The far-right British National party, which won its first local authority seat in a by-election at Tower Hamlets in September, will contest eight seats in the east London borough in next month's council elections. Tower Hamlets has the most decentralised structure of any local authority in Britain - it is divided into seven largely autonomous neighbourhoods. BNP candidates are concentrated in two of the seven - Isle of Dogs and Globe Town. The party's September by-election success was in the Isle of Dogs, where it appears to have successfully exploited concerns about housing among the predominantly white population. BNP activists have campaigned hard in the area to consolidate their position. The divisions and recriminations in the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, which hold all other seats on the council, are illustrated in yesterday's nominations. Mr James Hunt, the Labour by-election candidate who resigned from the party after losing the seat to the BNP, is standing in the Isle of Dogs as an independent. Mr Jeremy Shaw, who resigned from the Liberal Democrats during an inquiry by the national party which found that some Tower Hamlets' Liberal Democrat leaflets had pandered to racism, is one of several independent Liberals standing against official Liberal Democrat candidates. At Westminster Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat campaign chairman, acknowledged that the independent Liberal Democrats might split the party's vote in Tower Hamlets, David Owen writes. But he predicted the party would keep control of the council. If people did not agree with the way the party had handled things, they should leave it, Mr Taylor said. The 'overriding priority' in Tower Hamlets must be to stop the BNP from getting elected, he added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 4 [date as received] -- According to IBERIA  news agency opposition parties adopted a statement that says:  "To the United Nations Organization, the peoples and  governments of the world!    At its 1 March 1994 session, the Georgian Supreme Council  ratified a document on Georgia joining the CIS, signed by Eduard  Shevardnadze, the Supreme Council chairman and head of state, by  126 votes to 69 (two abstained), thus making an attempt to  legalize the loss of independence by Georgia and Georgia's  incorporation into a modernized empire.    This act passed by the Supreme Council contradicts the law,  and Georgia's union with Russia and other republics of the  former Soviet Union is illegal because of the following  conditions:    1. The act of the restoration of Georgian state  independence,  passed unanimously by the legally elected Supreme Council  (parliament) of the Republic of Georgia on 9 April 1991, is  based on the results of a referendum held in the Republic of  Georgia on 31 March 1991, during which 99 percent of the  participants voted for the independence of Georgia and in which  90 percent of electors took part. It is illegal to pass any  resolution on a complete or partial abolition (limitation) of  Georgia's independence other than by means of a referendum.    2. Over half of MPs on the list, yet less than two thirds  (there are 222 members in the Georgian Supreme Council), voted  for the approval of the 1 March 1994 resolution of the Georgian  Supreme Council. Meanwhile, the above-mentioned resolution a)  differs from a confirmation of a bilateral or multilateral  treaty in its concept pertaining the statute of the Republic of  Georgia as a state and, b) requires an amendment in the Republic  of Georgia's law "On the state authority" that was voted for and  passed by the qualified majority of the Georgian Supreme Council  as a law of constitutional importance. Paragraphs Four, Nine,  and others of the CIS regulations stipulate that a number of  discrete rights of the Supreme Council listed in Paragraph Seven  of the Republic of Georgia's law "On the state rule" are  transferred to the competence of the CIS. Therefore, only a  qualified majority can pass the resolution.    3. According to the Republic of Georgia's laws "On the state  rule" and "On the statute of a deputy," certain executive  occupations cannot be combined with the statute of a deputy (a  list of those has been approved). There are 15 members of this  kind in the Georgian Supreme Council at present. All of them  consented to Georgia joining the CIS and this was known to other  MPs before the vote and was proved by the vote. Despite the  requirements of the regulations, these Supreme Council members  participated in the voting.    4. A law "On conclusion, ratification, implementation, and  denunciation of international treaties" was violated. According  to Paragraph 11 of the law, the Georgian Supreme Council Foreign  Affairs Commission carries out the preliminary discussion of an  international treaty submitted for ratification and issues an  appropriate conclusion.    5. Georgia's joining the CIS contradicts the Republic of  Georgia's law "On defense," which recognizes Georgia's active  neutrality and nonalliance to any military bloc.    Apart from direct contradictions to the aforementioned law,  the contents of the resolution passed by the Supreme Council,  and the procedure taken have other political and procedural  shortcomings. Namely:    a) The election program of neither Eduard Shevardnadze, the  Supreme Council chairman, nor any other member of the Supreme  Council mentioned the prospect of Georgia joining the CIS. On  the contrary, the election programs of all of them contained  promises to defend and strengthen Georgia's independence. Thus,  the 1 March 1994 Supreme Council resolution was not authorized  by electors.    b) Apart from the regulations, a Georgian translation  (therefore nonauthentic) of which was distributed among members  of the Supreme Council before the session, regulations on  passing resolutions, as well the as rights and duties of the  member countries of the CIS are defined by a number of other  documents that were not available for the MPs.    c) The discussion and voting in the Georgian Supreme Council  on 1 March 1994 was preceded by a year-and-a-half-long process  of Georgia's economic destruction and variable destabilization  which, in our opinion, was artificial to a large extent and in  which, in our opinion, communist and pro-communist high echelons  of Georgia's executive authorities participated in order to  provoke Georgia's joining a modernized Russian empire.    Because Paragraphs two and Three of the above were read to  the chairman and the speaker of the Supreme Council, a demand  was made that the parliamentary authority of the above-mentioned  15 MPs [combining executive positions with Supreme Council  membership] should be stopped and that voting should be ruled by  two-thirds of the Supreme Council, and because these demands  were rejected against the law and regulations by the  parliamentary majority, we consider that this is a coup d'etat  from above.    During the session the police battered representatives of  the  National Liberation Movement who stood silent holding posters on  the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Council building. The  police also dispersed refugees from Abkhazia who stood beside  them. During the session, Jaba Ioseliani, the former chairman  of the "Emergency Committee," said from the rostrum that the  opposition had to be jailed. For two months prior to the  session a series of terrorist acts causing casualties were  carried out in Georgia. Thus, the Supreme Council session,  which made a decision on Georgia's joining the CIS was held in a  state of terror.    During the discussion of the resolution, the debates were  stopped by a decision of the parliamentary majority, and not  only were MPs who were on the list of speakers refused a right  to speak, but even factions."    The statement was signed by 69 deputies, who did not vote  for  Georgia becoming a member of the CIS.</p>

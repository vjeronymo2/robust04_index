			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Norwegian insurer well ahead Vital Forsikring, one of Norway's top three insurers, has reported a sharp rise in 1993 operating profit, helped by a substantial increase in financial income and lower interest rates, which pushed up the value of its securities portfolio. Operating profit jumped to NKr3.32bn (Dollars 453m) from NKr824m as premiums increased to NKr3.31bn from NKr2.8bn. Gross financial income nearly doubled in 1993 to NKr5.14bn from NKr2.63bn. Vital has proposed lifting the 1993 dividend by NKr1 to NKr5.75. Group operating expenses rose to NKr570m from NKr548m but costs, as a percentage of premiums, fell by 2.4 percentage points to 17.2 per cent. The company said that since 1990 its cost ratio has declined by 34 per cent as a result of increased premium volume and it aims to cut the ratio to 13 per cent by 1997. Vital said that premiums from group pension policies increased by 31.6 per cent, while premiums for individual annuity and pension insurance were 0.1 per cent lower. Group life premiums were 4.9 per cent up on 1992, while individual life insurance premiums increased by 8.9 per cent. According to the Norwegian Insurance Association, Vital increased overall market share to 21.1 per cent in 1993 from 17.8 per cent in 1992. The value of shareholdings and other investments rose to NKr4.31bn in 1993 from NKr3.45bn while bonds increased to NKr19.33bn from NKr13.81bn. Separately, the group said it was finalising negotiations to acquire a large property in central Oslo, comprising 75,000 square metres, from Sweden's Skanska group for NKr1.3bn. Vital said the pending deal was one of the largest property transactions ever carried out in Norway. The group's real estate portfolio comprises a gross area of an estimated 270,000 square metres and a book value of more than NKr1.9bn. In 1993, real estate activities provided a rate of return of 8 per cent.</p>

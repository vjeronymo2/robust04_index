			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC BERKELEY WILL BARGAIN WITH TEACHING ASSISTANTS  </P> <P> UC Berkeley has agreed to talk about pay and working conditions with an  organization of teaching assistants and researchers in exchange for a promise  that the graduate students will not repeat a strike that disrupted the campus  for two days in May.  </P> <P> UC officials stressed that the agreement is not formal recognition of the Assn.  of Graduate Student Employees as a union. However, Berkeley graduate students  say their group now has de facto bargaining status, a boost for the small but  growing national movement against what they claim is their exploitation by  universities.  </P> <P> "We think it's a very significant agreement and we think it's a direct result  of the strike last May," association spokesman Michel Chaouli said Tuesday. "I  think the university was somewhat dumbfounded by the strike and surprised by  the breadth of it."  </P> <P> Debora Harrington, UC Berkeley's manager of labor relations, denied that the  campus was pressured by fear of another strike, saying the school was used to  all sorts of disruptions. But she also said the agreement was a major step.  </P> <P> "The university could have simply ignored or refused to deal with (the graduate  student association)," Harrington said.  </P> <P> Graduate students last year taught about 38% of all undergraduate courses at UC  Berkeley. The more than 5,000 teaching assistants, graders and researchers  worked an average of 20 hours a week and were paid a maximum of $1,100 a month.  </P> <P> The agreement reached last week is to remain in effect as long as both sides  believe that the talks are progressing or until the association's lawsuit  seeking union status is resolved. A week before the May strike, the state  Public Employment Relations Board voted to support UC's position that teaching  assistants should be treated as scholars on stipends, not as unionized  employees. The association, which is affiliated with the United Auto Workers'  District 65, is taking the case before the state Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> The strike was the first of its kind in California. Similar graduate student  organizations have won bargaining status at only five other universities across  the country, according to Mary Ann Massenburg, a UAW official. She said the  union is trying to organize graduate students at four other UC campuses:  Irvine, Santa Cruz, Davis and San Diego.  </P></p>

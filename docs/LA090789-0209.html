			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LLOYD'S OF LONDON REPORTS REBOUNDING PROFITS  </P> <P> The Lloyd's of London insurance market, which reports results three years in  arrears because of long delays in settling claims, said today that profits  rebounded strongly in 1986.  </P> <P> It put pretax profit for the year at $1 billion at current exchange rates, more  than three times its profits of $303 million in 1985.  </P> <P> The latest figures show underwriting profit of $1.15 billion and total net  premium income of $5.75 billion.  </P> <P> Lloyd's Chairman Murray Lawrence said that although prospects for 1987 were  encouraging, results for the next three years would be less spectacular, with  marine and aviation markets in particular unlikely to produce satisfactory  profits in 1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> "There are signs that some important areas of the market are approaching the  bottom of the trough, and I believe that during 1990, rates in these areas  should begin to harden and move upward to more realistic levels," he said.  </P> <P> The marine market had an underwriting return of 19.7% before currency gains,  but excessive capacity and worsening claims were producing unfavorable  conditions.  </P></p>

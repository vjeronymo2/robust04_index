			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is the 31st in a series of  editorial reports on political Islam in Egypt. These reports  include summaries of all articles, reports, interviews,  commentaries, or other items on political Islam that have been  published in all the issues of Cairo newspapers 'AQIDATI,  AL-NUR, and AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH since late December 1993 and  most of the issues of the twice-weekly newspaper AL-SHA'B.    SHAYKH 'ABD-AL-KAFI BANNED FROM PREACHING    A 150-word front-page report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im notes  that ``the security services have banned Shaykh Dr. 'Umar  'Abd-al-Kafi from preaching in his Asad Ibn-al-Furat Mosque in  al-Duqqi and from giving religious lessons. The mosque has been  placed under the control of the Awqaf Ministry.''    ISLAMIST DETAINEES GO ON HUNGER STRIKE    A brief 30-word report on page 1 says that ``the imprisoned  Islamist detainees have declared a hunger strike in protest  against ill-treatment, denial of visitation rights, confiscation  of blankets and clothing, and the torture of some detainees on a  regular basis in the Abu-Za'bal Prison. The strike began a few  days ago in the al-'Aqrab, Abu-Za'bal, and Turah prisons.''    RELIGIOUS SCHOLAR WARNS AGAINST CULTURAL INVASION    In a 300-word article on page 12, religious scholar Muhammad  al- Ghazali warns against the West's cultural invasion, which he  says has created bands of apostates who are destroying the  religious heritage. He says that these ``apostate bands are  deliberately mixing freedom of thought and freedom of  disbelief.'' He concludes: ``We must confront these apostate  bands with the necessary contempt and hostility, and unveil the  parties for which they work so that the people can beware of  them.''</p>

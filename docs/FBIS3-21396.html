			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Good Decision"] </F>   [Text] According to a news report, a decision has been made  to start building a nuclear power plant to meet the increasing  demand for power in our country. Although the inappropriate  attitude of the Western nations towards our peaceful nuclear  program is given as the reason for this principled decision,  however, we believe that our policy-makers should continue to  build the nuclear power plant on our own despite the support  offered by other countries. The few nations that have attained  nuclear capability cannot be trusted. The moral perversion these  countries have demonstrated in order to deprive the third world  of cheap modern technology need not be mentioned here. Their  treatment of Muslim countries is openly prejudiced. Therefore,  we should not trust these countries in any situation. The  irreparable loss we have suffered in the area of peaceful use of  nuclear technology was caused mainly by the unfair attitude of  the Western nations, however, our governments' ambiguous  policies also played a role in it. Had our policy-makers started  to attain nuclear technology when France and Canada had refused  to cooperate with us, we would not be facing this energy crisis  now. This energy shortage has all but stopped our developmental  projects.</p>

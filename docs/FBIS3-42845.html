The liberalization of social and political life in the  republic and individual measures geared to a reform of the  economy initiated movement toward a new condition of society  based on a market economy and political pluralism. But the  half-baked nature of the measures adopted by the legislature and  the executive in recent years and the absence of a clear concept  of stabilization of the situation in the economy and of arrival  at a new quality of development led to the destruction of the  previous economic, social, and political structures and to the  underdevelopment of the new ones. As a result society has found  itself in a dangerous situation fraught with permanent  sociopolitical and economic crisis.    The Liberal Convention of Moldova believes that there is no  alternative to the further development of democracy, a radical  reform of property relations, and the creation of a full-fledged  and efficient economic system based on market mechanisms. There  is no other way of extricating the country from the crisis and  of the creation of favorable conditions for the formation of the  state.    The key question consists of the formulation of a clear and  consistent concept of reforms based on the creative application  of the principles of liberalism and in accordance with the  particular features of the economy of Moldova, with the evolved  mentality and traditions of the people. Without a vision by all  citizens of Moldova of the conceptual trajectory of movement,  without an understanding of long-range and immediate goals, and  without specific programs of transformations at the macro- and  microeconomic levels, renewal and a new quality of Moldova's  socioeconomic development will not be achieved.    In the absence of mature political parties and democratic  traditions in Moldovan society, an effective instrument of the  democratic reform of the country in the initial phase of the  formation of the civil society are the state and its power  structures. The Liberal Convention of Moldova regards power as a  real opportunity for and the basic lever of implementation of  comprehensive programs of transformations on the basis of  liberal doctrine and with regard to the specifics and salient  features of Moldova.    These program principles, which have been made the basis of  the activity of the Liberal Convention of Moldova and which  contain the main directions of further liberal reforms in the  political, economic, and social spheres, could contribute to a  stabilization of the situation at the transitional stage and  impart new impetus to the country's development on the path of  democracy and progress.  <H3>  Freedom Under the Conditions of Order--Toward an Efficient  Law-Based and Democratic Society </H3>   In the political sphere the Liberal Convention considers a  principal goal the strengthening of the statehood of the  Republic of Moldova and the country's further development as an  independent, sovereign, and democratic state.    The Moldovan people's right to statehood is the right to the  preservation of its distinctiveness and the creation of the  necessary conditions for the more than 4.5 million citizens of  different nationalities of the republic, who are capable only by  joint efforts of extricating society from the crisis,  stabilizing the situation, and creating living conditions for  the present and future generations which are worthy of man at  the end of the 20th century.    It is important to adopt national features of Moldovan  statehood, ensuring simultaneously the principle of equal  opportunities for all citizens before the law, regardless of  national affiliation. Setting the goal of the creation of a  minimum, but strong and effective state, with regard to the  residual influence of the authoritarian regime on people's frame  of mind and the particular features of the mass consciousness at  the stage transitional to a full-fledged and efficient  democratic society, the formation of a strong presidential  republic is justified and logical.    The head of state, elected by the whole people, should have  the opportunities for corrective influence on the branches of  power for the purpose of assurance of the operation of the  constitution and laws of the country and the rights and  liberties of its citizens.    An improvement of the institutions of the state presupposes  primarily a delineation of the political and economic  authorities, a decisive reduction in the role and influence of  the state as a subject of economic relations via active  privatization and the growth of nonstate property in the  economy, the increased competence and responsibility of  employees of the machinery of state, and effective control of  the executive structures on the part of the organs of  representative power.    In the immediate future the state will retain the functions  of regulation at the macroeconomic level, in the main, ensuring  a reasonable proportion between the economic liberty of the  members of society and directed influence in accordance with the  economic and social programs of the governing majority.    The principle of interethnic accord and the settlement of  disagreements by the peaceful, democratic path should be a  fundamental proposition of the state's domestic policy. This  would permit the positive resolution of the problem of social  stability and ensure a dynamic balance of the interests of the  multinational population of the republic.    On the other hand, consistent and decisive measures of the  power structures in respect to the use of constitutional means  to ensure the territorial integrity of Moldova and the unity and  inviolability of its territory are essential.    The resolution of the conflicts in the Dniester region and  the south of Moldova based on the maximum consideration of  current realities and strictly in accordance with the rules of  international law, the principles of the European process, and  UN decisions is a principal condition of the restoration of  sovereignty throughout the territory of the republic and of  peace and tranquillity in the republic.    The decentralization of state power, the transfer of  managerial functions to the local government authorities, their  release from the tutelage of the "center," and the legislative  enshrinement of these principles in the course of  administrative-territorial reform would make it possible to  organize the more precise interaction of the authorities in the  center and locally on the basis of a delineation of authority  and to enhance the efficiency of the power structures in the  defense of social interests.    A principal function of the state should be realization of  the right of the citizen to be a proprietor, the optimum  conditions for free competition, and the surmounting of monopoly  trends.    The continued democratization of society means first and  foremost the creation and assurance of the normal activity of a  civil society. The formation of a protected environment for the  freedom of the individual and the subordination of political and  state power to a community of free people via the consolidation  of the institutions of the civil society--social and political  organizations, societies, and citizens' associations, nonstate  organizations and institutions, and so forth which aim at the  support and protection of the autonomy, initiative, and  responsibility of each individual and people's creative  activity--could impart an irreversible nature to the progressive  transformations.    The gradual return of the functions usurped by the state to  a  self-governing civil society, the establishment of limited  administration and the minimum state jurisdiction under the  conditions of the existence of a clear-cut legislative base and  assurance of the efficiency of the law-and-order authorities and  the state authorities as a whole would make it possible to  realize in practice the principle of freedom under the  conditions of order.    The creation and assurance of the efficient functioning of a  multiparty system and subsequent elections to the country's  parliament on a multiparty basis would make it possible to  enhance the degree of responsibility of the power structures,  and a real instrument of opposition to political voluntarism and  totalitarian tendencies would arise. A parliamentary system and  the mature, responsible approach of the political parties to  support for the efficiency of its activity would afford an  opportunity for the resolution of social contradictions in  civilized fashion, in the interests of the majority, and with  maximum consideration of the opinion of the minority. Thus real  prerequisites for a qualitatively new level, social stability,  and the consolidation of the multinational society would emerge.  A constructive opposition to the authorities would be created  via the multiparty system, which would enable the latter to take  account of the diverse interests and social expectations of  different strata and groups of society.    Aside from the creation of a civil society and assurance of  the functioning of a multiparty system, further democratization  includes the following aspects:    the real separation of the branches of power to prevent the  authorities' slide toward political voluntarism and the tendency  to establish an authoritarian regime of government;    the realization at all levels of activity of the political  system and state power of the principle of political liberalism,  which contributes to control of the authorities on the part of  society and of the "managers" on the part of the "managed";    the building of an effective state based on the rule of law  and a defender of the rights and liberties of the citizen. The  consistent conversion of the interventionist state and the  legacy of the totalitarian regime into a management authority  and state administration;    the adoption of a constitution of the Republic of  Moldova--the charter of power and the basic voluntary compact  between the individual and the state;    the improvement of legislation to create the legal  conditions  for the realization in day-to-day practice of the fundamental  values of liberalism;    the creation of a climate of broad cooperation among all  political formations and social and political organizations of  Moldova of a liberal-reform persuasion for the surmounting of  reactionary-conservative trends still capable of winding down  the reforms in society that have begun and restoring the  totalitarian regime in an individual post-Soviet republic;    maintenance of a high moral and ethical level in political  activity and in public life as a whole without renunciation of  particular principles and consistency in their defense.    The pursuit of an active and consistent foreign policy and a  guarantee of national security are a most important function of  the young Moldovan state.    The world community's recognition of the Republic of Moldova  as an independent state and the country's membership of a number  of international organizations have created for us a  qualitatively new situation, where the foreign policy course,  reflecting national-state interests, is developing in accordance  with the principles of the United Nations and the European  process, the rules of international law, and values common to  all mankind.    The particular features of Moldova's geopolitical location  in  the south of East Europe, the ethno-demographic composition of  the population, and the economic and defense potential of the  country predetermine political and diplomatic means as the basic  means in assurance of the security of the republic at the  complex stage of its development as a new European state in the  post-totalitarian era. The maintenance of friendly and mutually  beneficial relations with contiguous states, primarily with  Romania and Ukraine, which are for us the gates to the West and  to the East, is of exceptional significance for Moldova.    The common ethnic roots, language, historical past, and  culture objectively predetermine the priority relations of the  Republic of Moldova and Romania. The Liberal Convention  advocates the surmounting of the excessive politicization of  Moldovan-Romanian relations and the consistent expansion and  intensification of mutually profitable trade and economic,  cultural, and other relations between the two states. By joint  and concerted efforts we would succeed in ridding ourselves more  quickly of the sinister legacy of totalitarianism and  dictatorship engendering radical nationalism and nostalgia for  the past.    Relations with Russia remain a most important issue of  Moldova's foreign policy. They should be built on the basis of  respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two  states and the development of mutually beneficial relations in  the economic sphere and science and culture. The exclusion of  double standards and pressure in the solution of questions of a  political nature and interference in internal affairs and, in  particular, the withdrawal of Russian troops from the eastern  parts of the republic and a resolution of the Dniester conflict  in accordance with the rules of international law could  consolidate Moldovan-Russian relations.    Paramount significance, particularly at the transitional  stage, is attached to mutual relations with the states of the  CIS built on a treaty and bilateral and multilateral basis. They  are conditioned by the continued economic ties and  interdependence of the economies and the long-term possibilities  of these countries as markets for the sale of Moldovan  commodities and supplies of energy and raw material on terms  beneficial to the republic.    It is essential to stimulate Moldova's affiliation to the  integration processes in Central and East Europe and the  countries of the Black Sea in order to obtain access to the  dynamically developing capital, technology, raw material, and  industrial commodity markets. The formation and development of  all-around cooperation with the United States remains an  important strategic direction.    Multilateral contacts and effective participation in the  activity of international organizations--the United Nations,  CSCE, IMF, World Bank, GATT, the International Bank for  Reconstruction and Development, and others--could contribute to  a stabilization of the situation in Moldova and ensues logically  from the policy of the openness of Moldovan society and the  assurance of economic and national security.    A most palpable threat to the security of Moldova and to the  republic's existence as a sovereign state is the aspiration of  certain influential circles of Russia to restore the former  communist superpower within its previous borders. This threat,  which acquired real outline following the victory of the Russian  nationalist radicals at the recent parliamentary elections, can  only be resisted by Moldova's active participation in the  creation of an all-European system of security under the aegis  of the CSCE. A broadening of contacts with the North Atlantic  alliance, which has an interest in the prevention of regional  conflicts and in the assurance of stability on the old  continent, is in Moldova's interests in this context.    A precise ascertainment of the structure of the real and  potential threats to the country's security and independence  should form the basis of the determination of the level of  sufficiency and the organization of the armed forces of the  republic and the determination of their manning level and the  nature of their provision with equipment and arms. It is  essential to bring the system of national security into line  with the principles of the law-based, democratic state and the  rules of international law, considering national-historical  traditions and world experience.    The army of the Republic of Moldova is not only an attribute  of statehood but also a real force for countering potential  military danger and our specific contribution to the European  security system which is being created.    The gradual and planned transition to professional armed  forces smaller in size and providing for a high level of combat  readiness would make it possible to accomplish efficiently the  assignments confronting the army and to reduce appreciably the  burden of military spending.  <H3>  Toward an Efficient Market Economy Via a Surmounting of the  Crisis, Stabilization of the Situation, and the Realization of  Comprehensive Programs of Transformations </H3>   Not only the future of our state but also its very existence  and, consequently, stability in this region of Europe will  depend on the capacity for normalizing the situation in the  economy and formulating and implementing adequate measures for a  way out of the protracted crisis in which Moldova has found  itself.    The complexity of this problem is intensified by the need  for  the simultaneous accomplishment of several tasks which are  difficult even for an economy which is developing in stable  fashion: a halt to the decline in production and the reduction  in the gross national product and the drop in society's living  standard, a surmounting of the structural and technology gap,  and continuation of the transition to a market economy.    The Liberal Convention considers as the main causes of the  intensification of the crisis in the economy the following:    1. An orientation toward the production and sale of  agricultural raw material and its primary processing is  predominant in the agro-industrial complex. The republic's  industry, with the rare exception of individual enterprises, is  in a neglected state and is practically unadapted to independent  economic activity under the new conditions. All that is produced  in the country and intended for export is barely sufficient to  cover expenditure on the purchase of raw material and energy  outside of Moldova. Hyperinflation is being imported together  with them from the CIS countries.    2. The comprehensive and phased transfer of the economy to  market mechanisms of the regulation of production activity is  chronically behind schedule. The state retains, as before, the  plenitude of power in the economic sphere, gravitating toward  the customary administrative-command means and levers of control  and engendering thereby voluntarism and, frequently, an  inappropriate response to changing economic realities.    3. The half-baked nature and contradictoriness of the  measures in the sphere of privatization and the fruitless waste  of time in arguments about the forms and means of the  denationalization of state property, instead of the creation of  effective levers and the infrastructure of the engagement of  private initiative--individual and group--in the accomplishment  of national economic tasks, are imparting a chronic nature to  the economic crisis.    4. Instead of stimulating small and medium-sized business  and  the process of the original accumulation of capital and its  subsequent investment in the production sphere, the state, via a  tax system of a manifestly confiscatory nature, is suppressing  private initiative and provoking the mass drain of capital  outside of Moldova. This is causing a chronic shortage of  consumer goods and hyperinflation.    5. The sluggish nature of foreign economic policy, the  absence of new markets for the sale of Moldovan products and  imports of raw material and energy, and an incapacity for  attracting to Moldova foreign investments in the sectors where  this is justified by a lack of resources and progressive  technology are making the situation in the economy worse.    6. None of the last three Moldovan governments has had a  program, precise and considered in detail, of a way out of the  socioeconomic crisis and transition to the market economy. The  declared transition to a market model is being undertaken in a  "groping" manner and by way of a copying of foreign experience.  On the pretext of the realization of measures to stabilize the  economy, a return to the old forms of administration and  management is being undertaken.    7. The legislative base, which was originally created for  support of the transition to the market, is frequently of a  general nature and does not reflect the normalities and salient  features of Moldova or a specific model and concept of  transformations. The prerequisites for a free interpretation of  the laws and the appearance of a mass of legally binding  enactments creating an atmosphere of uncertainty in the majority  of subjects of economic relations are being created hereby.    An appreciable and positive role in the solution of the  entire set of economic questions could be performed by foreign  investments. The experience accumulated in the last three years  testifies that it would be a mistake to rely exclusively on  economic assistance from outside. The basis of an anticrisis  program should be the stimulation of domestic manufacturers and  investors. Assistance will be rendered to those who have shown  their capacity for working efficiently and those who save and  invest in the development of production and contribute to the  creation of new jobs in all spheres of economic activity.    Reliance first and foremost on our own potential  possibilities, a policy of the coordination of efforts in the  sphere of the economy with the CIS countries, and the attraction  of foreign investments to the spheres in which it is impossible  to overcome the crisis phenomena thanks to our own potential  could set the necessary directions for overcoming the crisis.    The second strategic direction consists of the choice of the  correct priorities for surmounting the technology gap and  providing for the structural reorganization of the economy. In  the sphere of material production the priorities for Moldova are:    saturation of the market in short order with food and  consumer merchandise;    the creation and modernization of the technological and  production base of the processing of agricultural produce and  the production of competitive foods;    the structural reorganization and, where necessary, the  conversion of the former defense enterprises of industry and the  development of research-intensive and energy-saving works;    the solution of questions of the republic's stable energy  supply and supplies of the necessary quantity of energy  resources;    an expansion of the production of building materials using  local raw material and a buildup of the facilities of  construction and building materials industry, primarily for the  erection of housing;    the introduction universally of environmentally clean  technology;    the formation of a modern infrastructure--transport,  communications, power engineering, tourism, and a hotel network.    The main driving force of the special programs at the macro-  and microeconomic levels should be the active denationalization  and privatization of property and the large-scale inclusion of  private initiative and free enterprise in the accomplishment of  economic tasks combined with the regulatory role of the state.    It is essential to formulate clear stages of the reform of  the economy, moving from a stabilization of the situation to a  full-fledged market model integrated in the world system of  economic relations.    The first stage is 1994. The main task: saturation of the  consumer market with commodities, which is a principal condition  of the assurance of social stability and the continuation of  market reforms.    The means and mechanisms of the accomplishment of the said  task are:    the active and large-scale privatization of small and  medium-sized enterprises, facilities of the service sphere, and  housing. The creation of an infrastructure for the support of  efficient investment and the free movement of capital;  securities markets, trust companies, investment funds, and so  forth;    the channeling of the resources obtained from privatization  into the creation of a liberal fund for the support of the  private sector and the stimulation of the initial accumulation  and investment of capital in socially significant production  sectors of the economy;    the abandonment of a fiscal tax policy of total confiscatory  taxation and the flexible use of economic levers to stimulate  investments in the economy of the republic and prevent a drain  of capital abroad;    the liberalization of export and import activity and  regulation of commodity-supply exports and imports by economic  measures and the abandonment of rigid bureaucratic  administration of trade and economic relations with other  countries;    the pursuit of an active antitrust policy and the  stimulation  of competition on the domestic market and the production of  high-quality goods for export;    the concessionary taxation of investments in the production  sphere and in the priority areas of the development of industry,  agriculture, and consumer service;    the local concessionary transfer and long-term lease and  sale  of land to foreign investors on the strength of progressive  engineering designs (model farms, processing complexes, and so  forth);    the creation of free economic zones to attract foreign  investments and modern technology, the creation of jobs, and the  training of personnel for work under the conditions of the  market economy (the Danube-South zone, Dniester-East,  Chisinau-Center, Beltsy-North). The development of comprehensive  government programs of the creation of the zones and the  legislative enshrinement of the conditions of their activity;    the preservation of profitable agricultural enterprises and  their conversion into stock companies. The denationalization of  unprofitable production units and their conversion into private  and cooperative enterprises and effective assistance to them at  the stage of the formation of new forms of management in  agriculture;    the creation of the necessary base and infrastructure for  agrarian reform; specialized banks, exchanges, investment funds,  production of agricultural equipment, and so forth;    an increase in the efficiency of the use of the research  potential of Moldova and the development of venture enterprise  providing for high returns and rapid savings.    Development of the agro-industrial complex of Moldova and  its  consistent and decisive reform and also measures to saturate the  consumer market with foodstuffs should remain a principal  strategic priority.    A key issue in this sphere is the development of small-scale  rural processing industry. Utilizing economic levers, the main  thing is to ensure the necessary investments for the  construction or equipping of a designed number of small and  medium-sized enterprises on the basis of compact equipment  capable of manufacturing in situ a high-quality end product.    This would make it possible to reduce losses of agricultural  raw material and create additional and prestigious jobs for the  rural population. The funds of shareholders in the person of  agricultural enterprises with mixed capital, private  investments, and government resources would be mobilized to this  end.    The destruction of the kolkhozes (stock companies) and the  mass privatization of the land and fixed capital in the agrarian  sector would be an unforgivable mistake. Consistent and  carefully considered measures ensuring the proportionality and  competition of all forms of ownership are needed more here than  in any other sphere of economic activity. At the initial stage  of comprehensive agrarian reform the state should render private  initiative and the private farms effective support, creating for  them the optimum conditions of activity and the prerequisites  for healthy competition to emerge.    The government should draw up as quickly as possible a  program of the attraction and utilization of foreign investments  and of the importation and assimilation of modern technology  with regard to the chosen strategy and priorities.    At the second stage (1995-1999) the denationalization of  large-scale enterprises and their conversion into stock  companies with the equal participation of the state as a  shareholder in the sectors of strategic significance for Moldova  and also the sale of production units to private individuals  will continue.    Important content of this stage of the formation of  full-fledged market relations should be new driving forces and  stimuli of the development of the economy: the genuine freedom  of all commodity producers, the engagement of full-fledged  market mechanisms, land reform and the rational use and  conservation of natural resources, and the effective  incorporation of free economic zones in the country's single  economic complex.    This stage will be characterized by the formation of  developed commodity and currency markets and other  markets--capital, manpower, securities, intellectual property. A  competent personnel corps in the field of domestic and  international business will gradually be created. Altogether  these measures will create the necessary prerequisites of the  normal functioning of an open-type market model of the economy  with the minimum intervention on the part of the state and based  on private initiative and competition protected by law.    Problems of the budget deficit and the convertibility of the  national currency will be resolved as the market relations are  built.    The surmounting of the extensive development of the economy  and a rational approach to the utilization of natural resources,  primarily the land and energy- and resource-saving technology,  will create real prerequisites for the restoration of the upset  balance in nature and make it possible to realize directed  measures for protection of the environment also.    The strategy of transition to a market economy should be the  economic ideology of the whole of society, of everyone who  considers Moldova his homeland and is prepared to share with it  the burdens of the transitional period and the joy of future  well-being.  <H5>  Lowering Tension in Society and Social Development </H5>   Questions of social development are closely interconnected  with society's achievement of a particular level of economic  well-being making it possible to provide for the redistribution  of material and financial resources for a solution of questions  of a social nature. The saturation in short order of the  consumer market with food and industrial commodities would  create the prerequisites at the initial stage of the reforms for  a lowering of social tension and the restoration of normal  conditions for a stabilization of the situation in the economy.  On the other hand, a reduction in the inflation hitting  constantly at personal income could also stabilize the situation  not only in the economy but in society as a whole as well.    There is no doubt that as long as the republic is in a state  of protracted economic crisis and until effective measures to  get the better of inflation have been adopted, only  irresponsible populists and political adventurers could promise  a solution of absolutely all social questions.    At the stage of stabilization of the situation in the  socioeconomic sphere the Liberal Convention considers paramount  the following questions:    government support and the creation of normal living  conditions for the disabled and needy strata of  society--retirees, the handicapped, large families, and trainee  youth. Strict consideration of the level of inflation and a  timely increase in pensions, grants, and allowances;    prevention of a decline in research, culture, education, and  health care and government subsidies for them;    stimulation of the creation of jobs and the assurance of  social safeguards against unemployment;    the development of diverse systems of insurance, private  included, for the creation of additional channels of social  protection.    Provision will be made for these areas of social protection  primarily from budget appropriations, the resources of the funds  that are created, and with the help of government stimulation of  philanthropy.    Throughout the stabilization period, public medical services  and education will remain free of charge. The subsequent and  gradual introduction of private medical establishments and  educational institutions must be undertaken so as not to be in  any way detrimental to the general educational level of the  citizens.    With regard to the structural transformations in industry  and  agriculture close attention needs to be paid to the system of  the retraining of specialists and workers and to the migration  of manpower.    A large share of responsibility will be borne by the  fledgling class of entrepreneurs. The assistance they render the  disabled part of society and the preservation of the solidarity  of all strata of the populace in the difficult period of  transition to the market economy could exert a positive  influence on social processes and preserve peace and  tranquillity in the country.    An important condition of the achievement of this goal is  the  for assurance of each who so desires it of entrepreneurial  freedom and the possibility of application of his powers in any  sphere of activity in order that the more capable, industrious,  and enterprising may attain to a higher social status in society.    The appearance of a social stratum of Moldovan  entrepreneurs,  15-20 percent of the total number of the able-bodied population,  is a key factor of the realization of transformations,  stabilization of the situation, continuation of market reforms,  and assurance of economic upturn.    The large social group of the intelligentsia, managers, and  former career servicemen constitutes a good potential base of  the future middle stratum.    The formation of the new social structure of society will  directly influence the machinery of state also and, via this  latter, the efficiency of the activity of the state. It is  essential to adopt measures to enhance the status, social image,  and protection of public employees. The departure of skilled  specialists for the commercial structures is exerting a negative  influence on the capacity of the machinery of state for  upholding public interests.    The incomplete nature of the reforms and the retention in  the  hands of the machinery of state of practically the plenitude of  power, economic included, with the low pay of the employees and  the simultaneous accumulation of capital among representatives  of business circles and also the absence of precise and  long-term legal guarantees of their activity are creating  altogether an extremely dangerous situation socially which is  stimulating corruption and other crimes of office. The  imperfection of the legislative base regulating the rights and  obligations of the employees of the machinery of state and the  activity of the law enforcement authorities in the fight against  this social evil are making this situation worse and imparting a  chronic nature to it. The Liberal Convention advocates the  decisive eradication of corruption and other malfeasance by the  authorities by way of the elimination of their causes and the  strict application of the law in respect to all offenses,  regardless of the position held.    A change in the value orientation in society thanks to the  directed formation of a pro-market consciousness in the  population, in the young people primarily, is an important  factor.    A principal component of the social strategy of the Liberal  Convention is the assurance on the basis of the development of  the market economy of a high living standard and quality of life  for all groups of the country's population, which would ensure  the stability and dynamism of the development of Moldovan  society.    Considering the social stratification of society an  inevitable process accompanying market reforms and the  democratization of society, the Liberal Convention believes that  a principal task in the social sphere, in the transitional  period particularly, is the reduction to a rational minimum of  the difference in personal income levels, economic levers being  utilized for this. A balanced policy in this sphere would make  it possible to avoid possible social conflicts caused by the  difficulties of adaptation to the new realities.    The fundamental principles of liberalism presuppose the  introduction in all spheres of the activity of people and  society of the principle of the equality before the law of all  citizens, regardless of nationality and religious belief. The  establishment of a climate of trust and dialogue, the removal of  any form of discrimination, and the surmounting of egotism,  group ambitions, and the habit of creating an enemy where  constructive cooperation is needed would help us attain to a  qualitatively new state of society that is freer and more  civilized.    In the future the combination in day-to-day practice of the  principles of political and economic liberalism will make it  possible to create a social environment in which the majority of  people live freely, which will be guaranteed by private property  and control over the political authorities on the part of the  civil society.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (28): Peace dividend may be delayed - Middle East / The structure of most economies in the region has so far remained immune to the wave of liberalisation elsewhere in the world IN JUST a month, the cast of Middle Eastern politics has been transformed. The signature of an outline peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation on September 13, unthinkable a little more than a fortnight before, broke the deadlock in the Middle East peace talks and accomplished the necessary first step for a full and comprehensive regional peace. Much remains to be negotiated before that dream is reached. Syria and Lebanon must follow Jordan in signing even documents of principle to guide their own talks. But enough has been achieved already to raise serious questions about the future economic cast of the region. Will nascent peace, in particular, encourage greater regional economic integration than hitherto? And might this in turn lead to stronger trade and investment ties with other trading blocs - most particularly with Europe? History suggests that progress in both cases is likely to be glacial. The first impediment will be political will, which has traditionally been found wanting in any of the few attempts to date to forge meaningful economic blocks, grouping, particularly, the countries between the Gulf and North Africa. Moreover, as the example of the cold peace between Egypt and Israel, now more than a decade old, shows, peace alone is no guarantor of enhanced economic integration. Trade and investment flows between Egypt and Israel, the two biggest economies of this block, remain small and to some extent grudging. As an instance, only 3,000 Egyptians have travelled as tourists to Israel during the whole 14 years of peace. Another impediment is the very structure of most economies in the region, which has remained steadfastly immune to the wave of liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation which has eroded previously dirigiste economies elsewhere in the world. As Mr Mohamed El-Erian and Mr Shamsuddin Tareq, two International Monetary Fund economists, stated in a recent independent report: 'No country in the region may be regarded as having implemented a comprehensive program of wholesale divestiture of public sector enterprises - in contrast to the experience in Asia, central and eastern Europe and Latin America.' As their report emphasises, most countries in the region have been characterised by policies of import-substituting industrialisation, heavy reliance on the state sector and restrictive trade practices. 'The private sector came to perform an increasingly residual role in a number of economic and financial sectors, with administrative allocation of resources replacing market signals.' Trade regimes, meanwhile, are 'characterised by extensive quantitative restrictions, nominal tariffs and cumbersome administrative procedures'. Profound internal reforms would, therefore, be the pre-requisite of any attempts, even given sufficient political will, towards greater regional economic integration. But progress here has also been tentative at best. Of the countries in the region - excepting North Africa - only Jordan and Egypt have undertaken formal reform programmes under the auspices of the IMF and World Bank. In this respect the Gulf economies are something of a special case, although recent high deficit spending in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have received IMF attention, even if they have not quite accepted IMF prescriptions. The course of Egypt's reform programme offers modest hope for optimism. Since resuming previously fractious relations with the IMF in 1991, Cairo has succeeded in completing one agreement and will this month commence a second. In the financial economy, the results have been striking: budget deficits have been slashed from above 20 per cent of gross domestic product to below 3 per cent, inflation has been halved to around 12 per cent, the exchange rate has been stable for two years, interest rates now imply a real cost of money - and are gradually falling - and reserves have accumulated to around Dollars 16bn. Import restrictions and tariffs have been considerably eased. New banking and capital market laws have been passed. These macro-economic gains are likely to be built upon during the three years of the second programme. But deeper structural reforms to the economy have been harder won and far more limited. Indicatively, the government's privatisation programme - thrashed out at great and painful length with the World Bank - is well behind schedule, somewhat mired in bureaucratic complexity and still to address the core public sector industries which dominate at least 70 per cent of Egypt's manufacturing output. 'The financial economy is going quite well, but reforms to the real economy are going rather badly,' remarks Mr Rodney Wilson, a specialist in Middle Eastern economies at the University of Durham. The reasons for this are complex and deeply rooted. One is the leaden nature of Egypt's bureaucracy, the poverty of public sector wages and the attendant shortage of high-calibre administrators capable of implementing sophisticated reforms. Another is governmental caution in carrying through reforms which, in the short run, are likely only to increase joblessness in an economy which cannot, already, keep up with the need to create upwards of 500,000 new jobs a year. There is also a structural resistance to opening an economy the closedness of which has created deeply entrenched vested interests - many of them close to the regime itself. Egypt, therefore, appears unlikely to become any sort of powerhouse for a regionally-based economic revival in the near term. The appetite for reform elsewhere is also limited. According to IMF officials, Lebanon has hinted at the possibility of undertaking some form of Fund assistance. Syria has shown little taste for such yet - although President Hafez al-Assad has in the last year or so gradually begun to dismantle some of the statist economic controls bequeathed by the state's pseudo-socialist Baathist ideology. But whatever the political, social or structural impediments, there is a desperate need for some shift in economic thinking. Few of the region's economies presently meet fully their peoples' needs - and, in some countries, the worsening shortcomings of the economy provide only an improving platform for anti-government activism, including Islamic fundamentalism. Messers El-Erian and Tareq remark; 'The need for sustained and comprehensive policy actions becomes more important in the context of some countries' rapidly growing populations, uncertainties about the prospects for a natural resource base, and the tendency outside the Middle East toward preferential regional trading blocs.'</p>

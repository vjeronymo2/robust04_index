Traditionally, the  Attorney General's Office has only exerted disciplinary control  over servicemen and policemen, punishing almost exclusively  flaws in service and abuse of power. Based on a critical  self-analysis, the office concluded this is not sufficient.    That is why now, under the guidance of Deputy Attorney  General Mauricio Echeverri Gutierrez, the Public Order  Commission [Comission de Orden Publico] of that office is  beginning a new strategy to try to exert a more preventive and  immediate control. The bases of this new control program are  the regional diagnostics on the public order situation in  specific zones and the performance pacts in which citizens, the  Armed Forces, and watchdog organizations participate directly.    At the disciplinary level, the novelty of this program is  that the Attorney General's Office is not only going to punish  those responsible for an illegal action but also those who by  omission allowed the illegal action to take place. So far, the  Attorney General's Office has analyzed the public order  situation in Santander's Middle Magdalena region, Uraba, south  of Cesar, and Arauca.    In Middle Magdalena, for example, said office conducted a  study of the complaints against the police and found that most  of them are related to irregularities during raids, arbitrary  arrests, abuse during interrogations, flaws in intelligence  reports, and harassment of civilians. "That analysis allows us  to identify problems and recommend solutions to the police and  Army so no more complaints are filed. The guarantee that our  observations are heeded is that we do a follow-up every three  months on the police in specific zones," Echeverri indicated.    Among the recommendations suggested by the Attorney  General's  Office to the Armed Forces are: not to touch the scenes of  battles where there are dead or wounded; notify immediately the  appropriate authorities about the arrest of alleged offenders  and raids; and allow the control corps to inspect the operations  log.    In the medium-term, the Attorney General's Office is going  to  insist that a national statute to conduct intelligence reports  be drafted. "We cannot continue to conduct military or police  operations based on rumors. That is why we must establish clear  guidelines to prepare these kinds of documents," the official  added.    According to Echeverri, the new human rights protection  program, which has an interinstitutional nature since control  and security organisms participate in it, entails periodic  checks. If citizens' complaints of abuses by soldiers go down  that means the suggestions by said office are being heeded.    "To avoid the distortion of the complaints, the Attorney  General's Office pledges to evaluate and follow up every  complaint to establish whether or not it is justified,"  designated Human Rights Ombudsman Hernando Valencia Villa said.    Echeverri affirmed another of the virtues of this program is  that permanent, direct, and immediate communications exist  between the police and Army and control organizations to prevent  problems. "The Army, for instance, has pledged to keep watchdog  organizations informed of its operations. If they make an  arrest or conduct a raid they pledged to report it immediately,"  the deputy attorney general noted.    Echeverri and Valencia define this program as "a pact on a  commitment between the Attorney General's Office and the Armed  Forces." Another of the virtues of the new monitoring approach,  according to Echeverri, is that the work by the watchdog  organisms is decentralized because centralization has proven  highly flawed. "The idea is to bring all the commands closer in  a region and establish operations and control guidelines. We  cannot talk here of an Attorney General's Office syndrome or of  hampering military operations, but of all of us avoiding future  problems for the Armed Forces," Echeverri added.    The official indicated the program has been so effective  that  on the eve of the recent elections the Army, police, and  Administrative Department of Security conducted a large-scale  operation in Yopal because of reports the guerrillas were  preparing a guerrilla offensive from there to hamper the  elections. "The police," Echeverri noted, "in coordination with  the Prosecutor General's Office and the Attorney General's  Office conducted 50 raids, and only one complaint was filed  involving a minor irregularity in the procedure."</p>

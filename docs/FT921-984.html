			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Call for pension control changes EMPLOYERS would be prevented from using pension fund surpluses for their own purposes under pensions law proposals being urged by the Institute for Policy Research, the left-of-centre think tank. It also proposes giving control over funds to beneficiaries. The report addresses the most sensitive question being considered by legislators considering pensions law: whether a pension fund surplus is the property of the employer or of the scheme's members. The institute rejects employers' arguments that liability to make good any deficit entitles them to recoup surpluses. Although employers are correct in theory, the report notes that most scheme rules give employers the right to cease their contributions at any time, regardless of the financial state of the pension fund. Provisions in the 1990 Social Security Act which will require employers to make good deficiencies when a pension fund is wound up may be ineffective because a financially troubled employer may simply stop contributing and not wind the fund up until the options run out - upon bankruptcy. The report suggests that in return for surrendering their right to use surpluses, employers' contributions should be defined and limited. Employer and employee contributions should be a contractually binding matter to be renegotiated periodically. Contributions levels in the event of a surplus or deficit would be spelled out. Making up shortfalls would be a matter to be negotiated between employers and beneficiaries. Locking the Stable Door, Institute of Public Policy Research, 30-32 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA. Pounds 5.</p>

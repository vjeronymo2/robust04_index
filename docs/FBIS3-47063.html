			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Four cabinet ministers  compared notes Monday [10 January] on a fresh action program to  open Japan's large-scale public works projects to foreign  bidders, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara said.    The ministers confirmed that the action plan should be  designed to boost transparency, objectivity and free competition  in Japan's construction market and secure greater foreign  access, Ishihara said.    They were Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Construction  Minister Kozo Igarashi, Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato and  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    The 20-minute meeting was in line with Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's instruction on October 22 to hammer out an  action program in early 1994 to open Japan's construction market  to foreign firms.    The government issued an outline of the scheme to improve  its  public works bidding systems on October 26 to avert U.S.  punitive actions against Japan.    Ishihara told a news conference the government hopes to  thrash out details of the action program by around mid-January.    He denied, however, that the timetable has anything to do  with the January 20 deadline for U.S. sanctions against Japan  over construction procurement practices.    "It is not that we are working out an action plan in the  face  of threatened sanctions but at our own volition," Ishihara said.    The United States has threatened to impose sanctions if  Japan  fails to take steps to increase the openness of its construction  market and secure greater foreign access by January 20, an  extended deadline from the original October 31.    Ishihara also said that all cabinet ministers, except Sadao  Yamahana who is in charge of political reform, will meet prior  to a regular cabinet session on Tuesday morning to exchange  views on the planned action program.    At the meeting, Ishihara said, Hosokawa will explain the  outcome of Monday's talks and seek cooperation from the  ministers.    He revealed that ministers did not discuss the value of  projects undertaken by national and local governments, or by  public corporations, for which foreign contractors will be  allowed to participate in tenders.    The four ministers also did not talk about a possible halt  to  preferential treatment for U.S. construction firms in bidding  for Japan's major public works projects, the deputy chief  cabinet secretary said.    Igarashi, the construction minister, has said Tokyo may stop  such preferential treatment for U.S. firms in return for the  introduction of an open bidding system.    U.S. construction firms have received work on 34 Japanese  projects worth a total of nearly 100 billion yen, including New  Kansai International Airport near Osaka, western Japan, since  the two governments agreed on the idea in 1988.</p>

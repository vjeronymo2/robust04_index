			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Selling the facts EUROPEAN cash and futures markets were extremely bullish about the prospect for rate cuts on the continent yesterday after the Bundesbank announced that it would be holding a news conference after its fortnightly council meeting, writes James Blitz. Sterling and French franc futures rose sharply in the interval between 1.00 and 2.15 pm London time on the expectation that a cut in Germany's officially-posted interest rates would help ease monetary policy elsewhere. But, when news of both the 25 basis point cut in the Discount rate and the 50 basis point cut in the Lombard rate came through, the reaction was one of disappointment, and sterling futures fell back sharply. In part, the price fall in the European afternoon may have been due to the dealer principle of 'buying on the rumour and selling on the facts.' However, dealers seemed unwilling to assume that yesterday's cut in the Discount rate heralded aggressive easing in the future. The March Euromark contract rose 17 basis points on the day, to a peak of 92.30, before closing unchanged on the day at 92.13. At this level, it assumes that 3-month money will be 7.87 per cent next month, only 13 basis points below the current Discount rate. The reaction in French franc markets was more ebullient. The March French franc contract rose 75 basis points to 89.30 on the expectation that a cut in German rates could allow French policy to ease. But, again, the March contract fell back to a close of 89.91. At this level, it prices 3-month French francs at 9.09 per cent next month, some 3 per cent below yesterday's level for 3-month money. The assumption of traders must be that there will either be an aggressive easing in German policy or that the French franc will float. There was a bullish mood in the sterling cash market, too, where 3-month Certificates of Deposit were bought as low as 5 7/8 per cent, before closing back up at about 6 per cent. Dealers assumed that a German policy ease would take the presure off sterling on the FX markets. However, Mr Norman Lamont's comment's yesterday that the exchange rate would be closely monitored injected some bearishness at the end of the day.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (6): Market in the doldrum - Trading in shares declined on the stock exchange WHILE TRANSACTIONS in Portuguese government bonds and securities have boomed in the past year, trading in shares has declined, in spite of official efforts to attract investors back to the bolsas. Several factors affected the market's performance. High real interest rates and special fiscal benefits for purchasers of shares in companies being privatised combined to favour investment in government-influenced stocks, at the expense of the broader market. Private Portuguese investors, who have seen the value of shares steadily decline since the stock market crash of 1987, continued to stay away from the market. At the same time, foreign (mainly institutional and corporate) investors, who had been attracted by expectation of rapid gains in an 'emerging' market, have been more cautious, switching their attention to the bond market instead. The Portuguese market remains small, and is easily influenced by the behaviour of a small number of large transactions. Foreign investors, who often account for the bulk of share transactions, also have a disproportionate effect. Recent reforms have yet to have their full impact. Last year's figures speak for themselves. The value of transactions in government bonds and securities rose from Es341bn (Dollars 2.4bn) in 1990 to Es1,460bn. In contrast, the value of shares traded on the official market, not including share flotation for privatisations or over-the-counter trading on the secondary market, fell from Es260.2bn in 1990 to Es244.1bn last year. The Banco Totta &amp; Acores (BTA) index ended 1991 at 1,953.8 - almost 9 per cent below its level a year earlier - and has since slipped below 1,900. The focus now for investors, Portuguese and foreign, is on selective investment, based on careful analysis of prospects for specific sectors in the economy, and on the longer-term outlook for a small number of well-chosen companies. Speculative investments are out, though the habit has not been fully shaken, as demonstrated in hectic dealing in shares of companies being privatised. Jose Carlos Pestana Teixeira, president of the Lisbon bolsa, says high interest rates alone do not explain the poor performance of the stock market: lack of liquidity and insufficient information about the market also played their part. 'A large part of information about the market never reaches people, whether in Portugal or abroad.' Special efforts will be made to improve the flow of information, he adds. New instruments will also be introduced, and a futures and options market, now under consideration, could come into being within 18 months. Meanwhile, Mr Pestana Teixeira hopes to establish marketmakers for shares, as has been done with the government bond market. Some analysts believe the market remains too rigid and time-consuming. 'When an investor takes a decision to buy or sell shares, he wants to move straight away, not weeks later,' says one. Mr Pestana Teixeira rejects this criticism, saying the problem is not technical but one of liquidity, which the creation of marketmakers could help to alleviate. 'It's partly a cultural problem. You don't create a market by decree, but by building up the confidence of investors,' he says. He believes that recent and forthcoming reforms will help to make the market more efficient, flexible and transparent. These have included the division of the market into three tiers. The first tier, or 'official market', includes a small group of 'top' companies, listed on the new computerised continuous-trading system that links the two exchanges in Lisbon and Oporto; and a larger group of about 50 companies, which are quoted twice a day, as under the old system. Continuous trading was launched last September, with an initial three companies. The number has since grown to 11; and up to 30 could eventually be included, provided they have a minimum market capitalisation of Es500m. The second tier, or 'second market', is for small and medium-size companies with a market capitalisation of at least Es125m. Companies in this tier are quoted whenever there is trading in their shares, but are listed on only one of the two exchanges. At present, this second market consists of three stocks. The third tier, or 'market without quotations', is for companies which do not meet the criteria on liquidity or financial status. Companies in this tier can be traded on either of the two exchanges. Last year, an independent securities exchange commission was set up, to regulate and supervise the market. The exchanges are now managed by two private companies, which will ultimately merge; while the creation of a central clearing-house for all shares will eventually enable delivery against payment settlements. The number of authorised brokers will be doubled to 20 in Lisbon, and raised from 10 to 14 in Oporto, to encourage greater competition and better services. Mr Pestana Teixeira believes that, once the reforms are fully understood and assimilated by investors, the market will be in a better position to recover. Interest rates are slowly coming down, and inflation should also fall, with a positive effect on company earnings, leading some analysts to expect an upturn later this year. 'In our view, the BTA index is substantially undervalued,' says Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton, director with Baring Securities. 'There are stocks available that are as good as any in France, Germany or the UK, and we expect foreign investors to return to Portugal in 1992.'</p>

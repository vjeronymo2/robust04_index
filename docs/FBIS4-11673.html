			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sa'id 'Ayyad] </F>   [Text] Bethlehem, QUDS PRESS -- A former Palestinian  negotiator has said that the arrangements reached by Palestinian  and Israeli negotiators recently and which provide for the  deployment of police units comprised from Israeli, Norwegian,  and Palestinian elements "are a retreat from the prevailing  situation and might create a more harmful one."    In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Ghassan al-Khatib, former  member of the Palestinian delegation to the bilateral talks,  expressed apprehension that these arrangements "might reinforce  and consolidate the existing situation, which includes an  unacceptable settlement presence even in the short-term."    Al-Khatib, who is a leading member of the Palestinian  People's Party, believes that the task of the joint police force  "will not only be to protect the security of Palestinians but  also that of the settlers." He pointed out that this "will mean  recognizing the reality of their presence and their right to  security. This is recognition and reinforcement of a reality  which everyone has admitted is the real cause for the present  grave situation in Hebron."    The Palestinian negotiator said that "solving the problem on  the basis of a joint Palestinian-Israeli-international police  force reflects the Israeli concept of the problem. Namely, that  it is a conflict between Arab residents and Jewish settlers and  that the Israeli authority is a neutral party in this conflict."  He said that the arrangements which are being talked about "are  not a step toward ending settlement activity, but a step toward  its consolidation. They do not constitute a guarantee for the  security of Palestinians, but will complicate the security  situation."    The former Palestinian negotiator called on the Palestinian  leadership to reassess its position with regard to this issue.  He said that "one must not accept any arrangement that does not  include the removal of settlements, especially in Hebron." He  added that the Palestinian side "must not rely on undeclared or  unofficial promises because these promises seek to persuade,  after which the Israeli position will return to its customary  intransigence."</p>

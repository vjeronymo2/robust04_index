			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Lang calls on Scots to oppose plan for their own parliament MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, yesterday called on Scottish businesses to declare their opposition to Labour's plan for a tax-raising Scottish parliament. Mr Lang has also written to 50,000 Scottish businessmen and women warning them that, in addition to Labour's plan for higher UK taxes, the proposed Scottish parliament would be able to raise the basic rate of income tax in Scotland by a further 3p in the pound. A Labour government, he told the Institute of Directors at a lunch in Glasgow, would result in higher business rates by abolishing the uniform business rate and allowing councils to set their own non-domestic rate. The effect would be 'catastrophic' for business, he said. The constitutional debate in Scotland has been galvanised since an ICM opinion poll last week showed that a record 50 per cent of Scots wanted independence. Another poll showed a drop of 9 percentage points in Labour's standing in Scotland, a sharp rise for the Scottish National Party and a modest increase for the Conservatives. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, blames Mr Lang for the growth in support for independence, attributing it to his repeated attacks on a Scottish parliament within the UK. Mr Dewar says these attacks have polarised the constitutional debate into a choice between the status quo and independence. Mr Lang said after his speech, in which he made no reference to the SNP or independence, that Labour's plans would lead to the separation of Scotland from the UK, which was the SNP's aim. He was not attacking the SNP because 'Labour's bad enough'. Some observers argue that Mr Lang is running risks by concentrating his fire on Labour. While a rise in support for the SNP may help the Tories in some constituencies by taking votes away from Labour, it makes the SNP more likely to win Conservative seats such as Mr Lang's own Galloway constituency. Some Scottish Conservatives are urging the government to promise Scotland an assembly after the general election, or at least a referendum on Scotland's constitutional future. Mr Lang indirectly acknowledged there were differences among the Scottish Tories. He said: 'Every party has one or two people with their views. My stand is on the maintenance of the union and I think you will find that everyone in our party is agreed on that.' Meanwhile, the SNP, delighted that independence is at the top of the political agenda in Scotland, yesterday launched a campaign with a party political broadcast featuring the actor Sean Connery and backed by posters. The national poster campaign, in a play on a Scottish lager commercial, carries the phrase: 'They've got yours'. The campaign is in line with the SNP's strategy of persuading Scots to find the self-confidence to vote for independence and convincing them that they would benefit economically.</p>

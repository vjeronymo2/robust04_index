			<p>BFN     [Text] The German foreign minister has put forward a figure  of 500,000 for the number of dead in Rwanda -- 500,000 deaths is  seven percent of the population of the country.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe repeated in the National  Assembly today that it is a real case of genocide. In order to  put an end to it, he suggests that a regional summit be  organized:    [Begin Juppe recording] Faced with the offensive by the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], the Rwandan Government troops  have been carrying out a systematic elimination of the Tutsi  population, which then, of course, resulted in the massacres  becoming generalized.    France has denounced this situation very vigorously. We  support the efforts of the states of the region -- Tanzania,  Zaire, and Uganda -- to achieve a cease-fire, and we advocate a  summit of the heads of state of the region so that they can  bring all possible pressure to bear on the warring sides -- the  RPF on the one side and the Rwandan forces on the other -- to  halt the hostilities and to resume the Arusha process, which,  allow me to point out, was established in 1993 thanks to the  efforts of France. This made it possible for the cessation of  hostilities at the time, before the attack which was launched on  the plane carrying the Rwandan and Burundi presidents. [end  recording]    Alain Juppe also announced that the French health minister  would be going to Burundi and Tanzania tomorrow or the day after  tomorrow with the teams of French doctors given the task of  going to the aid of the refugees.    On the political front, thus, France is proposing a summit  of  the heads of state of the region, in other words, the presidents  of Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. We look at the reasons behind  this initiative with you, Monique Mas:    [Mas] Tanzania, first of all, because it was in Arusha that  the peace agreement between the RPF and the Rwandan Government  was signed last August. President Mwinyi had brought all his  weight to bear to this end. Then Uganda, where the original  core of the RPF was formed. Furthermore, its military  commander, Paul Kagame, won his spurs in President Museveni's  underground movement. Finally, Zaire, which remains a faithful  ally of the Rwandan Government, which is having plenty of  problems on an international diplomatic front at the moment.  Paris considers it useful to get President Mobutu involved  again at the same time as Ugandan President Museveni, whom  France accuses of supporting the RPF. France itself has  supported the Habyarimana regime financially and militarily.    What Paris expects from this summit is a cease-fire in  Rwanda  between the government and the RPF. However, on the military  front, the RPF has the wind in its sails, and, furthermore, it  does not recognize the government as an interlocutor. On the  other hand, for the government, negotiations would be the  occasion for it to put itself forward as an obligatory political  partner.</p>

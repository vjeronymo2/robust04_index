			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Doubt over orimulsion projections BP BITOR, the sole importer of orimulsion to the UK, is expecting to keep sales at existing levels during the next few years. Its hopes cast doubts on government assertions that consumption of the bitumen-based fuel is likely to fall. Mr Stuart Johnston, BP Bitor commercial director, says the company aims for sales to continue at about 1.3m tonnes to 1.5m tonnes a year for the next few years and hopes to increase the figure further by the end of the century. The ambitions of BT Bitor, a joint venture between BP and Petroleos de Venezuela, will cause concern at British Coal which is already struggling to find a future for 12 pits reprieved by the government last month. In its coal white paper, launched after the public outcry over previous pit closure plans, the government said it had been informed by the Venezuelan authorities that orimulsion exports were likely to stay at their minimum contractual level for the foreseeable future. 'This should entail a reduction in the consumption of orimulsion in the United Kingdom of at least 500,000 tonnes of coal equivalent a year from current levels,' the white paper said. In subsequent interviews, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made frequent mention of the likely decline in demand for orimulsion. Energy industry analysts agreed there could be some reduction because of the government's intention to subsidise coal, which would make orimulsion less attractive to the electricity generators. However, they were surprised at the prediction of a drop of as much as 500,000 tonnes, given that the government had rejected suggestions that orimulsion should be subjected to stricter environmental controls that coal. In the short term, competition from orimulsion will affect demand for British coal only at the margins, although existing import levels are the equivalent to the output of one pit, or about 1.5m tonnes of coal. In three or four years time, however, the fuel will pose a greater threat as subsidies for coal run out and stricter pollution controls on all fuels come into practice. Electricity generators believe that recent rulings by the Pollution Inspectorate mean they may have to fit equipment to reduce sulphur levels on all coal-fired and oil-fired power stations in heavy use. This would favour orimulsion, which is burned in oil-fired stations. If generators had to choose between fitting such equipment to coal-fired or oil-fired power stations they may opt for the latter because they have been used less in recent years and have a longer life expectancy.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HEEEEERE'S JOANNA!  </P> <P> Joanna Carson has inked a deal with Warner Books to write her autobiography.  But the wealthy divorcee apparently won't use the book to get back at ex-hubby  Johnny Carson for all those barbed divorce-and-alimony comments on "The Tonight  Show."  </P> <P> Producer/manager Michael Viner, who set the book deal, acknowledged that it  will cover the 11 years -- 1972 to 1983 -- that Joanna was married to Carson,  as well as their acrimonious divorce. But that won't be the focus, he told us.  </P> <P> "It is not a 'Mommie Dearest,' not in any way a 'tell-all' book," Viner said.  "It's an autobiography covering her whole life . . . the story of a woman who  scraped by all her life, who suddenly finds herself married to the king of  Hollywood."  </P> <P> (Joanna is simultaneously working on a Warner Books novel, "Glass Houses," due  out next year, and the untitled autobiography, which has no deadline.)  </P> <P> Joanna "won't comment" on any of this, Viner added. "The last thing she wants  to do is get involved in any controversy having to do with Johnny Carson."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Carson reportedly gets the tough treatment in Laurence Leamer's  "King of the Night," due from William Morrow this summer.

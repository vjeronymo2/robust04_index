			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Grateful for Life Term"] </F>   [Text] The case of German engineer Helmut Szimkus, who has  been sentenced to death in Tehran, kept Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel busy during the April 1993 visit to Bonn by Iranian  Deputy Parliament President Hasan Rohani.    According to a secret document of the Tehran Parliament that  FOCUS has obtained, Kinkel pointed out that the execution of the  alleged Iraqi spy would place a serious strain on German-Iranian  relations. Bonn would be grateful if the death sentence were to  be commuted to life imprisonment. Apart from that, one has to  do everything to keep the topic out of the media, Kinkel  reportedly said.</p>

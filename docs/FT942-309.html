			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (4):'Look at the market' - Publishing / Pauline Goodwin of Kogan Page talks to Tim Dickson No doubt the author who failed to find a publisher for Memoirs of a Microwave Salesman is bitterly disappointed. But if it's any comfort to him, he is not alone. His is one of hundreds of unsolicited manuscripts rejected each year by Kogan Page publishing director Pauline Goodwin. Goodwin's judgment - and that of other senior editors like her - matters a lot these days in the increasingly fierce battle between UK publishers for saleable business book titles. The adverse economic climate has dented everyone's growth, but Kogan Page also faces growing competition from the likes of Pitman and Butterworth Heinemann for the affordable, jargon-free practical guides which have been the hallmark of its success. Even so, the company, founded in 1967 by ex-Cornmarket director Philip Kogan, is likely to achieve an impressive 20 per cent increase in turnover for the 12 months to end-June. It can also claim to have avoided redundancies during the recent recession. Sitting in her office off the Pentonville Road, North London, Goodwin appears much more down to earth than the archetypal books editor. She observes that publishers 'are notorious for using intuition and following their nose' but insists that commercial discipline is equally indispensable. 'I look at the market and ask myself will it sell? You have to keep up with current business trends, know what is happening in the economy generally and, in our part of the market particularly, plug in to management thinking.' Timing and packaging, though, can be decisive. Goodwin cites the example of Kogan Page's highly successful 1992: Strategies for the Single Market, which started off as a book on international marketing but was subsequently 'tweaked' to give it a full '1992' flavour (including a price tag of Pounds 19.92). The title sold 27,000 copies in hardback, was selected for business school reading lists, and translated into several other languages. Goodwin rejects most of the 1,000 or so unsolicited manuscripts sent to her office each year; those she likes are discussed at the fortnightly meetings of Kogan Page's publishing committee (which also comprises Philip Kogan, the firm's senior editors, representatives of the sales and marketing team, and a rights specialist). Each proposal before the committee is accompanied by a detailed profit and loss forecast and marketing assessment. She denies suggestions that there has been a reaction against the flood of business books. 'I think there may be a reaction against personalities, against gurus. But we tend to avoid the big names who demand big advances and lots of personal attention.' Kogan Page has published about 270 titles in the past year - of which between a quarter and a third are new editions. Business and educational subjects dominate the list, but the total includes books published by its small environmental subsidiary, Earthscan. Authors, observes Goodwin, are often in it mainly for the personal PR. Ideas are often generated with the help of outside experts, who advise on business trends and content. Even so, one of her main dilemmas is 'keeping the schedule intact'. Many authors are in full-time employment and have difficulty in finding time to write. 'If one of them gets a big contract the first thing that will go out of the window is the book deadline,' she says. One of the company's strengths is its list of co-publishers, including such organisations as the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and the Confederation of British Industry.</p>

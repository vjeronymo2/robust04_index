			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Government Should Not Be So Concerned About </F> the Timing of Raising the Consumption Tax"]    [Text] What the people desire most now, probably, is for  the nation to regain its economic vitality soon and to develop  into an economic society in which the people can live in  security. It is for this reason that we have persistently  called on the government to overhaul the tax system -- by  readjusting the ratio of direct and indirect taxes -- and to  proceed with implementing income tax cuts on that premise [that  the tax system will be overhauled]. The Tax Commission's  interim report compiled in November essentially is based on this  line of thinking, too.    The problem is how specifically this thinking can be  reflected in the tax system reform to be carried out next year.  We would like to insist that the concept of "effecting in one  package" the income tax cut and consumption tax increase -- as  proposed in the Tax Commission's report -- should be interpreted  flexibly.    The Finance Ministry has recently been persisting in saying  that "even if and when the income tax cut is implemented first,  the relevant bill supporting it should state clearly when the  consumption tax will be raised." But such a policy will  substantially undercut the effect as an economic stimulus  measure which it is hoped that the tax cut will have.    As a matter of principle, no doubt, what is desirable is to  implement the income tax cut and the increase in the consumption  tax at the same time. But with the economic recession only  worsening, there have emerged opinions that the tax system  overhaul should be put to use in boosting the economy and that  the income tax cut should proceed [prior to increasing the  consumption tax]. But according to the Finance Ministry, even  when that happens, it should happen only after it is written in  the law that the consumption tax should be raised in turn to  prevent the income tax cut from "continuing freely." That  policy may be logical as far as the Finance Ministry is  concerned. After all, it is the office which needs to guard  against the national treasury growing poorer.  <H5>  The Economic Outlook Is Growing Grimmer </H5>   But we think that such a policy is no longer realistic. We  would like to note that economic conditions have further  deteriorated while the Hosokawa government has stood idle.    The mid-term and long-term assessments of the economy by  corporate managers and consumers is growing grimmer. They  appear to think that even if the nation does succeed in escaping  its current swamp, there will be no hope of achieving the annual  3.5-percent growth rate envisaged in the government's Five-Year  Economic Plan To Achieve a Better Quality of Life.    The best indication of such a mood may be that major  companies all have rushed toward revising their mid-term and  long-term employment plans and readjusting existing jobs. Even  where the spring labor offensive for wage increases is  concerned, the best that the unions can hope for is a wage  increase consisting of routine promotions. We cannot at this  time hope that national consumption, which is being affected by  the double blows of employment uneasiness and restrained wages,  to increase.    Naturally, the raise in the consumption tax should be  effected only on the grand premise that the economy has fully  returned on track. Under the given economic situation, it is  impossible to make any predictions. There is no guarantee that  the nation will be in any condition to implement the consumption  tax increase by the spring of next year as is claimed by the  Finance Ministry.    Some in the government appear to think that "if the date  that  the tax will be increased is publicized beforehand, that can  induce the people to hurry to spend before that time." No one  can deny that possibility, but we also have to think about what  will happen after that. It is only common sense to expect that  there will be instances of backlash.    But we object to the idea of uncoupling a consumption tax  increase [from the income tax cut] which is being mentioned by  some people in the ruling and opposition camps, as well as in  business circles. Before the income tax is cut, it is only  natural that the maximum available sources of revenue to cover  the shortfall caused by the cut should be found -- through  administrative reforms and by correcting the unfair tax system.  But if that happens, the effect of cutting the tax is bound to  decrease also. But, if that is not done, the financial  conditions will worsen further. Moreover, it will become  impossible to carry out the tax system reform pertaining to the  upcoming aging society.    Seen from that viewpoint, we believe that the concept of  "effecting in one package" [the income tax cut and the  consumption tax increase] needs to be maintained. We will not  discuss the legal technicalities, but we do insist that the  government come up with a way of incorporating in the bill a  clause to the effect that "once the economy recovers, the  consumption tax will be raised."    What is important is that the basic position on implementing  both the tax system overhaul and the income tax reduction [ahead  of the consumption tax increase] not be altered.    The scale of the income tax cut should never be reduced just  because the time to implement the income tax cut has not yet  been set. Since the announcement of the overall economic  stimulus measures at the end of August, a total of 30 trillion  yen's worth of projects have been launched, but they have made  almost no contribution to economic stimulation. The reason for  this is that there has not been enough so-called "fresh water"  that could lead to the direct creation of demand. Besides, the  measures came out piecemeal.    The tax cut must be full-fledged in its scale -- in its role  as an economic stimulus measure and as part of the tax system  overhaul plan. As we have persistently pointed out so far, it  is essential to secure a tax cut of at least 6 trillion yen by  easing the progressive curve in tax burdens on the middle income  bracket. The burdens of the income tax and residents tax on  middle and higher income earners are now nearly back to where  they were prior to the previous tax reform. What the tax  authorities call "energy for reform" has accumulated adequately.  <H5>  Don't Fall Into the Pace of the Bureaucrats </H5>   What concerns us is that while the politicians have stopped  moving, the bureaucrats appear to have increased in power. As  long as the Finance Ministry holds power, it is apt to persist  in its position of demanding balanced finances. But the given  conditions dictate that the financial functions play a valuable  role in "shoring up the economy."    We urge the government and the ruling coalition parties to  begin discussions and to agree on the advance implementation of  the income tax cut. The economy itself is not pausing. The  longer the decision to deal with it is delayed, the harder it  becomes for a policy decision to be effective.    We also have demands of the Tax Commission. The commission  is delaying discussions on the question of an income tax and the  consumption tax -- which will be the central theme of the tax  system reform next year -- using the excuse that the Hosokawa  government has not presented a basic policy on it. But is that  a good enough excuse?    The commission should fill in the policy portion, which the  coalition parties are not familiar with, by holding discussions  on its own and by presenting many ideas. That will certainly  not lead to a narrowing of the scope of political alternatives,  as is claimed by some people in the ruling parties.    The tax system has a direct impact on the lives of the  people. The people are concerned about what will happen to tax  rates and into which bracket they will fall under the system,  and they want to find out if changes envisaged in the new tax  system are reasonable. As such, they want to have information  with which to make their decisions -- as much as possible and as  soon as possible.    But we wonder whether the Tax Commission has not fallen into  the pace of the bureaucrats. We hope that the incident of  Commission Chairman Kato recently retracting his earlier  remarks, for instance, does not prove that that was what  happened. We want the commission to do its work independently  on its own.</p>

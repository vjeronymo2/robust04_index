			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Very strange Morgan Stanley-Warburg talks could have got so far Sir, Apropos your article, 'Warburg merger plan called off' (December 16), note 7 to rule 9 of the Takeover Code contains something called the 'chain principle' which deals with what happens when one party obtains control of a company and thereby control of a second company because the acquired company itself holds a controlling block of shares in the second company. This note states that the Takeover Panel will not normally require an offer to be made for the second company under this rule unless either: the shareholding in the second company constitutes a substantial part of the assets of the first company; or one of the main purposes of acquiring control of the first company was to secure control of the second company. In the case of the Morgan Stanley-Warburg merger, and the controlling stake held by Warburg in MAM, it would appear that both these conditions are fulfilled. No-one could argue that MAM does not represent a substantial part of the assets of Warburg, and you reported on your front page Mr Stephen Waters, co-managing director of Morgan Stanley Europe, as saying: 'MAM was the reason for us to do the deal.' It therefore seems fairly clear that the rules of the Takeover Code mean that a mandatory offer for the minority shareholding in MAM was always going to the required. Against this background it seems very strange that negotiations between Morgan Stanley and Warburg could have got as far as they did when the (premature) announcement was made of bid talks without independent advisers to MAM having already been brought in to the deal with this potential show-stopper at a far earlier stage.

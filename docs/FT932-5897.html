			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Personal View: Why the chancellor must act tough During the last election, Mr John Major said Britain had never been in a better position to borrow. Even if it was true then, it is no longer the case. Although the budget Red Book, projects a run of large but declining PSBRs, these all represent additions to the existing stock of debt. With nominal interest rates some two points higher than the growth of nominal GDP, debt service costs will rise, as a proportion of GDP, with debt interest costs tending to rise exponentially. This means the costs of stabilising the debt to GDP ratio rise with each passing year. Last year debt interest cost Pounds 17.5bn and is projected to rise to Pounds 29bn in 1997-98. Stabilisation of the debt ratio requires a primary surplus - that is before debt interest - sufficient to pay the real interest on the debt. On current plans, this would require a fiscal adjustment in four years' time roughly equivalent to raising the basic rate of income tax from 25 per cent to 30 per cent. Rising debt service costs have an impact on public spending and the control of inflation. The growth of debt servicing costs puts pressure on other spending programmes, which have been growing very rapidly. Over the last three years, public spending rose by 13 per cent in real terms whilst the economy contracted. It is sometimes forgotten that public spending is a cost on the wealth creating part of the economy, funded by taxes and borrowing, which is deferred taxation. Sooner or later increased taxes are passed through in the form of higher costs, reducing competitiveness. A case is made that capital spending, particularly on infrastructure, is different as it yields a return. But in the best cases, the returns are low, albeit long term. Cutting public spending is difficult, particularly if so much is ring fenced by the manifesto, a document which is becoming the most expensive suicide note in political history. As the case of Belgium or Italy shows, it is easy to run up debt, but difficult to reduce it and requires high tax rates to service it. The risk is that the fiscal options will have been closed off for a decade, during which time the main task of fiscal policy will be an unremitting effort to turn the deficit into a primary surplus. An increasing national debt also makes the operation of monetary policy and the control of inflation more difficult. Unlike in the 1970s, inflation will not erode the real value of debt significantly without the re-imposition of exchange controls. If inflationary worries resurface, bondholders would switch their holdings to investments where they can maintain positive real returns. As a result, nominal gilt yields will rise. It is thus vital for the government that inflationary expectations remain low. So far the rise in debt service costs has been partially offset by falling yields. But this could be quickly reversed. With a current account deficit as well as the large fiscal deficit, there is a risk that investors will become nervous about the UK economy returning to a sustainable balance within a realistic period. Such fears could lead to a run on sterling, placing the government in an awkward position - to raise interest rates to offset the loosening in monetary policy, so putting the recovery at risk, or instead letting sterling fall, boosting nominal competitiveness but risking any inflationary consequences. Political weakness at such a time would increase the likelihood of a wrong choice. The UK's political culture makes it extraordinarily difficult to have a sensible debate on these central issues. Two weeks ago, Michael Portillo made a speech reviewing the issues and stating his preference for action on public spending. What unfolded was a typical Whitehall story; a leak about prescription charges, probably from the Department of Health, made the speech headline news and the media were off to hunt-the-manifesto-pledge. Too often economic issues are written about in a narrow tactical context such as the relative power of one minister against another. This is very different from Germany, facing its own fiscal crisis caused by unification. There the debate is being conducted in terms of growth versus distribution - spending cuts versus tax increases. In the UK we have not got to first base. In this respect, one of the world's oldest democracies has some growing up to do. Mr Clarke's appointment as Chancellor might help to change this. If he confronts the fiscal deficit and explains the options, his authority would be enhanced, as happened to Paul Keating, who, as Australian finance minister in 1987 took tough measures to cut the deficit. If, and only if, Mr Clarke can cut public spending as ruthlessly will he be well placed to earn the leadership of his party.

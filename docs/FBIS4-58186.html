			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus last night and  presented the Zionist regime's so-called peace plan to him.    In this plan, Tel Aviv has proposed to Damascus that the  Golan Heights be returned to Syria over a period of 10 years and  in this interim period, U.S. or peacekeeping forces be stationed  in this region.    According to political analysts, this proposal indicates  that  the Zionist regime is trying to postpone its withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories to as far in the future as possible,  by presenting miscellaneous proposals. Earlier as well, the  Zionist regime had suggested to Syria that it carry out a  military withdrawal on the condition that Syria would lease the  region to Israel for 10 years.    Such proposals by the Zionist regime to Syria highlight the  following realities: First, this regime, and its main  supporter, the United States, do not consider it necessary to  act within the framework of the Madrid talks. In other words,  the so-called Middle East peace talks that began in Madrid on  the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 clearly  stipulate that the Zionist regime should return the territories  usurped by it in 1967 to the Arabs. However, in the latest  proposals by the Zionist regime which have been conveyed by the  United States to the Syrian leaders, withdrawal from the Syrian  Golan Heights has been enmeshed in various conditions, some of  which even violate Syrian sovereignty.    The second issue that can be deduced from the Zionist  regime's proposals to Syria is: With its various ploys, the  Zionist regime is seeking to defer withdrawal from the Golan  Heights and other occupied territories to a time as far in the  future as possible. This attitude indicates that the Zionist  regime is not very optimistic about its future in the region.  Tel Aviv is well aware that as a result of the proliferation of  the wave of Islamism, public opinion in the region has not even  accepted the despotic Zionist regime's existence, much less  amicable coexistence with it.    The actions by the United States and the Zionist regime to  cast aside the Madrid framework and Tel Aviv's tendency to  present such invalid plans for withdrawal from the Golan Heights  and autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza Strip exposes the  reality that the Zionist regime and its international supporters  are striving to attain peace with the Arabs without returning  the occupied territories to them, but at the same time, to forge  friendly relations and cooperation in the political, economic,  and security fields.    This reality illustrates the outcome of the so-called peace  talks, that is, the Zionist regime will get what it set out to  get from these peace talks, while the Arab countries will be  forced to make peace with the enemy without regaining their  usurped territories.</p>

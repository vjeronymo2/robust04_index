			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Recent reports in the French press on  the presidential elections has dealt with the rivalry between  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Rally for the Republic (RPR)  leader Jacques Chirac, the divisions within the Right, and the  possible reduction of the presidential term from seven to five  years.  <H5>  Balladur Versus Chirac </H5>   According to Philippe Reinhard writing in the 15 April Paris  daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, the tension between Balladur and  Chirac, "friends for 30 years," was "inevitable." Since both  aspire to the presidency, "competition could only turn to  declared hostility," Reinhard contends, and the rapid  deterioration of their relations is "easily explained." Chirac  supporters are all the more "pugnacious" because the prime  minister's sustained popularity made them fear for their leader  for a long time. However, their rejoicing in Balladur's  decreasing popularity may be premature, Reinhard continues.  Even if public opinion is now negative about Balladur as prime  minister, polls indicate that he is still the voters' favorite  for president, while Chirac has never surpassed the "fateful 20  percent" threshhold. As the presidential elections draw nearer,  the outcome is "more uncertain than ever," Reinhard writes.  Chirac's success will depend on his ability to attract voters  beyond his own party; according to Reinhard, his acceptance of  centrist Dominique Baudis to head the Right's list for the  European Parliament elections suggests he is attempting to do  this. As for Balladur, he must first end the decline in his  popularity and ensure that no more mistakes are made by being  "less attentive" to the "suggestions" of a governing majority  that has involved him in controversial issues such as the law on  secular education. The beginning of an economic recovery may  allow him to solve unemployment--his most pressing problem--by  the end of 1994. However, failure to solve this problem will  mean Balladur has labored "for the benefit of others," Reinhard  concludes.  <H5>  Right Termed `Incorrigible' </H5>   Reinhard's editorial in the 15 April of LE QUOTIDIEN DE  PARIS  terms the Right "incorrigible" because of its propensity to  continue quarreling even while aware that division may spell  defeat in the presidential elections. The situation is  complicated by the fact that candidates "have never been so  numerous" in the ranks of the majority, Reinhard writes.  Besides Chirac and Balladur, UDF [French Democratic Union]  leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing will probably not renounce a  last fight for the title. However, the parliamentary domination  of the RPR/UDF keeps the two parties' officials from recognizing  that the Left has succeeded in partially restructuring itself  and that it may profit from the Right's internecine quarrels,  Reinhard writes. The deteriorating Chirac-Balladur relationship  may presage an "annus horribilis" for the majority, he opines.  Unity in the upcoming Euroelections would go a long way toward  allaying fears that the Right might lose the presidential  elections. Additionally, general observance of the traditional  rule postulating a single candidacy as early as the first round  of the presidential elections is essential. However, personal  ambition and the influence exerted by the potential candidates'  entourage will come into play. "As surely as the Trojan war, the  candidates' war will also take place," Reinhard predicts.  <H5>  Presidential Term </H5>   Changing the presidential term from seven to five years  would  be easy today, Reinhard writes in the 18 April LE QUOTIDIEN DE  PARIS. With few exceptions, most political parties and their  leaders advocate it, making adoption of this measure possible.  In fact, Giscard d'Estaing recently proposed that a referendum  be held on this issue in conjunction with the 12 June  Euroelections, a suggestion that Balladur has rejected. While  the prime minister's reasons are not "altogether  convincing"--the "risk of polluting the Euroelections" that  Balladur invoked is seen by Reinhard as "very limited"--his  refusal has a justification. The prime minister can "propose" a  referendum to the president of the Republic, but the final  decision rests with the president, Reinhard writes. President  Mitterrand, now in the fourteenth year of his presidency, would  be reluctant to oppose the idea and thus open an institutional  debate, for some might suggest he apply the five-year limit to  his current term as well. Again, if Balladur failed to obtain  Mitterrand's agreement on the referendum, other members of the  majority, first and foremost Giscard, would denounce Balladur's  powerlessness in a cohabitation government, Reinhard contends.  However, a genuine debate should take place, he continues, as a  seven-year term would be too long for today's potential  candidates, all of whom are over 60.</p>

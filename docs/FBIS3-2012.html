The move comes after Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu said British  companies would have no chance of winning the remaining two  contracts of the rail project because of the Sino-British  dispute on Hong Kong's political reform.    Meanwhile, the top representative of the European Union (EU)  in Hong Kong confirmed the EU had been given assurances from  China that there would be no discrimination against firms from  any of the union's member states because of political reasons.    Etienne Reuter, head of the office of the European  Commission  in Hong Kong, said the EU did not see any "material  consequences" from the "verbal threats" from China that it would  discriminate against British traders. He said the EU had not  received complaints from any British traders. He added that  China's boycott against any members of the union because of  political reasons would not be compatible with trade and  co-operation agreements between the EU and the mainland.    But Mr. Reuter said if there were evidence that China  discriminated against any traders from its member countries, the  union would consult China and try to come up with a solution  before taking any measures against Beijing.</p>

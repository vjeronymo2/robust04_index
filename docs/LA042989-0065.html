			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 BOYS, 8 AND 9, HELD IN MAJOR BLAZE AT SCHOOL  </P> <P> Two boys -- one 9 years old, the other 8 -- were arrested Friday on suspicion  of starting a big fire at their Boyle Heights school.  </P> <P> Authorities said the boys, who neighbors describe as "troublemakers," had  confessed to setting an arson fire early Thursday morning that gutted three  classrooms at Malabar Street School and, to the great dismay of their  schoolmates, destroyed a set of sparkling, new Cinco de Mayo costumes.  </P> <P> Damage was estimated at $275,000, and the fire forced school officials to cram  six classes into the auditorium and other temporary quarters on campus, and to  lay plans to transfer students temporarily to other schools.  </P> <P> "It's hard to believe that 40 pounds of muchacho could cause $275,000 of  damage, but there it is," said Police Detective Ben Lovato.  </P> <P> The suspects' names were not released because of their age. The pair, arrested  on suspicion of arson, were taken late Friday to the Eastlake Juvenile Center.  Decisions on how to proceed legally against the youngsters were pending.  </P> <P> Lovato said the boys showed little emotion when questioned Friday by  investigators.  </P> <P> "Let me put it this way," Lovato said, "they weren't crying about it."  </P> <P> As they were led away by detectives Friday afternoon from the Hollenbeck Police  Station, the boys, dressed in T-shirts, jeans and sneakers, looked straight  ahead and said nothing when asked by a reporter about the fire. Looking more  than a little perplexed, detectives kept a guiding hand on the boys' shoulders  as they steered their four-foot-tall captives to a waiting patrol car. The boys  were not handcuffed.  </P> <P> Attention focused early on the two youngsters. After the predawn fire was  extinguished Thursday morning, the parents of the 9-year-old came to the  Hollenbeck station and filed a missing persons report on their son. Lovato, on  his way to the arson site, remembered this and returned to the station house to  retrieve the report.  </P> <P> The 9-year-old and his companion, it developed, had run away from home  Wednesday afternoon and were not in school on Thursday. Malabar administrators  told investigators that the parents of one of the boys had been scheduled to  come to school the morning of the fire to discuss the youngster's behavioral  problems, Lovato said.  </P> <P> "On Thursday (morning)," a neighbor recalled, "the mother was out front  watering her lawn and crying that her son had not come home."  </P> <P> On Thursday afternoon, the boys were spotted by police a short distance from  the school, playing video games in a neighborhood supermarket. The youngsters  scrambled out of the store and were pursued through the neighborhood by at  least four patrol cars, assisted by a helicopter. They escaped.  </P> <P> The two returned home Thursday night and the parents called officers, police  said. The 9-year-old, a fourth-grader at Malabar, was taken into custody at his  home Friday morning.  </P> <P> His alleged accomplice, a third-grader at Malabar, returned to class Friday and  was promptly summoned to the principal's office and arrested.  </P> <P> The two boys had attracted police attention before, Lovato said. Two months  ago, they ran away from home and were reported to police after spending the  night on the roof of a Malabar School building, the detective said.  </P> <P> "They've also been into other trouble -- playing with matches, other acts of  vandalism," he explained.  </P> <P> Neighborhood youngsters described the boys as "troublemakers" who often would  make obscene finger gestures "to the teacher and say bad words."  </P> <P> "They're always in trouble with the teachers," said 12-year-old Alicia  Talamontes. Other youngsters said they had seen the boys playing with matches  in the past.  </P> <P> "My mother says I shouldn't play with them," one fourth-grader said.  </P> <P> Gang-like graffiti was found in the blackened ruins of the school building  Thursday morning, but Lovato said that the duo were not believed to belong to a  gang.  </P> <P> "They're 'wannabes,' or whatever, but there's no gang involvement," he said.  </P> <P> The parents of neither boy could be reached for comment Friday.  </P> <P> While fire officials said it is not unusual for children the boys' age to cause  fire damage, they could not recall arsonists so young setting such a  devastating fire.  </P> <P> Battalion Chief G.R. Bowie, head of the city Fire Department's arson section,  said some children play with fire as early as 3 years old, and 4-, 5- and  6-year-olds often are fascinated with it.  </P> <P> "But they're just experimenting," Bowie said. "If you can intervene early on,  you can stop the pattern, unless there is an underlying emotional problem."  </P> <P> Bowie said 8- and 9-year-olds are on the "upper edge" of youngsters who can be  weaned off tendencies to play with fire. But in the subteen years, he said,  "they know what they are doing. It's, 'Let's go light a fire.' "  </P> <P> At the Malabar School on Friday, administrators and pupils tried to carry on  despite the extraordinary distractions. Practices for the Cinco de Mayo  celebration continued in a playground to the bounce of blaring musica Mexicana.  It was the loss of the new costumes for the festival that most students had  lamented after the fire, and children gasped when told about the arrests.  </P> <P> School administrators were troubled by the development. "Sometimes, parents  need to take more time with their kids," one administrator said. "Mischief  could be a child's way to seeking help, of wanting attention."  </P></p>

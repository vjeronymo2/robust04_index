			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise at Arnott's to ADollars 81m Arnott's, the Australian food group now majority-owned by Campbell Soup of the US, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in profits after tax and abnormals in the year to July 1. The company made ADollars 81.1m (USDollars 60.3m), compared with ADollars 47.2m previously. However, the advance was partly due to the absence of abnormal charges, which took ADollars 32.9m off the result last time. Operating profit before abnormals and tax rose by a more modest 5.5 per cent to ADollars 116.5m, while sales dipped from ADollars 636.2m to ADollars 622.5m - largely due to the sale of some non-core businesses, including White Rose Flour Mills and Illawarra Jam. Arnott's said revenues from its core Australian biscuit division were marginally ahead of the previous year, but trading profits for the division were affected by a Prices Surveillance Authority review. During the period of the inquiry, companies are precluded from seeking price rises. Sales in New Zealand were slightly down, and trading profits lower. However, in Papua New Guinea, sales and trading profits - after adjusting for asset sales - rose 'significantly'. Arnott's said its push into Asia was 'proceeding well'. It plans to start distributing products in Korea in the final quarter of 1994, and is targeting Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and India 'in the longer term'. There is a final dividend of 17 cents a share, taking the full-year payout to 32 cents, compared with 29 cents previously.</p>

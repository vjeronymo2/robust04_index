			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, 19 April (MTI) -- Opposition Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP) Chairman Gyula Horn saw Slovak Prime  Minister Jozef Moravcik for over an hour in Bratislava today.  The meeting during Horn's stay in Dunajska Streda was requested  by the Slovaks.    Horn told MTI, "I explained what the Hungarian Socialists  mean by historic reconciliation, how old grievances are to be  set aside and history should be for historians rather than  politicians. I told the prime minister that we want to take  confidence-building steps in this direction."    "A basic treaty is vital for relations. If the MSZP enters  government after the May elections, Hungary would still sign the  treaty. Moravcik spoke of some fear among Slovaks. They hope  the basic treaty will fix the inviolabity of borders," Horn said.    The MSZP chairman said the basic treaty could eliminate  fear.  "Of course, all this is closely connected with what the basic  treaty should declare on national minorities. I told the prime  minister that the Hungarian nation's sense of solidarity with  ethnic Hungarians beyond the border is natural. Hungary's  efforts for a European agreement protecting national minorities  to be signed is also understandable," Horn said.    "It is part of the basic treaty that Hungary would promote  the economic prosperity of ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia, and  welcome their cultural and administrative autonomy. Of course,  reality should always be kept in view," Horn said.</p>

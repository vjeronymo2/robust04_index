			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by </F> unidentified correspondents in Geneva on 10 February --  recorded; Karadzic and correspondents speak in English with  superimposed Serbo-Croat translation]    [Correspondent] Mr. Karadzic, do you plan to withdraw the  Serbian troops as is stipulated in the agreement on the  cease-fire brokered yesterday?    [Karadzic] The cease-fire was agreed upon a week ago and is  not connected to NATO threats or the ultimatum. I believe that  NATO is knocking at an open door and is flexing its muscles  absolutely needlessly. Our commanders have drawn up some kind  of agreement on a permanent cease-fire around Sarajevo. I have  spoken to Mr. Akashi about this issue, and I prepared all this.  This has nothing to do with NATO.    [Correspondent] You will maintain the cease-fire?    [Karadzic] Yes. It has been brokered by the representatives  of the [warring] sides and Mr. Akashi. NATO has nothing to do  with us.    [Correspondent] Neither the Croats, the Muslims, nor the  cochairmen want a joint commission to investigate the [5  February] Sarajevo event. Will you go on demanding it?    [Karadzic] We have encouraging information that a commission  will be formed and that a Serbian expert will be part of it.</p>

Those concerns have arisen at a time when, after a  threat by NATO to carry out aerial attacks against Serbian  positions, the Serb paramilitaries said that they would defend  themselves against any aerial attack and they might take action  against the 12,000 UN soldiers in Bosnia.    Parallel with those threats, the U.S. and British  Governments  recommended that their representatives in the Serb-Montenegro  alliance should leave because of the growing unrest that has  been created as a result of the NATO threat. It seems that the  U.S. and British response -- which has resulted in their  recalling their representatives from Belgrade -- will end the  American pretense of saying that the policy regarding the  Bosnian crisis has been thought out. Also, this issue faces  NATO's role in the current crisis with ambiguity.    Nevertheless, political experts believe that military  intervention in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has only a  deterrent meaning and is taken to mean psychological pressure on  the warring sides; especially since there is neither any oil in  the area nor has the area much geopolitical significance for  Western Europe and America. Nevertheless, it is predicted that  if NATO embarks on an aerial attack against the Serbs it will  undoubtedly be taken as a measure to enhance the West's global  image and to legitimize its action.    In fact the West's irresponsible rationalizing and the lack  of serious support for the Muslims against the events in Bosnia  have resulted in the true face of the Western forums and their  evil objectives to become more evident than ever. It is clear  for all that America assesses Bosnia, just like other world  issues, from the angle of its own national interests. In the  case of the Bosnia- Herzegovina conflict, the United States has  adopted three different positions. At the beginning, Washington  was playing the role of a neutral observer, thinking that the  Yugoslav crisis was simply a European problem. With the passage  of time and the spread of war in the Balkans, Washington then  showed an inclination to play a political role in the crisis.    However, now we can see a change in the United States' point  of view. The American Government intends to increase its role  in the Bosnia peace negotiations to force the Muslims of that  country to accept the disintegration of Bosnia and lose control  of Sarajevo. Now, under the guise of NATO, the U.S. Government  is not showing the slightest inclination toward a fair  resolution to the differences, and, if NATO implements its  threats on air strikes, the region will enter a period of  protracted and useless ground conflict.    Therefore, the surest way to stop the time killing policy of  the West in the Bosnian crisis is to give the responsibility of  defending Bosnian civilians to the rightful owners of that  country, namely the Bosnian Government; so that under those  conditions, the Muslims can manage to take effective steps in  defending their obvious and usurped rights and in the final  condemnation of the Serb aggressors.</p>

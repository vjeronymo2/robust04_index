			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Late buying helps Dow recover from jobs news Wall Street A BURST of late buying helped share prices finish marginally higher yesterday after mixed unemployment figures and bad April car sales had earlier cast a cloud over the stock market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 0.25 at 2,938.86. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also moved into positive territory just before the close, finishing up 0.28 at 380.80, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks rose 0.97 to 492.10. New York SE volume was light at 159m shares. Declining stocks outnumbered rising stocks by 760 to 729. The weak tone in the market was set from the start after the Labor Department reported that non-farm employment had fallen by 124,000 in April. This figure was smaller than many analysts had forecast. There was also an unexpected decline in the unemployment rate during April, which fell 0.2 percentage points to 6.6 per cent. Although taken at face value the figures appeared to indicate an improvement in the jobless data, analysts were quick to point out that the 124,000 decline in employment was still sizeable, and that the fall in the unemployment rate was primarily due to a rise in the number of self-employed and government workers. The job statistics weighed on the bond market, with the benchmark 30-year government issue falling 1 5/32 to 96 1/32 , to yield 8.227 per cent, and the two-year note falling  3/16 to 100 11/32 , to yield 6.794 per cent. An announcement from Ford, the nation's second-biggest car manufacturer, that late April sales were down 28.5 per cent on the same period a year ago, added to the market's gloom. The sales figures may have been worse than analysts had expected, but Ford shares managed to hold up against the market trend, rising Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 34 1/4 , with the bad news discounted in the price. Other car makers were also firmer, with General Motors up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 38 1/8 and Chrysler Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 14. All three companies reported big first-quarter losses this week. RJR Nabisco ended steady at Dollars 11 1/8 on turnover of 1.3m shares after the food and tobacco company announced that its subsidiary, RJR Nabisco Holdings, would redeem all of its outstanding subordinated exchange debentures due in the year 2007. One of the most actively traded stocks was McCaw Cellular, which rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 26 3/8 on turnover of 3.9m shares after First Boston, the US investment bank, said that it planned to sell 1.9m McCaw shares on behalf of its client, Jordon Trust. Although First Boston would not confirm that the sale had been executed, the volume in the stock indicated that it had. Duracell, which made a successful debut on the market on Thursday, remained in demand. The battery-maker's stock rose another Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 21 1/4 on turnover of 3.7m shares. The stock had been floated at Dollars 15 a share. Canada TORONTO stocks closed slightly lower in moderate trading, having spent the entire session within a tight range. The TSE 300 Index dipped 9.65, closing at 3,491.29, for a decline of 6 over the week. Decliners beat gaining issues 268 to 260, and trading volume of 20,741,000 shares was down from yesterday's 20,556,000. Trading value of CDollars 242.6m was below yesterday's CDollars 244m.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR;  </P> <P> CUDDLES CHALKS UP AN EASY VICTORY  </P> <P> The word a few months ago was that Wayne Lukas had a 2-year-old filly in his  well-populated stable he thought was capable of winning the Breeders' Cup  Juvenile Fillies later this year in New York.  </P> <P> Whether or not Cuddles is successful Oct. 27 at Belmont Park remains to be  seen, but the Mr. Prospector filly is off to a good beginning.  </P> <P> Nine days after breaking her maiden by seven lengths at Hollywood Park, Cuddles  became a stakes winner when she won the $81,525 Junior Miss Stakes here  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Ridden confidently by Pat Valenzuela, the even-money favorite tracked  pacesetter Profit System, then took command in the final eighth of a mile to  win by three lengths in 1:09 3/5 for the six furlongs. Dragonetta, a 6-1 shot,  rallied to finish second, beating Profit System a neck.  </P> <P> This was the second victory in three starts for Cuddles, who is owned and was  bred by William T. Young's Overbrook Farm. In her June 16 debut, she broke  poorly, then raced greenly and was sixth, beaten 14 lengths by Garden Gal, who  went on to win the Landaluce and was second Wednesday in the Schuylerville  Stakes at Saratoga.  </P> <P> "This is a very good filly," Valenzuela said. "I had worked her for Wayne  before she ever ran and I told him I really wanted to ride her. But the week he  entered her, I was suspended. I begged Wayne not to run her, but he said she  needed a race. So, he ran her and she didn't run well.  </P> <P> "I went to him and asked him if I could ride her back when she ran the next  time. He let me and she won easy on closing day at Hollywood. I knew the way  she finished the other day, she'd be double tough today. I knew I had (Profit  System) because this filly really kicks in when you ask her."  </P> <P> Lukas left Wednesday for Chicago, where he will saddle Steinlen in Saturday's  Arlington Challenge Cup, so assistant trainer Randy Bradshaw greeted Cuddles in  the winner's circle. Two races earlier, the barn had staged a 21-1 upset when  Nimitz came from far back to win a $50,000 maiden contest.  </P> <P> "The filly ran well," Bradshaw said. "She stumbled a little leaving the gate,  but she was content to rate off the pace, and when (Valenzuela) called on her,  she finished very well.  </P> <P> "She was kind of small and immature at first, but she's steadily developed and  gotten a lot better. It looks like every time she starts, she gets better.  We'll probably keep her here and go through the stakes schedule (the Sorrento  Aug. 15 and the Debutante Sept. 2)."  </P> <P> Profit System, who was Bill Shoemaker's first stakes starter as a trainer,  couldn't quite hold off Dragonetta after showing the way through :21 4/5 and  :44 1/5 fractions.  </P> <P> "Boy, she's quick," said David Flores. "The first time I rode her, she really  came out of there, but today, she really surprised me with her speed. She can  really go. She got tired the last part, but the race will help her. She'll be  better next time."  </P> <P> Nice Assay, a maiden, was fourth, then came Unstrained Silver, Lite Light,  Freedom Cry, Passion For Poker and Sawsan, who turned in her second bad race in  a row after winning her first two starts.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Kim Yong-sam at Seoul Airport before </F> leaving for Moscow on official visits to Russia and Uzbekistan  -- live]    [Text] Dear fellow countrymen: Today I am going to leave  the country to make an official visit to Russia and Uzbekistan.  This visit is an extention of thse I made to the United States,  Japan, and China over the past year. These countries have a  very important influence on the stability and peace of the  Korean peninsula. When I visited these countries, I stressed to  their government leaders and people the need for their  cooperation for peace on the Korean peninsula and won their  support. Now I am going to visit Russia in order to conclude  the quadrilateral diplomacy that I have sought for stability and  peace of the Korean peninsula since I assumed office.    In summit talks with President Yeltsin, I will sincerely  [chinjihage] discuss the issue of peace in East Asia, security  of the ROK, and economic cooperation needed by both countries.  Particularly at this point of time, when the solution to North  Korea's nuclear issue is urgently required, it is very  significant to develop closer relations with Russia. This visit  will be an occasion to confirm that the Cold War era between the  ROK and Russia has clearly ended.    During my visit at the Russian Federal Council and Moscow  University, I will appeal to Russian politicians and young  people, who face difficulties in a transitional period, to  advance toward building a great Russia without giving up their  hopes and dreams.    Russia is vast and very rich in natural resources.  Therefore, it has boundless potential for development. On the  other hand, Uzbekistan is in a stable situation and rich in  natural resources. Therefore, it is a country with many  possibilities for economic cooperation with our country.    In the summit talks with President Karimov, I will deeply  discuss the issue of the advance of our enterprises into this  country.    In Uzbekistan, there are as many as 200,000 Korean residents  who are descendents of people who were forcibly relocated from  the Maritime Province of Siberia to Central Asia. I will meet  these compatriots and console them. I will also discuss the  matter of promoting their rights and interests.    On my way back home, I will also visit the Russian Pacific  Fleet in Vladivostok, where I would like to experience [silgam]  the changes in ROK-Russia relations along with our people.    Dear fellow countrymen, while in Russia, I will promise to  establish constructive and complementary partnership  [konsolchogigo sangho powanjogin tongbanja kwangye] with it  towards the 21st century. With this as a momentum, our country  will establish firm cooperative relations with the major  countries around the Korean peninsula -- the United States,  Japan, China, and Russia -- not only in security, but in  economics.    We should open the Asia-Pacific era of the 21st century with  these four countries. Our nation's destiny was decided by these  four countries 100 years ago. However, our current effort to  strengthen friendly and cooperative relations with them contains  the positive meaning [chokkukchok uimi] that we will explore our  destiny ourselves. Our compatriots are evenly distributed in  these four countries. Our position has greatly changed. As a  result, we can discuss world issues with the four countries, and  they also need our country's cooperation and coordination  [chojong].    What is most important to us now is for people to achieve  internal unity and accord, to develop the national destiny with  that unity, and to increase the country's competitive strength  with all our efforts. We have no time to pause for  energy-consuming conflict. I, as president, will go even to the  ends of the earth to do my best where our country's security and  interests are concerned.    Dear fellow countrymen, your encouragement will give me  courage and strength during my trip. I wish you good health and  fortune while I am away briefly.    Thank you very much.</p>

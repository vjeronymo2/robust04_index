			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: Few companies are interested in the merits of older people Sir, I read Marc Thompson's letter on the merits of employing staff over 45 (March 17) and would like to add some comments. All the positive aspects of hiring 'older' staff disappear when the American attitudes of budget constraints have to be taken into consideration. Somebody with a doctorate, a few years' experience and who is still under 30 and willing to start for a salary which is within the budget targets is what all the personnel managers are after. Hardly any companies are interested in the merits of older people. And then there is the psychological handicap. In professions and cultures where confidence and achievements come with maturity, this may be easier to face, but in the society that reflects American aspirations - youth appears to be everything. What happens to them when the waist thickens even slightly, or the pace slows down. . . I see companies where grey hair in the management meetings is becoming a rarity. You need to look smart, young and slim. Lacking any of these characteristics may not be a great asset for your career. Sharif Lone, Castellring 56, 6369 Nidderau 1, Germany</p>

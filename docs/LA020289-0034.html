			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: MAKING PERFECT PIE CRUST EASY TASK SURE TO GARNER SMILES OF  APPROVAL  </P> <P> Intimidated at the mere thought of making pie crust from scratch? You have lots  of company. It seems to rank high on the cooking techniques phobia list.  </P> <P> Actually making pie crust is not that difficult. With a little practice, anyone  can learn to make a picture-perfect pie with tender, flaky crust.  </P> <P> Begin by using either bleached or unbleached all-purpose flour. Unless the  recipe directs you to sift the flour, measure by lightly spooning it into a dry  measuring cup, then level off with a metal spatula. Measure carefully, being  certain not to shake the cup or pack the flour down.  </P> <P> Salt may be added for flavor but is not necessary to the success of the recipe.  Blend well with the flour before adding the fat.  </P> <P> Shortening, lard, butter, margarine or oil -- any of these fats will give pie  crust flavor and flakiness, in addition to promoting browning. Shortening is  the most commonly used fat, and it creates a flaky texture but doesn't impart  much flavor. For extra-flaky pastry, chill the shortening 15 to 20 minutes  before using. Lard adds flavor, creates a flakier texture than most other fats  and may be used alone or in combination with shortening.  </P> <P> Unsalted butter is recommended over salted butter for baking. It gives both  color and flavor to a pie crust. Margarine produces a crust similar to that of  butter but without the butter taste. Both butter and margarine should be placed  in the freezer 15 to 20 minutes before using and should be combined with  shortening. Oil produces a tender pie crust but with a mealy texture.  </P> <P> A pastry blender with six to eight arched wires or blades attached to a handle  (Photo 1) is recommended for cutting fat into the flour. If you don't have a  pastry blender, two table knives may be substituted, cross-cutting through the  flour. It's also possible to rub the fat and flour together with your  fingertips, although the heat from hands can melt the shortening and may  toughen the pastry.  </P> <P> As the fat particles are broken up, they become coated with the flour. Later,  as the pie crust bakes, these melt. At the same time, moisture in the dough  becomes steam and collects in the spaces left by the melting fat, producing a  flaky pastry.  </P> <P> Because the moisture in flour varies, the amount of water combined with the  flour-shortening mixture requires some judgment. Enough needs to be added to  develop the gluten and hold the flour particles together but too much will  cause the crust to become tough. Either cold or ice water may be used. The  latter produces an extra-flaky pastry.  </P> <P> Future Back to Basics columns will be devoted to rolling out pie crust, fluting  the edges and making double-crust and lattice-topped pies.  </P> <P> BASIC PIE CRUST  </P> <P> (For Single-Crust Pie)  </P> <P> 1 cup flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt, optional  </P> <P> 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon shortening or 1/3 cup lard  </P> <P> 2 to 2 1/2 tablespoons ice water  </P> <P> Combine flour and salt in medium bowl. Place shortening on top, then using  pastry blender, cut shortening into flour (Photo 1) until particles are about  size of small peas or coarse meal. Use relaxed flick of wrist, to keep dough  mixture from becoming compact mass. If necessary, run finger across inside arc  of pastry blender to release shortening.  </P> <P> Sprinkle cold water (Photo 2) 1 tablespoon at time, over flour-shortening  mixture, tossing lightly with fork to distribute liquid evenly. As water is  added, flour-shortening mixture will begin to hold together (Photo 3).  </P> <P> Mix only enough so dough sticks together, overmixing results in tough crust.  When too much liquid is added, pastry becomes sticky, too little and pastry  will be crumbly. When correct amount of water has been added, form pastry in  ball (Photo 4) using hands. Roll out immediately or chill from 30 minutes to 2  days.  </P> <P>  Requests for explanations of cooking techniques may be sent to Back to Basics,  Food Section, The Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

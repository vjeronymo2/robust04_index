			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to  information gathered by this reporter from a national forum on  the development of small towns held by the Ministry of Civil  Affairs today, the development of small towns in our country has  proceeded by leaps and bounds since the program of reform and  opening up was initiated. By the end of 1992, there were 55,000  small towns in rural China, of which 14,500 were organized along  administrative lines, compared with 2,200 in the early eighties.    Comrades attending the forum were of the opinion that the  development of small towns is an inevitable consequence and  objective demand of rural reform, as well as the inevitable  direction in which urbanization with Chinese characteristics  must proceed. The proliferation of small towns has resulted in  the transfer of large numbers of surplus workers in rural China  to secondary and tertiary industries, thereby promoting an  industrial restructuring within the farming sector. The  development of small towns has stimulated the exchange of  commodities in rural areas, promoted market development, and  facilitated the formation of socialized service networks in the  countryside. Moreover, the urbanization mode adopted for the  development of small towns, in which "people leave their  farmland but not their hometowns," has substantially bucked the  tide of migrants from rural areas into large and medium cities  in the course of modernization.    The Ministry of Civil Affairs held the forum with the aim of  further implementing the important strategic ideas of the party  Central Committee and the State Council regarding small towns,  and of making preparations for revising the standards for  administratively organized towns to facilitate the process of  integrating urban and rural areas. In his speech, Minister of  Civil Affairs Doje Cering pointed out: During the current  development of small towns, we must ensure that the geographical  distribution of such towns is rational and achieve better  results by virtue of the proper size of such towns. Also, we  should establish a multilevel and multifunctional social  security system, bearing the distinctive features of small towns  in mind, so as to gradually advance the process of introducing  community-wide social security in small towns.    More than 30 people attended today's forum. They included  specialists from the Geography Institute of the Chinese Academy  of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Chinese  Urban Planning Research Institute, Beijing University, and other  research institutes and educational institutions, as well as  comrades in charge of relevant State Council departments.</p>

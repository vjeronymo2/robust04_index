(See II.B. of this NOFA.) HUD notification to the grantee of the amount and conditions (if any) of EDI funds awarded based upon review of the EDI application shall constitute an obligation of grant funds, subject to compliance with the conditions of award and execution of a grant agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (E) Limitations on Grant Amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD expects to approve EDI grant amounts of up to $100 million each with the ratio of EDI to Section 108 funds of 1:1. Applicants cannot request grants exceeding a one-to-one ratio of EDI funds to Section 108 funds. In the case of requested amendments to an approved Section 108 loan guarantee commitment, the EDI assistance approved will be based on the increased amount of Section 108 loan guarantee assistance. HUD reserves the right to determine a minimum and a maximum amount of any EDI award per application or project and to modify requests accordingly. The applicant will be required to modify its project plans and application to conform to the terms of HUD approval (final obligation) before execution of a grant agreement. HUD reserves the right to reduce or de-obligate the EDI award if approvable Section 108 loan guarantee applications are not submitted by the grantee in the required amounts on a timely basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (F) Eligible Applicants for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> EDI Grant Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Generally, eligible applicants for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EDI grants under section 108(q) of the Act are those public entities eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance pursuant to &sect;570.702. However, this NOFA further limits eligible applicants to those communities that submitted applications on behalf of areas that qualify for designation as an urban Empowerment Zone, and that have remaining Section 108 loan guarantee authority of at least $40 million; or in the case of an urban Empowerment Zone application from joint entities, an aggregate Section 108 loan authority for all of the entities that submitted the Empowerment Zone application of at least $40 million. In the case of a joint Empowerment Zone application for two or more entities, HUD will accept a joint EDI application from the same public entities eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance pursuant to &sect;570.702. However, each of the joint applications will be expected to execute separate EDI grant agreements and separate loan commitments and issuance documents for their related section 108 loan guarantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (G) Eligible Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EDI grant funds may be used for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Activities listed at &sect;570.703, provided such activities are carried out in the qualifying Empowerment Zone area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Payment of costs of private financial guaranty insurance policies, letters of credit, or other credit enhancements for the notes or other obligations guaranteed by HUD pursuant to Section 108, provided such notes or obligations are used to finance an economic development project.

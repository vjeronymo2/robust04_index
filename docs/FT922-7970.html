			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Investors in Sears, Roebuck register strong protest vote SHAREHOLDERS in Sears, Roebuck, the large but ailing US retail and financial services group, yesterday delivered a strong protest vote at the company's annual meeting in Atlanta. Two non-management motions, put forward by 'dissident' shareholders, attracted the support of more than 40 per cent of all votes cast. This is an exceptionally large percentage in the US, where institutional investors have traditionally supported management. Non-supportive votes rarely top the high teens. The vote at the meeting comes amid some signs that the corporate governance climate in the US is shifting. Institutions - in particular, the large public pension funds - have shown increased willingness to flex their muscles, and last month non-executive directors at General Motors ousted Mr Robert Stempel, chairman, from the leadership of a key board committee. Shareholder dissent has been rumbling at Sears for some years, as the share price has stagnated and the company has been struggling to get its large but ailing retail business back on track. Ahead of this year's annual meeting, dissident shareholders had filed five proposals. The most widely-supported motion yesterday suggested that the three-year staggered board terms at Sears should give way to the annual election of all directors; 41.2 per cent of all votes cast yesterday were in favour of this. A second motion, to tighten the confidentiality of shareholder voting, won the support of 40.9 per cent. A proposal calling for the division of the chairman's and chief executive's responsibilities between two separate people, won the backing of 27.4 per cent; a motion asking for an independent study of the break-up values at Sears found 23.3 per cent of votes in favour; and a suggestion that directors should hold at least 2,000 shares attracted 19.3 per cent. The three non-executive board members up for re-election at yesterday's meeting were also returned.</p>

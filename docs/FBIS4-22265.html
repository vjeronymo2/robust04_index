			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Zagorskiy, vice rector of the Moscow </F> State Institute for International Relations: "Tilting From the  CSCE to NATO? European Affairs Call for Closer Attention"]    [Text]  <H5>  After the Cold War </H5>   The October events in Moscow would seem to have cleared the  decks for a more flexible and active Russian policy in Europe.  After all, it was the dissolved Supreme Soviet that did quite a  lot to block a rapprochement between Russia and the West. We  will know the position of the new Russian parliament after the  coming elections. At the moment there is strong evidence that  European developments are gradually restricting Russian  diplomacy's room for manoeuvre.    Not long ago people in Europe, which had entered a period of  sweeping change, were under the impression that a painless end  of the division of the continent was in the offing. Democratic  revolutions had created an atmosphere of expectation of early  European unity. The East and the West stopped looking on each  other as adversaries, both sides extending a hand of friendship,  as the Declaration of 22 signed by WTO and NATO countries in  Paris on November 19, 1990, put it.    But over optimistic expectations gradually gave way to some  realistic thinking. The Yugoslav crisis and the disintegration  of the country accompanied by armed clashes and civil wars, a  phenomenon which Europe had forgotten about, and the breakup of  the Soviet Union, which extended the area of conflict, dampened  the idyllic mood of architects of a new Europe, making them  ponder on how to stop Europe's incipient return to the era of  internecine wars, to Hobbes's "war of all against all". As a  result, Europe remained virtually divided, except that what we  have this time is not military and political alignments but an  economically and socially backward "Eastern periphery" and a  West that is ahead of it on many counts.    In spite of a process of transformation of relations in  Europe, the equation of the new continental architecture still  included many unknowns, making its assumption of a reasonably  marked character difficult. The formation of a pluralist Europe  relying on a whole set of organisations rather that an only  organisation is a product of the concept of mutually reinforcing  institutions. In line with a kind of division of labour, it was  expected to bring in the CSCE, NATO, North Atlantic Cooperation  Council (NACC), EC, Western European Union (WEU), Council of  Europe. But it was not easy for these organisations (except the  NACC, they all came into being in Cold War years) to find a new  identity after the end of that war. There even developed a  certain competition between them.    While the United States gave preference to preserving NATO's  role or searching for a new one, France focussed on extending  the powers of the EC in the area of security policy, stressing  the need to revive the WEU. Paris also saw a priority in  strengthening the CSCE, not NATO, as an instrument of European  security policy, with the North Atlantic alliance playing only  an auxiliary role, it is probably safe to say that the  controversy over which of the European organisations was  particularly important took as much time as the search for  solutions to the thorny problems encountered by Europe of late.  <H5>  The CSCE: A Prospect for the Whole of Europe? </H5>   Today the CSCE is the only European institution which  includes Russia as a full-fledged member. This explains Moscow's  effort to help the CSCE and its institutions play a bigger role  in European politics. Unlike other ex-Soviet republics, Russia  did not have to go though any special procedure of admission to  the Conference, for as a state continuing the Soviet Union, it  had also inherited the latter's seat in that forum.    The mechanisms of the Helsinki process have undergone  visible  changes in recent years. Under the 1990 Charter of Paris for a  New Europe, new bodies have been set up: the CSCE Council  composed of the members' Foreign Ministers, the Committee of  Senior Officials (CSO), the Conflict Prevention Centre (CPC) in  Vienna, the Office for Free Elections in Warsaw (now called the  Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights) and the  Secretariat in Prague. Ever since 1992, annual meetings have  been held by the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly.    The first meeting of the CSCE Council (Berlin, June 1991)  approved a Mechanism for Consultations and Cooperation with  Regard to Emergency Situations, which makes it possible to call  extraordinary meetings of the CSO to this end without waiting  for the go-ahead of all member states. Immediately after that,  the CSO tackled the crisis in ex-Yugoslavia, and ever since 1992  it has also been concerned with the conflicts in the ex-Soviet  Union.    The second meeting of the Council (Prague, January 1992)  admitted the majority of ex-Soviet republics to the CSCE.  Georgia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina became  participating states in March and May 1992; Czechia and Slovakia  have held similar status since their peaceful "divorce" in 1992.  Currently the CSCE comprises 53 countries.    The same Prague meeting resolved to extend the powers of the  new institutions of the Helsinki process. The CSO became in  effect the central body of the Conference Council representing  the latter in between meetings and responsible for coordinating  the work of other institutions. Established within the framework  of the CSO was a CSCE Economic Forum, which first met in April  1993 in Prague. The political functions of the Conflict  Prevention Centre were extended. The rule demanding that  decisions be made consensually was partly revised. At present  decisions can be made according to the formula "consensus minus  one", at least as far as fulfilling obligations within the  framework of the human dimension are concerned.    Further steps to strengthen CSCE institutions were taken at  a  meeting in the Finnish capital that opened on March 24 and  culminated in a summit on July 9-10, 1992. The 1992 document  adopted at Helsinki confirmed the key role of the Council and  extended still further the CSO's power to make decisions. The  Committee was assigned the chief role in giving early warning of  emerging conflicts, managing crises, settling disputes by  peaceful means and carrying out peace-keeping operations.    From 1993 on, the CSO has not only met in Prague every month  but had its working group hold weekly meetings in Vienna that  have become a standing body, for some of the senior officials  empowered to represent their countries are stationed in Vienna.  Also growing in the system of CSCE mechanisms is the role of the  Acting Chairman -- the Foreign Minister of the country where the  Council's latest meeting took place.    The 1992 Helsinki Document instructed the Warsaw Office for  Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to monitor compliance  with commitments within the CSCE human dimension, meet to  discuss this matter, hold specialised seminars and fulfil other  tasks. In December 1992, the newly established post of CSCE High  Commissioner for National Minorities was entrusted to former  Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel.    The powers of the CPC, a consultative committee, were  extended. Specifically, it was authorised to make decisions on  sending fact-finding missions and rapporteurs to the field with  a view to detecting potential conflicts at an early date as well  as to managing crises. Besides, the Centre is to assist the CSO  in peace-keeping operations.    By decision of the CSCE Helsinki meeting (September 1992), a  CSCE Forum for Security Cooperation has begun functioning in  Vienna. It is intended to help work out new accords on arms  control, disarmament and confidence and security building  (within the framework of the Forum's Special Committee) as well  as to search for ways and means of settling conflicts (within  the framework of the Consultative Committee, whose work is  closely linked with the CPC's tasks).    The third meeting of the Council (Stockholm, December 1992)  established the post of CSCE Secretary-General (in April 1993,  without waiting for its Rome meeting set for late 1993, it gave  the post to a German diplomat, Ambassador Wilhelm Hoynck).  His functions include not only seeing to the proper organisation  of the work of the secretariats of diverse CSCE structures but  assisting the Acting Chairman. The Convention on Conciliation  and Arbitration within the CSCE was signed in Stockholm by 29  countries.    The extended powers and functions of new CSCE structures and  institutions undoubtedly reflect an effort to react to the  dramatic events taking place in Europe and help at first sight  strengthen the trend towards making the CSCE a key component of  the new European security mechanism. But prudent opinion's  prevail more and more over the euphoria generated by the early  steps towards institutionalising the Helsinki process.    Initially it looked as if the CSCE could undertake to  gradually form a community of countries sharing the common  values of pluralist democracy, human rights, economic freedom  and social responsibility set out in the Conference's Bonn and  Copenhagen documents (1990) and in the Charter of Paris. Yet the  solution of this problem is being put off indefinitely, not to  say becoming impossible, due above all to the extension of the  CSCE membership in 1992 and the inclusion in it of all the  sovereign states established on ex-Soviet territory,    Who had expected the CSCE to become a collective  peace-keeping instrument in Europe were also in for  disappointment. While the conflicts in ex-Yugoslavia and the CIS  are the object of intensive CSCE debates, hardly anyone today  would venture to associate an eventual settlement of these  conflicts with precisely the CSCE. Nor did the situation change  with the adoption of the 1992 Helsinki Document, which declared  the CSCE a regional agency of the UN and provided for eventual  peace-keeping operations to be funded by NATO, the EC and WEU.  Nor was solution made any easier by the establishment in June  1993 of priorities in decision-making on the use of force by the  international community to maintain peace in Europe, which  implied that these matters must first be settled at the level of  the UN Security Council or the CSCE, after which appropriate  powers can be delegated to NATO or other entities.    The very process of decision-making, which presupposes a  consensus, proved so cumbersome as to make it impossible for the  CSCE to act promptly and effectively. As for the emerging  tendency to revise the principle of consensus and make decisions  by majority vote, it is fraught with a different danger.  Excluding one of the parties to a conflict from the drafting of  decisions complicates the implementation of recommendations.  Ex-Yugoslavia is a case in point. Following the suspension of  Siberian membership in the CSCE (amounting to that country's de  facto expulsion from the Conference) in July 1992, Belgrade  demanded the withdrawal of CSCE observers from Kosovo and the  Macedonian border. Needless to say, this reduced the  Conference's ability to influence developments in the region.    Currently the role of the CSCE in European politics, though  important enough, is more modest than expected. Its decisions  lend all-Europe legitimacy to efforts exerted by individual  groups of nations in conflict zones (as was the case in, say,  July and August 1991, when the first extraordinary meetings of  the CSO confirmed the EC mandate for mediation in Yugoslavia).  The CSCE also performs an important function by establishing  facts on the spot and monitoring developments through observers  sent to conflict zones.    In some cases the Conference makes attempts at mediation  that  generally produce little effect.[.sup]1[/] The blame for  disillusionment with its potentialities must obviously be put  not so much on the organisation itself as on the excessive hopes  and promises that found expression in 1990. Realising this fact,  however, cannot add to the prestige of the CSCE.    This is evident from, for instance, Austria's approach to  the  Helsinki process. In March 1992, Foreign Minister Alois Mock  made a sensational statement about Vienna's desire to seek a  rapprochement with NATO structures.[.sup]2[/] Subsequently  that trend in Austrian policy grew stronger even though it was  offset by putting emphasis on closer relations primarily with  the WEU.[.sup]3[/] It follows that Austria has in fact gone  back on its earlier view of the CSCE as a highly important  instrument of European security.    A debate on a rapprochement with or even entry into NATO is  also going on in Finland. The Swedes are talking about the need  to partly revise their traditional policy of neutrality. Swiss  policy, too, betrays disappointment at the CSCE. It will be seen  that the Conference's obvious failures and the drop in the  rating of the concept of an all-Europe collective security  system, like the emerging trend towards a rapprochement between  ex-WTO members and the EC and NATO, directly face neutrals with  the issue of their future place in new European security  structures.  <H5>  An Extended NATO? </H5>   In 1990, NATO's starting positions in the new Europe did not  at all seem preferable to those of the CSCE. True, both the  London Declaration of its Council (July 1990) and documents of  its Rome meeting (November 1991), which formulated the  alliance's new strategy, underlined the need to preserve the  alliance as an important instrument of European security. But  due to controversies inside the alliance, primarily the attitude  of France, the future of NATO looked most uncertain, all the  more so because this organisation is associated with the sad  legacy of the Cold War more often than others.    Paradoxical as it may seem, the alliance's new legitimacy  received the strongest support from the pro-Atlantic position of  East European countries, which have been saying, especially  since January 1991, that they would like to join the alliance at  some stage as full-fledged members. Yet there are many  circumstances holding up such a transition. One of the  stipulations of the accords on German unification reached by  Mikhail Gorbachev with the West was the latter's readiness not  to extend NATO's sphere of influence towards the East. Besides,  the alliance itself was in no hurry to throw its door wide open  to new members, fearing as it did that this might complicate  decision-making and compel it to tackle problems of East  European countries. What NATO proposed were mostly stopgaps.    In November 1991, after a long period of resistance from  France, the Rome meeting of the NATO Council resolved to set up  the NACC.[.sup]4[/] The latter's constituent meeting on  December 20, 1991 coincided with the disintegration of the  Soviet Union, and it was not long before sovereign states that  had sprung up on ex-Soviet territory became NACC members along  with East European and Baltia states. Compositionally, the only  difference between the NACC and the CSCE today is that the  former includes no neutrals although Finland secured observer  status in June 1992 while Austria and Sweden in 1993 joined in  drafting recommendations for peace-keeping operations.    The NACC and the working bodies formed by it have no  explicit  procedures. This may be regarded as a certain demerit but, on  the other hand, it stresses the flexibility of the new  structure, which makes no political decisions but offers  nonparticipating states opportunities for dialogue with NATO.  Besides assisting "partner states", as NATO now officially  describes Central and East European countries, including the  ex-Soviet Union, in a number of sectors agreed in 1992, the Ad  Hoc Group for Peace-keeping Operations set up by the Council  submitted to the fifth regular meeting of the NACC at the level  of Foreign Ministers (Copenhagen, June 1993) recommendations for  the promotion of interaction between European institutions in  maintaining peace on the continent.    In the nearly two years since it was established, however,  the NACC has evolved no clear vision of its role in ensuring  European security. What is perhaps particularly typical of it is  that it leaves various options open depending on developments in  Europe. Occasionally it may become something of an anteroom of  NATO through which a country wishing to join the alliance must  pass and a transitional structure on the road to the formation  of a collective security system.    Events of 1993 seem to have brought us visibly closer to the  final solution of this dilemma. As late as 1992, nobody in NATO  would hear of admitting any Central European countries (meaning  primarily Poland, Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia) but in early  1993 German Defence Minister Volker Ruhe made a cautious  statement in favour of not ruling out such a possibility.    An unexpected change in the debate on this subject came  about  after President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Warsaw in August 1993.  Previously Russia had taken a reserved or even negative stand on  an extended NATO membership but in Warsaw the President said he  "appreciated" Poland's intention to join NATO. "In the long  term," said the Joint Russo-Polish Declaration of August 25,  "such a decision by sovereign Poland, being directed towards  all-Europe integration, does not run counter to the interests of  other countries, including the interests of Russia."    The Warsaw Declaration was seen as Russia's consent to the  inclusion of the four Central European countries in NATO  although Russian diplomacy took steps to ease that impression by  making a decision on this matter conditional on the evolution of  relations between Russia and NATO. Be that as it may, the  document signed in Warsaw created an important and irreversible  precedent: it cannot be retracted. And while Romanian Foreign  Minister Teodor Melescanu in September 1993 said that Romania  did not find it necessary in shaping its foreign policy line to  ask Boris Yeltsin's or anyone else's permission, it would be  hard to overestimate the Warsaw Declaration. Indeed, its signing  was followed by a lively debate on the outlook for the admission  of Central European countries to NATO, some comments striking a  note entirely different from those sounded earlier.    Many in NATO still doubt the wisdom of extending its  membership, and yet the general tenor of the debate suggests  that the day is not far off when a fundamental decision may be  made on this issue. In mid-October 1993, a spokesman for the US  State Department said that the Administration was seriously  considering the position it should adopt on an extension of  NATO. Volker Ruhe on September 15 was more explicit -- he  declared for admitting the four Central European countries to  NATO. He even allowed for the possibility of their being  admitted to NATO earlier than to the EC.    Discussion was postponed until the NATO summit in January  1994, which is most likely to adopt a political decision paving  the way for talks with Central European countries on their  joining the alliance. This would probably be tantamount to the  decision of the Copenhagen meeting of the European Council,  which opened the door to the EC for several Central and East  European countries.    As in the case of the EC, nothing is said about the possible  time limit of admitting new members, but such a development  would influence the formation of European security mechanisms by  predetermining an option not in favour of building an all-Europe  collective security system in at least the foreseeable future.    Since October last, the debate on extending NATO has centred  on the concept of "partnership for peace", which US Secretary of  State Warren Christopher advanced during his tour of Moscow,  Alma-Ata, Kiev, and Minsk. His initiative met with approval in  Moscow as well as in Paris and other West European capitals. Its  substance has yet to be studied on the threshold of the Brussels  summit of NATO scheduled for January 10 but the main ideas are  clear: all NACC members can in principle join NATO provided that  they meet a number of criteria (including reliable civilian  control over the armed forces and a democratic system).  Meanwhile they are invited to further their ties with NATO on a  bilateral basis, in particular by preparing in common to join in  peace-keeping operations. As for natural disasters, a longer  list of areas of cooperation will have to be specified within  NATO.    "Partnership for peace" nominally puts all NACC members on  an  equal footing but this initiative marks a change in the thinking  of alliance members. The very possibility of extending NATO is  no longer called into question. Approval of this concept at the  Brussels meeting of the NATO Council will probably mean as much  as the Copenhagen decision of the European Council. But NATO  feels in no hurry to say a final yes to the question about which  of today's seekers of membership are most eligible. Washington  and Brussels alike are careful not to antagonise Russia so long  as there remain prospects for democratic and market reforms  here. Nevertheless, agreeing the parameters of "special"  relations between Russia and NATO is bound to remove these fears  and will go a long way towards opening the alliance's door to  new members.  <H5>  A New Yalta? </H5>   There is no telling how far the likely echo of Boris  Yeltsin's Warsaw statement was forecast and taken into account  by today's makers of Russian policy, who are now engrossed  primarily in internal affairs. It is beyond doubt, however, that  such important decisions will necessitate modifications in  Moscow's policy in both the short term and the more distant  future.    The main effect of the events of last fall is unquestionably  the near-inevitable extension of NATO by admitting primarily the  four Central European countries, which may be followed later on  by Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltia countries. Still, the  problem is not that this may happen. Such a development could  have been foreseen even earlier. The events in question have  merely brought it nearer. The problem is the conclusion which  Russian diplomacy must draw.    We have gotten away from the notion that NATO is an  aggressive bloc. It is now clear that the alliance poses no  threat to us. The important thing is that a fundamental  political decision to extend NATO virtually would put an end to  the debate on a European security system even if it were to set  no timeframe for this.    The expanding West European collective defence system is  becoming the mainstay of European security and will guarantee  primarily the stability of its member countries more effectively  than any other system. This means that interest in playing an  active role in stabilisation outside this system now that a  series of attempts in ex-Yugoslavia has failed will decline to  the extent that developments outside the new zone of NATO  responsibility are safe for the organisation's members. If this  is true, Russian diplomacy must draw important conclusions.    First among them is the conclusion that the present emphasis  on building up the CSCE needs to be revised for all that it is  important for Russia to preserve organisational possibilities of  developing all-Europe structures. The Helsinki process will  hardly become the pivot of European policy in the foreseeable  future. It is therefore necessary, as well as strengthening the  CSCE, to adjust policy to closer interaction with West European  and transatlantic structures, primarily the EC and NATO.    The question of promoting partnership with the EC is being  discussed as preparations go on for a comprehensive treaty with  the Community, including a provision for the creation of a  mechanism for political dialogue between Russia and the EC,  which has turned out to be probably the easiest thing in the  course of the talks. The problem of NATO is a harder nut to  crack. In view of the prospect of an extension of the alliance,  there is reason to forecast (this is another point on which a  decision must be made) the possibility of a gradual diminution  of the role of the NACC, which largely owes its rise to a desire  to draw Central European countries into the drafting of NATO  decisions. It follows that Russian membership of the Council,  which will retain its importance as a channel for dialogue with  ex-Soviet republics, will hardly be enough as a means of  bringing about proper interaction with NATO.    This leads Russian experts to various conclusions. Sergei  Karaganov, for one, proposes making Russia's parallel joining of  NATO one condition for the extension of the  alliance.[.sup]5[/] I believe, however, that this is unlikely  and that, besides, such a solution is unnecessary. It is  obviously more important to agree with NATO (even before it  admits Central European countries to membership) mechanisms for  a direct political and military-political dialogue and  interaction between Russia and NATO (without the NACC as  mediator), such as would enable Russia to defend its European  interests before the alliance makes decisions likely to affect  these interests. If this were done, the seemingly negative  consequences of extending NATO could be compensated for in the  course of direct and close cooperation between Russia and NATO.    The more remote effects of political decisions to be made by  Russia today seem far more complicated. After all, to extend  NATO and the EC would mean seeking to finalise the West's  priority interests in Europe, which is what they would  concentrate on above all else. Because the geographic zone in  question does not include the greater part of the ex-Soviet  Union (except the Baltia states), such a decision would  strengthen the tendency to recognise that Russia bears special  responsibility for the maintenance of stability and peace in the  CIS.    It is by no means accidental that visible concern about the  prospect of an extended NATO is felt in the former European  republics of the ex-Soviet Union, especially Ukraine, where an  effort is being made to break out of the vast Eurasian area and  "get rid", as some Ukrainians word it, of dependence on Russia  by gradually integrating into European structures.    If this trend in Russian and European politics were to gain  the upper hand, the result might prove paradoxical. Moving on  from the postwar Yalta order, we would arrive at a new division  of spheres of influence, not at a united Europe, and besides,  Russia's sphere of influence would shrink greatly compared with  that of the ex-Soviet Union. Couldn't this become a pretext for  fresh redivisions of Europe after things in our country began  looking up and Russia became once again a decisive factor in  European politics, as we hope will be the case?

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11.4.2(2)&blank;Restrooms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (2) requires toilet facilities to comply with ADAAG 4.22 (Toilet Rooms) and bathing facilities to comply with ADAAG 4.23 (Bathrooms, Bathing Facilities, and Shower Rooms). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM sought comment on grab bar design, security concerns, and the potential for suicides in holding cells and detention and correctional facilities. A majority of the commenters indicated that grab bars in accessible cells do not pose any more of a suicide or security risk than other cell features such as cell grills, bed frames and air circulation vents. The Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice stated that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Effective suicide prevention is not accomplished solely by rendering a cell protrusion-free. A jail's physical plant cannot be designed, constructed or altered to ensure it is ``suicide-proof''. Effective suicide prevention is a function of screening at admission, appropriate classification, adequate staff training and vigilant staff supervision as well as physical plant design. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None of the commenters cited a specific case in which an inmate used a grab bar to commit suicide. However, at least one commenter stated that this could be a result of the under-reporting of jail suicides throughout the country and the fact that grab bars are not yet predominantly provided. Several commenters were less concerned about persons with disabilities misusing the grab bars than other detainees or inmates who, due to overcrowding, could be occupying the accessible cells. Most commenters felt grab bars can be designed and installed in new construction without posing a security risk. Commenters provided several examples such as designing an infill welded plate to close the gap between the grab bar and wall and using ``embeds with welded connections or embeds with security screws.'' The latter method would allow the removal of the grab bars when a person with a disability was not using the cell. One commenter further suggested that where an infill welded plate is used, the outside diameter should be enlarged to two inches to compensate for the inability to totally wrap one's fingers around the bar's surface. Several commenters added that clustering the accessible cells would enhance the ability to effectively monitor detainees and inmates and further minimize security risks. Other suggestions included limiting the accessible cells only to detainees or inmates with disabilities; locating the accessible cell in the infirmary or other health care unit; or requiring grab bars only in institutions with sentenced inmates where behavior is more predictable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the responses to this provision, grab bars can be properly designed and installed in new construction without posing a security risk. No changes were made to this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters suggested that an exemption be provided for alterations. One commenter stated that the use of steel embeds is structurally impracticable insofar as the installation of embeds would require reconstruction of the entire wall into which the embed was installed. The commenter further stated that a grab bar could be welded to a steel plate bolted through an existing wall to another steel plate on the back of the wall. However, several factors would determine the feasibility of this solution including whether the back of the wall is available to hold a steel plate as well as the type of existing wall upon which the steel plate is installed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If compliance with alterations requirements is technically infeasible, ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(j) requires that the alteration provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. Technically infeasible means, with respect to an alteration of a building or a facility, that it has little likelihood of being accomplished because existing structural conditions would require removing or altering a load-bearing member which is an essential part of the structural frame; or because other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features which are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements for new construction and which are necessary to provide accessibility. Any elements or features of the building or facility that are being altered and can be made accessible are required to be made accessible within the scope of the alteration. There may be circumstances in an alteration to holding cells where grab bars cannot be securely attached to meet security requirements due to structural conditions in an existing wall. In such cases, the installation of grab bars would not be required because it would be technically infeasible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several combination stainless steel water closet and lavatory units are available that cannot incorporate a 36 inch grab bar behind the water closet. The NPRM asked whether standard combination units are available which meet the requirements of the proposed guidelines and whether combination units are required to the exclusion of separate fixtures by any State, local or other codes. Manufacturers acknowledged that the standard design of combination units, including those otherwise considered accessible by the industry, do not fully meet ADAAG specifications. One commenter stated that combination units are preferred because only one wall opening is required for plumbing connections, rather than two wall openings if separate fixtures are provided. Another commenter added that a typical cell design provides a single plumbing chase which will serve two cells. These chases are built on an angle in order to maximize the space available and can easily accommodate a combination unit. One manufacturer stated that although the combination unit does not fully comply with the proposed guidelines, the design of combination units provides maximum strength and security within the practical limits of manufacturing. The commenter was concerned that lengthening the combination unit to accommodate a 36 inch long grab bar would make the unit less able to withstand the stresses it may be subjected to through vandalism. The commenter further noted that a shorter grab bar can be provided. Several correctional agencies commented that combination units are used primarily because they require less space than separate fixtures. The only source identified as actually requiring combination units was Virginia's ``Guide of Minimum Standards in Design and Construction of Jail Facilities'' which requires such units in maximum security cells. A few commenters took the position that if combination units are not accessible, then separate fixtures should be required. A number of commenters recommended that an exception be provided for a reduced grab bar length in alterations to mitigate the structural and plumbing chase modifications required in making the cell accessible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments indicated that although the use of combination units are preferred for space efficiency and security and required by at least one State's guidelines for jail facilities, they are not mandatory. An exception for the length of the rear grab bar on combination units has not been provided in new construction or alterations since separate, accessible lavatories and toilets are readily available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an alteration to toilet and lavatory fixtures, ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(b) requires that accessible fixtures be provided in compliance with the applicable provisions for new construction. However, as described above, if compliance with the alteration requirements is technically infeasible, ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(j) requires that the alteration provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. For example, if providing separate accessible fixtures would necessitate combining two cells to create one accessible cell or where the existing plumbing chase construction would preclude recessing connections for separate fixtures, combination units may be utilized. ADAAG 4.1.6(1)(j) still requires that the alteration provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible. Therefore, the combination unit that most closely complies with the technical provisions for toilets and lavatories should be provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11.4.2(3)&blank;Beds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.4.2(4)&blank;Drinking Fountains and Water Coolers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.4.2(5)&blank;Fixed or Built-in Seating and Tables <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADAAG 11.4.2(3) requires that accessible clear floor space be provided on one side of beds. ADAAG 11.4.2(4) requires drinking fountains and water coolers serving accessible cells to be accessible to individuals who use wheelchairs and those who have difficulty bending or stooping. ADAAG 11.4.2(5) requires fixed or built-in seating to be accessible. No comments were received regarding these provisions and no changes were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11.4.2(6)&blank;Fixed Benches <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision requires that fixed benches be mounted between 17 inches and 19 inches above the finish floor and meet minimum structural requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

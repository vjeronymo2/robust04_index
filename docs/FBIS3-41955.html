			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the spring of 1992, the French and U.S.  Presidents decided to follow in the footsteps of the British and  Russians by extending their countries' moratoria on nuclear  tests. Those respective decisions had more to do with politics  and diplomacy than with scientific or technological arguments.  So one might well ask what the consequences of these decisions  might be.    Firstly, nuclear weapons -- like conventional arms -- grow  old. In other words, only detonating them can provide sufficient  information on such problems of ageing to ensure that the armed  forces concerned remain confident in their respective nuclear  arsenals.    A second problem resides in the fact that France has not  developed any new tactical weapons, especially when it comes to  low- powered missiles. The United States is facing an entirely  different problem, for it already has weapons of this type.  Strategic experts believe that France, too, should have  variable-energy arms, as well as the neutron bomb. Of course,  those who oppose nuclear testing maintain that the same kind of  information can be obtained through computer simulations.  However, doing this requires vast computer programs which need  the input of incredibly extensive databases compiled on the  basis of previous tests. Yet, to our knowledge, French  researchers do not have any such databases, unlike the  Americans, no doubt, who naturally classify them as  confidential. Furthermore, even if the performance of nuclear  missiles could be simulated by computer, it would be difficult  to estimate the damage caused by the electromagnetic shock  generated at the moment of detonation.    A wave of this kind can destroy the electronic components of  monitoring and tracking equipment. In this area, the United  States has gathered extensive experience through underground  tests.    We should also mention another argument advanced against  resuming nuclear testing, namely the risk of radioactive  pollution. However, in 1991 an international committee  performed a series of measures at the French testing site in the  Pacific and ended up finding no trace of radioactive elements  that could have been produced by an explosion.    Finally, prolonging the moratorium would risk causing the  best available researchers to lose interest in this kind of  work. This would then result in a loss of know-how which would  be very difficult to overcome when the decision to resume tests  is made. These, then, are the problems that will have to be  taken into account by the members of the working group jointly  appointed by the French president and prime minister on 15 July  1993 to "consider the effects on our nuclear capacity of the  moratorium on nuclear testing." The working group, chaired by  Admiral Lanxade, the French chief of staff, comprises two  representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), two  military figures, and the former research minister, H. Curien.  Let us hope that despite the "wall of silence" surrounding the  group's conclusions which are due to be submitted this month,  the government will keep French citizens informed regarding the  ultimate reasons behind the decisions that will surely have to  be taken.</p>

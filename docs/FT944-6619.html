			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Electrotech plans 200 Welsh jobs Electrotech, a UK manufacturer of machinery for making microchips, is to transfer production from its main plant near Bristol to Newport in south Wales. The move is part of a Pounds 2.1m expansion intended to create an additional 200 jobs over the next three years. The privately-owned company, which has annual sales of more than Pounds 20m, will be moving into a 102,000 sq ft air-conditioned factory which was formerly owned by Inmos, the UK-based semiconductor subsidiary of SGS-Thomson. Electrotech said it was unable to expand at its existing plant at Thornbury and there had been no suitable alternative premises locally. All 240 full-time employees at Thornbury would be offered a transfer to Newport. The move to the Newport factory, which has been empty for several years, has been co-ordinated by the Welsh Development Agency. Electrotech is acquiring the lease from Newport Wafer-Fab, which was set up two years ago to take over manufacture at a second Inmos factory nearby. Electrotech expects the plant to be fully operational by the middle of next year.</p>

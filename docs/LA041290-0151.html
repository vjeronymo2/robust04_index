			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BY DESIGN, IT'S AN ADVANTAGE FOR NICKLAUS  </P> <P> When Jack Nicklaus won his first tournament on the PGA Senior Tour two weeks  ago, it was on a course he designed.  </P> <P> Nicklaus didn't design the PGA National Golf Club where the PGA Seniors'  Championships starts today, but he knows his way around since he lives 10  minutes away.  </P> <P> The Seniors' championship has been played on PGA National since 1982, but the  veterans will see a different course since dramatic alterations have been made  in the last year.  </P> <P> Those changes were made by, you guessed it, Jack Nicklaus.  </P> <P> "There's no home-course advantage," Nicklaus insisted Wednesday. "I had to play  a couple of practice rounds here this week just to see what I've done. It's  coming along nicely, even though it's young and immature in some places. The  greens have a nice pace to them and were much smoother (Wednesday) than  (Tuesday).  </P> <P> The competition for Nicklaus includes former champions Gary Player (1986),  Arnold Palmer (1984) and Larry Mowry (1989), not to mention another senior tour  rookie, Lee Trevino.  </P> <P> Nicklaus' competitors aren't concerned that he knows the layout so well. In  fact, they're glad he made the changes.  </P> <P> "It's a big improvement," Player said. "There is a much better design to the  greens and bunkers."  </P> <P> Added Palmer: "It's better than it was. The grass is smoother, more consistent.  I don't think you can say it's easier or harder than it was before. It depends  on the conditions."  </P> <P> Gene Sarazen, who won the tournament in 1954, was honored Tuesday night at the  past champions dinner. He has been a member of the PGA of America since March  15, 1921, longer than any man alive. The PGA was organized in January, 1916.  LARRY BUSH  </P></p>

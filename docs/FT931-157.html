			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Danish PM wants more measures to encourage EC growth SELECTIVE EXPANSION of European Community economies to pull the EC out of recession and cut its 17m jobless total was urged yesterday by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Rasmussen, president of the EC council, said he expected a Yes vote in Denmark's Maastricht referendum on May 18. This would improve the EC's economic prospects by reducing general uncertainty about the treaty's future. Latest indications are that about 47 per cent would vote Yes, with 25 per cent saying they are against and a substantial proportion of voters undecided. Mr Rasmussen said EC leaders should follow this up by agreeing further growth measures at the Copenhagen summit in June, building on plans to increase infrastructure investment decided at the EC summit in December. He said: 'We have to provide a locomotive effect of the 12 (EC members) by expanding our national economic policies in a selective manner.' In line with Denmark's decision not to take part in the final stage of economic and monetary union (Emu), he underlined his scepticism about some longer term Maastricht goals. Mr Rasmussen, who took over at the helm of a Social Democrat-led coalition in January, said: 'What we need is not to discuss developments for the year 2000. I'm in favour of concrete decisions concerning those 17m (unemployed) people in 1993-94 . . . We need decisions to bring Europe out of stagnation and economic crisis.' He said he particularly favoured increased investment in 'railways, roads, harbours, cities and education' to expand the EC's December plans for higher infrastructure lending by the European Investment Bank. 'If we do that together, we will exploit the dynamism of the single market,' he said. Mr Rasmussen's ideas back up increasingly vigorous suggestions from EC officials in Brussels that the Community puts greater emphasis on combating the recession. Asked about constraints posed by German monetary policy, Mr Rasmussen said measures to allow non-inflationary expansion would help the Bundesbank continue recent interest rate cuts. 'There's no contradiction between higher economic growth and lower interest rates.' Pointing out that EC growth this year was likely to be no more than 1 per cent 'in the best case', he said: 'Stagnation in Europe is a disaster for ordinary people.' He said his government would maintain the krone's parity in the ERM despite Denmark's exemption from Emu. But he said EC governments would have to accept short-run divergences from the fiscal targets set down at Maastricht to guide the path to Emu. Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

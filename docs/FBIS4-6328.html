			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The government has begun  negotiations to bring to South Korea escapees from North  Korea-run logging camps in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, Foreign  Ministry officials said Monday.    Eight North Koreans have asked to be brought here through  the  South Korean Embassy in Kazakhstan and five more at the Embassy  in Uzbekistan, the officials said.    "The government will seek cooperation with these countries  as  well as with Russia to resettle them here," said one official.  "Negotiations are under way and we have asked for support from  the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees."    Seoul announced last week that it would accept all camp  escapees as long as they are not serious criminal offenders.    The number of those in flight is estimated to be as high as  500.</p>

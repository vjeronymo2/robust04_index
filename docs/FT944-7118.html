			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Western interest fails to allay Gazprom fears The foreign appetite for shares in Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly which is the world's largest supplier and the country's biggest company, has created huge disparities in its market price ahead of the sale of 9 per cent of its stock to international investors, planned to take place by the end of the year. The price of Gazprom shares quoted on the Vladivostok stock exchange has soared to Rbs15,510, according to Gazprom officials. This is more than 17 times greater than the Rbs880 quoted by Moscow brokers, and reflects the fact that foreign investors, who can trade on the Vladivostok exchange following a test offering last month, are pushing up the price. The Vladivostok price would mean that the 9 per cent offered abroad would be worth around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6bn) - on the Moscow price it would be worth under Dollars 600m. However, both prices are highly artificial, since nothing is known of how the shares will be offered, and there are doubts surround the title to any future shares and even about whether Gazprom has the right to sell them to foreigners. Gazprom is, after the oil companies, the largest earner of hard currency for Russia. Its annual contract with the German company Ruhrgas - its largest foreign client - is worth DM2.6bn (Pounds 1bn) a year. However, according to brokers and financial executives in Moscow yesterday, the doubts surrounding the shares may mean that the price will be lower than Gazprom is hoping for - though they concede that a company as potentially rich as this may be forgiven a good deal of uncertainty. Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank handling the sale, refuses to give any details, citing the need to observe US legislation on non-disclosure of information before a sale. The problems cited by the Moscow analysts are: Lack of information on how the shares are to be offered - whether to chosen investors or sold freely. Lack of ability to prove title to the shares - which, though they have a price, are barely traded outside Vladivostok. A clause in the company's charter which forbids it to sell shares to foreigners. Though it can probably circumvent the clause by creating a special class of foreign shares, it might leave itself open to legal challenge. Though its reserves are vast - estimated to be worth between Dollars 1,500bn to Dollars 2,000bn - it is subject to Russian government policy of controlling energy prices and cannot collect some of its largest debts, from other former Soviet republics. Gazprom has received substantial credits from the Italian and German credit agencies, but in both cases can offer gas supplied to these countries as collateral. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is working with the company on an ambitious plan to identify investment opportunities on its 220,000km of pipeline but has as yet not decided to invest in the company. By contrast Lukoil, the next biggest energy company, has delayed its stock offer to demonstrate accounts diligence.</p>

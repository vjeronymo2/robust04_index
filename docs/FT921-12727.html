			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Observer: Cross-eyed Eyeballs bulged north of the Border yesterday. Could they really be looking at the Scottish edition of The Sun fronted by a blue-and-white St Andrew's cross, and then seven pages urging independence for Scotland, to which even the page-three girl succumbed? The paper used to string along with its London edition in backing the Conservatives and rejecting Labour's scheme for a devolved Scottish parliament, let alone independence. But now it says Scotland should become a separate member of the European Community, raising its own taxes and keeping its oil revenues. 'Then we could stop blaming everything on the Sassenachs at Westminster.' Oddly enough, there is a stream of Scottish Tory thinking that, failing the status quo, would prefer independence to the fudge of devolution. But the reason for the switch is probably the battle for popular readership in Scotland where the Mirror Group's Daily Record has a circulation of about 700,000 against the Scottish Sun's 280,000. Its editor Bob Bird explains that he reached the decision after 'listening to our readers'. But although he says he has complete editorial independence, it's hard to believe that Rupert Murdoch did not have the decisive voice.</p>

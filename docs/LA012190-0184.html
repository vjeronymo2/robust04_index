			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMITMENT OF YOUTH KEY TO EAST EUROPE UPHEAVAL  </P> <P> In the Palace Square, construction cranes tug at the wreckage left by the  battle that attended dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's flight from power. At midday,  crowds of people, in from the countryside, walk slowly through the square,  looking open-mouthed at the charred and bullet-chipped masonry, appreciating  for the first time the ferocity of the fight that took place here.  </P> <P> Then they stop by the rows of candles set out before the heaps of dirty snow  piled at the edges of the square. These are the shrines to the dead, and the  candles have been burning solidly for two weeks now. The elderly women, pausing  to gaze at the puddles of molten wax and the sputtering wicks of the candles,  often begin to cry. They cry, they say, for the youth, "the youth who saved  us."  </P> <P> There are a dozen such places in Bucharest, and possibly hundreds in other  cities across the country. On two of the main traffic circles in Bucharest,  University Plaza and the Plaza Romania, great wooden crosses are surrounded by  a sea of flickering candles and thousands of wilted flowers, marking the places  where hundreds were cut down by sniper fire from the dictator's elite security  force.  </P> <P> As all Romanians readily acknowledge, the overwhelming majority of those who  died to sweep the Ceausescu regime from power were young people. The courage of  the Romanian youth, braving bullets to win freedom, was unique in a year of  sweeping change in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> But the special determination of the Romanian young people was, in fact, a  forceful reminder of the role played throughout the East Bloc by a new  generation whose bravery, desperation and impatience became a vital catalytic  force in the political revolution that is now changing the face of Europe.  </P> <P> What happened in Romania and the other countries of Eastern Europe in the last  year amounts to a sharp generational break between youth and a parental  generation that came to maturity in the Communist world at a time either when  there was greater hope for communism as a workable system or when the coercive  forces of the state brooked no opposition.  </P> <P> Where parents, by and large, made their uneasy truce with life under communism  and got on with life as best they could, a new generation saw only falsehood  and hopelessness and decided it had nothing to lose.  </P> <P> "We were raised on a mountain of lies," said Stefan Ghencea, 22, the son of a  veterinarian, now helping to organize a student union at Bucharest Polytechnic.  "There was a fantastic difference between the things they told us and the  things we saw. They published incredible statistics on agriculture production,  and in the shops there was nothing to eat. On paper, we had freedom of  expression, but any time anyone said anything, members of the Communist Party  told us to keep our mouths shut."  </P> <P> The mountains of lies and oceans of doublespeak were as obvious to adults as to  youth, of course; but youth, as youth does, saw it all in simpler terms.  </P> <P> "My father had a lot to lose," said Ghencea. "He had a job. He had a family. He  had to take care of me. They could do nothing to me as a student. They could  shoot me, of course, but when you are in a crowd, you lose your fear."  </P> <P> Ghencea, like hundreds of thousands of other youths across the East Bloc in the  last 12 months, had never faced bullets before. In Poland and Czechoslovakia  and East Germany, they had periodically faced the clubs of riot police, but  there were no reports of live ammunition being used. Unlike their parents, they  did not remember the horrors of the Stalinist era in Eastern Europe, when  resistance to communism was punished with prison, labor camps or even death at  the hands of secret police inquisitors.  </P> <P> In Poland in 1988, it was a band of young strikers -- too young to have  participated in the strikes that gave birth to Solidarity in 1980 -- whose  action led directly to the legalization of Solidarity and the ultimate  formation of a government led by the free trade union movement. Lech Walesa,  the veteran leader of the union, told the young strikers in the Lenin Shipyards  in Gdansk in 1988 that their effort would probably fail. By last August, those  same strikers could be credited with establishing the first non-Communist  government in the East Bloc.  </P> <P> The upheaval in East Germany and the fall of the Berlin Wall were triggered by  an exodus of youth -- predominantly East Germans in their late teens and early  twenties -- who had simply had enough of waiting and of empty promises. The  thousands of East German refugees who piled into makeshift encampments, first  in Hungary and then in Prague, resembled, like a kind of time warp, the 1968  youth of Woodstock, the fuse of a political explosion.  </P> <P> It was also youth who set off the 10 tumultuous days of demonstrations in  Prague that brought down the hard-line Czechoslovak regime. There, when  truncheon-wielding police waded into a crowd of students, brutally beating  scores of them, the action galvanized the public. A demonstration by 15,000  students led to crowds of 300,000 filling Wenceslas Square on a daily basis  until the Communist government fell.  </P> <P> "It happened because we created a different conception about life," said Sorin  Ciobanu, 22, another student union organizer at the Bucharest Polytechnic. "We  did not get stuck as our parents did. Our parents know much better than we did  the system of the secret police, the information system of the Communist Party.  They knew they could lose their jobs, that their family could suffer.  </P> <P> My parents are teachers. They were party members. They did not agree (with the  system), but they could not change it. They knew about their colleagues who,  within two days of speaking out in some way, were fired from their jobs and  could not work again as teachers. So they were careful. We understand this.  </P> <P> "But it was different with us. It is true that we had much less to lose. We had  only ourselves. Our parents had families and children to think of."  </P> <P> Now the youth of Bucharest, like much of the rest of the country, are wrestling  with new-found freedom, trying to organize associations and clubs to press  their demands and concerns. They want a revised education system, youth  organizations free of the old Communist concerns. They want to travel, to  establish contacts with the outside world. They see themselves, in their recent  past, as "the most oppressed" of all Romanians.  </P> <P> "The youth were under an absurd yoke," said Ion Manea, who is helping to  organize the newly formed Assn. of Romanian Youth. "In the schools, the  students had no books. The classrooms were dark and unheated. And they could  not express the smallest complaint. If young people wanted to go to college,  they had to be a member of the party."  </P> <P> Some now feel that the revolution, not yet a month old, has already been stolen  from them. Dumitru Coriban, 23, a factory worker from Timisoara, the  Transylvanian city where the revolution began on Dec. 16, fears that the old  Establishment, trying to shed its Communist skin, is clinging to power however  it can. There is a danger, he said, that the youth will be cut out of the  Romanian revolution.  </P> <P> "The youth did not face the bullets to have flowers laid on our heads," Coriban  said. "We did it for change, and we want to see change."  </P> <P> The courage of the streets, the youths said, now has to be transformed into  organization, into developing political skills. It is not easy to be faced with  this challenge overnight.  </P> <P> "In the first days, we faced terrorists with arms," said Vilutza Virtejanu, a  19-year-old student. "Now we are faced with terrorists with ideas, and they are  much more dangerous. They are more adept than we are. They are from the old  order, they feel the ground being cut from under them. It is happening  everywhere now. The farther you get from Bucharest, the more acute the  struggle. It is in every factory, every institution.  </P> <P> "The truth is, we are in a new age. It is as though we have been in a cage. Now  the door to the cage is open, and we are free to fly, but we don't yet know how  to do it. We don't yet know how to fly. We don't know how to use the freedom we  have won. We need people to be close to us and to help us, and we always need  to remember why we did this."  </P></p>

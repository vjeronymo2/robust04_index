			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: USF&amp;G returns to the black in third quarter USF&amp;G Corporation, the troubled Baltimore-based insurer, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 5m in the third quarter of 1992, compared with a net loss of Dollars 25m a year ago. The small profit came despite an Dollars 80m bill for Hurricane Andrew, the storm system which left a trail of destruction across southern Florida in late-August. The insurer also took a one-time restructuring charge of Dollars 51m as it implemented changes to the field marketing and underwriting operations. These moves, it said, should produce annual cost-savings of about Dollars 55m. USF&amp;G said that excluding both the restructuring charge and realised gains on investments, but including the hurricane losses, it would have produced a loss of Dollars 80m. This would have compared with a loss of Dollars 30m in the same period of 1991. On the same basis, USF&amp;G would have posted a nine-month loss of Dollars 75m, compared with losses of Dollars 115m in the first three quarters of 1991. USF&amp;G shares were Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 12 1/4 when Wall Street closed.</p>

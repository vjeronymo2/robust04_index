			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> SENATE PRAISES MANDELA ON RELEASE  </P> <P> The state Senate passed a resolution Friday congratulating Nelson Mandela, the  South African anti-apartheid leader who was released this week after 27 years  in prison.  </P> <P> The resolution passed on a 23-6 vote, but only after an amendment to condemn  the violence that Mandela's movement has sparked failed 15-16. The condemnation  call came from Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin), and drew sharp criticism from  more moderate senators, who labeled him a hypocrite and ill-intentioned.  Doolittle blamed the African National Congress for a 1983 car bombing that  killed 19 people and for periodic torture deaths of civilians.  </P></p>

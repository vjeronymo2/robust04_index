Our correspondent  reports.    Cuanza Sul Provincial Governor Ramos da Cruz has described  the situation as very delicate and said UNITA has two objectives  -- to economically destabilize every area in the province and  subsequently to occupy them.    [Begin Cruz recording] The military situation in the  province  is very delicate. UNITA has exerted pressure on almost every  district in the province in an attempt to destabilize and occupy  them. It plans to fully destabilize the coastal region so that  it can use Cuanza Sul Province as a launching pad to carry out  attacks on Angola's northern provinces, particularly Luanda.  [end recording]    Ramos da Cruz said there is an urgent and imperative need  for  the government to organize its entire defensive perimeter.    [Begin Cruz recording] During 1994 the government should  continue to organize its entire defensive perimeter, improve  administrative work, create minimum living conditions for our  people, and try to begin a counteroffensive so that we can  gradually regain control of the entire province and thus achieve  our main objective -- to stabilize Cuanza Sul Province and make  it one of the provinces where the government has complete  territorial administration.

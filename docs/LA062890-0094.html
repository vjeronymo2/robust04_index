			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET PARTY PLANS TO HOLD CONGRESS ON SCHEDULE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN REFORMERS AND CONSERVATIVES IS EXPECTED AT A  CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING FRIDAY.  </P> <P> Despite a conservative surge that could undermine President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's hopes of accelerating his reform program, the leadership of the  Soviet Communist Party intends to proceed with its congress next week as  scheduled, a ranking member of the party's Politburo said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Vadim A. Medvedev, the party secretary for ideology, said that a final decision  on whether to hold the congress in spite of calls for its postponement will be  made at a meeting of the policy-making Central Committee that opens Friday.  </P> <P> In what is likely to be a major showdown between the party's reformists and its  strong conservative wing, the 249-member committee will also debate the report  to the congress that Gorbachev will deliver as the party's general secretary.  </P> <P> And it will review a rewritten party platform and a plan for the reorganization  of party bodies, the two key documents that will be put before the 4,700  delegates to the congress as "blueprints for perestroika," as a Soviet  commentator described them.  </P> <P> Medvedev said the platform, which was published Wednesday, had been reworked  extensively to take account of criticism from both radical reformers and  conservatives as well as to create a more philosophical, strategic document,  which would lay the basis for broadening and speeding perestroika, as  Gorbachev's reforms are known.  </P> <P> Although there had been intense speculation that Gorbachev was seeking to delay  the congress so that he could regroup his forces and ensure endorsement of his  reforms, Medvedev said there was a strong consensus, now shared by Gorbachev's  supporters, that it is best to proceed Monday with what party officials regard  as a crucial congress.  </P> <P> "I view with understanding the proposals to postpone the congress, but the  train has already left the station," Medvedev told a press conference. "Many  leaders in the republics and regions (of the country) were in favor of sticking  to the dates already established. This is the predominant opinion in the party.  In my view, the congress will take place July 2."  </P> <P> That the Soviet leadership was even seriously considering the possibility of  postponing the congress, however, testified to the considerable disarray across  the political spectrum, especially in the party hierarchy, as a result of the  strong conservative push.  </P> <P> A good case had been made for the delay, Medvedev said, but the leadership  decided in the end that the negative impact would be greater than any gain.  </P> <P> According to Medvedev, the suggestion of postponing the congress, months in  preparation, arose because some provincial leaders were worried about gathering  the earlier harvest and felt that too much time had already been taken up with  political meetings.  </P> <P> But party sources, liberals and conservatives alike, said that close Gorbachev  advisers had raised the possibility of a postponement after conservative  delegates took over another party conference last week and turned it into a  forum that virtually put Gorbachev and perestroika on trial.  </P> <P> Their quick calculations, these sources said, were that a repeat of such events  at a full party congress -- about half the delegates are regarded as  conservative -- would defeat Gorbachev's plan for a broader mandate for  political and economic reforms and a fresh team to implement them.  </P> <P> A postponement of the congress until fall, according to this thinking, would  have deprived the conservatives of the momentum that they built up during the  past three months. Last week, they elected one of Gorbachev's sharpest critics  as the new leader of the Russian party.  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist president of Russia, the largest Soviet  republic, was among those suggesting that the congress might be postponed until  the autumn to "stabilize the political situation." He predicted a "real  struggle" in the Central Committee.  </P> <P> But Medvedev, who canvassed party leaders around the country, said that the  "political arguments in favor of perestroika are also in favor of not  postponing the congress."  </P> <P> Were the leadership to put off the congress, which Gorbachev had twice brought  forward from next spring, it would signal to the nation that the conservatives  had wrested control of the party away from the reformers, according to most  Soviet political observers.  </P> <P> "We expect healthy perestroika forces to take care of that," Medvedev said when  asked whether the congress would approve the platform and party reorganization.  </P> <P> The proposed platform, which will become the party's basic policy statement,  focuses on measures to pull the country out of its deepening political,  economic and social crises.  </P> <P> It urges emergency measures to speed the transition to a market economy, to  increase the supply of food and consumer goods and to build more houses but  also balance the state budget and cut defense spending.  </P> <P> It also calls for steps to fight crime, improve health care and increase  environmental protection. And, in response to spreading ethnic conflicts, it  sets forth as a priority the drafting of a new treaty linking the country's  constituent republics.  </P> <P> Entitled "Toward a Humane, Democratic Socialism" and described by Medvedev as  deliberately broad to avoid splitting the party along ideological lines, the  policy statement breaks ideologically with the party's historic position,  noting its "heritage" from Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and V. I. Lenin but  declaring that good ideas must be taken from wherever they are found.  </P> <P> Many of the Soviet Union's problems stem from its previous "distortion of  socialism," the platform argues in support of adherence to the "socialist  choice."  </P> <P> "False ideas about socialism as a society based on the state monopoly on  property and dictatorship led by the party-state bosses in the name of the  proletariat has brought tyranny and lawlessness and the alienation of people  from property and authority," it says.  </P> <P> In an effort to keep as many radical reformers within the party as possible  despite their threats to quit and form a new party, the platform was rewritten  to assure a place for multiple structures within the Communist Party and to  relax the once rigid discipline of centralism that subordinated each party unit  to another above it.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, head of the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), met Friday [28 January] evening in a  last-minute bid to reach agreement on political reform bills.    The meeting began at around 7 P.M. shortly after Hosokawa  and  Kono met separately with Takako Doi, speaker of the House of  Representatives, who urged the two rivals to come to terms on  the issue.    Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito [Japan Reneweal Party],  the second-largest but most influential party in the ruling  coalition, attended the top-level meeting along with LDP  Secretary General Yoshiro Mori.    Mori told reporters just before the start of the meeting  that  the LDP leadership agreed to meet with Hosokawa and Ozawa in  response to a compromise proposal made by Doi, a former  chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).    Doi proposed passing the bills without setting a date for  implementation and then discussing revision of the package in  the next ordinary Diet session, coalition sources said.    Earlier, Hosokawa met with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of  the  SDP, the largest party in the coalition, to seek his support for  a face-off with Kono, officials said. The SDP has been  opposed to making further concessions on the political reform  bills.    The coalition and the opposition, including the LDP, failed  to reach an accord over the issue Thursday night at a meeting of  the joint council of the two Diet houses.    The council was made up of 10 members from the coalition who  voted for the bills in the lower house and 10 legislators from  the opposition who opposed the package in the upper house.    The alliance moved closer to the LDP position by amending  the government's four-bill reform package, which was voted down  by the House of Councillors last Friday. The package passed the  more powerful House of Representatives last November.    The coalition's compromise proposal would increase the  number  of single-seat constituencies to 280 from 274 in the original  bill and cut the number of proportional representation seats  correspondingly to 220 from 226. The mix is intended to replace  the current multiple-seat constituency system in lower house  elections.    The coalition is also backpedaling on the initial blanket  ban  on corporate donations to individual politicians by allowing  members of local assemblies to receive such donations for five  years after the reform bills are enacted.    In the joint council session, the LDP rejected the  compromise, and counterproposed its own slightly revised reform  package, which was rejected by the lower house in November.    The LDP version calls for 300 seats single-seat  constituencies and 171 under proportional representation, as  well as allowing individual politicians to accept corporate  donations through designated fund-raising organizations.    The coalition refused to accept this, and Yuichi Ichikawa,  secretary general of Komeito and the coalition's chief  negotiator, who chaired the meeting, declared an end to the  effort by the joint council to find ground for a compromise.    If the talks between Hosokawa and Kono end in failure, the  coalition will send the package back to a plenary session of the  lower house to seek a two-thirds majority to pass the bills,  some coalition members hinted.    This would require some 70 rebels from the LDP to vote for  the package.    If the bills fail to be passed, Hosokawa will be forced to  have his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower house for  a snap election, political analysts say.    Hosokawa said Thursday he will not cling to power if he  fails  to achieve political reform by Saturday's close of the Diet  session.</p>

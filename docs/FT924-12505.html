			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Venezuela pushes ahead with electricity price rises VENEZUELA'S government has approved a series of price rises by public and private electric power companies, despite widespread opposition. The increases, to be staggered over 36 months, will cover residential, commercial and industrial subscribers. The cost of electricity is a big political issue in Venezuela, even though rates are relatively cheap compared with the rest of the world. In March President Carlos Andres Perez ordered a temporary freeze on planned price increases because of political pressure following an attempted coup d'etat in February. The government has not released details of the price rises, but officials said they involved 'very small' monthly increments. The rises should boost the government's flagging privatisation programme - several electric power companies are due to be sold this year and next. They should also improve the inflation-hit profits outlook for Venezuelan power companies; the country's largest private electricity utility, La Electricidad de Caracas, recently announced an indefinite suspension of dividends due to the rate freeze. Mr Alirio Parra, minister of energy and mines, said the increases were intended to reduce the large gap between residential and commercial power rates. For many years Venezuelan industry and commerce have been subsidising residential consumption by paying higher prices. The minister stressed that, even when the new rates were effective, Venezuela's power costs would continue to rank among the lowest in the world.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heavies lead a virulent campaign YESTERDAY'S publication of the Calcutt report was preceded by a virulent press campaign against its recommendations. Like veteran field commanders, the broadsheets have led the charge, followed by some rather indisciplined troops - the tabloids, which have smelt blood and moved in for the kill. The papers have brought out their big guns in the days leading up to publication. The opening volley of the new year was fired on January 4 by The Independent, identifying in general terms Calcutt's plans for a tough statutory body as a potential attack on democracy. More extensive leaks were published on January 10 by the Sunday broadsheets, led by The Sunday Times with the headline 'Britain's toughest-ever curbs on freedom of the press'. They were backed up by hard-hitting coverage in the tabloids. Condemning 'the black hole of Calcutt', the News of the World denounced an 'establishment plot' to install the 'the news of the government'. It pledged to fight Calcutt 'every column inch of the way', and cheekily made its lead story an alleged bribery scandal involving a civil servant. On Monday, as national newspaper editors issued virulent anti-Calcutt statements, The Sun under the headline 'Hands off Your Sun' urged its readers: 'Don't be fooled. This argument is not about protecting the little man from the big bad press. It's about stopping us from printing the truth about pompous public figures.' Its rival the Daily Mirror, clearly anxious to establish respectable post-Maxwell credentials, admitted that newspapers were not perfect and that journalists 'make mistakes'. But it argued that existing laws of libel and the Press Complaints Committee were sufficient. By then, some ministers were reported to be siding with some of Calcutt's proposals - those on bugging and eavesdropping, which are an essential part of the tabloid armoury, although not necessarily of all the broadsheets. The Guardian defensively stated that the press faced a big obstacle 'for it currently has fewfriends'. It soon found a friend - its Westminster correspondent David Hencke was handed a strategic missile: a leaked letter to Sir David Calcutt from Lord McGregor, chairman of the PCC, stating that at least one member of the royal family had manipulated the press in reporting the marriage difficulties of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Broadsheets and tabloids hit back, arguing that the letter had undermined the case of those who used alleged media mistreatment of the royal family as grounds for sweeping curbs on the press. But, as The Guardian noted in its editorial earlier in the week, 'the greatest trouble is that the general public's view of what's awful switches inevitably from moment to moment.'</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Move to wind up Malaysian fund BUCHANAN Partners, the London-based investment firm, is attempting to organise a voluntary winding-up of Malaysian Smaller Companies Fund (Cayman). MSCF is a closed-end investment company, similar to an investment trust, with a net asset value estimated by Buchanan at Dollars 40m. It invests in Malaysian smaller companies. Buchanan and related accounts now have an aggregate 10.27 per cent holding in MSCF's ordinary shares, and they are requisitioning an extraordinary meeting to wind up the company. According to Buchanan: 'We have a very strong confirmation that shareholders representing a further 61.73 per cent in the ordinary shares will support the resolution. At the present time we are very confident that the resolution would be passed.' Shares in single-country funds are only infrequently traded, and so discounts to net asset value are often substantial. The aim of a voluntary liquidation would be to allow shareholders to realise assets in the fund, at a discount. A two-thirds majority is required. Buchanan says the liquidators' fee would not exceed Dollars 25,000, and that distribution of assets and cash could take place within two months of winding-up.</p>

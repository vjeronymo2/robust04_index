			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Jump seen in double income families Nearly one-third of British households contain dual-earner couples and only 17 per cent contain sole-earner couples, according to research on household income published in the latest Employment Gazette. There has also been a surge in the employment rate of women with children - 57 per cent were working in 1989 compared with 46 per cent in 1981. Employment during that period increased faster among certain groups of mothers, including those with fewer and younger children, white mothers, mothers living with employed partners and mothers with higher levels of qualification. Employment grew slowly or even fell among mothers with three or more children, mothers with no qualifications, mothers with non-employed partners and lone mothers - whose employment rate fell from 45 per cent to 41 per cent. Employment Gazette says: 'Employment trends are creating a process of differentiation and polarisation among families with children. For example, the number of no-earner and dual-earner families increased in the 1980s. 'Furthermore, among dual-earner families there is a small but growing group where both parents are employed full-time.' A separate analysis of household employment in 1991 stresses the growing inequality in household income. It says: 'At one end of the spectrum there are households where both partners are working and some adult children are also working. 'At the other end of the spectrum there are households where both partners are unemployed . . . and where adult children are also unemployed. 'Elderly people also tend to be in the households with the least resources and which have few, if any, earners.'</p>

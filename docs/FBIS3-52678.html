			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent in Cairo Shefi Gabay] </F>   [Text] Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation  for talks on IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the  Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, told MA'ARIV in Cairo yesterday  that progress was made on some issues dealt with in the liaison  committee meeting in Cairo, mainly regarding the size of IDF  installations for guarding the settlements, and to a lesser  degree in relation to the size of the Jericho autonomous area.  He added, however, that at this stage it is impossible to say  that an agreement between the PLO and Israel has been attained.    [Gabay] What answer will you give the Israeli Government  today following the unequivocal negative reaction of the PLO  Executive Committee?    [Sha'th] In our answer, which we will send to Amnon Shahaq  today, we will declare our intention to continue the  negotiations toward achieving an acceptable memorandum of  understanding regarding all the outstanding problems. The two  original delegations will resume their regular sessions.    [Gabay] Does Yasir 'Arafat share your opinions?    [Sha'th] Certainly, because there is no return from the  declaration of principles. In our meeting with 'Arafat, which  has just ended, we decided that with goodwill we will be able to  solve all the problems.    [Gabay] What, then, did the Liaison Committee do for three  days in Cairo?    [Sha'th] We agreed with the Israelis not to publish the  understandings reached, and a few understandings were indeed  reached. You must remember, though, that no agreement or  memorandum was attained. I hope that Israel will not leak the  understandings, because I will construe any Israeli leak a  breach of promise.    [Gabay] According to what you say, the Liaison Committee  will not be reconvened in Cairo soon, as Peres claimed.    [Sha'th] The Liaison Committee, headed by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud  'Abbas] and Shim'on Peres, convened this week only to unfreeze  the talks, seeing that this is its job. It scored some  progress, and now we will immediately start to deal with the  details in a thorough manner. The Liaison Committee did attain  a certain breakthrough.    [Gabay] Why did the PLO Executive Committee reject the  memorandum of understanding reached in Cairo?    [Sha'th] The Israelis were mistaken to talk about an  agreement in Cairo, when in fact there was no such agreement.  The final agreement will be reached only after the committees  end their deliberations.    [Gabay] Was progress made on the issue of border crossings,  as the Israelis claimed?    [Sha'th] No progress answering the Palestinians' aspirations  was made on this issue. Controversial points remain in other  issues as well.</p>

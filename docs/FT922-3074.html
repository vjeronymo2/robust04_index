			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Increased loss at Owen &amp; Robinson OWEN &amp; Robinson, the jewellery and sports shoe retailer, reported an increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 638,000 to Pounds 2.9m for the year to January 31, and again is not paying a final dividend. It was also announced yesterday that Mr Maurice Dwek, chairman, had resigned as head of Arlen, the electricals group, and was expected to devote more time to O&amp;R. Mr Dwek, who ran Dwek Group, a mini-conglomerate, and set up Seaforth Investments, an industrial investment group, has brought in new management at O&amp;R. Mr Alan Gaynor, who ran the Underwoods chemist chain, and Mr Mike Smith, formerly finance director of Laura Ashley, arrived in April. Mr Gaynor said yesterday that they had already identified and removed overheads, saving Pounds 1m in a full year. This had involved 100 redundancies. He said the core Gold Centre business was sound but had expanded too fast, almost doubling in size last year. As a result, group sales rose 45 per cent to Pounds 26.3m in 1991-92. However, gross profits were held back by price cutting in the all-important Christmas period. Exceptional costs of Pounds 832,000 and an extraordinary debit of Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 5.48m), the dividends on the preference shares and the cost of the 0.15p interim dividend, meant a transfer from reserves of Pounds 5m (Pounds 6.9m). Losses per share were 11.62p (8.08p).</p>

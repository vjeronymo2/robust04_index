			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 29 Apr (TANJUG) -- The foreign affairs  ministry of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] sent a letter  today to the diplomatic and consular missions in Belgrade  warning of the terror by the Croatian over the Serb population,  calling on them to raise this issue at the United Nations and to  do everything to prevent these crimes in Croatia from being  hushed up.    The letter mentions a statement by Stipe Mesic, the speaker  of the Croatian Assembly, about the killing of the Serb Zec  family (Mihajlo, Mirjana, and their 12-year-old daughter,  Aleksandra) in Zagreb in 1991. In his statement, which was  published in the FERAL TRIBUNE weekly in Split, the letter goes  on to say, Mesic said that members of the Internal Affairs  Ministry of the Republic of Croatia were suspected of having  killed the Zec family, but were acquitted at a secret trial in  Zagreb.    This statement by Mesic is a confirmation of the terror by  the Croatian state over the Serb population between 1991 and  1994, the letter stresses, calling on the consular and  diplomatic missions in Belgrade to propose to their governments  that his issue be raised in the UN bodies.    The letter says that over 300,000 Serbs were evicted from  Croatia, which is the largest-scale and the first ethnic  cleansing carried out in the former Yugoslavia.    The letter also notes that approximately 14,000 Serbs,  including complete families, were killed by the Internal Affairs  Ministry of the Republic of Croatia. The UN Security Council  Commission for War Crimes, the letter goes on to say, was  informed about 87 mass graves in Croatia, where the 14,000  innocent members of the Serb nation are buried.    "Unfortunately, the Security Council has decided that this  commission should cease work on 30 April 1994 (allegedly because  of a lack of money), even though nothing has been done about the  exhumation of these 87 graves, the identification of victims,  and the handing over of the perpetrators to the International  War Crimes Court," the letter says, making the appeal: "Please  do everything to prevent these crimes in Croatia from being  hushed up."</p>

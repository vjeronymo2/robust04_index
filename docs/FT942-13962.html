			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Management: Unilever in a lather - The urgency behind the soap powder maker's launch of a new concentrate In the next few weeks, shoppers across Europe will be subjected to a barrage of publicity on the topic of washing powder. Well-known brands, such as Persil in the UK, Omo in the Netherlands and Via in Sweden, will suddenly appear in a plastic container instead of the familiar box. The pack will be smaller, but will cost about the same. Advertising will make familiar claims: that the new version washes whiter, works at lower temperatures, is kinder to the environment and so forth. For the owner of these brands, Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever, the hype will have more than the usual urgency. The launch is the culmination of 10 years' work and Pounds 100m of capital investment. It claims to represent the first real breakthrough in detergent technology for 15 years. Above all, it aims to make up ground lost by Unilever to its deadly rival, Procter &amp; Gamble of the US, across Europe in the past five years; and if it is to succeed, speed is of the essence. At the root of the battle is a shift in the market from conventional washing powders to concentrated powders. From a standing start in 1989, concentrates now have half the European market, with sales worth almost Pounds 3bn. As Unilever candidly admits, the shift caught it wrong-footed. 'What took us by surprise', says John Taylor, European production manager, 'was the rate the market grew at, and our inability to tool up to meet demand'. Procter &amp; Gamble made no such mistake. As a result, its concentrates now outsell Unilever's by a factor of two in the UK, and by a handsome margin elsewhere in Europe. All the while, supermarkets are making inroads with own-label concentrates, and have grabbed 15 per cent of the UK market. In struggling to address this, Unilever also had to modernise its internal organisation. Five years ago, it had some 18 operating companies around Europe, each with its own factories and products. Procter &amp; Gamble, by contrast, was a late arrival in Europe in the early 1980s, and tackled the market on a pan-European basis from the outset. Its production was concentrated in fewer plants. The product was harmonised across countries and sold under a single brand name, Ariel. As a result, says Niall Fitzgerald, head of Unilever detergents worldwide, 'their cost structure was several percentage points below ours. On a business worth Pounds 1.4bn to us, that's a lot of money.' At the start of the 1990s, Unilever set out to close the gap. In a period of traumatic upheaval, its detergents operations throughout Europe were merged into a single business. Factories were closed and jobs were axed. Unilever is now in a position to push a new product much faster through its new pan-European organisation: provided, of course, that it has the product. Hence the new super-concentrated detergent. It has two chief characteristics: effectiveness at lower temperatures and less bulk. According to Unilever executives, 100g of the new Persil equals 125g of the old, or 155g of the equivalent version of Ariel. The key is a combination of chemistry and process technology. Traditionally, powdered detergents are made by mixing the ingredients with water, then drying the result in an enormous tower some 130ft high. This uses large amounts of energy and involves evaporating up to 30 tons of water an hour, producing a huge emission of steam mixed with volatile chemicals. Unilever's new method involves no water, relying instead on a chemical reaction between the ingredients to drive the process. This, says Unilever, saves around 80 per cent of the energy cost, besides being more flexible and much less pollutive. The new technology is being employed at just three sites around Europe: at Warrington in the UK, Mannheim in Germany and Casale in Italy. No other detergents producer is yet copying it. But Unilever does not expect to keep it to itself, since it is neither patented nor specific to the detergents industry. The real technological edge, Unilever says, lies elsewhere: in a new catalyst, which accelerates the chemical reaction of the detergent and lets it work at lower temperatures. The catalyst hunts out the stain, then attracts the bleach in the detergent to it. Having set the bleach to work, it moves on to the next stain. It is protected by 34 patents: and, say Unilever executives, patent searches suggest that no one else is close to imitating it. Switching to the new product is a formidable exercise, since it involves replacing old-style concentrate sales worth some Pounds 500m across Europe. The result is not lower costs, since the savings in non-tower production will be offset by more expensive ingredients. But if nothing else, the product should have environmental appeal. A machine-load of washing uses large quantities of energy, water and highly reactive chemicals to remove a few grams of dirt and release a lot of pollution. Since the new product uses less heat, fewer chemicals and less packaging, it can be promoted as ecologically virtuous. Meanwhile, the new formulation will for the first time copy the Procter &amp; Gamble approach in being physically identical across Europe. But if the powder is the same, the brands will remain separate. Unilever is slightly defensive about this. The sunk cost in brands like Persil and Omo, it says, far outweighs the marginal savings that would be gained from unified advertising. The chief priority, though, is to roll the new formulation out as fast as possible. By the end of the month it will be in the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Next month it will be across Scandinavia. 'This is an industry with several formidable competitors,' Fitzgerald says. 'Technological change is short-lived. The premium comes from exploiting it very rapidly. In Europe, we need to whip it through the structure at great speed.' If this sounds alarmist, Unilever can remind itself how quickly it fell behind the last time. Another of its senior executives puts it bluntly: 'The old high-suds powders for hand washing had a lifetime of 60 or 70 years. The low-suds powders which arrived in the 1960s had a life of 20 years. Detergent liquids lasted seven years. The first phase of concentrates has lasted five years. This is the next phase.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sergey Bablumyan: "The Armenian </F> President's Team: Artem Atalyants and Others"]    [Text] Yerevan -- Yerevan newspapers often publish old  photographs of Levon Ter-Petrosyan and his friends from the  Karabakh Committee. There is nothing surprising in the fact  that the same people still surround him now and that some of  them are members of the president's team.    They all helped to found the current ruling party, the  Armenian National Movement; the Karabakh Committee flowed  smoothly down into it. Observers usually include parliamentary  Speaker Babken Ararktsyan, Interior Minister Vanik Siradegyan,  and, until recently, Chief National Security Adviser to the  President Ashot Manucharyan in the circle of people closest to  Ter-Petrosyan. Public opinion gives Siradegyan a special place  among those closest to the president. The interior minister's  almost unlimited freedom of action and independent conduct and  opinions make these comments convincing enough. Levon  Ter-Petrosyan has repeatedly expressed public satisfaction with  the work done by Vanik Siradegyan's department. In turn, the  interior minister categorically rules out the possibility of any  difference of opinion with the president.    The president is helped in forming and implementing domestic  policy by members of the Armenian National Movement, his loyalty  to which he never tires of reiterating. It is Armenia's most  liberal political party and favors cooperation not only with  Russia and the West, but also with the East -- with Turkey and  Iran.    According to people in the know, Levon Ter-Petrosyan's  economic views were formed under the influence of Prime Minister  Grant Bagratyan and his predecessor, now Armenian Vice President  Gagik Arutyunyan. As far as the well-known businessman Artem  Atalyants is concerned, foreign economic issues are his sole  responsibility as chief adviser to the president. Some  observers assessing the situation in this sphere make no secret  of their skepticism; this, incidentally, applies equally to the  economic situation in the republic itself.    The average age of the president's closest entourage is  40-45. It is widely held in Armenia that the president's team is  virtually entirely made up of his former fellow students from  the Yerevan University Oriental Studies Department, as well as  his work colleagues from the Institute of Ancient Manuscripts,  the Matenadaran. In actual fact his team includes lawyers,  economists, mathematicians, even musicologists, and, of course,  orientalists.    A recent adviser, Vagan Papazyan, now heads the Armenian  Foreign Ministry. This appointment is seen as a logical  continuation of the president's cadre policy, as he earlier  assigned another of his advisers, U.S. citizen Zhirayr  Liparityan, to the same department. Continuing to work as first  deputy minister, according to well informed sources, he is still  one of the president's most trusted consultants in the foreign  policy sphere.    Vazgen Sarkisyan, the president's chief military adviser,  was  a journalist until recently. According to many military  specialists, he has quickly mastered military matters and no one  in Armenia doubts his personal courage.    The opposition accuses Levon Ter-Petrosyan's closest  associates of being incompetent, of being out of touch with the  people's real problems and concerns, and of having totally  forgotten their promises. The president's team does not  outwardly respond to these attacks, although some members assess  the results of their activity fairly soberly. But they stay  with the president and, according to one of his comrades, if  anyone were forced to leave it would only be "because of  incredible physical exhaustion."    It is extremely rare for one of the president's closest  entourage to leave on his own initiative, and in this sense the  departure of former chief adviser Ashot Manucharyan is the  exception.    "He only left because he wanted to leave," is the official  comment on the resignation of one of the most influential  members of the president's closest entourage. Few people in  Armenia believe that Ashot Manucharyan has left the political  scene for long.</p>

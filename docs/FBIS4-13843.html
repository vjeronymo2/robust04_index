			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] The NATO ultimatum to the aggressor Serbs has  expired. Yet, even though they continue their attacks on the  city of Gorazde and its oppressed residents, the UN emissary in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has announced that Serbs have promised to  withdraw a few kilometers away from Gorazde and there is no need  for a NATO attack on Serb positions.    Political analysts believe that the United Nations and  Western countries are turning a blind eye to the Serbian  atrocities and the announcement of a belated ultimatum by  NATO--for political and propaganda purposes--highlights the fact  that no justice can be expected from the current international  system. It is because of the intrinsically Western bias of this  system that it has an anti- Islamic stance. The implementation  of the UN resolutions on Iraq to chastise that country for its  occupation of Kuwait while turning a blind eye to Serbian  atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Zionists in Palestine  proves that with such policies the West and the United  Nations--with their leniency toward noncompliance with UN  resolutions in these regions--not only do not prevent the  continued humanitarian catastrophes but actually facilitate  their continuation and proliferation.    It is for this reason that the Islamic world should seek an  alternate measure from the United Nations and the West to halt  this savage and brutal onslaught. Even though activity outside  the current international system is very difficult, and the  subservience of some rulers of Islamic countries to the powers  of world arrogance detracts from cooperation among Islamic  countries, the continuation of the present state of affairs is  not possible, especially when the Islamic world is witnessing a  human catastrophe daily.    Political analysts believe that the Muslim people realize  the  above facts now more than ever before because of the sorrowful  events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that most Islamic countries  also understand this reality. In such a climate, planning and  coordination on the popular and official levels among Islamic  governments is essential.    The upcoming hajj season is one of the most important things  that can be used to attain such lofty objectives and to impart  its true meaning to the hajj.</p>

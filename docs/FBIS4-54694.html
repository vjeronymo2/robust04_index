			<p>BFN     [Text] Probably thanks to Mr. Akashi's visit, the chetniks  have reduced the number of cease-fire violations in Sarajevo  today. Still, their snipers have managed to wound one civilian  today near the Simon Bolivar primary school in Dobrinja. They  also fired with an antiaircraft machine gun from Azici on the  city's free territory. Throughout the day they have been  carrying out tactical regrouping of men and equipment in various  directions, and grouping of their army on certain positions  around Sarajevo. There are indications that their sniper fire  and other military activities could intensify, so the citizens  are reminded to take seriously all the caution warnings.    This is reported by the [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] 1st Corps  Information Center.</p>

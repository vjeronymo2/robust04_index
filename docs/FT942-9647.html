			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chelsea Mr Ken Bates, the ebullient chairman of Chelsea, is not letting today's FA Cup Final against Manchester United impede his reputation for litigation. Two companies under his control, Chelsea Village and Chelsea Football Club, have issued proceedings in the High Court seeking a declaration that the recent appointment of Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross as liquidator to CFAC, the former Chelsea Football and Athletic Company, was invalidly made. The statement said that 90 per cent of CFAC's debts had already been paid off and the remaining non-Chelsea debts were never acknowledged as valid. Chelsea is seeking to appoint a liquidator 'who will finalise the affairs of CFAC in the most cost-effective manner and in the best interests of all the remaining creditors'.</p>

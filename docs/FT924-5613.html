			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Minister resigns to 'protect' Yeltsin MR Mikhail Poltaranin, the Russian minister of information and one of President Boris Yeltsin's closest allies and friends, resigned yesterday 'to protect the president from mounting attacks from an opposition bent on revenge', writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Mr Poltaranin was a bitter foe of the Civic Union group Mr Yeltsin is making a political and economic pact with. His comments indicate his resignation was part of that deal. Russia was yesterday reinstated to the US food credit guarantee programme, a day after it was suspended for failing to make a Dollars 10.9m payment. The default notice was lifted after full payment plus a late fee were received by US banks.</p>

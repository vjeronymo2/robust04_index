			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 103 CONSUMER GROUP COSTS TO BE PAID;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: IMPLEMENTATION HEARINGS GET UNDER WAY WITH ATTENDANCE WEIGHTED  HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF THE INDUSTRY.  </P> <P> Proposition 103 implementation hearings that are expected to last at least two  months got under way here Monday with a decision that consumer representatives  will be compensated for their participation.  </P> <P> The chief hearing officer for the state Department of Insurance, retired Santa  Clara County Superior Court Judge William J. Fernandez, said that any consumer  group that makes a substantial contribution to the proceedings could submit its  legal fees and expenses each 30 days and will be reimbursed if deemed  reasonable.  </P> <P> Fernandez added that witnesses used by consumer groups to testify on the issues  at the hearings will also have their expenses paid after their appearances.  </P> <P> He said the Insurance Department will advance the necessary funds. But  eventually the department will pass the costs on to insurance companies that do  business in California, Fernandez said. According to the law, the companies pay  the Insurance Department's budget.  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said she had been consulted in the  hearing officer's decision and that she fully approved of the payments as a  means of assuring that consumer groups at the drawn-out and complicated  hearings will be represented to the same degree as the insurance companies.  </P> <P> Harry Snyder, West Coast director of the Consumers Union, called the  compensation order "a very auspicious beginning to the hearings. It will  guarantee fairness," he said. "Now it's up to us to adequately represent the  consumers, to be sure they are given what they voted for when they passed  Proposition 103."  </P> <P> As the hearings began on such key Proposition 103 implementation issues as rate  rollbacks, what constitutes a fair return for the companies and new methods of  pricing auto insurance on other than a neighborhood basis, industry  representatives vastly outnumbered consumer delegates in the hearing. The ratio  appeared to be about 10 to 1.  </P> <P> But representatives of such groups as the Consumers Union, Voter Revolt, Public  Advocates Inc. and the Latino Issues Forum managed to speak almost as often as  all the company lawyers combined. Robert Gnaiza of Public Advocates estimated  that the industry lawyers in the room were billing their companies a combined  total of $500,000 a day in fees, which are passed on to policy holders. He said  the consumer representative billings will be only a fraction of that.  </P> <P> Paul Alexander, speaking for State Farm Insurance Co., replied that the  $500,000 figure for the industry attorneys was an exaggeration. But he made no  estimate of his own.  </P> <P> Much of the first day of the hearings was taken up by pleas by industry lawyers  for special treatment for their clients.  </P> <P> Several lawyers insisted that the companies they represented should be exempted  from the regulations developed by these hearings altogether and be treated  individually later. But the hearing officer said this would not be done and  that all companies doing business in California are subject to the hearings.  </P></p>

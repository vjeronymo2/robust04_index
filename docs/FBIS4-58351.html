			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The Right Angle" column by Nadim Muhsin] </F>   [Excerpts] Assassinations carried out by states with legal  institutions are definitely considered criminal actions that  demand bringing their perpetrators to trial. The mentality that  plans such assassinations needs to be changed to adapt to the  modern age. [passage omitted]    A state's assassination of its citizens is an indication of  failure and bankruptcy. Assassinating individuals cannot save a  country, lift a blockade, repulse an enemy, or restore arms  programs that are the rights of every state. It is only an  expression of anger and the loss of nerves, and these are not  the characteristics of rational states or wise governments.    We condemn the assassination of a citizen born in Iraq at  the  hands of other citizens. Yes, Iraqi officials made a mistake in  planning and perpetrating the crime, which constitutes a  diplomatic problem demanding an extraordinary solution.  Lebanon's security must be safeguarded against all physical  liquidations that take place on its territory to enable it to  prepare the people to confront the Jewish enemy. But why sever  relations between Lebanon and Iraq? Some time ago we heard from  the Lebanese Industrialists Association; trade union officials;  and political, financial, military, and press figures that they  believe that the only useful, practical response to the  Gaza-Jericho agreement is the establishment of a  Lebanese-Syrian-Jordanian-Iraqi common market and  political-economic-military-cultural coordination. This could  save our people in Palestine from being swallowed by the Jewish  state and could be a force that would stand in the face of the  Jewish Satan and those behind him.    Our vital interests, which affect our future and social  existence in greater Syria, have been undermined and no longer  have any value because of the blood of one individual. It is  being said that no individual, no matter how prominent he may  be, should be more important than society and that his death is  no reason for killing the future of that society.    Will severing its relations with Iraq make Lebanon grow  stronger and more united, strengthen its economy, and reinforce  its political and military position or will the establishment of  Lebanese-Syrian- Jordanian-Iraqi-Palestinian working committees  that will make plans, not statements, and implement them achieve  these goals?    We are compelled to make a comparison between the Lebanese  official position toward Iraq and its position toward the Jewish  state. Lebanon should immediately break off negotiations with  the Jewish enemy, negotiations that will lead to the  establishment of diplomatic relations. The Israelis recently  shelled Sidon and killed some of its citizens. Before that,  they masterminded the explosion in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church  through their agents and were about to rekindle the war in  Lebanon. They killed our citizens. [passage omitted]    Why hasn't Lebanon broken off negotiations with the Jewish  state, which is responsible for killing tens and even hundreds  of Lebanese citizens on Lebanese territory since the beginning  of the capitulation negotiations, but broke off relations with  Iraq who killed--in the view of the Lebanese state--an Iraqi  citizen on the same territory?    We never knew that the Jewish state was closer to Lebanon  than Iraq. We never knew that the patience of the Lebanese was  exhausted toward a brother but not toward the Jews. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): PC and fax avoid traffic jams More than 50 per cent of faxed documents are prepared on a computer, but most are printed before they can be faxed. The alternative - to put a fax board inside the PC - means other documents cannot be sent while the computer is faxing, and the power has to be left on to receive faxes outside office hours. Japanese fax specialist Muratec has teamed up with software company Wordcraft International to produce a plain paper fax machine that sits next to the PC and enables faxes to be sent from both. Incoming faxes can either be printed out or stored and displayed on the PC. Muratec: UK, 0737 780178.</p>

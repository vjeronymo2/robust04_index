			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Not yet first choice for fashion - The image problems facing House of Fraser SHOPPERS VISITING stores such as Rackhams, Army &amp; Navy and Dickins and Jones may never realise they are shopping in a House of Fraser shop - unless they happen to notice the group logo on the carrier bag. After House of Fraser's eight years as a private company owned by the Fayed brothers, the investment community may be similarly unaware of the full extent of its retail empire. Overcoming the City's scepticism and ignorance is one of the biggest tasks the group faces before its flotation next year. Although the department stores have effectively been run as a separate business, in spite of the presence of Mr Ali Fayed as chairman, they have often been swallowed up in the publicity surrounding the Fayeds and the flagship Harrods store. No 1980s takeover battle was more ruthlessly fought than that for House of Fraser, pitting the Fayed bothers, Mohamed and Ali, against Mr Tiny Rowland and his Lonrho trading conglomerate. 'One cannot deny that there is in some quarters a credibility problem,' admits Mr Brian McGowan, the man brought in to replace Mr Fayed as non-executive chairman and to prepare the chain for flotation. Mr McGowan, 48, was sufficiently convinced of House of Fraser's strengths to postpone his retirement. One strength, he believes, is its assets base. House of Fraser has 59 stores with total floorspace of almost 5m sq ft. About 90 per cent of the property is freehold - with a value of about Pounds 250m. The chain stretches from Inverness to Plymouth, trading under names such as Rackhams, Dingles, Army &amp; Navy, Dickins and Jones, Binns and Frasers. Mr McGowan believes another strength of the business is that many of the stores are popular and well established retailers with customer loyalty built up over 100 years or more. Moreover, he says, rumours that the company has been starved of cash since it was bought by the Fayeds in 1985 are untrue. Capital investment has been about Pounds 100m over the last five years, and the shape of the chain has changed significantly. In 1985, it had 93 stores. Many smaller, underperforming stores have been closed, while new stores have opened in the Lakeside retail park at Thurrock, at Meadowhall near Sheffield, Leicester and Milton Keynes. The store closure programme means turnover has been relatively static. For the year to January, sales were Pounds 695m, little different from the figures for 1990 or 1988. But operating profits increased from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 36.8m. The company said yesterday that sales up to the end of June were running 7 per cent ahead of last year. Mr Andrew Jennings, House of Fraser's managing director since 1992, says the rationalisation programme is largely complete. While isolated closures may still occur, the company is now left with a core store base, which it can gradually expand, largely through out of town developments. The way forward, he says, is to continue the programme begun last year of cutting costs and repositioning the business as the first-choice destination for fashion clothing and accessories as well as 'fashionable' furniture and housewares. The number of full-time equivalent staff fell from 10,500 people to 8,300 by January 1993, and the ratio of full-time to part-time staff changed from about 60:40 to about 40:60, resulting in a Pounds 6m saving on wage costs. Layers of management have been removed, and new systems are allowing further productivity improvements. Mr Jennings is continuing to look at the product mix, reducing and focusing the range and the number of suppliers. The company has some way to go in making the most of its retailing space. According to a recent report by Verdict, the retail market research company, sales per square foot at House of Fraser stores last year were only Pounds 143, compared with Pounds 195 for the Debenhams chain, and Pounds 408 for the John Lewis Partnership's department stores. However, its operating margin, at 5.3 per cent, was well above Debenhams' 4.0 per cent, although it lagged behind John Lewis's 5.8 per cent. Mr Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the City would remain suspicious of House of Fraser until it had chance to examine the company's figures for the last seven years, and would take a lot of convincing that the chain could look forward to profits growth.</p>

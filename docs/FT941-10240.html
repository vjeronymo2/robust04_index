			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK may increase Eurofighter order to win bigger work quota The Ministry of Defence is considering increasing its order for Eurofighter 2000 combat aircraft from the current figure of 250 to help win the UK a greater share of the production stage of the Pounds 32bn project, a select committee heard yesterday. MoD officials also outlined proposals to replace the 'whole range' of frontline Royal Air Force aircraft - including the Harrier jump jet and the Tornado bomber - with the multipurpose fighter. Giving evidence to the parliamentary defence select committee, MoD officials also revealed that the cost to the UK of developing the Eurofighter, a joint project between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, had risen by another Pounds 450m to Pounds 3.4bn - double the Pounds 1.7bn cost estimate for full development given in 1988. Mr Jack Gordon, the MoD's director general of aircraft, said that the Eurofighter - which is running two years behind schedule - was expected to make its maiden flight in April. Tests and simulated combat modelling had shown that the fighter could outperform all Western or Soviet aircraft except the American F-22 manufactured by Lockheed. 'It is capable of replacing the whole suite of frontline RAF aircraft,' he said. An expansion of the UK order above 250 is likely to lead to intense negotiations between countries about the sharing of the production stage of the project. The 'workshare' quotas of the production stage of the fighter, which starts next year, will be allocated according to the number of aircraft each country orders. As 600 aircraft are planned for production, a UK order in excess of 250 will give the UK strong grounds for arguing that it should receive more than 40 per cent of the work. 'Clearly the more airplanes there are, the more good news for all the partners. The more planes for the RAF, the more work for British industry,' said British Aerospace, which owns 33 per cent of the Eurofighter consortium. Germany, whose Daimler-Benz also owns 33 per cent, has said it will order 140 - but is likely to contest any division which hands the majority of the project work to the UK. In 1992 Germany insisted on cost reductions and specification changes as a condition for continuing with the project.</p>

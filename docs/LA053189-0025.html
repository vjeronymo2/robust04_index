			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SPALDING GRAY'S 'OLD WISE TALES' SPIN MEEKLY  </P> <P> "Everyone has a story," says raconteur Spalding Gray near the end of "Old Wise  Tales" (tonight at 10:30 on Channel 28). So why don't we hear more of them?  </P> <P> We hear snippets of folk wisdom from the group of old-timers Gray found at a  senior center in the Fairfax District, but we hear no particularly engaging  tales. Some of the folk wisdom is phrased colorfully, but much of it is very  bland -- the sort of thoughts that might stray through the head of any  reasonably happy person.  </P> <P> For the most part, these people do seem quite happy, and it's nice to hear that  old age isn't necessarily a bitter pill. But this program doesn't go very far  beyond "nice."  </P> <P> Gray even drags out the cliched question that is perpetually asked centenarians  in small-town newspaper interviews: To what do you attribute your longevity?  Or, as Gray phrased it, "how did you get this far?" The answers are instantly  forgettable.  </P> <P> Perhaps Gray and producer/director Lyn Picallo tried to include too many people  in half an hour; no one has the time to tell a really good story.  </P> <P> Some of the show was shot at the Taper, Too, during Gray's presentation of  "L.A., the Other, Conversations With . . ." there last year. On stage, Gray  limited the number of interview subjects to a maximum of five each night. He  should have followed the same format on television, especially for a 30-minute  slot.  </P> <P> Then again, there just aren't many people who tell a story as well as Gray does  in his own monologues. Compared with his more personal pieces, "Old Wise Tales"  is pure fluff. DON SHIRLEY  </P></p>

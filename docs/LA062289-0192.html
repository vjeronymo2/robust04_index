			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FEDERATED SETTLES LIE-DETECTOR SUIT FOR $12.1 MILLION  </P> <P> Federated Group, a big electronics retailer, has agreed to pay $12.1 million to  settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of applicants or employees who were forced  to take lie-detector tests in order to get or keep a job, lawyers for the  plaintiffs said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The class-action suit, initially brought by four unsuccessful job applicants,  was brought under a 1963 California law that forbids polygraphs as a condition  of employment or continued employment and under a state constitutional  guarantee of the right to privacy.  </P> <P> The settlement, believed to be the largest involving polygraph testing, is  expected to be shared by as many as 12,000 Californians who worked for or  applied to Federated Group since 1983. The amount each receives will depend on  a review of individual cases.  </P> <P> Lawyers said the case probably will not set a legal precedent because it was  settled without a verdict. It also will probably not have widespread  ramifications for lie-detector testing because federal law bans the use of  polygraphs in private employment situations, except in very specific and narrow  circumstances.  </P> <P> However, the settlement does raise the possibility that employees or job  applicants in California will now challenge as invasions of privacy the  so-called honesty and psychological tests that employers are increasingly  turning to in the wake of a federal ban on polygraphs, which went into effect  last December.  </P> <P> "We think psychological tests are much more intrusive and personal. The only  difference is that they don't strap you to a machine," said Brad Seligman, an  Oakland attorney who represented the Federated plaintiffs.  </P> <P> Seligman said his law firm is close to filing a suit that will challenge a  psychological test used in an employment situation.  </P> <P> "It will be the first major psychological test case in California under the  constitutional provision," he said.  </P> <P> The lawyer claimed that employers have "gone too far in their hysteria over  imagined and real problems."  </P> <P> "They are trying to buy security, but they are also degrading their employees,"  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought Jobs  </P> <P> The Federated suit was filed in November, 1987, by Joanna Mest of Berkeley,  Scott Vogel of Danville, Cynthia Marques of Santa Clara and Miriam Milgrom of  Los Angeles. All had sought jobs as sales representatives or cashiers with  Federated, which is based in City of Commerce and has stores throughout the  state.  </P> <P> Two of the four were told that they failed the test, and two refused to answer  personal questions, Seligman said. Questions included whether they had ever  received psychological counseling, he added.  </P> <P> The settlement must still be approved by Alameda County Superior Court Judge  Demetrios Agretelis. Seligman last year won a settlement in a similar  California case against Fort Worth, Tex.-based Color Tile, which agreed to pay  $750 to $28,000 each to as many as 3,000 California employees and job  applicants.  </P> <P> Seligman said the Federated settlement includes a provision under which the  company will pay for a toll-free telephone number to help Federated employees  or applicants participate in the settlement.  </P> <P> Federated said it ceased polygraph testing after the company was purchased last  year by Atari, the Sunnyvale-based personal computer and video game company,  for $67.3 million. Federated also suspended other types of written honesty and  psychological tests, spokesman Greg Pratt said. He declined to comment on why  the company chose to settle the lawsuit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Written Tests  </P> <P> Chances are there will be a number of lawsuits challenging written tests under  the privacy provision, said William Gould, a Stanford University law professor  who specializes in labor and employment law.  </P> <P> "The form of the test is not relevant," he said.  </P> <P> However, Gould said, the success of such challenges will depend on the specific  tests challenged and how invasive the questions are.  </P> <P> California courts have given very little guidance on the privacy issue in  employment cases, said Nancy Abell, who represents employers in labor issues at  the Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker law firm in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The case that will most likely give judicial guidance, she said, is a challenge  to pre-employment drug screening at Matthew Bender, a unit of Los Angeles-based  Times Mirror Co., which also owns the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> Bender applicants won a verdict in that case seeking to halt the drug tests,  but it was overturned on appeal by Times Mirror. The state Supreme Court is  considering an appeal by the plaintiffs.  </P> <P> "I believe this case will be very instructive. The issue will largely turn on  what is the extent of a job applicant's right of privacy when the applicant  knows what the conditions of employment are and has a choice of whether to  apply for the job," Abell said.  </P></p>

In the course of their conversation the parties discussed  issues related to regulation of transport communications'  functioning in Transcaucasia and, in particular, in Azerbaijan.    Aliyev pointed out that aggression being waged by Armenia  against the republic seriously affects normal functioning of  transport and energy communications in Azerbaijan.    The president reported that at present almost the whole  section of the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia is a  battlefield and it is very difficult to restore normal  functioning of the communications in this zone.    Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Cabinet of Ministers told Interfax  that Baku had declined a proposal to organize a meeting of  Transcaucasian states' vice premiers on the border of three  countries to discuss security of the gas-main laid via Georgia's  territory to Armenia. In 1993 this gas-main was subjected to  numerous explosions on the territory of Georgia's Marneul region  which is predominantly inhabited by the Azerbaijanis. The last  explosion occurred on December 18.    Azerbaijan explained its rejection to participate in this  meeting by the fact that it has nothing to do with these  subversive acts.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Kunick raises Pounds 5.6m from Dungeons sale KUNICK, the amusement machine and nursing home group, yesterday released its second profits warning in less than six months and said that it was selling the London and York Dungeons for Pounds 5.6m. The company blamed the recessions in the UK and France, which had been longer than expected. It said first half profits to end-March would be 'substantially below' the Pounds 7.3m last time. The shares, which traded at 36p before the first profits warning in October, fell a further 2p to 9p. UK amusement machine business continued to be hit by the economic downturn and uncertainty following the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on beer supply, the company said. Kunick has previously estimated that between 10,000 to 15,000 pubs have ceased trading during the recession. Mr Russell Smith, chairman, said care services were performing satisfactorily, except for sale and rental of close care and sheltered housing units which continued to be affected by the state of the housing market. He added that it was impossible to predict group trading levels in the second half of this year. Kunick plans a further review of operations and will reduce borrowings through the sale of The London Dungeon and The York Dungeon tourist sites for Pounds 5.6m to Winchmore. Winchmore is itself being restructured following the resignation of the existing management and the appointment of Mr David Hudd, a non-executive director of Kunick, as chairman. Winchmore will pay for the acquisition through a placing of 17.9m new shares at 40p to raise Pounds 6.8m. The company also plans to change its name to Vardon. The London Dungeon attracted 434,000 visitors in the year to end-September, down from about 500,000 the previous year, with 123,000 visitors at York. The two sites made trading profits of Pounds 1.26m from turnover of Pounds 2.22m during the period.</p>

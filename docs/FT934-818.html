			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (7): Eager to sell green advice - Andrew Jack asks whether consultants are worth the money As the number of environmental consultants continues to expand rapidly, so a growing number of existing and prospective clients are asking an awkward question: are they really worth the money? Firms around the country are eagerly cashing in on the potential to sell environmental management systems, green reporting advice and other forms of expertise to businesses under legal and commercial pressure for reform. The environmental consulting sector has itself begun to recognise the wide variation in the quality that it delivers, and has started to address the concerns with at least two accreditation schemes. But as one former senior executive at a large environmental firm says: 'The consultancy business has grown far faster than the work. There are 700 firms all scrambling around for business, and they are all finding it very tough. Profits are down.' 'Environmental measures cost money; they do not save money,' he says. 'Once you've got beyond the public relations froth about creating an improved image, it costs . . .' If environmental management systems are genuinely so worthwhile, say the critics, why have companies not implemented them already? Mr Jeremy Barrett of Environmental Data Services (ENDS), a London-based environmental research company, argues that companies lack the expertise, and are only gradually becoming aware of the benefits that management systems can bring. 'There is huge hypocrisy in the criticism,' he says. 'There are a lot of bad consultants, but there are many who have also saved companies stacks of money.' On one hand, there is a growing cadre of environmental managers being hired directly by companies in response to a variety of external pressures, which arguably might dispense with the need for so many consultants. On the other hand, many are ill-prepared for the job, and may seek out outside help more than ever in the past. A survey of 210 such managers by Ends, published last month* suggests that not only are numbers growing, but their role is changing from in-house policeman into people 'adding value' to their companies by savings through environmental practices in areas such as waste minimisation. Yet it also highlighted the fact that only 39 per cent had any environmental content in their basic education, and the vast majority learnt merely by attending conferences from time to time. The survey showed that just 14 per cent of respondents did not use external consultants periodically. For two-fifths, the reason for bringing in outside help was the greater skills of the adviser for one-off advice. One eighth said the reason was lack of resources or time to do the job internally. However, it admitted that 'adverse views about consultants were not uncommon' in its questionnaire responses. Typical comments included: 'Everybody has got to earn a living but consultants are awful and we would only use them in very particular circumstances'; 'They tell you what you know, or should know, and give it to you in a glossy package'; 'Some consultants I would not have as a gift'. The survey is critical of these remarks, pointing to projects where there have been cost savings, and demonstrating that demand for consultants is likely to grow sharply in the future. Mr Tony Bishop, manager, environment services at PA Consulting, says: 'The cynical view is that an awful lot of companies are having a go at it for themselves and not getting any results. This area is new and it's difficult. Managers cannot buy this knowledge off the shelf.' 'There are a lot of consultants who have not delivered anything. I don't think any consultancy appears cheap. It has to be justified very carefully. People are more and more asking for tangible, direct, bottom line benefits.' He adds that there is a glut of technical competence, when consultancy is far more about communication and the ability to persuade companies to implement change. 'Otherwise you end up with a fat report that no-one can use,' he says. That is one reason why PA Consulting has developed its own simplified version of an environmental management system, known as managing environmental performance. It uses a series of 'site environmental fingerprints' to develop measures and future plans. It can be used as the basis for BS 7750, the environmental management standard, but without the cost and formality - which many companies can do without. Mr Mike Samuel, environment affairs manager at Sainsbury, the high street retailer, believes he has obtained good value from the external advisers his company uses because he knows their limitations. 'I tend to look at consultants as providers of information,' he says. 'They help us ask the basic questions: whether we are, what should we be trying to achieve, the sorts of outputs to get there.' 'The actual work is something you've got to do yourself. We have always tended to keep things in-house until we feel we don't know what to do, and then we use them.' He defends the need for green consultants, particularly for their broad knowledge of the issues and how companies are responding to them. 'The environment is one of those things that creeps up on you,' he says. 'An organisation often has difficulty seeing the wood for the trees and asking what it is actually trying to achieve.' He emphasises several points in getting the best value from environmental - as with other sorts of - consultants: Make sure the people pitching for the job are the ones who will be doing the work. Be sure to specify exactly what the consultants will achieve, and have it written into the contract. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Be realistic and ensure the recommendations made can be implemented. *Environmental Managers in Business. Pounds 35.

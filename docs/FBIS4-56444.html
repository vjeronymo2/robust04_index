			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 3 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Today,  Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman said the  Guatemalan Government is interested in resuming the stalled  negotiations on the more than 150-year-old territorial dispute  between Belize and Guatemala.    The negotiations were interrupted in the aftermath of the  failed 26 May 1993 coup d'etat by former President Jorge  Serrano, who recognized the Belizean state, a British colony  until 1981, for the first time in Guatemalan history and  established diplomatic relations. President Ramiro de Leon  Carpio upheld the Serrano's decision (1991-93), although many  political sectors and citizens have demanded he change his  position.    Today, Minister Vielman told foreign correspondents the  following: "As the executive branch, we have no jurisdiction" in  recognizing Belize as an independent state. She failed to say,  however, whose jurisdiction such a decision would fall under.    She pointed out that the "Belize Council," a new council  comprising lawyers and other experts on the subject, must deal  with this issue. The council, which will serve an advisory  role, will revise the previous legislation and will recommend to  the government what to do next. The Belize Council, whose  appointment will be announced next week, will make  recommendations that will be reviewed by the executive branch  "in accordance with foreign policies before acting upon them."    The foreign minister insisted this is a legal conflict, but  said she trusts the territorial dispute will have a negotiated  solution and avoid arbitration within the international courts.

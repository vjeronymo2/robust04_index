			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / International Company News: Siemens to take control of Skoda transport unit SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, has increased its investment in Czechoslovakia by agreeing to take control of the transport division of Skoda, Pilsen, the country's largest engineering company. The deal, under which Siemens will acquire 51 per cent of Skoda's transport business, is valued at Dollars 105m, according to the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, which advises the Czech company. The transport divisions of Krauss-Maffei and Krupp of Germany - Siemens has a 25 per cent stake in both companies - will also take an undisclosed portion of Siemens' holding. Four weeks ago, Siemens won the race for control of Skoda, Pilsen's energy division, valued at Dollars 170m, beating Westinghouse of the US and Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish concern. For both ventures, Siemens has offered its Czech partners guarantees to maintain employment and retain research and marketing facilities. Siemens said it would start operating with the 3,500 employees in Skoda's transport division, some 90 per cent of whom are working on contracts to supply the former Soviet Union with electric locomotives. Siemens said its first priority would be to retain this market. The joint venture also plans to make suburban trains and underground railway carriages, said Mr Ladislav Novotny, general manager of Skoda, Pilsen. Siemens will use Skoda to help it fulfil its growing order book. In the financial year to end-September 1991, orders for the German group's transport division, expanded by the acquisition of the Duewag rail wagon manufacturer, rose by 70 per cent to DM3bn (Dollars 1.8bn).</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Company News: Shell Transport and Trading and Royal Dutch Shell - Other Companies Interim figures for the oil major are due on Thursday. Analysts say the presence of a number of exceptional items in the figures make it difficult to assess the underlying trend in profits. But most expect modest growth, with replacement cost profits of around Pounds 800m. The figures are likely to show that Shell has suffered particularly badly from a downturn in refining margins in Asia, where it has a strong presence.</p>

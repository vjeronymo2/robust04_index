			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Investors weigh network's returns: Charles Batchelor looks at Railtrack's pros and cons for those tempted by the planned flotation The stock market flotation of Railtrack - the company running British Rail's track, signalling and stations - represents for the government the logical way of imposing financial discipline on the railway. Railtrack will charge a commercial rate to the train operators who may thus be persuaded to weigh carefully the costs of running marginal services. The government's critics feel this has simply created a railway infrastructure monopoly and means that train operators no longer have direct control over their main costs. But these broader arguments will only be of indirect relevance for the City. Investors will be interested in whether Railtrack can manage effectively the myriad of contracts it will sign with train operators, its suppliers and the companies which will maintain the railway. They will be concerned that the break-up of the railway does not impose excessive costs and a layer of bureaucracy which renders the whole exercise uneconomic. Investors will be asked to buy into a new company with just over 10,000 miles of route, 23,000 miles of track (because most routes have at least dual tracks), nearly 2,500 stations and associated signalling systems. The Treasury has put a value of Pounds 6.5bn on these assets using the 'modern equivalent asset value' method common in transport undertakings. The real market value of Railtrack has been estimated at between Pounds 3.3bn and Pounds 4.3bn by brokers Kleinwort Benson, but other observers think even this is too high. The Treasury has also set Railtrack a target for its return on assets of 5.1 per cent, rising in annual increments to 8 per cent in year four. Railtrack will presumably attempt to beat these targets in the private sector - but it will have to contend with the rail regulator, Mr John Swift, who is keen to see it does not exploit its monopoly position. Mr Swift is still reviewing the question of access charges to the track, but he expects to announce his findings shortly, and in a second policy statement due in April. Until December 1996 he is obliged to accept the guidance of Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary - but Mr Swift has already revealed a determination to curb Railtrack's monopoly powers. The real significance of the physical assets is the cost to Railtrack of maintaining them. In spite of the fact that its cupboard includes 90,000 bridges and several hundred listed buildings, relatively few will require complete replacement within the framework of any business plan. Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, has said he plans to reduce his annual maintenance bill of about Pounds 1.8bn. BR's maintenance and track renewal companies are to be privatised and work will also be offered to other outside contractors. Railtrack is already accepting bids from maintenance companies in other regions in preference to the 'local' company. Track maintenance costs could be cut from Pounds 10,000 a mile to Pounds 7,000 a mile annually, according to one independent estimate. In addition to maintaining the existing railway, Mr Horton has committed himself to spending Pounds 550m on new projects this year, rising to Pounds 750m in 1996-97. Apart from Railtrack's own budget, it plans to bring in private-sector contributions to large projects such as the Pounds 500m-Pounds 600m upgrading of the main West Coast line. Projects such as this are hugely expensive, but can generate significant cost savings, for example by computerising signalling systems, and by attracting new customers to fast, modern trains. On the revenue side of the company's profit and loss account are the charges the 25 train operating companies and freight groups will pay. Passenger train access charges have been set at Pounds 2.2bn in year one with most of this to be met by Treasury subsidy. There will inevitably be pressure in future to reduce this sum although Mr Roger Salmon, the director responsible for selling train operating franchises, believes he has as firm a commitment as can be expected from the Treasury to maintain subsidies. Nevertheless Railtrack and the train operators will have to respond by improving efficiency, reducing costs and attracting more passengers. In addition to the access revenues, Railtrack will be attempting to increase the Pounds 142m it earns in rent from its Pounds 2bn property portfolio. Under BR management some of the larger modernised stations, such as London's Liverpool Street and Victoria, have already become retail centres. Rail enthusiasts may feel that activities such as this represent a distraction from the the main business of running a railway. But investors will see it as the exploitation of legitimate business opportunities which they will expect Railtrack to expand.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Railtrack's miles of assets  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Track  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Route miles open for traffic                           10,270 miles Passenger and freight                                   7,839 miles Passenger only                                          1,057 miles Freight only                                            1,374 miles Proportion of network electrified                  almost one third  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Stations  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total number of passenger stations                            2,482 Stations opened or reopened since 1965                          240 Signal boxes and control centres at April 1994                1,160  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bridges and tunnels  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Railtrack will be responsible for 984 tunnels and some 90,000 bridges.

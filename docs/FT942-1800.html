			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Isuzu omits payout as sales suffer Isuzu, the Japanese truck and bus maker, yesterday announced a Y6.3bn (Dollars 61.8m) pre-tax loss at the parent level for the half-year ended April. It passed its interim dividend. The loss compares with a deficit of Y8.4bn in the same six-month period a year ago, and was made on sales 6 per cent lower at Y541.5bn. Isuzu, which is 37 per cent owned by General Motors, the biggest US carmaker, blamed the disappointing performance on weak markets and the strength of the yen. Domestic sales, battered by the slump in the Japanese market, fell 6.4 per cent. Overseas sales plunged 25 per cent, largely as a result of weak demand and the decision by Isuzu to terminate passenger car production outside Japan. Total unit sales declined as a result, by 19.5 per cent. Isuzu has been cutting costs through increased procurement overseas, improved productivity and restructuring. On the brighter side, sales of components for overseas production rose during the period.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Bond sell-off provides cue The sell-off in bond markets by panicking hedge funds last week determined the performance of global equity markets. Most European centres finished the week lower, with the sharpest falls seen in Italy, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands. Hong Kong also continued its bumpy ride, although a strong performance by the heavily weighted Japanese market left the FT-Actuaries World index little changed on the week. The consensus among most economists yesterday, even before the Bundesbank offered variable rate repos, which hold out the prospect of lower money market rates, was that the shake-out in bond markets was likely to prove temporary and that European interest rates would resume their downward momentum in the not too distant future. Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers is among those remaining optimistic about the outlook for European shares. But he notes that the latest change of mood is likely to continue until the downtrend in the US bond market stabilises or European bond and stock markets decouple from the trend in US markets. 'Further substantial declines in European short-term interest rates, led by the Bundesbank, will push stock markets higher later this year,' he says. 'Steepening yield curves will also boost inflows of cash into mutual funds. If US liquidity is repatriated as a result of the rising trend in Fed funds, domestic liquidity in Europe is likely to replace it.' Hoare Govett sees no reason why bond yields in the US should dictate the trend in Europe, where economic circumstances are entirely different. The broker notes that the European economic cycle is some 18 months to two years behind that in the US; and in Europe output has barely stabilised after its earlier sharp falls, while the US economy has been growing strongly for around two years. 'In Europe inflationary pressures are still abating, while in the US the first hint of an upturn in inflation is beginning to emerge. Moreover . . . European monetary and fiscal policy settings are extremely restrictive for the current stage of the economic cycle, while US monetary policy is lax. This leads us to suppose the trough of the inflation cycle will be much lower in Europe than it was in the US.' Merrill Lynch notes that signs of a resurgence of inflation are noticeable by their absence in Europe, and its economists believe that bond yields in Europe can continue to fall even if yields rise further in the US. It adds that valuations suggest that equity markets can continue to rise even if bond yields do go up. 'Bond yields are not the only determinant of equity prices; dividend growth also matters. To the extent that higher bond yields reflect faster economic growth, they are likely to be accompanied by strong profits and dividend growth.' Merrill Lynch comments that the impact on equities is the result of a trade-off between these two factors. 'We use the framework of the yield ratio to examine this trade-off. We conclude that if the global economic recovery is as strong as we expect, then we could experience rapid dividend growth, rising bond yields and rising equity markets in Europe over the next three years.' NatWest Markets agrees that the bull market, particularly for equities, is not yet over. 'Admittedly, the risks have increased, especially if the US long bond pushed decisively above 7 per cent. But in our view, the US bond market fears are overdone.' It says history demonstrates that after long periods of falling rates the first rise in the Fed Funds rate does not precipitate a bear market. The key issue for equities and bonds is the schedule for further interest rate increases. 'We expect global stock and bond markets to move higher in the months ahead and provide us with a better opportunity to raise cash.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change       in US                % change in local currency**       sterling**   Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of    Start of    Start of                                           1993        1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +0.54    -2.81   +35.13   +42.61       +36.77     +34.63 Belgium      -2.07    -2.29   +22.64   +32.12       +27.07     +25.08 Denmark      -1.95    -0.82   +41.28   +53.91       +46.77     +44.48 Finland      -2.99    -1.32   +94.03  +123.15      +114.38    +111.03 France       -1.94    -4.67   +18.56   +25.86       +21.71     +19.81 Germany      -3.13    -2.80   +23.29   +33.36       +28.64     +26.63 Ireland      -3.48    -5.87   +45.80   +58.55       +41.88     +39.66 Italy        -4.68    +1.02   +31.65   +54.17       +37.48     +35.32 Netherlands  -3.06    -3.98   +29.78   +38.44       +33.52     +31.43 Norway       +1.20    +0.95   +55.39   +58.74       +50.67     +48.31 Spain        -2.98    -5.33   +41.37   +52.63       +27.56     +25.56 Sweden       -2.06    -1.26   +43.35   +50.05       +34.91     +32.80 Switzerland  -2.87    -6.30   +43.27   +43.28       +49.48     +47.15 UK           -2.83    -4.54   +17.86   +18.17       +18.17     +16.32  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE       -2.79    -3.97   +24.87   +29.93       +26.60     +24.63 Australia    -3.28    -4.80   +28.77   +33.13       +41.70     +39.48 Hong Kong    -7.16   -12.94   +62.12   +83.07       +86.18     +83.27 Japan        +3.34    +5.29   +25.99   +23.18       +49.18     +46.84 Malaysia     +5.22    +7.40  +100.95  +112.53      +107.12    +103.88 New Zealand  -2.93    -6.07   +41.77   +45.23       +65.64     +63.07 Singapore    +0.11    +0.35   +49.40   +57.34       +65.69     +63.11 Canada       -0.03    -2.78   +20.37   +23.02       +17.66     +15.82 USA          -0.28    -2.60    +5.00    +6.50        +8.19      +6.50 Mexico       -6.83    -4.41   +67.54   +43.60       +42.01     +39.79 South Africa -2.07    +1.61   +47.36   +55.43       +62.76      +60.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -0.16    -1.01   +18.13   +19.67       +26.52      +24.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on February 25th 1994.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, and NatWest Securities Limited.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

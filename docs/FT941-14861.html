			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: AMP lifts income to ADollars 8bn The Australian Mutual Provident Society, one of Australia's largest institutions and owner of the Pearl and London Life, UK life offices, said yesterday premium income increased by only a small amount in 1993, to about ADollars 8bn (USDollars 5.3m). However, this masks a 4 per cent fall in premiums and new savings in Australia, to about ADollars 3.8bn, while the two UK life offices saw a 10 per cent increase, to ADollars 3.2bn. Premiums and new savings income from New Zealand-based operations declined, by 8 per cent to ADollars 602m, writes Nikki Tait. The AMP, which will not release full results for 1993 until April, said the declines in Australia and New Zealand reflected 'the impact of the recession on consumers who were less willing to enter into long-term financial commitments'. The institution, which has seen its once-commanding position in the Australian fund management business come under competitive attack, added that annual operating costs had been cut by about ADollars 200m, and were 'moving steadily towards becoming a broader-based worldwide insurance and saving organisation'.</p>

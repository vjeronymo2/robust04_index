[passage omitted]    Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov "maneuvered" with the  topic he was offered, and made an "European journey" on the  topical issues called the "Bermuda Triangle" -- relations  between the supreme commander-in-chief, the defense minister,  and the chief of the General Staff. According to him, at  present the issue has been placed upon a legal foundation and  practically resolved to a large degree. Personal ambitions and  party interests occasionally produce sparks, which also affect  the so-called triangle.    Minister Aleksandrov made an historical review of the issue  and pointed out attempts to resolve it at the beginning of the  century in Germany, Austro-Hungary, and Russia, and analyze the  present situation in many Eastern and Western European  countries. Until recently, a merging between a certain party  and the army leadership was evident in the former states of the  Warsaw Pact. The minister of defense said that this is the  situation even today in some democratic countries. Colleagues  in Germany, Austria, and France are also party members.  However, this was dangerous at our state of democratic  development, because if a member of any political party becomes  the minister of defense, this could cause a politicization of  the army.    In the United States, the President is also the supreme  commander-in-chief and prime minister. The U.S. secretary of  defense is a coordinating official, while the chairman of the  United Chiefs of Staffs has direct access to the supreme  commander-in- chief. This is a very good model for the  developing democracies.    However, there is another model -- the Latin American one --  the defense minister said. There, the head of the General Staff  could organize a coup whenever he wanted. Fortunately, we are  far away from this model.    Minister Aleksandrov said that the president would find it  very difficult to be the supreme commander-in-chief in times of  a war if he was not a military expert. Therefore, in the case  of war the General Staff should have broader prerogatives.    According to the minister of defense, the issue of the  General Staff chief also co-signing ministerial orders was  artificially fanned. After all, the General Staff knows the  army and its officers best.    Army Gen. Lyuben Petrov, chief of the Bulgarian Army General  Staff, greeted the idea of the Center on Training National  Security Cadres to organize a seminar for the journalists. He  assured the journalists that, at present, there were no problems  between the defense minister and the General Staff chief.  However, this must be incorporated in a law, because there was  no guarantee that if today the things in this sphere are well,  the situation would remain the same tomorrow, when the  circumstances and the persons involved change.    Army Gen. Petrov outlined some challenges of our foreign  policy, and certain risk factors related to the complex  military-political situation in the Balkans. Among them he  listed the imbalance between troops, arms, and military  equipment that exists in the peninsula, the ethnic and religious  conflicts, the crime rate, the drug traffic, and so on. He  stressed that the military security guarantees will play an  important role despite the political efforts to guarantee the  stability.    The military doctrine is a system of fundamental views  related to preventing military conflicts and defending the  country that have been officially accepted, Army Gen. Petrov  continued. It was developed during the last year and subjected  to many discussions. A theoretical conference on the military  doctrine has been conducted. The Supreme Military Council and  the General Staff Military Council reviewed the doctrine. After  certain corrections were inserted by the Council of Ministers,  the doctrine was ready, and it will be submitted to the National  Assembly.    The military doctrine is the conceptual foundation of both  the military policy of our state institutions and the activity  of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff regarding the  armed forces' construction, training, and strategic use. The  military doctrine is the foundation of the activity of the state  leadership and the armed forces in guaranteeing the country's  security. It is an open system and could be amended in  accordance with the changes in the military-political situation  and the strategic concepts of the state leadership, the chief of  the Bulgarian Army General Staff said in conclusion.</p>

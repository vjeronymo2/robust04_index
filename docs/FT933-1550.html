			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Thorn EMI falls on fears of US rental curb SHARES in Thorn EMI fell 11p to 977p yesterday on fears that profits could be hit by possible US legislation aimed at curbing the behaviour of staff at its American rental subsidiary. The possibility of US legislation on the rental of white goods, furniture and jewellery was raised by a report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal alleging that Thorn employees used intimidatory tactics when carrying out repossessions. Thorn EMI, whose interests include music and electronics, said last night that the claims would be investigated. It added: 'Thorn EMI is in discussion with its US management about the allegations, which are being taken seriously.' Another contention was that customers taking advantage of rent-to-own offers at Thorn's Rent-A-Center stores in the US ended up paying far more for goods than if they had bought them at the retail price. The report was largely based on evidence from former employees, some of whom had been dismissed by the group. Some analysts defended Thorn, saying the US rental business provided an opportunity for poor consumers, with no credit rating, to acquire goods such as television sets, refrigerators and jewellery. One analyst said it was not surprising that a rental business operating in depressed areas of the US resorted to rough tactics for repossessions. Several analysts said, however, that the publicity could only harm the group and that legislation aimed at curbing the rent-to-own sector could damage Thorn's profits. Rental provided Thorn with 30 per cent of its Pounds 379.3m operating profit in the year to March 31. The company is believed to have earned about 40 per cent of its rental operating profit in the US. Analysts are worried by reports that Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House of Representatives Banking Committee, intends to introduce a bill next week classifying rent-to-own arrangements as credit sales. This could limit the credit Thorn's US rental business could charge. The committee, however, has been preoccupied with consumer protection against insurance companies and it is unclear how quickly the rent-to-own bill might move forward. Mr Hamish Dickson, an analyst at Hoare Govett, said he did not think the chances of federal legislation on rental were high. But, if legislation were introduced, 'my suspicion is that it would make it difficult to run the business'.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The gilts market is whipping itself into a frenzy of anticipation about a change to the full funding rule in the Budget. Today sees yet another recommendation to that effect, this time from Midland Montagu. At this rate the market will be very disappointed if Mr Lamont does not oblige. That must be doubly irksome to the Treasury. The main advantage of conceding the change would not have been immediate sales of gilts to banks: the yield curve is not nearly steep enough to tempt them and even Treasury bills are too expensive. But the authorities would have derived tactical gain by announcing the change as a surprise. They could then have funded aggressively into a rising market. Indeed, if Mr Lamont can pull something out of the hat to make the market feel good, this would still be a sensible Budget day strategy. Tax concessions to retail buyers of gilts would help, as would a downward revision of the PSBR. More effective would be a foreign currency borrowing programme. That would be controversial but it makes more sense to borrow abroad with sterling at DM2.33 than it did to defend a higher parity within the ERM.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> TRANSPLANT DOCTOR ON THE MEND  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas Starzl was expected to be back seeing patients this week after  undergoing coronary surgery in the hospital he helped make famous for  innovative transplants.  </P> <P> The 64-year-old surgeon was released today from Presbyterian-University  Hospital, where doctors removed a blockage from his right coronary artery.  </P> <P> Starzl, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant at the  University of Colorado in 1967, was admitted to the hospital Sunday with chest  pains.  </P> <P> Starzl's physician, Dr. Bruce Wilson, ordered an angioplasty, in which a  catheter was put into the artery and used to inflate a tiny balloon to clear a  blockage.  </P> <P> "He's doing quite well," Wilson, director of the University of Pittsburgh's  Heart Institute, said at a news conference. "We expect a speedy recovery."  </P> <P> Starzl has worked since 1981 at the University of Pittsburgh hospital, which  last year performed 463 liver transplants and 210 kidney transplants.  </P></p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Disappointing start for Court Cavendish Shares in Court Cavendish, the UK nursing home operator, ended the first day of trading at 207p compared with an issue price of 225p. The company's flotation is the first in a recent spate of nursing home listings to disappoint the market. The offer was more than twice oversubscribed and applications were scaled down. One analyst said last week's announcement of a Pounds 33.3m placing and open offer by rival operator CrestaCare had weakened demand for the stock.</p>

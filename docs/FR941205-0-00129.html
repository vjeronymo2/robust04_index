			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is also approving a new method, the Colisure test, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simultaneously determining the presence of total coliforms and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  both of which must be monitored under the Total Coliform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule (40 CFR 141.21). Data supporting the use of this method was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented in the notice of July 14, 1994 (NOA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most commenters supported approval of the Colisure test, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several raised questions about the test, primarily concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incubation time. They cited the Broadway et al. (1992) data that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that only 64% and 69% of the bottles were total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coliform-positive and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -positive, respectively, after 24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours compared to the 48-hour results. According to the Broadway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> et al. data, 85% and 88% of the bottles were total coliform-positive and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. coli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -positive, respectively, after 28 hours compared to the 48-hour results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with the commenters who contended that 24 hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of incubation was insufficient for the Colisure test. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency, however, believes that the recovery rate after 28 hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is reasonable, and will approve the Colisure test as a 28-hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test. Moreover, based on additional data from the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer showing that the false-positive rate after 48 hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is small, EPA will allow laboratories to hold the test up to 48  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours before observing results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Chemical Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were only minor comments on the proposal to update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemistry methods to the versions contained in the 18th edition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Standard Methods. The 18th edition versions contain no or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor changes to earlier versions, and EPA received no comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to document specific hardships in converting to 18th edition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical methods. Several commenters noted that, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thallium is not in the scope of SM 3113B, EPA erroneously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved SM 3113B for thallium (57 FR 31840, July 17, 1992). EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees and will delete this approval in today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter noted that the 18th edition version of SM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;G omits instructions that would allow measurement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total residual chlorine in drinking water samples using a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colorimetric method. The Standard Methods Committee has written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Eaton, 1993b) that an editorial omission, not a technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change, occurred in recent versions of SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;G. The error  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be corrected in the next (19th) edition of Standard Methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA corrects the error today by describing the omitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Methods To Be Withdrawn and Replaced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> General Comments Received on Withdrawal of Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that all methods carry a ``draft''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status for three years after publication; other commenters asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA to approve new methods more quickly. It would defeat EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent to provide modern technology quickly, if a method had to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be published, proposed, and then kept in draft status for three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. EPA balances this problem by allowing optional use of old  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or new methods during a transitional period, which in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule extends to July 1, 1996 (or 18 months after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication, whichever is later).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters believed EPA was eliminating, or intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to eliminate, all autoanalyzer or colorimetric methods. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorrect; EPA is replacing only obsolete methods with equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASTM, EPA and Standard Methods. EPA is not eliminating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colorimetric or autoanalyzer technology for any regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminant, except arsenic. Evidence of EPA's intent is in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993 methods manual (EPA, 1993a), which updated colorimetric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods for cyanide (335.4), nitrite and nitrate (353.2), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate (375.2). EPA has and continues to approve autoanalyzer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and colorimetric ASTM and Standard Methods for cyanide, fluoride,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitrite, nitrate and sulfate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters stated that changing from EPA methods to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent Standard Methods and ASTM methods would be very time-consuming and expensive, but provided no specific information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support this statement. EPA is withdrawing methods that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incomplete and often require users to rely on the equivalent ASTM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or Standard Methods. Thus the change, in many cases, has already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken place. In other cases, there are very minor differences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the withdrawn and the replacement methods. EPA notes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that laboratories may continue to use a withdrawn method for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than compliance monitoring samples. EPA's actions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule save laboratories money, because they need only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support one version of an ASTM, EPA, or Standard Method. Prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this rule, laboratories were required to use methods in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14th, 16th, 17th, and 18th editions of Standard Methods, and at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least two different versions of EPA Methods 200.7 and 524.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

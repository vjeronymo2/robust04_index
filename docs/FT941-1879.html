			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Italian car parts group drops to L18bn for year Sogefi, Italy's listed car components company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's CIR holding company, yesterday reported net group profits of L18.1bn (Dollars 10.7m) for 1993, down from L33.3bn the previous year, writes John Simkins. The 1992 earnings, however, were boosted by a L19bn extraordinary gain through the sale of Sogefi's stake in the German Boge group to Mannesmann. In 1993 the group made an extraordinary gain of L12.3bn through the sale of the SVAMA distribution subsidiary. Group net borrowings fell from L116.4bn to L38.5bn. The company said a strong presence in the second-hand car market and the fact that its activities were centred both on Europe and the US enabled sales to reach L660.4bn in 1993, against L664.5bn, despite recession in the car industry.</p>

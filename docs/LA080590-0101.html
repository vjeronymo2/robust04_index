			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> Aspiring sand castle architects will get a chance to show off their skills in  two contests this week in the South Bay. If the past is any guide, the fertile  imagination of youngsters will produce a myriad of castles, dragons, mermaids,  dinosaurs, octopuses and sea monsters.  </P> <P> "This year we're expecting to see Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles," said Jim  Graham, an organizer of Redondo Beach's eighth annual Sand Castle &amp; Design  Competition, to be held Thursday. Today, Manhattan Beach sponsors its annual  sand castle contest just south of Manhattan Beach pier, an event coordinated  with the International Surf Contest also taking place this weekend. The sand  castle contest, which begins at 9 a.m., will be divided by age groups, starting  with a category for 5- through 8-year-olds. Teams that include participants of  all ages will also be competing in separate divisions. The Redondo Beach  competition will start at 10 a.m. Thursday at Seaside Lagoon. Children up to  age 14 will compete in free-form and castle-building categories. Although other  contests along the California shoreline often encourage more grandiose projects  -- some even using bulldozers, cranes and backhoes -- the Redondo event is more  in the spirit of an old-fashioned, low-tech family outing, Graham said.  Admission for both contests is free. IAN ROSE  </P></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Generators could face curbs BRITAIN's TWO largest electricity generators could be subjected to price controls or be asked to sell plant after Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, completes a review of their costs and profit margins later this year. Prof Littlechild raised these possibilities yesterday as he announced the results of a preliminary inquiry into why selling prices in the wholesale electricity pool have risen by 20 per cent this year. He indicated these could be alternatives to referring National Power and PowerGen to the Monopolies Commission if he found that they had increased the prices they charge to the electricity wholesale pool excessively. They would be preferable to profit controls, he said. Prof Littlechild said the many electricity customers who had complained about the pool price rises were right to be concerned. 'In a competitive market, customers' interests would be paramount. This is not yet the case in the electricity market.' The generators received average pool revenues which exceeded their avoidable costs. 'The need to cover avoidable costs does not justify any further price increases. Nor did it justify an increase as high as the recent one (since April). 'Customers assert that prices would be lower in a more competitive market. The generators could counter these assertions by competing more aggressively on the pool price.' Prof Littlechild said the electricity pool should base prices on both demand and supply. One suggestion is that demand side bidding be introduced, whereby consumers could be paid if they agreed to stop taking electricity when prices rose to a certain level. The regulator said that the pool should also look closely at rules under which generators are compensated if plant is constrained off the system by the National Grid, which operates it. Prof Littlechild is also asking the pool and the National Grid to consider a 'more appropriate division of responsibilities' for transmission and administration costs. Many of the costs were simply passed on to the customer. They could be met by the grid taking wider responsibility and recovering money through charges. Existing arrangements did not provide enough incentive to cut costs, he said. Alternatively some of the costs could be dealt with by the pool rather than the grid. Pool Price Statement, July 1993.

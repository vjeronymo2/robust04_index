			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORY OF WATER IMPASSE  </P> <P> The Times editorial "Water: Still a Riddle" (Aug. 21) correctly concluded that  the water impasse is the product of a complex political scene that requires  statewide leadership to overcome, along with less study and more action.  </P> <P> The public and many of our officials need to know that:  </P> <P> * Decades ago, California devised a State Water Plan to meet urban and  agricultural water needs into the next century. But it has been dangerously  detoured, preventing completion of its main facet, the State Water Project.  </P> <P> * The plan proposed water storage facilities to provide a firm yield, even in  dry cycles, to meet such needs. But key projects were jockeyed out of existence  by state and federal Wild Rivers bills. Witness the death in 1969 of the $245  million Eel River Dos Rios Dam, designed to provide a firm yield of 900,000  acre feet a year. Its cost today would be several billion dollars.  </P> <P> * Water conveyance facilities provided in the plan, including the State  Aqueduct, have been completed, but a gaping Delta hole remains -- a facility to  get high-quality water south to farms and cities free of San Francisco Bay  salts and Delta pollution. The hole exists because an integral part of the  state plan, the Delta Peripheral Canal, was defeated in 1982 due to an  overwhelmingly negative Northern vote and apathetic Southern support.  </P> <P> Three major obstacles to a water solution exist today:  </P> <P> 1. The so-called water establishment, including water agencies, cities and  counties, which are loath to adopt a hard line in fighting opponents of water  development. 2. Environmental groups, which have made water development their  prime target. The current national public concern over environmental  degradation makes the selling of water projects more difficult than ever.  </P> <P> 3. A North-South schism over water. Northern California historically has voted  against transferring water southward, despite recent Southern peace overtures.  Three-fourths of this state's undeveloped water exists in the North.  </P> <P> California is desperately in need of "statewide leadership at the highest  level" to solve its water dilemma, as The Times puts it.  </P> <P> Gov. Deukmejian and his water director, David Kennedy, have backed away from  forceful action, electing to try to keep all sides happy by offending no one.  JACK W.

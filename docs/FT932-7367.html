			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Economics: Focus turns to UK trade concerns THE main British economic indicators this week are the April non-European Community trade figures, detailed first quarter GDP figures, and the Confederation of British Industry monthly trends inquiry for May. Although the UK's trade deficit with non-EC countries in March was considerably smaller than in February, economists are gloomy about the general state of UK trade. The non-EC figures have painted a bleak picture since the beginning of the year when they became the only trade statistics to be published. Central Statistical Office statisticians have cautioned against reading too much into the figures - they represent less than half of the UK's total trade - but economists are bracing themselves for bad news when the complete figures, including EC trade, are published next month. This week also brings a string of US economic indicators. April existing home sales published tomorrow are expected to show a bounce back from the generally bad winter figures. Since December existing home sales have dropped a sharp 16.8 per cent, after winter storms hit the nation. Durable goods orders should also have advanced in April following a drop in March. The other economic highlights and statistics of the week are listed below.

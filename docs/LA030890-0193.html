			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> OIL FACILITIES ISSUE APPROVED FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> City officials will place a measure on the November ballot that would require  any proposals for onshore oil facilities to go before city voters.  </P> <P> "The Feb. 7 oil spill highlighted for me and others that we can't afford any  additional offshore development," said Councilman Robert F. Gentry at the  Tuesday meeting.  </P> <P> "You can't have offshore activity without onshore support facilities."  </P> <P> Council members discussed the option of changing the city's land-use plans to  prohibit onshore facilities such as transportation, processing and storage  structures but voted unanimously for the ballot requirement because they said  it would have greater impact.  </P> <P> "We need something stronger than an ordinance," Gentry said. "And we need to  make that statement strong."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Martha Collison agreed, adding that she hoped it would send a  message to other cities to do the same thing.  </P> <P> San Clemente is the only Orange County city that requires a vote of the people  before approval of any onshore oil facilities. Other California cities  requiring a vote are Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Point Arena,  Redondo Beach, Trinidad and Fort Bragg. Counties requiring such a vote are  Santa Cruz, Sonoma, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Mendocino and Humboldt. Eight  other cities and counties have ordinances that prohibit onshore facilities.  </P> <P> "Having this on the ballot brings it to the forefront and keeps it there for a  long time," said Councilman Dan Kenney. "We get more bang for the buck and keep  it in the news."  </P> <P> In other action, the City Council voted to send Gentry to Washington to testify  before the House Appropriations Committee, which is holding hearings this week  regarding an extension of the 1989-1990 offshore-drilling moratorium.LESLIE  HERZOG  </P></p>

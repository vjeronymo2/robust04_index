			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: H&amp;C 24% higher at midway - Industry growth driven by housing starts not maintenance Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday voiced concern over prospects for the housing market as it unveiled a better than expected 24 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 59.9m. Mr Bill Turcan, chief executive, said industry growth in the first six months had been driven by new housing starts rather than repairs and maintenance, where most of H&amp;C's business in the UK arose. His caution led H&amp;C to hold the interim dividend for the fourth successive year at 3.6p. Earnings rose 12 per cent to 4.6p. Mr Turcan was optimistic about the company's prospects for the rest of the year. Sales in the first half were flat at Pounds 1.1bn, but trading in H&amp;C's building and timber supplies business remained strong. This division had returned the fastest growth in the six months with operating profits ahead by 27 per cent to Pounds 13.5m. The chemicals business remained competitive, while food and agriculture had been hit by price pressure. BOCM Pauls, the agriculture and animal feeds business purchased in 1992, was expected to 'begin to realise its potential for higher profits', he said. The group's overall profits included net disposal proceeds of Pounds 6.3m, but still compared favourably with market expectations of between Pounds 45m and Pounds 55m. Mr Turcan said H&amp;C, which has streamlined its diversified portfolio of businesses, was now ready to strengthen two divisions through acquisition - timber and building supplies, and the speciality chemicals operation. H&amp;C last week raised Dollars 273m from the disposal of its Indonesian plantations, leaving it with debt of Pounds 59m, against Pounds 221m at the end of the half. The group intends to take advantage of the fragmented UK building supplies market - where it claims a 5 per cent share - and moves by global chemicals companies to withdraw from niche markets. Mr Turcan said H&amp;C was in no rush to spend the money. It would be deposited to offset tax losses around the world, leaving H&amp;C free to take its time on acquisitions. He added that H&amp;C had no immediate intention of selling its remaining plantations in Papua New Guinea. The most likely route was a local flotation. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata flatly denied press reports Thursday [26 May] that  he promised the United States last month to implement continuous  income tax cuts over a three-year period.    "I couldn't have easily given such a promise at the time, as  it would have had to be followed through by the incoming  government. Common sense rules out such an idea," Hata said.    "Such expectations were voiced but how could I give such a  promise," he added.    In its Thursday evening issue, the Japanese business daily  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN quoted a high-ranking U.S. Government  official as saying Hata promised the permanent tax cuts to U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor when they met at the signing  ceremony for the Uruguay Round of multilateral world trade talks  in Marrakesh, Morocco, in April.    Hata, then still foreign minister under Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, reportedly agreed to a three-year lag between  the implementation of income tax cuts and the introduction of  new taxes to boost Japan's economy.    The daily also reported that Washington takes the alleged  Hata promise as a premise for resumption of the stalled  framework talks on bilateral trade.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: First National reduces its half year losses First National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit and commercial lending company, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 3.2m in the six months to April 30. The company, which agreed a refinancing deal with banks a year ago to cut debt, said it had already made a Pounds 9m payment due in October. Total debt had been cut to Pounds 860m, compared with Pounds 910m at its October 31 year end. Mr George Cracknell, executive vice-chairman, said the company had 'broadly done what we said we would do' by reducing losses from discontinued commercial lending and property business while developing consumer credit. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.5p per share, despite a losses per share of 4p (2.5p). Mr Cracknell said the payment was a continuation of the policy of 'making a modest payment to shareholders as a declaration of good faith'. Its consumer credit arm, specialising in home improvement loans and second mortgages, was Pounds 10.2m, against Pounds 10.4m which included a Pounds 3.9m exceptional gain from the purchase of debt in a bank subsidiary.</p>

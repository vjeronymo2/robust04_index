			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Academics open wounds of MG Corp's oil crisis - Derivatives The oddest risk management episode of the past year has become a little odder. When German metals and engineering group Metallgesellschaft nearly succumbed to a liquidity crisis last December, it blamed the problems on the activities of its US subsidiary, MG Corp, in the oil derivatives markets. A hedging strategy had blown up spectacularly, leading to losses of more than Dollars 1bn. The MG story refuses to rest in peace. In recent days, a revisionist view of the saga has been gaining currency. Were MG Corp's risk managers in fact right all along? And was it a panic by the group's board - along with the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and US regulators, not to mention a possible conspiracy by the German group's bankers - that prompted the losses? These questions have been raised by US academics and fuelled by speculation that Deutsche Bank, Metallgesellschaft's lead banker, used the oil trading episode as an excuse to exert more direct influence over the group. MG's problems arose from its use of derivatives - mostly futures - to hedge long-term fixed-price contracts to supply oil products, mainly to small independent petrol stations around the US. The aim was to protect MG from a rise in the oil price. The problems started last autumn as the oil price plunged. A lower oil price might have added to MG's profits over the long term - with oil products sold at a higher, fixed rate - but in the short term, it faced two difficulties. One was that the futures contracts were falling in value, so MG had to put up additional margin payments with Nymex. With futures positions equivalent to about 160m barrels of oil, these figures were not small: every Dollars 1 fall in the price of a barrel of oil translated into Dollars 160m of extra margin. The second problem was a little more esoteric. The oil yield curve - the relationship between short-term and long-term oil prices - moved against the company. Traditionally, short-term oil prices had been above longer-term ones. But the curve flipped in 1992, with short-term prices sliding lower. This exposed MG to losses every time it rolled over its futures contracts. The near-term contracts it sold were worth less than the longer contracts it replaced them with. Meanwhile, at the long-term end of the oil curve, prices hardly moved, so the short-term losses were not being matched by profits on the underlying supply contracts. The size of MG's market position and the steepness of the oil price slide eventually precipitated a disaster. MG's bankers had to agree to an emergency line of credit, and the Metallgesellschaft management was sacked. Deutsche Bank sent Ms Nancy Kropp, an experienced fire-fighter it had used in such situations before, to sort out the mess. Her response was to liquidate many of MG's positions. This is where the revisionism comes in. Should Ms Kropp have kept rolling the futures positions forward? Eventually, surely, the losses would be made up by corresponding profits on the oil supply contracts (or futures prices would bounce back, as they have done this year). Ms Kropp's approach served to turn paper losses into real ones. This argument was murmured by a number of derivatives experts at the time. Now, it has gained wider circulation in academia. It is floated in a paper in one journal, The International Economy, written by Mr Steven Hanke, professor of applied economics at John Hopkins University, and Mr Christopher Culp, a doctoral candidate at the University of Chicago. The views are expanded on in a longer, unpublished paper by Mr Culp and Mr Merton Miller who, among other things, is a Nobel Laureate and director of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. According to an early draft of the Culp/Miller paper, MG's 'problem was not with its derivatives group, but more likely with its supervisory board and supporting banks, who may not have understood the hedging strategy and forced the premature liquidation of (MG's) hedge positions'. Ms Kropp's team 'might not have fully understood the nature of the original hedging strategy  -not because of inadequate training and expertise, but simply because the strategy was complex'. Comments like these have drawn strong criticism in the 'real world' of trading rooms, derivatives exchanges and regulators. 'Naive is a really good word (to describe the academics' criticisms),' says one outsider who was involved in sorting out the MG mess. And an oil derivatives expert who has followed the case closely at another trading house says of Ms Kropp's approach: 'She did a good job.' 'People should only put on positions which they can afford to margin - the cost of funds is a real consideration,' one person close to the MG problems says. Mr Miller has recently received a visit in Chicago from two Metallgesellschaft representatives, aiming to 'persuade' him to reconsider his views. A heavy-handed bid by the German group to stall wider debate on the subject, perhaps? The saga is certain to run on: a revised version of Mr Miller's paper with Mr Culp is due to be published shortly, and will no doubt be pored over for signs of recantation.</p>

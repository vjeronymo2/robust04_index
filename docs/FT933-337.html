			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: ITT buys 80% of GM automotive offshoot ITT, the US conglomerate, is spending Dollars 400m to buy 80 per cent of a General Motors automotive components company which makes motors and wiper systems. The deal marks a substantial expansion of ITT's already large automotive components business and is part of a strategy by GM to slim down its Automotive Components Group as it concentrates on restoring its North American vehicle assembly operations to profit. GM will retain a 20 per cent interest in the business, which will be managed and operated by ITT and employ the unit's existing workforce of more than 5,400. GM will continue to buy components and systems from the company under a long-term supply agreement. It is expected to account initially for 90 per cent of its sales. The business, which had sales of Dollars 760m last year and is said to be profitable, is a leading supplier in North America of motors for windscreen wipers, power antennae and seats as well as making complete wiper systems. The acquisition appears a good fit for ITT, which is a leading supplier of these products in Europe but has no US manufacturing presence in this area. ITT's automotive parts business has annual revenues of around Dollars 3.5bn. The GM business also makes air movement components and electro-mechanical devices, which ITT said was an area of growth opportunity in Europe. The unit has an engineering and technical centre in Dayton, Ohio and plants in Rochester, New York, and Nuevo Laredo and Juarez in Mexico. The sale is consistent with GM's policy announced last December of disposing of automotive components businesses which were uncompetitive or required too much capital. Earlier this month it announced plans to sell five parts-making plants, employing 6,800 workers, to American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, a company formed to buy the assets. The disposals come as GM and the United Auto Workers union are preparing for talks over a new labour contract focusing on job security. The UAW is wary of GM plant sales, though it will continue representing workers at American Axle and those at the motors unit are represented by the International Union of Electrical Workers. Mr Timothy Leuliette, chief executive of ITT's automotive business, said the deal reinforced ITT's commitment to the global auto industry. It would 'strengthen our position in these strategic product lines and further balance our sales between Europe and North America'.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Mass protest planned today ALGERIAN state radio yesterday reported a new attack on the country's security forces, and student protests continued at four universities as the authorities braced themselves for an unauthorised march by Moslem fundamentalists, AP-DJ reports from Algiers. Supporters of the Islamic Salvation Front, which the government is seeking to ban, spread word that the protest march in Algiers would go ahead after today's weekly prayers despite a ban on demonstrations. The military-backed ruling council imposed a 12-month state of emergency early this week and said it was initiating legal steps to ban the Salvation Front. State radio said yesterday that a sailor in the Algerian navy and two assailants died in the latest clash of a wave of attacks on security forces. The authorities say that, since the emergency decree, at least ten members of the security forces had been killed.</p>

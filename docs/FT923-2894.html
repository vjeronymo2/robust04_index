			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (6): Kimchi tops the menu - The South Korean market is growing fast AT THE Suginoi Hotel waitresses busily clean up after the vast number of guests who have eaten at the dinner buffet in the great dining hall. Aside from traditional Japanese dishes, the hotel serves a number of Korean stews and plates of Kimchi, a red hot Korean cabbage pickle. For as well as attracting local tourists, the hotel - in Beppu, famous for its hot springs  -caters to large numbers of South Korean visitors. Kyushu has been successfully competing for foreign tourists, especially those from south-east Asian countries. Of the 40,000 South Koreans expected to visit Oita this year, some 30,000 will stay at the Suginoi. The area has become more accessible for South Koreans since Korean Air recently launched direct flights from Seoul to Oita, three times a week. gThe one-hour flight has brought Seoul and Oita so close that South Korean politicians and leading businessmen come incognito to take a dip in Beppu's hot springs for a few hours. However, the Suginoi has not achieved its popularity overnight. After seeing the rush of Taiwanese tourists to Kyushu after liberalisation of overseas travelling in Taiwan in 1979, Mr Tatsufumi Watanabe, Suginoi's president, predicted the South Korean market would hold the same potential. When the South Korean government announced the gradual lifting of restrictions on foreign travel in the early 1980s, Mr Watanabe decided to start promoting Beppu to South Koreans. Mr Koichi Shudo, head of sales and promotion, expects the hotel's revenues from South Korean tourists to total Y2.5bn this year. While some hotels and ryokan - Japanese-style inns - are reluctant to target foreign clients due to the lower sales per head, the Suginoi is sticking to its strategy because of the South Korean market's high potential. The hotel has several Korean-speaking employees and plans to send staff to South Korea for training. Mr Choi of Korean Air says that since meals mean a lot to Korean tourists, buffets, which allow guests to eat as much as they want, are ideal. 'They don't want to be bothered by being told how to eat a raw egg for breakfast.' Other prefectures have established strong links with south-east Asian countries. Kagoshima prefecture, this year celebrates the 20th anniversary of its ties - through trade, culture, and tourism - with Hong Kong. Last year, Kagoshima attracted over 56,000 south-east Asian tourists. A number of new theme parks have started to attract Japanese tourists to Kyushu. Space World in Kita-Kyushu, set up by an affiliate of Nippon Steel, saw a steady inflow of visitors this year. Tours combining Space World and Huis Ten Bosch, a replica of a Dutch town set up in Nagasaki which opened last March, have also been a great success. At Huis Ten Bosch 20m bricks were imported from the Netherlands to construct a Dutch town with buildings which include complete replicas of famous Dutch cathedrals and city halls as well as original creations of Dutch architects. But why a Dutch city in Nagasaki? From the mid-1640s to 1854, Nagasaki was Japan's sole gateway to the rest of the world. The Dutch and Chinese were the only trade partners permitted by the Tokugawa Shogunate, thus Japan's exposure to western culture was through a little Dutch trading post in Nagasaki Harbour. However, Huis Ten Bosch, with its 6,000-meter canal network and an adjoining Dutch-style residential area, is only a base for a future resort city, says Mr Akira Kawada, managing director of Nagasaki Holland Village Corporation, the creator of Huis Ten Bosch. In the future, Mr Kawada says it wants to develop the area into a city of about 10,000 residents and hopes Japanese companies will create satellite offices, so employees can work in an environment close to nature.</p>

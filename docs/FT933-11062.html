			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Banks win tax ruling on BES NATIONAL Westminster Bank, Hambros Bank, and BZW, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, yesterday won a High Court ruling overturning an Inland Revenue decision that two Pounds 25m loan-back business expansion schemes affecting 3,000 investors did not qualify for tax relief. BES schemes give tax relief to investors at their highest marginal rate if they hold their investment for five years. In his March Budget Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, abolished loan-back BES schemes, which allowed investors to withdraw after six months while retaining full BES tax relief at their top marginal rate. He ruled that shares in BES companies had to be issued by the midnight before the Budget if loans were to be made against them. BZW's Gracechurch companies and National Westminster's Homeshare scheme  - launched in conjunction with Hambros Bank - had raised their full subscription of Pounds 25m each after launches in February and the first week of March respectively. The banks had allotted shares but had not listed the shareholdings in the companies' register of members by the Budget deadline. In May the Inland Revenue decided the shares had not been 'issued' and would not be eligible for tax relief. But Mr Justice Rattee ruled yesterday that the word 'issue' had no fixed meaning and there was 'no reason to think that the legislature intended the availability of BES tax relief to be dependent on the actual registration of shareholders or the issue of share certificates'. The banks' argument is that shares are issued when shareholders have a right and an obligation to be put on the register of members and that it is not necessary for a shareholder's name to be typed in for it to be registered. They had promised to return to investors their original investment should the legal case fail. Yesterday the Inland Revenue was considering the implications of the decision. It has 28 days to file an appeal. It earlier argued that a ruling in favour of the banks might have wider ramifications.</p>

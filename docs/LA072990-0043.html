			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BLACKSMITH: IRONWORKER AND FARRIER BY ALDREN A. WATSON  (W.W. NORTON: $14.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> The first half of Aldren Watson's study has the pleasant, gently didactic tone  of a good educational film.  </P> <P> Using words and neat ink drawings, he explains the duties and roles of a New  England blacksmith: his tools and supplies, his pay, his importance to the  community. Much of that importance derived from his work shoeing horses: In  freeway-conscious Southern California, it's easy to forget that horses were  important means of transportation well into the 20th Century.  </P> <P> The second half of the book is devoted to a set of plans for building a  blacksmith's forge, should the reader wish to undertake this unlikely project.  </P></p>

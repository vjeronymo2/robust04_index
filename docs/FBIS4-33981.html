			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mireya Cuellar and Raul Llanos] </F>   [Text] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos is reportedly ahead of  Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary  Party [PRI] by only 5 percent of the vote in the race for the  Presidency of the republic, according to two recent polls, one  conducted by the Opinion Research Center (CEO) and the  University of Guadalajara and the other by the Indemerc-Louis  Harris Firm.    The CEO conducted its poll among 6,896 voters in 19 cities  of  the republic. The results show that, as of 28 May, Fernandez de  Cevallos had 33.2 percent of the votes, Zedillo 28.1 percent,  and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 13 percent.    The poll conducted by the private Endemerc-Louis Harris Firm  on 24-31 May among 600 people in the valley of Mexico shows that  PAN [National Action Party] candidate Fernandez de Cevallos  increased his popularity rating to 42 percent after the  presidential debate. The PRI candidate placed second with 37  percent followed by Cardenas, candidate of the PRD [Party of the  Democratic Revolution], with 9 percent.    The CEO poll, which has a statistical reliability rating of  94.2 percent, was conducted on 19-18 May, and the 19 chosen  cities make up 36 percent of the national electorate. The  criteria used to select the sample of voters included sex, age,  and area of residence. The people were approached on the  streets.    The CEO poll shows that trust in the Federal Electoral  Institute (IFE), which is tasked with overseeing the process,  increased slightly. When asked how trustworthy the IFE is in  their opinion, 38.8 percent answered that it is trustworthy and  35.6 said that "it is not trustworthy." The first CEO poll  conducted in March showed that 37.3 percent questioned the IFE's  trustworthiness and 34.3 percent said it was trustworthy.    According to this poll, although more than 30 percent of  citizens trust the IFE, only 27 percent think the elections will  be "clean and honest." When asked whether they think the  upcoming presidential elections will be clean and honest, 41.1  percent replied "no" and 31.9 percent said they do not know.    Another interesting fact revealed by the CEO poll is that  61.9 percent of the population thinks the parties will reject  the electoral results, only 33 percent think they will accept  them, and the rest do not know.    If the elections had been held during the last 10 days of  May, that is, after the debate, Fernandez de Cevallos would  reportedly be the next president of Mexico with 33.2 percent of  the vote. Very closely behind was Zedillo with 28.1 percent and  Cardenas with 13 percent of the vote.    The CEO conducted its first poll on 16-22 March this year.  In that poll, 45.8 percent of the voters supported Zedillo,  13.5 percent Fernandez de Cevallos, and 18.1 percent Cardenas.  The second and most recent poll was carried out on 19-28 May,  amid the debate, and by then the PRI and PRD candidates had lost  popularity.    CEO Director Cesar Augusto Morones Servin stated that his  second and most recent poll makes two things clear: the 21  August election will be "strongly disputed" and the statistical  forecasts are very "vulnerable." Any major development between  now and the elections could alter the voting.    To back his "work theory," Morones Servin, during the same  news conference in which he reported the results of the CEO poll  yesterday, said they conducted a poll in Guadalajara two days  after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, showing that  PRI popularity had increased from 45.8 to 65 percent. The  assassination favored the official party.    The PRI popularity rate, however, had dropped to 35 percent  one month after Colosio's death. The analyst attributed this to  the confusion created by the incident. In fact, 30 percent of  those polled in Guadalajara said they think that the  assassination was plotted within the official party.    The CEO director said the poll yielded a large amount of  additional information that the University of Guadalajara places  at the disposal of not only the media but also political  organizations and the public at large.    Morones Servin said the cost of the poll was 80,000 new  pesos, thanks to the support of 19 public universities  throughout the country, which collected information in their  states at no charge. On the market, this poll would cost 1.5  billion old pesos.    The cities where information was collected are: Mexico,  Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, Villahermosa,  Hermosillo, Culiacan, Morelia, Veracruz, Acapulco, Torreon,  Puebla, Merida, Chihuahua, Oaxaca, Tampico, Leon and Tapachula.  <H5>  Indemerc: Diego grows </H5>   According to a recent poll conducted by the Indemerc-Louis  Harris firm with a representative sample of 600 Valley of Mexico  residents, support for Fernandez de Cevallos began to rise after  the public debate and as of 31 May he garnered the support of 42  percent of the respondents.    Following him very closely is the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo  Ponce  de Leon who, according to the poll, has the support of 37  percent of residents in the Valley of Mexico, one of the areas  with the largest number of voters in the country.    The poll in question, which is part of the weekly follow-up  conducted by Indemerc-Louis Harris, shows that support for the  former secretary of programming and budget began to drop in the  second week of May, days after the televised public debate  between the PRI, PAN and PRD candidates.    As for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the  Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), he received the  support of 9 percent of the voters in central Mexico.    Support for Cardenas Solorzano has remained steady following  the aforementioned debate, although according to polls conducted  a few days ago there has been a significant surge of support for  the PRD, which is gradually closing the gap that separates  Cardenas from his two main contenders as 21 August approaches.    As for the six other political parties that will participate  in the electoral process, the polls underscore that together  they gathered the support of 12 percent of the electorate.    Nevertheless, Indemerc-Louis Harris President Vicente Licona  said that most of this support has gone to Labor Party (PT)  candidate Cecilia Soto, while support for the remaining  contenders in this group has shown little or no change.    The Indemerc-Louis Harris poll shows the trend of the three  leading contenders' campaigns before and after the public debate.    Thus, for example, starting in April support for the PRI  declined significantly. By then, Ernesto Zedillo had been  uncovered as the candidate who would succeed Luis  Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, slain in Tijuana on 23 March.    According to the poll, popular support for the PRI had  stopped dropping up to the day after the televised debate  between Zedillo, Diego Fernandez and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. After  the debate, the party regained some support which, nevertheless,  has proven insufficient to restore it to the levels of support  it enjoyed up until April.    Meanwhile, the PAN made steady progress prior to the debate.  As of that date, 12 May, Diego Fernandez' "bonds" multiplied  "like bubbles" and he gained the support of 50 percent of Valley  of Mexico residents. Nevertheless, the white and blue party  candidate's popularity has decreased slightly due to matters  pertaining to his choice of words during his political campaign.  As of 31 May, Fernandez de Cevallos maintained the support of  42 percent of the voters in the heart of the nation.    To conclude, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' position has remained  steady among Valley of Mexico voters, and although he did not  "win" the debate, his popularity has not been significantly  affected.</p>

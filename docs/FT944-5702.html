			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Overseas holdings rise to 16.3% Overseas ownership of UK shares grew faster than any other sector of shareholders last year, official figures show. The Central Statistical Office yesterday said the survey showed that overseas owners accounted for 16.3 per cent of share ownership, compared with 13.1 per cent in 1992. The survey covered 79 companies, including many of the largest, representing 53 per cent of the total capitalisation of the London Stock Exchange. The US accounted for 41.8 per cent of this overseas investment. If this percentage is extrapolated to cover the total amount of stock market equity, this implies that US investors held Pounds 49.2bn of shares in 1993, up from Pounds 37.1bn in 1992. Overseas investors tended to have much larger holdings than other groups, the survey suggests. A total of Pounds 43.5bn out of Pounds 117.6bn of the shares held by overseas investors in 1993 were in holdings worth more than Pounds 100m, with most of the rest accounted for by holdings of more than Pounds 10m. The largest single group of holdings by pension funds, by contrast, occurred in the category of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 10m - with Pounds 95.7bn worth of shares held there. Most of the unit trusts holdings occurred in the Pounds 1m to Pounds 10m holdings band. For individuals, the majority of shares were in holdings of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 100,000. The fastest expanding area in overseas investment was in the non-manufacturing sector. Overseas share ownership in manufacturing companies rose from an extrapolated Pounds 38bn in 1992 to Pounds 49.5bn in 1993. Overseas ownership of non-manufacturing shares, however, rose further to Pounds 51.2bn in 1993, up from Pounds 31.3bn in 1992. Overseas ownership of shares in financial companies roughly doubled in this period to Pounds 16.9bn. UK individuals held Pounds 33.1bn worth of shares in financial companies in 1993, Pounds 61.5bn in non-manufacturing companies and Pounds 41.8bn in manufacturing groups. Pension fund holdings were also more heavily concentrated in non-manufacturing companies - with Pounds 108.3bn worth of shares. This was considerably larger than 1992's figure of Pounds 86bn. Their ownership of manufacturing shares changed less in this period, with Pounds 87.1bn worth of shares held in 1992 and Pounds 96.4bn in 1993.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- WHO BUYS THE MOST SHARES?  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Beneficial ownership, % of total equity owned, 31 December Beneficial owner  1963    69    75    81    89    90    91    92    93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Pension funds      6.4   9.0  16.8  26.7  30.6  31.6  31.3  35.1  34.2 Insurance  companies        10.0  12.2  15.9  20.5  18.6  20.4  20.8  16.7  17.3 Unit trusts        1.3   2.9   4.1   3.6   5.9   6.1   5.7   6.2   6.6 Banks              1.3   1.7   0.7   0.3   0.7   0.7   0.2   0.5   0.6 Inv. trusts    _                           1.6   1.6   1.5   2.1   2.5 Other financial  11.3  10.1  10.5   6.8  institutions                             1.1   0.7   0.8   0.4   0.6 Individuals       54.0  47.4  37.5  28.2  20.6  20.3  19.9  20.4  17.7 Other personal  sector            2.1   2.1   2.3   2.2   2.3   1.9   2.4   1.8   1.6 Public sector      1.5   2.6   3.6   3.0   2.0   2.0   1.3   1.8   1.3 Industrial and  commercial sector 5.1   5.4   3.0   5.1   3.8   2.8   3.3   1.8   1.5 Overseas           7.0   6.6   5.6   3.6  12.8  11.8  12.8  13.1  16.3 Total              100   100   100   100   100   100   100   100   100  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

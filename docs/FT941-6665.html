			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Calor enters natural gas market Calor Gas, the dominant supplier of bottled liquefied petroleum gas in the UK, has decided to enter the increasingly competitive natural gas market. Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive, said Calor Gas would offer supplies immediately to consumers using more than 2,500 therms a year, with particular emphasis on small commercial users. Mr Robinson said many British Gas consumers in that category had yet to see the benefits from a competitive market, in part because they have been overlooked by existing independent gas companies. Calor has hired Sir James McKinnon, former head of Ofgas, the industry regulator, to advise its natural gas business. It will be supplied by Alliance Gas, the joint venture of British Petroleum, Statoil and Norsk Hydro of Norway. Alliance, which is one of the larger independents to emerge since the government began to liberalise the gas market, says it has 10 per cent of the firm market for gas users above 2,500 therms. The independents have captured 41 per cent of the total market above 2,500 therms. Calor says it might be able to attract 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the 300,000 or so potential customers in the small commercial category. It claims to be able to offer price savings of up to 15 per cent compared with current British Gas charges. A multi-year gas supply contract is the only formal link between the two companies. Alliance will be able to enter into similar arrangements with other companies, and it will remain free to sell to the same category of consumers that Calor is aiming at. But Alliance executives think any duplication of efforts will be limited. They point out that their company does not have the staff to identify and approach many of the smaller commercial users, whereas Calor has a national sales and dealer network.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Presidium of the Croatian Democratic Community  [HDZ] today addressed a message to the members of the HDZ and  the Croatian public. We will broadcast the message in its  entirety.    At a critical historic moment in the struggle to defend  Croatian state sovereignty, when we have achieved the greatest  results and obtained recognition from the whole of the  international community for our consistent, peace-loving, and  democratic policy, but while we are still facing serious  challenges and uncertainties on the path of establishing full  sovereignty over Croatian areas under the protection of the  peace forces -- but in fact under Serb occupation -- and the no  less grave problem of establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina;  in such internationally complex circumstances, we are facing an  attempt to cause a rift in the HDZ. The HDZ Presidium is,  therefore, addressing the HDZ members and public with the  following message:    The initiative launched by Josip Manolic and Stipe Mesic to  form a new political party called the Croatian Independent  Democrats [HND] marks the final stage of their departure from  the HDZ's program and policy. The process of their departure  from the HDZ's central policy has been under way for more than a  year, and it gained momentum after the second general convention  of the HDZ, held on 15 October 1993.    Manolic and Mesic protested their deep dissatisfaction with  decisions adopted with an overwhelming majority at the  convention. Their objections referred to the new program  envisaging the completion of the transformation of the HDZ from  a Pan-Croatian democratic movement [opcehrvatski demokratski  pokret] into a Pan-Croatian and all-people's party [opcehrvatska  and opcenarodna stranka] which bases its democratic policy on  the principles of Christian civilization. They expressed  particular disapproval over the new party leaders and the HDZ  presidium that was elected in a secret ballot at the convention.    Over the past few months Manolic and Mesic were increasingly  open in expressing their views that were contradictory to those  of the HDZ leadership, the president of the republic, and the  prime minister in all important issues concerning internal and  foreign policy.    Through their separate political activity and the initiative  to launch a new party, Manolic and Mesic continued and deepened  the work of those from the opposition and from abroad -- the  letter of the six and the Initiative Circle -- who called for a  change in the constitutional order, the resignation of the  president of the republic, and early elections.    Considering the circumstances in the internal and  international spheres, there can be no doubt as to the  intentions and consequences of such activity. The attempt to  cause a parliamentary and constitutional crisis, and especially  the discrediting of the state policy of the president of the  republic did not and cannot aim at anything other than the  destabilization of the internal order and the weakening of the  international position of democratic Croatia, and consequently  the weakening of Croatia's negotiating positions in resolving  the problem of the occupied Croatian areas, ending the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the realization of the Croat-Bosnian  Muslim Federation and confederation, as well as in reaching  economic and financial agreements with other countries.    Naturally, respecting the constitutional and democratic  rights of every citizen, the HDZ Presidium recognizes Manolic's  and Mesic's right to hold differing views and form a separate  party. However, the HDZ Presidium has not only the right, but  also the obligation toward HDZ members and the Croatian public  to present its view on their stances and activity, because this  is not only an attempt to create a rift in the HDZ as a majority  party, but also an attempt to change the policy of the state.    The Croatian people have achieved their sovereignty and the  Croatian state has secured its place in today's world under the  leadership of the HDZ owing to the correctness of its policy and  the stability of its democratic order. By pursuing such a  policy, Croatia has gained trust and made friends and allies in  the modern world. On the other hand, the world, the important  international players, need a stable Croatia as a reliable  factor in the creation of a new international order in this part  of Europe.    In whose interest is then the destabilization of Croatia?    Only people who are politically blind and yearn for power  or those who cannot reconcile themselves to an independent and  sovereign Croatian state. Precisely because it is obvious to  every rational human being the attempt by Manolic and Mesic to  bring about a division and a constitutional crisis is doomed to  failure.    Of the 16 deputies that they claim to be in the Initiative  Committee of their party, several have already denied any  connection with them. The HDZ has retained the majority in both  Croatian Assembly chambers, while messages of support for the  HDZ Presidency and reports of a growing membership are being  received, precisely because of the departure of Manolic and the  like.    Attempts to cause a division and to weaken the HDZ are  already turning into a process of strengthening and  consolidation of the HDZ as the focal party on the Croatian  political scene. The HDZ will resume its tried and tested  policy at both the domestic and international levels without  taking any right or left turns away from its program principles  and goals.    The HDZ will remain a pioneer in the construction of a  democratic Croatia in the period of economic and cultural  renaissance, in the construction of a legal system. The HDZ  will encourage private entrepreneurship and resolutely struggle  to overcome all remains of the old communist regime, all  bureaucratic, criminal, and immoral phenomena.    The HDZ Presidency is calling on all its members and  deputies  in the Croatian Assembly, in county and municipal assemblies, to  justify the trust placed in them by the people who elected them.    A question now arises of personal responsibility, before  public and party bodies, for the conscientious execution of the  duties entrusted, for regular participation in the Assembly  Chambers, and the responsible implementation of party policy.    All civil servants are requested to fulfill their  obligations, including the one on keeping state secrets. They  also bear collective responsibility for their own specific  areas, especially with regard to economizing at all levels.    Personal changes that will take place in the leaderships of  the Assembly Chambers -- given the democratic right of a  majority party -- will not cause any changes in Croatian policy  either at domestic or international levels. On the contrary,  they will insure its more consistent implementation.    Similar and even greater turmoil than that in the HDZ is  also  present in the opposition parties. They are the expression of  democratic shifts in the balance of political alliances and will  serve to strengthen the democratic system in Croatia.    All our experience so far gives us solid reasons to conclude  that the HDZ, with its well-proven leadership, will come out of  this situation even stronger and more united, at the head of the  struggle for the preservation, consolidation, and construction  of a sovereign and independent Croatian state, the state of full  democratic liberties, progress, happiness, and prosperity for  all its citizens -- the HDZ Presidency states at the end of its  message.    [Signed] Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of  Croatia, HDZ General Secretary Jure Radic, Deputy Presidents  Nikica Valentic, Mate Granic, Franjo Greguric, Gojko Susak,  Marjan Sunjic, and members Ivan Milas, Djuro Brodarac, General  Djuro Decak, Antun Vrdoljak, Ivic Pasalic, Hrvoje Hitrec, and  Mario Kapulica.</p>

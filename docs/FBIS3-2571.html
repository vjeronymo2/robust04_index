In the past years, these enterprises have undertaken most of  the important research programs in the province and developed  many new products of national significance, the official said.    These products include a microwave cancer killer, artificial  bone, optic-fibre and natural carotene.    The Department of Science and Technology of the provincial  government last year made a survey of 72 products of 44 private  high-tech enterprises.    The survey showed that most of the 72 products are at or  near  advanced international levels. Many are best-selling or have  great market potential.    The province has so far registered more than 1,000 private  high-tech enterprises, most of them being started and operated  by scientific researchers or experts.    The employees of all these enterprises have a sophisticated  professional background. The officials said some 5,900  employees of the around-1,000 enterprises are of senior or  medium professional level.    The official said more than 90 percent of these enterprises  maintain close co-operation with scientific bodies and  universities in the interior, where most of the employees came  from.    This very close tie has enabled these enterprises to carry  out a large part of the early-stage research and even  manufacture at cheaper costs and formed a powerful backing to  their development, the official said.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EXPATRIATE RETURNS HOME TO PRISON, NOT DEMOCRACY;  </P> <P> TAIWAN: ZAU-NAN CHEN'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS SAY HE IS INNOCENT, NOT AN ADVOCATE  OF VIOLENCE AND SEDITION.  </P> <P> When Taiwanese officials finally gave Zau-Nan Chen a visa to return to his  homeland last spring, the Westminster businessman took it as a sign that  Taiwan's new government was serious about democratic reform.  </P> <P> Instead, the video store owner and democracy activist was arrested before he  got off the plane at the Taipei airport.  </P> <P> Though Chen is an Austrian citizen who has lived in the United States for a  decade, Taiwanese officials jailed him and charged him with sedition. On Sept.  22, he was convicted and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Taiwan government in Los Angeles said Chen had advocated  the violent overthrow of the island's government. But Chen's wife and friends  insist that he is a political prisoner who was targeted because of his  association with Taiwan's most famous dissident, Hsu Hsin-liang.  </P> <P> Between 1980 and 1984, Chen was general manager of the Formosa Weekly, a  now-defunct newspaper published by Hsu in Los Angeles, associates said. The  newspaper criticized martial law in Taiwan and was a rallying point for the  political opposition in Southern California.  </P> <P> Among the evidence against Chen was a 1984 series of articles published by the  newspaper about urban guerrilla warfare. The government alleges that the  articles were aimed at "inciting people to start guerrilla warfare to overthrow  the government on Taiwan," said Carol Cho, spokeswoman for the Coordination  Council for North American Affairs, Taiwan's quasi-official diplomatic mission  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "They tried to paint Mr. Chen as a violent (person). He is not," said Chen's  longtime friend Ching J. Shieh, a Fountain Valley aerospace engineer who  attended part of Chen's trial in Taipei. "We maintain that we promote the  Taiwanese democratic process through peaceful means."  </P> <P> Chen's conviction has left his wife, an ailing piano teacher, struggling to  manage three children and three businesses alone. Fung In Chen, 43, was  hospitalized briefly last week with a bleeding ulcer, a condition she says has  been worsened by the stress of her husband's arrest.  </P> <P> "I support my husband's ideals, that he cares about his motherland so much,"  she said through an interpreter during an interview Thursday. "He's the kind of  a man that I respect very much. But being his wife and the mother of three, I  also worry that it will end up like a nightmare."  </P> <P> "Our three children, they've been very understanding . . .," she said. Mrs.  Chen bowed her head low and covered her hands with her eyes, but tears dropped  onto the table in front of her. "Of course, they worry about their father very  much."  </P> <P> Chen's arrest has also left Taiwanese-Americans like Shieh wondering why  Taiwan's officials gave Chen a visa if they intended to arrest him, whether  other U.S. citizens risk retaliation for political activities in this country,  and whether the Taipei government is sincere about ending four decades of  one-party rule.  </P> <P> "This is a big case here," said Vincent Diau, a Los Angeles reporter for the  Chinese Daily News, the leading Chinese-language newspaper in Southern  California. "In this case Mr. Chen is arrested, but who is next nobody knows. .  . . The situation right now is very unpredictable."  </P> <P> Chen's backers say the businessman has been made a scapegoat since many far  more prominent dissidents, including Chen's mentor, Hsu, have been pardoned.  </P> <P> Hsu spent nearly a decade in exile in Los Angeles and was repeatedly refused  permission to return to Taiwan. Last year, he was arrested when he tried to  slip back into Taiwan on a fishing boat and was convicted of sedition. In May,  Hsu and nine others were freed by Taiwan's new President Lee Teng-hui.  </P> <P> "The president gave everyone the impression that this is the time for the  wounds to heal, and everyone who has previously opposed the government should  come back and talk," said Daniel Sheh, who owned a business next door to  Chen's. "So he went back and he was arrested."  </P> <P> Chen was arrested on June 24 and released six days later. On July 4, the  government and opposition agreed on democratic reforms, including a popular  vote for president, a decision that one opposition leader called "a peaceful  revolution." In light of that, Chen's wife said she expected the charges to be  dropped, but his trial began in August.  </P> <P> The Austrian consul general in Los Angeles, Franz Cede, said he was  "flabbergasted" to learn Thursday from a reporter of Chen's conviction, since  the last report from the embassy was that Chen had been freed. Cede said he  intended to inform Vienna of the case but was not optimistic.  </P> <P> "Definitely it will not be easy for the Austrian authorities to help him in  Taiwan as we do not have diplomatic representation there," Cede said.  </P> <P> Chen's troubles began when he boarded a plane on June 22 to return home for the  first time in 20 years. He and his wife had left Taiwan in 1969 to study music  in Austria, Mrs. Chen said. There, they renounced their Taiwanese citizenship  and became Austrian citizens. Chen became involved in Taiwanese exile politics.  </P> <P> In 1980, the couple moved to Southern California to help Hsu launch his  newspaper. Though Chen occasionally wrote editorials, he was mainly involved in  fund raising and managing the business side of the newspaper, she said.  </P> <P> In 1984, Chen left the newspaper to start his own business. His Taiwanese  Cultural Center, which rents Chinese-language videotapes and sells books and  magazines, now has branches in Westminster, Irvine and Huntington Beach. Though  Mrs. Chen became a U.S. citizen, Chen retained Austrian citizenship so he could  look after business interests there, she said.  </P> <P> In 1985, Chen joined the newly formed Taiwan Revolutionary Party, of which Hsu  was also a member. Spokeswoman Cho said the party advocated overthrowing the  government by force; Chen's associates say the party explicitly rejected  violence.  </P> <P> Chen had been refused a visa to return to Taiwan since his days in Austria, but  he continued to apply each year, his wife said. His mother had surgery this  spring, and he was desperate to go back. When his visa came through on June 12,  he was ecstatic, friends said.  </P> <P> "For over 20 years he has been refused to go back," said Leonard Hsu, a  Monterey Park businessman and secretary general of the Taiwan Democratic  Movement Overseas. "For somebody like him, he was so happy when he got a visa  from the government, so it was really like falling into a trap by the (ruling)  government."  </P> <P> According to Cho, Chen was well aware that a warrant had been issued for his  arrest in 1985 because property he owned in Taipei had been seized by the  government. Regaining that property was the real motive for Chen's trip,  Taiwanese officials said.  </P> <P> "When he applied (for) the visa, my colleague in the visa section advised him  that he would be arrested because he is on the wanted list," Cho said.  Moreover, she said, Chen signed a statement saying that he would accept legal  responsibility for his words and deeds during his years abroad, "even if this  means putting myself in prison."  </P> <P> Chen's friends, however, insist that if such a warrant did exist, it was never  made public.  </P> <P> "The warrant was never published until he was arrested, and then the government  claimed the warrant was issued in 1988," Shieh said. He said Chen was warned he  might be questioned upon arrival in Taipei but was never told of the warrant.  </P> <P> Daniel Sheh, who owns an insurance business next to Chen, said he isn't  involved in exile politics but believes that the Taiwan government has no right  to try a foreign national for treason.  </P> <P> "I'm an American citizen and I was born and raised in Taiwan," Sheh said. "I  thought that I am protected by the First Amendment. . . . But then this  constitutional right has been challenged by foreign authorities. This is the  real issue here."  </P></p>

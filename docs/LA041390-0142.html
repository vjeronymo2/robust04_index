			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE KLEIN: ALI FANS GET A WHIFF OF THE CHAMP (WITH PURCHASE)  </P> <P> "Muhammad Ali. The man. The legend. The cologne."  </P> <P> This is what I'm hearing on the car radio.  </P> <P> "The essence of a winner," it says.  </P> <P> I think this has got to be a joke. An MTV promo. A bit from Live at the Improv.  </P> <P> I've been around boxers. Nobody in his or her right mind would bottle their  essence.  </P> <P> I keep listening. This is for real. The Champ himself is going to be at May Co.  department stores throughout Southern California, signing autographs "with  purchase."  </P> <P> I figure I should check this out, Thursday at noon at South Coast Plaza. I'm  afraid I might be the only one there. I pull into the parking lot five minutes  early.  </P> <P> What I see is a line from the May Co. men's fragrance department snaking out  the door, all the way to the corner. Hundreds of people -- men, women, children  and infants -- have been waiting for Ali since the store opened at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> These people have made lots of purchases. (After shave: $17.50. Cologne: $28.50  small, $38.00 large). They have brought many things, several of them rather  strange, to be signed. They are patient. They are happy.  </P> <P> A white limo zips by. The crowd goes nuts. Then The Champ is ushered inside.  </P> <P> A plainclothes security guard asks one man near the front of the line: "Excuse  me, sir. Did you make a purchase today?"  </P> <P> "I made two purchases," the man says.  </P> <P> Joe Kasper, a car salesman from Huntington Beach, has brought a fresh baseball  to be signed. This is Joe's thing. He has 150 signed baseballs at home. Richard  Nixon, Oliver North, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, George Bush -- all of them  have signed Joe's baseballs.  </P> <P> "I even have one of Wade Boggs and Margo Adams on the same ball, after they  broke up," Joe says. "What I did is have Wade sign it first. Then later, I  turned it around and had Margo sign it. She didn't even look."  </P> <P> Ara Akoubian, 11 years old, is the first to step up to the man himself. This is  an unbelievable coincidence, Ara tells me.  </P> <P> Just last week he did an oral report on The Champ in his sixth-grade class in  Anaheim Hills, before he knew about The Man, The Legend, The Cologne.  </P> <P> Ara gives me an encore. He assumes the champion stance. He lowers his chin. He  puts gravel in his voice.  </P> <P> "Hi, my name's Muhammad Ali," he says. "I fly like a butterfly, sting like a  bee. There ain't no other fighter like me."  </P> <P> Ali, 48 years old, retired from the ring since 1980, is sitting behind a table,  an armed bodyguard standing on either side. He is wearing a very dark suit and  a very red tie. He isn't saying much, although he is smiling a lot. His voice  is barely above a whisper. He is shaking hands and kissing women and babies.  </P> <P> He is signing color glossies (free with purchase) very, very slowly, with  quivering hands. Nobody is talking too much about the quivering. That wouldn't  be nice. They are noticing, however. They love this guy.  </P> <P> J. Arthur Worth, president of Crystal Fragrances in New York, is the brains  behind all this hype. The cologne, he says, was his idea and Ali has gone along  just fine.  </P> <P> "Ali is the most well-known person in the world today," Worth says. "We wanted  to do something, so we came upon the idea of a cologne. It's a clean product.  Because of his religious beliefs, he couldn't promote any alcoholic beverages,  or underwear, or anything too sexually explicit. . . . You know, Michael Jordan  is doing underwear now."  </P> <P> J. Arthur Worth says that the crowds have been like this one -- huge and  adoring -- pretty much down the line.  </P> <P> They started the promotion in August of last year in Detroit. It was the  Midwest after that and then on down into the Deep South. This week's tour of  Southern California is the first stab at the West.  </P> <P> "We were in Mississippi, at the store, and Gov. Ray Mabus calls," Worth tells  me. "He says that he'd like to see us. I told Ali, 'We're in Mississippi. I  don't see how we can refuse the governor.' So he sent for us and entertained us  like royalty. He told us how great the cologne was, in his opinion."  </P> <P> The line inching toward Ali, meanwhile, seems interminable. Nobody has been  waiting less than two hours, most at least an hour beyond that.  </P> <P> No one is complaining, except for one guy who has failed to make a purchase. He  is removed.  </P> <P> Finally, I make my way toward Ali. He tells me that it's Allah -- "that's  A-l-l-a-h" -- who makes him so popular, although the cologne is pretty good  too.  </P> <P> "I don't wear anybody else's," he says. Before the essence of The Greatest made  its way to the market, however, Ali confides that he used to splash on Calvin  Klein's.  </P> <P> J. Arthur Worth says that I should join The Champ and his entourage for lunch.  I decline. It's already 2 o'clock, and the end of the line is still nowhere in  sight.  </P> <P> In any case, I figure this may not be my last chance for a whiff of The Champ.  Worth says that the cologne is just the start.  </P> <P> "Rope a Dope" soap is one of the clean Muhammad Ali products that we can look  forward to next.  </P></p>

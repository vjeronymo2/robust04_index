			<p>BFN     [Text] On 22 June, the "defense policy council" (chaired  by Asahi Breweries, Ltd. Chairman Kotorao Higuchi), which is an  advisory body to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata responsible for  studying a new framework for defense policies, held a meeting to  discuss the issue of reviewing the organization of the Ground  Self- Defense Forces [GSDF]. Members of the council shared the  view that "a review of the current GSDF structure consisting of  13 divisions is unavoidable." From now on, the council will  hold further concrete discussions on reducing the number of GSDF  personnel through a scale down of some units and a review of  their organization. Regarding a GSDF organization review,  participants at the meeting agreed on the following points: 1)  Modernization and effective management of equipment will be  considered; 2) a personnel reshuffle review is necessary from  the viewpoint of the potential for war; 3) based on new defense  policies, unit arrangements will be reviewed; and 4) the  expansion of SDF reserve officers will be studied.    While some members proposed a GSDF personnel organization  rehers called for a review of unit arran gements putting  emphasis on defense of the metropolitan area and on disposition  of units in regions which adjoin foreign nations.</p>

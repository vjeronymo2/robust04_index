			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Dan-Air takeover probe rejected VIRGIN Atlantic and British Midland failed yesterday in their High Court attempt to have the British Airways takeover of Dan-Air referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The two airlines were refused leave for a judicial review of the government's decision not to refer the takeover to the MMC. They had argued that the EC treaty required the MMC and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to examine the takeover under rules prohibiting abuse of a dominant trading position.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valentin Zhdanko: "Election Scandals Over </F> Shooting on Roads and in the Press"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Yet another resounding  scandal in recent days stems from the appearance in three major  republic papers financed from the state budget of a wide-ranging  article allegedly reprinted from the Dutch AMSTERDAMGUFIRE [as  transliterated]. The article takes a negative view of all the  presidential candidates except Vyacheslaw Kebich. Especially  many harsh words and offensive hints are leveled at ex-Speaker  Stanislaw Shushkevich. Mr. Shushkevich's initiative group sent  an official question to the Dutch Embassy in Warsaw. It  received the answer: No publication by this name exists in  Holland, and there have been no such articles in the Dutch  press. The identity of the author of the forged article remains  a riddle.    The Oversight Council consisting of independent experts  recommended that in the days remaining before the elections the  mass media refrain from publishing sociological surveys because,  the council thought, sociological services in the country are as  a rule controlled by the government and some of its leaders are  members of Mr. Kebich's initiative group. This decision evoked  a negative reaction from official sociologists. According to  their polls, Mr. Kebich has enjoyed unequaled popularity in the  republic for a long time now, although observers believe that  the real mood among the bulk of the population creates some  doubt that the prime minister will win the 23 June elections.</p>

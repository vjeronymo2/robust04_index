			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Benefit of employee ownership Sir, Those who think reserving 10 per cent of the shares in a privatised Post Office ('PO staff may get free shares in sell-off', June 20) is a waste of scarce equity might examine the evidence in the US. Employees own an average 12 per cent equity in more than a quarter of the Fortune 500 industrials. This is not altruism. An index of 265 public companies where employees own at least 10 per cent of the equity, compiled by a team at Rutgers University, outperformed the Standard and Poors 500 Index by 26 per cent over 11 quarters to September 1993.

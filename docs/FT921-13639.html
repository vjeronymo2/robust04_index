			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (14): Cairo film studios in crisis - Pirates and videos assail the Arab world's 'Hollywood' SWITCH on a television anywhere in the Arab world and the language one hears is likely to be the urban slang of Cairo. The city's entertainment industry dominates 150m Arabs as Hollywood's dominates the English speaking world. But after seven decades in film making and three in filling the region's television screens, Egyptian show business is in a crisis. From 100 feature films a year in their 1950s heyday, the output of Cairo studios has dropped to only 30, producing a meagre annual turnover of Dollars 10m. Egypt's state-owned Radio and TV Union once supplied 70 per cent of programming in the Arab world. Competition from satellites, video and nascent national studios have whittled away its market share. For Egypt's cinema industry the foremost obstacle is finance. 'We have excellent artists, excellent technicians and no real competition in the Arab nation,' says Mounib Shafei, who heads the cinema branch of the Egyptian Chamber of Industries. 'Our whole problem is economic.' With cinema attendance in decline and video piracy rife in the home market, Egyptian film makers have come to rely on foreign sales for two thirds of their revenues. That gives their foreign distributors so much clout that a handful of Arab producers now finance 80 per cent of the industry. A typical Egyptian film costs Dollars 200,000 to shoot. Most studios finance production by selling a film in advance to a distributor in the Gulf. With his foreign right sold, the film maker's profits must come from local sales. Serious film makers are concerned by Gulf money's effect on the standards of Egyptian cinema. Foreign producers tend to be unadventurous, demanding only well-known stars and formula scripts studded with plenty of flesh and violence. Financial pressures have limited the creativity of younger directors such as Mohammed Khan, Khairi Bichara and Atef al Tayeb whose work is representative of a trend away from the slapstick humour and melodrama that Cairo studios are famous for. The real Egyptian issues they like to treat - class conflict, urban crowding, corruption, the hypocrisy of tradition - are of no interest to video watchers in the Gulf. Efforts to secure local financing have not been encouraging. Egyptian producers are wary of alienating the foreign finance monopoly. Director Mohammed Khan set a precedent by financing his latest film, Knight of the City, with a bank loan. Given the difficulties he has had getting the film screened in Egypt and sold abroad, few are likely to follow in his steps. Nevertheless there are some bright signs for the future. Egyptian producers have plans to set up a joint production fund and a centralised agency for foreign sales. Long closed by inter-Arab squabbles, lucrative markets for Egyptian films have reopened in Lebanon, Syria and Libya. Anti-piracy structures which will soon be legislated in Egypt and other Arab countries should boost video sales that generate the bulk of income. As a near monopoly of the state, Egypt's television production faces different problems. Its most successful products - soap operas, religious programmes and variety shows - remain popular outside Egypt. But the Radio and TV Union's bureaucratic approach has depressed artistic standards just as the sophistication of Arab audiences has grown. At the same time Gulf countries have promoted their own programming, often luring away the best of Egypt's technicians. Officials at the Radio and TV Union refuse to disclose sales figures that probably run into tens of millions of dollars, but admit that their share of Arab programming has fallen. 'Ten years ago we were the only producers of drama,' says Mrs Zeinab Ezzat, who runs the Union's foreign sales department from a dingy, cramped office. 'But now Arab countries are producing their own programmes. They get satellite TV. There is even private TV production.' Still, Mrs Ezzat appears unworried. 'The competition is better for us. If we make better quality the viewers will ask for Egyptian programmes.'</p>

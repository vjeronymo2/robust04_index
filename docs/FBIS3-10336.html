			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli  said yesterday that the state will absorb the fuel price  differential, after distribution problems are resolved, which  will result from the measure announced by the municipality and  the president to sell fuel without including the increase that  took place after deregulation.    He added that if the mayors of the country's main department  capitals present the respective plan, the government is willing  to pay the diesel fuel price difference to prevent an increase  in urban transportation fares. He said that ways are being  sought to distribute in two or three days 50,000 gallons of  diesel, which is consumed in the capital, to avoid the pretext  to increase fares.    Luna Troccoli explained that it is not exactly a subsidy  because the differential payment of a few cents is a temporary  measure, in view of the fact that future international fuel  market prices are expected to drop. Luna said that the amount  the state will cover will depend on the distribution mode and  that the intention is to take advantage of the drop in the  profit margin of certain distributors for diesel used for  transportation.    The official was asked what would happen once the price of  diesel dropped to below what has been set as the reference  price, and he replied that the government, logically, not only  does not set the differential, but does not set the rates to  allow a drop.    Lastly, Luna Troccoli said that the use of state  distributors  has not been ruled out, but that a study of the most effective  solution will be completed in the next few hours.</p>

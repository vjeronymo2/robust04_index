Do note that we're Republicans here.  </P> <P> We voters must have just gotten a taste of how frustrating it is to be a  legislator, in that the things you vote for have predictably both good and bad  results. Things just can't be simple, no way.  </P> <P> DIANE STILES  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

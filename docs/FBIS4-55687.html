			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. Kecman: "Preparations to Build Road from </F> Banja Luka to Cadjavica Via Manjaca: Half a Million Marks for  Initial Work"]    [Text]The Executive Committee of the SO [Serb  Opstina] in Banja Luka has provided 500,000 German marks [DM]  for the construction of a road which will shorten the trip to  Knin by 60 km; the people of Manjaca enthusiastically welcomed  around 300 engineers from the First Corps with 50 machines;  petroleum, spare parts, and projects for shorter section  provided.    Banja Luka, 28 Apr--The Executive Committee of Banja Luka  Opstina, at the suggestion of chairman Rajko Kasagic, has  decided to pay DM500,000 to the fund for construction of a  highway between Banja Luka and Cadjavica from the opstina  budget, as the initial amount necessary for 50 machines and 300  soldiers from engineer units of the First Krajina Corps to carry  out preparations and begin cutting the section from Kocic Han to  Cadjavica, 15 km in length, over Easter.    "The Executive Committee has provided this money to secure  spare parts for machines, tires, batteries, and other necessary  goods, so that the start will be successful. An adequate  quantity of petroleum has also been acquired. Responsible for  the acquisition of the petroleum are `Sinekop,' owned by Slavko  Roguljic, PP `Djukic,' owned by Momo Djukic, and MP  `Poljoeksport' in Banja Luka. The road should be completed by 21  September," read the announcement by Rajko Kasagic, who is also  coordinator of the construction of this road, which will shorten  the connection between Knin and Banja Luka by 60 km.    Engineer Radoslav Brdjanin, minister for urban planning and  construction, and part of the ministry in Banja Luka are  providing project documentation for a shorter variant (in  addition to the longer one to be built); completion of the  shorter route, across the military firing range at Dobrnja,  would shorten the Banja Luka section by more than 5 km.    Engineers from the First Krajina Corps are already on site  in  Stricici, and the 300 soldiers are being provided for by hosts,  including the president of the local community, Dragan Vulin,  who says that the soldiers building the road will have  everything they want because the people are finally getting the  road promised to them back during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.    "By connecting the town, by building small properties and  dwellings in Manjaca, and through work in Banja Luka, we have  the opportunity to move the city to Zmijanje and Manjaca," says  Petar Savarevic from Stricici.    Father Nikodin Cavic of Pervan feels that this road will  bring the cultivated land of Manjaca to life, and with the  industrious Krajinans it will become like the cultivated land of  Sumadija.    "From the production of healthy food, unlimited  possibilities  for raising cattle and meat packing, a return to old trades in a  modern way, to the production of furniture, naturally in small  workshops--cottage industries, as `Simpo' in Vranje is  doing--and then possibilities for three swathes of grass a year  and raising sheep like before the war, with this road this  region has the opportunity to revive and become a significant  factor for development in the republic of Srpska, because  together with Lijevce Polje and the food producers there, food  from Manjaca is the mainstay of development," says Father Cavic.    Something that has not been done in the last 100 years,  something about which Petar Kocic wrote, something that the  authorities of the former SFRY and Bosnia-Herzegovina did not  succeed in doing, something that neither Mamula nor Kadijevic  succeeded in doing, but that they promised to do: It appears  that this will now be corrected and that the Banja  Luka-Cadjavica road (intersecting the Mrkonjic Grad-Kljuc road)  will finally be built. It remains to be seen whether all this  will be happen according to schedule, before the Nativity of the  Virgin Mary, under the difficult conditions of sanctions and  minimal production in an economy that has no market.</p>

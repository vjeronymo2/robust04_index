			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / UN inspectors to quit Baghdad as Iraq bars missile site videos UNITED NATIONS weapons inspectors are to pull out of Baghdad today after failing to persuade the Iraqi authorities to install video cameras to monitor a pair of missile testing sites. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, warned in Washington that the situation could presage another confrontation with Iraq. The renewed tension arose as Baghdad sent a team of negotiators to New York for talks with the UN over a possible limited resumption of oil exports. Mr Nikita Smidovich, the UN weapons inspectors' leader, said his team had tried since June 4 to win the agreement of the Iraqi authorities but were unable to change their position. He said his team would fly out of Iraq today. The UN Security Council has already adopted a resolution warning Iraq of 'serious consequences' if it fails to install the cameras at the Yam al-Azim and Al-Rafah sites, part of the UN's continuing mandate under Gulf war ceasefire resolutions to inspect and destroy Iraq's weapons. In a television interview, Mr Christopher said Iraq's refusal to allow video monitoring was 'a very significant violation' of UN resolutions. 'They've been through a long policy of what's been referred to as cheat and retreat. Maybe they will be in that situation again, but it's a bad sign that our inspectors are having to leave there not being able to proceed with the installation of the cameras.' Iraq has said it would consider installing the cameras only after a broader discussion of arms control with the UN commission scheduled for July 12. The stand-off is likely to raise apprehension in Baghdad about a further punitive western-led military strike on Iraq, following the recent US cruise missile attack on the country's intelligence headquarters. However, no post-Gulf war strike on Iraq has yet been prompted directly by any of the numerous confrontations between Baghdad and UN weapons inspectors. The January 17 missile attack on Baghdad factories linked to Iraq's nuclear programme was essentially a US-led initiative and followed rising tension in the 'no-fly' zone over southern Iraq, after Baghdad had installed anti-aircraft missiles. The stalled UN weapons inspection may, however, cloud the atmosphere surrounding talks due to open in New York on Wednesday between UN legal experts and Iraqi oil ministry officials over a resumption of Iraqi oil sales. The talks will be the first for more than a year on a proposed UN exception to the post-Gulf war embargo on oil sales, permitting Iraq to sell up to Dollars 1.6bn worth of crude to pay for food, medicines and the cost of UN operations in Iraq. The technicalities of such an agreement were decided in Vienna last year, but on political grounds, Iraq refused the terms of the permitted exception to the embargo, which could put more than 500,000 barrels of oil a day into the crude market. Iraqi officials particularly objected to the requirement that UN officials should oversee the distribution of food and medicines paid for under the scheme, saying it was an unacceptable infringement of the country's sovereignty. However, the US last week said it had no objections to such a sale if Iraq complied with UN terms. Oil prices fell around 70 cents a barrel last week on worries about Iraqi crude entering an already glutted oil market.</p>

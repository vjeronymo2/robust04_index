			<p>920608 FT  08 JUN 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y creditors divided into six committees AN ONTARIO court has split Olympia &amp; York's creditors into six committees for the purpose of negotiating a debt-restructuring plan for the crippled property developer. O&amp;Y had proposed five committees, but Mr Justice Blair ruled that holders of securities fully backed by specific buildings should be segregated from a group of five banks which have lesser claims to the properties. Creditors affected by the order have claims on Olympia &amp; York Developments, the Reichmann family's parent company, and on 28 other Canadian companies now under court protection. Their loans make up about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's total CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 11.3bn) debt, and do not include direct loans to the Canary Wharf project in London or O&amp;Y's two dozen US office buildings. The committees represent the following groups: About 30 members of a USDollars 2.5bn jumbo loan syndicate. By far the biggest lender in this group is Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp, which advanced Dollars 750m. Seven banks, led by Citicorp, which provided a Dollars 500m loan secured by O&amp;Y's stake in Carena Corp, a Canadian property holding company controlled by Toronto's Bronfman brothers. Banks and insurance companies which hold Dollars 1.6bn in unsecured loans, swaps and guarantees. Holders of marketable securities, including various issues of bonds, debentures and commercial paper. Lenders to specific projects with a prior claim on those assets. They include holders of CDollars 475m of bonds secured by First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's 72-storey flagship building in Toronto. Four Canadian banks plus Citibank Canada which have subordinated claims to various buildings. Several of the creditors, notably the Canadian banks and Citicorp, are represented on more than one committee.</p>

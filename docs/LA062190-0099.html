			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> REPORT ON PREP SCHOOL  </P> <P> A college prep school in Malibu for grades 7 through 12 would offer students an  alternative to Santa Monica High School and could woo students from private  schools, according to a preliminary report.  </P> <P> The report by the Malibu High School Study Committee found that many Malibu  parents send their children to private schools rather than have them commute to  Santa Monica High, the district's only high school.  </P> <P> In addition, at least one-third of all Malibu children in kindergarten to  eighth grade attend private schools, the committee estimates. As a result,  enrollment at the district's Malibu Park School, which serves kindergarten  through grade 8, has declined and has forced cuts in classes, according to the  report, submitted to the school board this week.  </P> <P> With some upgrading of the library and science labs, the middle school section  of the 32-acre Malibu Park campus could serve grades 7 to 12, the report  states. That part of the campus now has about 300 students but can accommodate  about 1,000.  </P> <P> The proposed school, which would open in September, 1991, may not have as many  electives and extracurricular activities as the 2,700-student Santa Monica  High, but would offer a semi-rural and smaller setting, the report says. There  should be no entrance requirements other than a willingness by students and  parents to "commit to the level of effort required to achieve success in a  rigorous academic program."  </P> <P> A certain number of openings at the Malibu school would be set aside for  students living in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Costs for the 1990-91 planning year are estimated at $82,100, which includes  funds for recruiting minority students. Operational costs would be largely  covered by increased state funding based on increased enrollment, the report  states.  </P> <P> The committee, which includes parents, students and educators, plans to submit  its final report to the board July 9.  </P></p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / MPs voice fears of a drift to large-scale hostilities THE RENEWED military action against Iraq brought the first signs of unease among British politicians yesterday over whether the western allies have framed a coherent strategy to respond to President Saddam Hussein's defiance of the United Nations. But Downing Street, warning of the possibility of renewed attacks unless Baghdad meets its UN obligations, rejected opposition suggestions that the west should seek a further mandate from the Security Council. Prime Minister John Major's support for the latest two strikes was endorsed by Labour and Liberal leaders after government assurances that the attacks were fully in accordance with international law and the terms of existing UN resolutions. A dozen leftwing Labour MPs opposed to the strikes failed to secure an emergency parliamentary debate on the conflict. But concern voiced by opposition spokesmen about the allies' long-term approach to the Iraqi leader was echoed by some senior Conservative MPs after a House of Commons statement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary. Mr David Clark, Labour's shadow defence secretary, and Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, called for renewed debate in the Security Council to secure the broadest possible coalition against Iraqi provocation. Cautioning that the allies could be drifting towards another bout of large-scale hostilities, Mr Clark said that they needed to re-establish a coherent and long-term strategy towards Iraq. Mr David Howell, chairman of the influential foreign affairs committee of backbench MPs, added that military action should be underpinned by a political and diplomatic strategy designed to bolster internal Iraqi opposition. Mr Rifkind stressed that the three countries involved in the latest strike were carrying out the will of the UN. The cruise missile attack was a measured and proportionate response to Baghdad's refusal to allow free access for UN weapons inspections teams. Officials added that there was no need for the west to seek a renewed mandate from the Security Council as long as its response remained proportionate to Iraqi defiance. But there was acknowledgement in Whitehall that if Mr Saddam does not back down, it will be increasingly difficult to allow piecemeal escalation. Mr Rifkind said repeatedly yesterday that military action was a last resort. But he offered no other real options. Mr Major is acutely conscious of the need to remain within a UN framework and of the concern in the Arab world about the legitimacy of repeated strikes. He spoke no fewer than six times to outgoing President George Bush at the weekend before final approval for the latest two strikes was given. But MPs are no longer sure where military action is taking them.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COURTS DELAY TICKETS FOR MIDEAST MILITARY  </P> <P> Military personnel stationed in the Middle East with outstanding citations for  traffic violations or other misdemeanor crimes will not have to appear in court  until they return from active duty, authorities said.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Superior and Municipal courts will allow families of the  personnel to contact base representatives who will notify the court.  </P> <P> Putting the cases on hold will avoid the cost and inconvenience involved in  issuing arrest warrants, said Sheila Gonzalez, the courts' executive officer.  </P> <P> Until families begin notifying officials, the court will not be able to  calculate the actual number of people with outstanding citations, she said.  </P> <P> "We're trying to accommodate them," Gonzalez said. "We don't want them to have  to worry about their court cases at this time. It's a courtesy."  </P> <P> The program is patterned after a similar one in San Diego.  </P> <P> "They're not matters of monumental significance," said Municipal Judge Lee E.  Cooper. "We're talking primarily about traffic violations." KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ  </P></p>

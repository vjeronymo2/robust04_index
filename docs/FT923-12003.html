			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Brittan presses Commission for backing on Nestle bid SIR Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, will today argue that dangerous loopholes could be created in EC competition policy unless the Commission backs him and approves Nestle's bid for Perrier, the French mineral water group. Approval of the Swiss food group's FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.6bn) bid - and of the strict conditions proposed by Sir Leon - would extend Brussels' anti-trust role to allow the examination of situations in which two or more players dominate a market. Sir Leon believes a restrictive interpretation of the 1990 EC merger rules would leave the Community market prey to such large-scale duopolies and oligopolies. Neither the Commission nor member states would have the power to restrict Community-scale mergers which created or strengthened such situations. Some of Sir Leon's colleagues, as well as competition lawyers and the Commission's own legal service, are concerned because the merger rules do not give Brussels explicit power over oligopolies. Commission competition officials argue that such cases are not excluded, and point out that the US, UK and France have all interpreted similar clauses in their merger control legislation to cover oligopolies. The Commission is set to impose strict conditions on the deal, aimed at reducing the potential duopoly of the French market held by the enlarged group and by BSN, the French food company. Nestle/Perrier will have to sell eight mineral water brands to a third buyer. The named brands for sale will include Saint Yorre, a sparkling water, Thonon, a still mineral water, and the spring water Pierval. Volvic, one of the largest brands, will be sold to BSN, as originally planned, but neither that deal, nor completion of the merger with Perrier will be authorised until the Commission has approved the sale of the other brands. There will also be an explicit ban on Nestle re-acquiring the sold brands within 10 years, an obligation to inform the Commission of further purchases in the French bottled water market, and conditions aimed at preventing closer business co-operation between Nestle and BSN. The EC Commission is likely to approve nearly Dollars 1bn of state aid planned for Iberia, the Spanish state airline, despite Sir Leon Brittan's objections. Last week, Mr Karel Van Miert, the transport commissioner responsible for examining airline aid, recommended approval of a FFr1.25bn investment in Air France by BNP, the state-owned bank.</p>

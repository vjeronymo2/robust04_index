			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Profits at Imperial Oil surge to CDollars 84m LOWER crude prices and wider downstream margins enabled Imperial Oil, Canada's biggest integrated oil company, to post a 83 per cent jump in third-quarter profit and a 56 per cent gain in the first nine months. The quarter showed earnings of CDollars 84m (USDollars 62.6m), or 43 cents a share, up from CDollars 46m, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Included are restructuring charges of CDollars 8m, against CDollars 63m. Revenues dipped 5 per cent to CDollars 2.24bn. Nine-month profit was CDollars 225m, or CDollars 1.16 a share, up from CDollars 144m, or 74 cents, on revenues of CDollars 6.7bn, down 1 per cent. Resource profits declined because lower oil prices and volumes more than offset higher natural gas prices and heavy oil output. Chemicals improved. Analysts expect Imperial, which is 70 per cent-owned by Exxon, to report lower fourth-quarter downstream profits and higher resource earnings, while chemicals will break even. Full 1992-1993 net profit is estimated at about CDollars 1.87 a share. Suncor, another integrated group, reported a nine-month profit of CDollars 52m, or 96 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 237m, or CDollars 4.37 cents, including a CDollars 238m restructuring charge.</p>

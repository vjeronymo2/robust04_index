The delegation arrived this morning. It is headed  by Ambassador Simeon Ake. In his statement upon arrival at the  international airport of Bujumbura, Ambassador Ake said that his  delegation will have an exclusively political mission and not a  judiciary one.    Second, the mission will examine in close consultation with  the Government of Burundi and the UN special representative to  Burundi, urgent activities to be done by the United Nations  under the auspices of the UN secretary general, in compliance  with the statement issued by the chairman of the UN Security  Council last 25 November.    During their two or three-week stay to Burundi, the  delegation will meet senior government personalities, as well as  representatives of security forces, together with  representatives of political parties and local organizations  which will have expressed the need to meet them. They will also  meet with the ambassadors of UN member states, representatives  of specialized institutions within the UN system, and other  intergovernmental and regional organizations such as the OAU and  representatives of nongovernmental organizations.

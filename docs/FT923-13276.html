			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Foreign weakness prompts slide in Treasuries US TREASURY prices fell yesterday as weakness in foreign markets overnight carried through into New York trading. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  17/32 at 103 23/32 , yielding 7.673 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down  1/16 at 101 5/32 to yield 4.361 per cent. Trading activity was described as extremely quiet. After late selling on Friday, and early Monday losses in Asia and Europe, it was no surprise that bonds opened lower in the US markets. Traders, searching for an explanation for the lack of strength in Treasuries, cited the weakness in the dollar (which has been undermined by talk of a tightening in German monetary policy) and doubts about the outcome of this year's presidential election. Minds of dealers and investors are likely to remain focused on political risk in the market because of the Democratic National Convention. As for the economic fundamentals, trading will be light until today's June retail sales and consumer prices data is released. Later in the week June industrial production figures will be published, followed by last month's housing data and May's trade balance, all of which should give bond market participants a clearer idea of how the economic recovery is progressing. In the credit markets, after trading at 3 3/16 per cent for the first half of the day, Fed funds firmed slightly to 3 1/4 per cent, the target recently set by the Federal Reserve. The upward move in the rate was achieved without any intervention by the Fed. THE Spanish bond yield curve became even more sharply inverted yesterday as dealers speculated that the Bank of Spain may decide to notch up money market rates ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank meeting. Ten-year Spanish bonds now yield 11.51 per cent, compared with a 12-month rate of 12.87 per cent. The Bank of Spain intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market yesterday to protect the peseta, at Pta63.70 against the D-Mark. Dealers said the currency came under pressure due to worries about a Bundesbank squeeze on monetary conditions, if not a rate rise, at Thursday's meeting. The longer end of the Spanish bond market benefited from good news on inflation, running at 6.2 per cent year on year, according to June figures. The Spanish bond market is currently 'stuck in a spread range of 350 to 380 basis points over bund yields ahead of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty in September,' according to Mr Steve Major, international bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. THE German bund market fell a  1/4 -point yesterday on concerns that the Bundesbank will raise rates at Thursday's meeting. Although many analysts do not expect the key Lombard rate to be altered, the Bundesbank has a number of other options which would allow it to tighten monetary conditions. 'The Bundesbank meeting is the sole focus of the market this week,' one trader said. The new 10-year bund ended at a yield of 7.98 per cent, with some support at a yield of 8 per cent: the price has already fallen 40 basis points since Friday's auction. UK gilt prices dropped half a point yesterday as sterling's weakness continued to depress market sentiment. Dealers reported relatively low volume in the cash market, as prices were marked down early on Monday morning. A technical support level at 98.30 on the gilt future on Liffe is underpinning the market, dealers said. 'The fact that the government has left sterling below the narrow band floor has led to some questioning of government policy on the Exchange Rate Mechanism,' said Mr Adrian James, international bond analyst at NatWest Capital Markets. JAPANESE government bonds ended  3/8 point higher, boosted by speculation that the reserve ratio for commercial banks deposited with the Bank of Japan may be lowered.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL ENDORSES ARMS BAN  </P> <P> The City Council has endorsed unanimously a resolution calling for the state  Legislature to ban the sale of semiautomatic assault rifles. Before the council  voted Monday, several speakers voiced their concern that such a ban would only  ensure that law-abiding citizens would be prohibited from using the weapons in  sporting activities or collections.  </P> <P> But the resolution noted that "urban assault weapons, such as the AK-47 and  Uzi, are military-type, high-powered arms which are inherently not suitable for  home protection or hunting." The resolution, referring to the use of the  weapons by cocaine dealers and violent gang members, said "there is no shelter  nor escape for innocent bystanders caught in the cross fire of urban assault  weapons."  </P> <P> As an amendment to the resolution, Mayor Barry L. Hatch gained support from the  council to urge the Legislature to adopt a mandatory, additional 10-year prison  sentence for those convicted of crimes in which the weapons are used.  </P></p>

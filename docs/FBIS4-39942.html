			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz June 10 TASS -- On his return from  Moscow, Akhsarbek Galazov, president of the Republic of North  Ossetia, informed today members of the Presidium of the  government of the republic of his meeting with Russian President  Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on June 9.    According to Akhsarbek Galazov, "the meeting was fruitful. I  told the Russian president about the situation in the zone under  the state of emergency regime, and the concrete steps being made  by the leadership of North Ossetia on the settlement of the  situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. The road  to peace and accord in the region lies only through  negotiations, and these goals cannot be achieved by forcible  methods."    North Ossetian leaders also discussed issues connected with  the celebration of the 220th anniversary of Ossetia joining  Russia and the 210th anniversary of the foundation of the city  of Vladikavkaz.    The president of North Ossetia proposed within the framework  of these celebrations to organize in Vladikavkaz a meeting of  all leaders of the Caucasian region with the participation of  the president of the Russian Federation and the head of the  Russian government during which it would be possible to consider  socio-political, economic and inter-ethnic problems, as well as  the roads to peace and accord in the region.    During his talks with President Boris Yeltsin, Akhsarbek  Galazov stressed, the two sides also touched on the problem of  signing a full-scale treaty between the Russian Federation and  the Republic of North Ossetia. This would give the possibility  to settle social and economic problems of North Ossetia more  purposively.</p>

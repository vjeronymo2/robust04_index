			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (20): Five steps to be taken with care - How To Choose One / If you plan to dip your toe into the stock market for the first time, the risks attached to a single-company or managed Pep cannot be justified. Collective investments are safer INDUSTRY-WIDE figures may show that Peps are competitive against other investments, but that does not help when you are choosing one particular Pep. The fund management industry has too many players for its own good, and this is reflected in the needless variety of Peps on offer. Some of these give extra choices which will help investors. Others confuse the issue. Stripping out the marketing fluff, you are buying a Pep to gain exposure to equities - sensible only if you are prepared to wait for the long term, and to take some risk - and to gain a shelter from tax. Bear this in mind, and consider the following factors in turn: Self-select or collective trust? Your choice of Pep will be governed first by how equities fit into the rest of your investments. If you already have a share portfolio, then it makes sense each year to transfer the maximum portion of it allowable into a tax-free pocket. As you have already decided on the shares it contains, you will not require any fresh management services for the Pep; so just choose a 'self-select' Pep manager who can offer good administration at a low price. But if you do not already have a large portfolio of equities, and you will be using a Pep to dip your toe into the stock market for the first time, then a single-company Pep, or a managed equity Pep, is more or less indefensible. The risks which come with small, undiversified equity holdings cannot be justified. And this points to unit or investment trusts. How much does it cost? The charges on the Pep (explored elsewhere in this survey) are important, and vary widely. They are known at the time you buy. An even more important factor, unfortunately, is unknowable at the time you buy, and that is how the investment will perform. But there are ways of making educated guesses. Again you have two main factors to consider - asset allocation and individual stock selection. Which sector? These products usually come packaged into sectors to make the asset allocation easy. For example, you can choose between smaller companies, blue chips, and broad European trusts without difficulty. You simply need to decide which will perform best. Each year, the top performers from the industry routinely come from the same sector, so it is obvious that choice of sector is important. However, this is not an argument for investing in the current top performer. For example, gold trusts had a great month in September 1990, and were the strongest sector. But longer-term statistics reveal this was a 'blip' - in the three years to December 1992, commodity and energy trusts lost 28 per cent on average, according to Micropal. That period includes one month in which the sector was the top performer. At present, smaller companies are showing strong signs of revival after a long time in the doldrums, and several managers, such as GT Management, are backing them to outperform, if a strong recovery arrives. Which manager? But then you need to choose the manager who will make the best job of it. This could be tricky. Past performance figures are regularly published in this Review, and provide you with some clues. But it is best to look beyond the current top performers, and short-term high-fliers, to see if any managers have delivered consistent high performance compared with the competition. If a fund is regularly in the top quartile (25 per cent) or decile (10 per cent) of its sector, it is likely to provide a much smoother ride than a trust which occasionally comes out on top, but sometimes dips below average. Also, fund management is a subjective discipline, so that performance varies significantly, according to the individual in charge of the fund. It is therefore important to ask questions about the people managing the trust, and how long they have been in place. If strong performance has been delivered by a manager who has just resigned, it does not count for much. Similarly, it is dangerous to generalise about fund-management groups. Most tend to have their specialisms, and the quality of their personnel will be variable, so that strong performance in one sector does not necessarily mean they will be good in another. Growth or income? Finally, you need to make a choice between growth and income. The more you want one, the less likely you are to be able to deliver the other. In general, income becomes more important as you grow older. Those still deriving a regular income from a salary, who can afford to sit back and wait for an investment to grow, would be better off investing for growth. Income-providing Peps come in two broad varieties. If they are based on a unit trust, then they will hold a portfolio of shares in high-yielding companies - in other words, the dividend they pay out each year makes a higher proportion of the share price than average. These generally aim to deliver a yield 25 per cent better than that of the FT-All Share, which at the turn of the year was hovering around 4.5 per cent, so the income on offer, before charges, should be at least 6 per cent. Such unit trusts bring with them a chance of long-term capital growth. If the income is reinvested, they still tend to outperform trusts aimed at growth, which pay less in dividends. However, as pure income providers, they are likely to be beaten by the special investment trust Pep packages, which use income shares of split-capital trusts to provide a higher yield. In a split-capital trust, all the income from dividends is paid out through income shares, which will only make up a third of the trust's capital. In this simple example, this would make the yield on an income share three times higher than it would otherwise be. High-income investment trust Pep packages should therefore provide a higher yield than income unit trusts, simply because of these technical characteristics. But you do not get something for nothing. In a split-capital trust, other classes of share - typically zero-dividend preference shares and capital shares - will have a superior call on any capital growth. So the chances of a long-term rising income, or of competitive capital growth, are limited if you use this route. Indeed, there is a real risk of capital loss, and in some cases, a loss is guaranteed. This is a trade-off individuals must make for themselves.</p>

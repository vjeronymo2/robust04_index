			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / WPP steps up pressure on investors to support rescue WPP, the UK marketing srevices group which is asking shareholders to approve a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 530m) refinancing at a special meeting on August 5, will this week write to its investors telling them that if the proposals are not passed there will be little alternative but to appoint a receiver. Receivership would leave nothing for shareholders, and would force banks to write off a proportion of their loans. A receiver has been lined up and has been working on a plan which would involve selling the assets and undertakings of WPP to a new company, wholly owned by the banks. This would leave shareholders with a stake in a company with nothing but debts. If WPP's reconstruction failed there could be widespread implications for other companies in trouble. A director of Samuel Montagu, the group's merchant bank, said that if WPP went into receivership after bankers had spent eight months working on a refinancing, 'banks will not bother to work on reconstructions in future. They will put in a receiver on day one.' He was optimistic, however, that the shareholders would pass the special resolutions to be put to them at the meeting. He said the deal was a better one for shareholders than investors in other troubled companies had been offered. The resolutions need to be approved by 75 per cent of those voting in each class of share. Investors will be urged to complete proxy cards if they cannot attend the meeting. The outcome could depend largely on Fidelity, the large US investment group, which last week bought a further 3m preference shares, giving it 10 per cent of that class. Fidelity has told shareholders and analysts it plans to vote against the resolutions. WPP's bankers are puzzled about the institution's motives. The WPP share price has fallen since final terms of the refinancing were fixed on July 1, when the offer to preference shareholders was sweetened, and Fidelity first announced its intention to vote against. From 50p at the start of the month, the shares slid to 37p at Friday's close. Some think the shares will recover if the votes are passed, and that Fidelity is buying for that reason. Others believe Fidelity is trying to force a further improvement in the terms.</p>

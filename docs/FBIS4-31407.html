			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wlodzimierz Lecki, voivoda of Poznan, by </F> correspondents Leszek Luczak and Roman Zielinski; place and date  not given]    [Excerpts] [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Self-government activists  complain that the voivodas are not interested in representing  their positions to the central authorities, that they function  exclusively as government representatives....    [Lecki] Indeed, this does present a rather difficult  problem. A voivoda cannot see himself as a representative of  local self-government structures. Local self-government has its  own representative bodies.    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] But surely a voivoda can support in  Warsaw the recommendations formulated by self-government  activists?  [Lecki] There are local self-government assemblies in  voivodships that were set up especially to represent regional  interests. But the crux of the problem is elsewhere. To what  extent should a voivoda represent the interests of the region  and to what extent those of the state? By definition, most  voivodas hail from the regions in which they hold their office.  They are local patriots who have the interests of their  voivodships at heart. It is the same with me. For example, I  constantly fight for allocation of higher outlays for  investments in the local roads network. The Poznan-Pniewy  highway is already overloaded to the limits of its  possibilities. Decisions involving its modernization are  currently in the balance. I would very much like to be able to  help in this particular matter, among others.    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Do you have much influence?    [Lecki] All I can do is formulate my recommendations. For  example, a large new residential estate recently developed in  Swarzedz is linked by a new road to Highway 2 by a highly  dangerous junction, on which many traffic accidents have already  been recorded. I have made several written representations in  this matter, and they were successful. During this year, the  dangerous road junction will be redesigned and reconstructed as  a so-called level crossing. The reconstruction will cost 30  billion zlotys [Z]. I had asked for a split-level crossing, but  that would have cost Z100 billion, which would be beyond our  budget's capacities.    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] You take part in the Council of Ministers  sessions as a consultant. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which belong to the  government coalition, claim with increasing insistence that they  have differing visions of the planned state administrative  reform. Where do you stand with reference to these differing  positions?    [Lecki] During the government sessions, no differences in  the proposed ways of state administration are apparent between  the ministers hailing from the SLD and those representing the  PSL. The Council of Ministers sessions are conducted in a very  open manner, and I believe that the ministers who participate in  them do say what they think. We often have polemical arguments,  even between ministers from the same political group.    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] So do members of the Waldemar Pawlak  Cabinet want decentralization, or are they not interested in it?    [Lecki] They do want it. The only thing is that they are  after a different option. The Suchocka government wanted to  reform our state administration from the bottom up. To begin  with, they prepared the so-called pilot program, which has  already been implemented. The next stage was supposed to be the  introduction of the new district scheme. But Minister Michal  Strak, head of the Council of Ministers Office, intends to  reform the state administration starting from the top.    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Which of these concepts was more to  your liking?    [Lecki] I would have preferred a reform starting from the  bottom structures. The majority of local self-government bodies  in our voivodship carried out their program very rationally,  according to what they should and what they could do. The  creation of districts will automatically present us with larger  self-government structures, whereas Poznan Voivodship has both  small and large parishes: The smallest one has 3,000 residents  and the largest 600,000. If the district project does go  through, the local authorities would have all of the specialist  services at their disposal--for example, the health service, the  land-surveying services, housing construction, education, and so  on. I believe that such a system would function most  efficiently. My position on this subject is influenced by my  knowledge of the functioning of the district system before the  war. In our part of the country, they proved to be very  effective indeed. Even after the war, despite the restrictions  of the totalitarian system, the district scheme worked well,  creating a sense of local patriotism and commitment. On the  other hand, I am well aware that, in Poland's eastern regions,  they are not particularly keen to see the introduction of the  district system. So the government really finds itself between  a rock and a hard place. [passage omitted]    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Minister Strak insists that local  self-government works well only in small parishes and in  residential estates. Anything larger is not genuine local  self-government. According to him, the problem is that  small-scale local self-government serves mainly to promote the  interests of small local elite groups and individual  self-government activists.    [Lecki] I suspect that there is some reason for Minister  Strak's claims because there is indeed a group of  self-government activists who promote the thesis of the  inevitability of conflict between government and local  administration. Personally, I believe that this thesis is  incorrect. From the example of my own voivodship, I can state  that, in the case of a decided majority of local self-government  structures, there is no conflict at all. At the present moment,  a political conflict has superimposed itself, as it were, on the  apparent conflict between the central and local administration,  the supposed existence of which has been postulated by certain  politicians. The government is of a left-wing persuasion,  whereas local self-government structures are largely represented  by people who cherish right-wing views. I remember a number of  sessions of our local self-government structures at which Prime  Minister Suchocka was present. You could always count on  spirited argument and debate during those meetings. On the  other hand, the debates that took place recently at the Arena  Hall were, in my opinion, below certain adopted parliamentary  standards. Such levels of aggression, encouraged from two  sides, are harmful also for the future of local self-government  structures.    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] How did your cooperation with the  Voivodship Assembly go?    [Lecki] That was during the first term of office of the  newly revived local self-government structures and, naturally,  also the first term of office of the Self-Government Assembly.  The assembly's range of competence was rather unclear and that  was why, especially during the first stage of our cooperation,  certain controversial issues arose. But, by the end of their  first term of office, the common plane of cooperation between  the voivoda and the Self-Government Assembly became much better  defined and more clear.    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] What have you done to prevent the  possibility of corruption in the Voivodship Office?    [Lecki] We have our own monitoring system. We treat all  information, including even anonymous messages, most seriously.  I must stress that, over the past four years, I received only  one message informing me that an official in our office had  taken a bribe. In any case, it was such a ridiculously small  sum of money that it reminded me of a prewar joke: "You must be  especially careful not to offend a civil servant with a bribe  that is too low to match his position."    The Planning Department is the most frequent ground for  leveling accusations of corruption against our officials. This  is because that department usually has to decide in contentious  cases, where the losers usually then accuse the officials  involved of dishonestly and corruption. On the other hand,  privatization is protected with such watertight regulations that  practically no scope for corruption is left. [passage omitted]    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] How much do your officials earn?    [Lecki] I pay salaries of Z7-8 million gross to my  directors. Other employees get much: The average salary is  about Z4 million.    [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Where is the limit of your loyalty as a  government official?    [Lecki] I would like to serve as voivoda for as long as I  can personally endorse the government's policy. The policy  tenets of Prime Minister Pawlak's government are not, on the  whole, much different from those of Prime Minister Suchocka's  government. There are, of course, certain subtle differences,  but they concern details. As for privatization, the principles  of its implementation are no different from those mapped out by  Minister Lewandowski. [passage omitted]</p>

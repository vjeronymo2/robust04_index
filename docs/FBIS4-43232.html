			<p>BFN     [Text] London, 14 Jun (TANJUG) -- British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd today received a Montenegrin delegation headed by  Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic.    The Montenegrin delegation was received this afternoon by  Douglas Hogg, state minister at the Foreign Office, and visited  the British Council.    The Montenegrin delegation also includes Deputy Prime  Minister Kruno Vukcevic and Foreign Minister Miodrag Lekic.    It has been learned from the delegation that the talks  centred on the crisis in former Yugoslavia, especially the  search for a peaceful solution in Bosnia-Hezcegovina. The hosts  asked the Montenegrin delegation to convey their appeal to the  Yugoslav side to help in the establishment of peace in Bosnia by  influencing the Bosnian Serbs to accept the proposed 51:49  territorial ratio.    According to Milo Djukanovic, Montenegro will do all it can  to find a peaceful solution as soon as possible.    The hosts were also informed about the consequences of the  international sanctions on the Montenegrin economy, and the  government delegation requested Britain's aid in opening a ferry  line to Italy for humanitarian reasons, and to enable the  blocked Montenegrin ships to return to their home ports.    The Montenegrin delegation will be meeting members of the  British-Yugoslav group in the British Parliament tomorrow.</p>

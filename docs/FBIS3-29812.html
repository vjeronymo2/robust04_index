Branko Kitanovic, general secretary of the new Yugoslav  Communist Movement, said in an interview with the KCNA  correspondent in his country on Feb. 7 that it was a base  betrayal to a partner of the dialogue and an intolerable  challenge to the fair public opinion that the United States  pronounced an ultimatum, crying for socalled full-scope  inspections and "sanctions".    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can never be  solved  by pressure and threat, he said.    The Mali-Korea Friendship Association said in a statement on  Feb. 4 that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cannot be  solved by means of force and only the dialogue is the realistic  way for the solution.    It strongly urged the United States to immediately come out  to the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks.    The Zambia-Korea Friendship Association strongly demanded in  a statement on Feb. 5 that the United States stop a very  dangerous row of pressure upon the DPRK, implement the promise  to the partner of the dialogue and discharge its duty in the  spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement.    Ranbir Singh, chairman of the Indian Committee for  Supporting  Korea's Reunification, said in an interview with the KCNA  correspondent in his country on Feb. 4 that the United States  must give up its unreasonable pressure regarding the "nuclear  issue", stop the provocative moves for another war and honestly  accede to the DPRK-U.S. talks.</p>

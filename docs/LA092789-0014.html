			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT LAST . . .  </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials are at last moving to reorganize the  administration of Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. Time will  determine whether they have moved fast enough to preserve the federal and state  funding that are essential to the operation.  </P> <P> The reorganization seems to have come reluctantly and belatedly, as much as a  year after facts had made clear that the hospital was not meeting basic  standards and that patients' lives were at risk. Indeed, the central action of  the reform, transferring the administrator, reportedly was weighed months ago  but abandoned in the face of community support for the incumbent. Now there  will be an interim administrator while a national search is conducted for a  permanent leader.  </P> <P> The action followed word from the U.S. Health Care Finance Administration that  the hospital would lose about $60 million in annual federal funding effective  Dec. 21 unless the egregious problems at the hospital had been corrected.  </P> <P> That warning came after state officials had uncovered serious defects in all of  the major areas of operation, indicating a deplorable breakdown in supervision  and administration. The county will respond to the state report on Friday and  to the federal report within two weeks. Those responses will measure the  seriousness of the reform plan.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the audit inspection unit of the County Department of Health  Services is completing an internal investigation, with a report promised within  two weeks. Unfortunately, the county appears to be resisting bringing in  expert, independent, outside professionals to monitor the reform process. Dist.  Atty. Ira Reiner is on record as favoring expansion of the Board of  Supervisors' own investigation to include medical and health-care experts  outside the County Department of Health Services. California abounds with  nationally recognized authorities in all of the affected areas. Their expertise  needs to be mobilized, and quickly.  </P> <P> The special meeting of the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday was called because  county officials "have known for a long time that there are operational  problems at King -- that it's not just a funding problem, but that there's a  need for a shift and change in management," according to the senior deputy of  Supervisor Pete Schabarum. That's an extraordinary admission, seeming to  confirm the earlier finding of state investigators that the supervisors had  failed in their legally mandated responsibility to supervise the hospital and  assure its quality.  </P> <P> The medical center is one of the most important links in the fragile  health-care system of the county. Its staff includes many outstanding  professionals who have served there at personal sacrifice and with distinction.  Their commitment, and the commitment of the hospital to provide quality care to  South Central Los Angeles have been betrayed by those who have failed to  provide prudent, appropriate leadership and supervision and support.  </P></p>

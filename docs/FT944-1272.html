			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Private pensions are no better safeguard Sir, In his reflections on a World Bank study of the looming public pensions crisis, Martin Wolf (Economic Eye: 'Confronting the old age crisis', December 19) concludes that 'governments are absolutely certain to default on their pension obligations, probably by a mixture of higher pension ages, reduced indexation and means testing. The notion that the state can be trusted is just one of several myths punctured by the Bank'. He also refers to the Bank's recommendation of a multi-pillar system in which the public pillar is supplemented by a privately-managed, funded and mandatory system, alongside purely voluntary savings. He ends his column with: '. . .Stop believing in Father Christmas and start saving now.' Martin Wolf may have stopped believing in Father Christmas, but he appears to have kept his faith in the Easter Bunny. If the state is not to be trusted, why recommend privately managed, funded and mandatory pension schemes or even purely voluntary savings? These kitties, too, can be (and have been) raided by the state, without any need for recourse to such coarse mechanisms as outright expropriation or confiscation. The assets owned by private funds or individual savers can be raided through targeted capital levies or a general wealth tax. The income earned on these assets can be taxed in a variety of ways ('unearned' income used to be taxed significantly more severely than labour income in the UK until quite recently) and the consumption financed out of the earnings from these assets can in turn be taxed with a wide range of general or specific instruments. There is a rule of thumb in economic policy reform that says: if you are faced with market failure, deal with it not by tinkering with the symptoms, but by eliminating the root causes of that failure. The same applies to the political system failure diagnosed by Wolf. If the political system is fundamentally flawed in that it does not enable governments to enter into binding commitments ('the state is not to be trusted'), then reform the constitution so as to make it prohibitively difficult or costly for governments to renege on certain classes of commitments. In the case under consideration, this might be achieved in part by requiring heavily qualified majorities for changes in tax and benefit systems. Without such reform Wolf's recommendations amount to saving future pensioners from the guillotine by handing them to the firing squad.

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Setback hits Dublin peace forum Dublin's plans for a cross-party forum for peace and reconciliation in Ireland suffered a setback yesterday when the Alliance party, the only party due to attend which can claim to represent the Protestant community of Northern Ireland, said that it might pull out unless it receives a larger allocation of seats. An Irish government official said Mr Albert Reynolds, the republic's prime minister, would seek to resolve the wrangle when he met Mr John Alderdice, the Alliance leader, on Friday. Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists and Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists have said they will not attend. A boycott by the Alliance would add to the perception among Protestants that the forum is a pan-nationalist front. With regard to seat allocation, a spokesman for the small, non-sectarian Alliance party said: 'Anything less than equal to Sinn Fein is completely unacceptable.' Under the proposed allocation Sinn Fein would have three seats, the Alliance two and the SDLP five. For the republic Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail party would have nine seats, Labour five and Fine Gael six. The dispute comes amid renewed calls from Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party for the UK to reduce its troop presence in the province to underpin the peace process. Dublin is keen to use the forum to build confidence between the two religious traditions on the island. The Alliance is moderate and non-sectarian, and unlike the main unionist parties it favours a Dublin contribution to any solution and is committed to the Anglo-Irish talks. It has never won a seat in parliament but has the same number of councillors as Sinn Fein, received only slightly fewer votes than Sinn Fein at the general election and had a bigger representation at the last Stormont assembly.</p>

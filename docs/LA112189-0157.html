			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES AGAINST RETIREE AID  </P> <P> The House today voted for the third time to repeal catastrophic medical  coverage for retirees, setting the scene for the Senate to offer one last  proposal to salvage some of the benefits.  </P> <P> The House vote was 352 to 63. Senators were preparing to send the House a  compromise offer to kill the unpopular surtax that finances catastrophic  benefits under the Medicare system and preserve some parts of the program.  </P> <P> "At this late date and hour, the only prudent action this House can take is  force the Senate into voting for repeal," Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) said  as Congress looked for a solution to one of the two major obstacles to  adjournment for the year.  </P></p>

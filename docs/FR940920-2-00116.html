The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant, a Massachusetts business trust, is an open-end management investment company. On August 5, 1987, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) and a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A pursuant to section 8(b) of the Act. On that same date, applicant filed a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 registering an indefinite number of shares of beneficial interest. Applicant's registration statement became effective on January 20, 1988 and its initial public offering commenced on March 11, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. At meetings on January 29, March 17 and June 24, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved a plan of reorganization, termination and deregistration of applicant (the ``Reorganization''). Under the Reorganization, applicant would be converted from a stand-alone structure to a master-feeder, series structure. As stated in the resolutions of the board of trustees attached at exhibit E to the application, applicant's board determined that the Reorganization was in the best interests of applicant, and the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Proxy materials relating to the Reorganization were furnished to applicant's shareholders on or about April 29, 1993, and were filed with the SEC on May 5, 1993. At a meeting held on June 18, 1993, a majority of applicant's shareholders approved the Reorganization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On July 9, 1993, pursuant to the Reorganization, the U.S. Fixed Income Portfolio (the ``Master Fund'') acquired all the investable assets and certain liabilities of applicant in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Master Fund. On July 11, 1993, all the applicant's assets, consisting substantially of a beneficial interest in the Master Fund, were transferred to The Pierpont Bond Fund series (the ``Successor Fund'') of the Pierpoint Funds (an open-end investment company) and the Successor Fund assumed all the applicant's liabilities in return for shares of the Successor Fund. These shares of the Successor Fund were distributed tax-free on a share for share basis to applicant's shareholders. Applicant's shareholders received shares of the Successor Fund with an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their respective interests in applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. In connection with the reorganization, applicant incurred legal, accounting, proxy solicitation, shareholder mailing, deregistration and other expenses, all of which were paid by applicant's investment adviser, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicant has no outstanding debts or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant has no shareholders and is not engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. Applicant will apply to be terminated under Massachusetts law. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

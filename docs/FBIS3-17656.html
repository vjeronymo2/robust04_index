			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 59 (549); </F> Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, Edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] "Russia has military strategic interests in  Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] which we must respect. They do not go  against our independence. At the same time, we have the  strategic interest of being together with Russia and cooperating  with it in the military sphere. This does not contradict the  interests of third countries," Turkmen President Saparmurad  Niyazov told the Military Council, speaking about the military  doctrine.    To quote Niyazov, Turkmenistan's military doctrine is of  purely defense nature. Giving preference to legal, economic and  other non-military means of settling conflicts, Turkmenia will  adhere to the principle of "positive neutrality and  non-interference in the internal affairs of other states."    According to the doctrine, Turkmenia will not treat any  state  as a potential enemy. Nor will it join any military bloc, or  keep foreign troops on its territory. (However, after his  speech, Niyazov welcomed Russian specialists' participation in  the development of the Turkmen armed forces -- INTERFAX).    Turkmenistan will be a nuclear-free state and will not equip  its troops with weapons of mass destruction.    The main sources of danger threatening Turkmenistan are  local  conflicts, the threat of using weapons of mass destruction,  attacks on Turkmenistan's facilities, border conflicts, military  buildup in the neighboring countries' border regions and  international terrorism.    Priority is given to the broadening of military cooperation  with the neighboring states, above all Russia.    According to the doctrine, an army grouping is to be created  in Turkmenistan and a mixed procedure of shaping the armed  forces (contracts and drafting) is to be introduced. The  Turkmen armed forces are to be reorganized by 1999. Priority  importance will be attached to the air-defense units, and to  "rapid forces capable of fast re-dislocation.    Niyazov said that the Turkmen armed forces' strength would  be  within the limits of reasonable sufficiency -- 37,000 men. The  current armed forces will therefore be cut down by 2000 men.    The program for reorganizing the defense ministry, announced  on 1 January, provides for establishing a defense and security  council led by the president. The Council will also consist of  Vice Premier Boris Shikhmuradov (deputy head of the Council),  the heads of the local administrations, the leaders of the power  ministries and the ministers of justice and foreign affairs.  The Council will analyze the situation in the Republic and  provide recommendations.    The president also proposed setting up a general staff (375  members), a staff for the armaments and the rear (225 members,  and the command of the air force, air defense and land troops.    Niyazov welcomed cooperation with the Rosvooruzheniya  (Russian arms industry) corporation and announced that a center  for repairing helicopters and factories for the production of  military clothes and footwear would be built. He said that in  exchange for supplies, the Rosvooruzheniya will receive 6 Bn  cubic meters of gas.</p>

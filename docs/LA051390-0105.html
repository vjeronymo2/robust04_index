			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING OTHER SPECIES  </P> <P> Many articles, of which "In Search of Genetic Diversity" (front page, April 26)  is one, describe the value to us of preserving the globe's flora and fauna  because of the potential of advancing medicine and agriculture from this gene  pool. There is also the matter that destroying the forests may increase the  greenhouse effect and inconvenience mankind.  </P> <P> Rarely is it mentioned that species might also deserve saving for a nobler  reason than how they directly benefit humans. I put some priority on the fact  that we, a single, relatively recently arrived species and the other millions  of species are sharing a cosmic journey that deserves continuing.  </P> <P> Our brains have let us create civilization, the industrial and technological  revolutions, and the associated human population increases -- to where now,  while scarcely realizing it, we have assumed responsibility for the fate of the  other species on this non-expanding Earth.  </P> <P> I am heartened by how many people are willing to exert themselves to save  species that do not help with medicine, agriculture, or the greenhouse effect.  For example, Monarca is an organization that works at saving the Monarch  butterfly through preserving its wintering habitats. I suspect that in the long  run we will find that saving "unnecessary" species is more important than we  now realize. It is not just being noble.  </P> <P> PAUL B.

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Sir Brian Kellett: Unigate chief - Obituary Sir Brian Kellett, chairman of Unigate, the dairy, food and distribution group, died on Sunday after a short illness. He was 71. Sir Brian studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, and, after wartime service in operations research at the Admiralty, began his industrial career in 1949 when he joined the St Helens-based glassmaker Pilkington. In 1955 he moved to engineering group Tube Investments, which was later to become TI Group, where he spent 30 years. He was chairman from 1976 until he left almost 10 years ago. He was knighted in 1979. In 1985, only six months after his retirement from TI, Sir Brian was appointed chairman of the Port of London Authority. Before he took over, the authority had lost more than Pounds 52m in nine years. Under his chairmanship, it returned to profitability. Tilbury, its last remaining dock undertaking, was privatised and the groundwork was laid for clearing the authority's government debts. Sir Brian became a non-executive director of Unigate in 1974 and chairman in November 1991. During his chairmanship, the company undertook a number of disposals and acquisitions. The company remains one of the largest dairy groups in Britain with a 16 per cent share of the liquid milk market. In the latter months of Sir Brian's chairmanship the group was involved in early negotiations on supply and price resulting from the government's decision to alter the milk marketing arrangements in place since the 1930s. Sir Brian was also a director at Lombard North Central, and a member of the Royal Commission on Standards of Conduct in Public Life. He was a member of the Industrial Society council, a vice-president of the Engineering Employers' Federation and a governor at the London Business School and Imperial College.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'NAYS' HEARD AS PARLIAMENT ELECTS KRENZ;  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY: NEW HEAD OF STATE SWEARS ALLEGIANCE TO COMMUNISM, WARNS AGAINST  FURTHER STREET PROTESTS.  </P> <P> East Germany's Parliament elected Egon Krenz president today in a ritual made  dramatic when some members voted "no" for the first time.  </P> <P> Krenz then issued a tough warning against street demonstrations, saying  continued agitation could cause a "worsening of the situation, or  confrontation."  </P> <P> More than 300,000 people marched in Leipzig on Monday in the largest protest in  the nation's 40-year history, and more pro-democracy demonstrations are  expected.  </P> <P> Krenz reaffirmed East Germany's allegiance to Communist orthodoxy, despite the  reform sweeping through the Soviet Bloc, but promised to investigate charges of  brutality against pro-democracy demonstrators earlier this month.  </P> <P> The new leader, who succeeded Erich Honecker as Communist Party chief last  week, was in charge of police at the time.  </P> <P> Officials admitted for the first time today that police had attacked peaceful  protesters. In a report carried by the state news agency ADN, the government  said: "There were instances where security officials exceeded their authority  and illegal acts were committed against some of those detained."  </P> <P> ADN said police commanders had apologized to victims of verifiable brutality.  ADN said 83 complaints are under review and prosecutors have taken up four  cases.  </P> <P> Krenz said in his speech that "proper steps will be taken if the evidence  warrants them. Anyone who was treated unjustly has the right to take advantage  of their legal rights."  </P> <P> Twenty-six members of the 500-seat People's Chamber voted against Krenz for  president, although he was the only candidate, and 26 abstained, ADN reported.  </P> <P> It was the first time in East German history that members of the  Communist-controlled chamber had voted against the sole candidate for head of  state.  </P> <P> After his election, the 52-year-old leader declared to the legislators:  </P> <P> "Demonstrations, however peacefully they may be planned and thought out, carry  within themselves the danger of ending in a different way from how they  started.  </P> <P> "That is unsettling to many people, and rightly so. Our society, which has so  many new things to tackle, is thus put under increasing tension."  </P></p>

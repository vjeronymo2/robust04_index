			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. COMMISSIONER'S VOTES APPEAR TO BREAK STATE LAW;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: PLANNING OFFICIAL ACTED ON MISSION VIEJO CO. MATTERS AFTER  ACCEPTING $365 IN GIFTS FROM THEM.  </P> <P> An Orange County planning commissioner may have violated California's  conflict-of-interest law by voting on matters affecting a major development  company within one year after he accepted $365 worth of free golfing  privileges, meals and theater and sports tickets from the firm, records show.  </P> <P> County documents reviewed by The Times show that Planning Commissioner C.  Douglas Leavenworth voted eight times in 1988 on land-use matters affecting the  development plans of the Mission Viejo Co., the firm that designed and built  what is now the city of Mission Viejo and nearby Aliso Viejo.  </P> <P> Leavenworth's votes, all favoring positions urged by the Mission Viejo Co.,  followed his acceptance in 1987 of the gifts from the firm. Leavenworth valued  those gifts at $365 on an annual financial-disclosure statement he filed with  the county and the California Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> State law prohibits elected or appointed officials "at any level of state or  local government" from participating in decisions that "will have a material  financial effect" on any individual or company from which the official has  received gifts worth $250 or more within the preceding 12 months.  </P> <P> Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the state Fair Political Practices  Commission, confirmed that any officeholder violating the $250 gift provision  could face maximum fines of $2,000 per violation, imposed by the FPPC, or  misdemeanor charges prosecuted by the county district attorney.  </P> <P> Referring to officials who accept $250 or more of gifts, Michioku said, "They  must avoid participating in a governmental decision, if it is likely to affect  the financial interest" of the donor.  </P> <P> Leavenworth, who was appointed by then-Supervisor Ralph Clark in 1982 and  reappointed by Supervisor Don R. Roth, said in an interview that he has  violated no law and has "absolutely not" been influenced by the gifts from the  Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> "Not one iota," Leavenworth said. ". . . It's really an insult to suggest that  people are buying our influence by providing us lunch, for Christ's sake. . . .  We're private citizens trying to do our best for the county under very  difficult circumstances."  </P> <P> Orange County planning commissioners are paid $170 for every meeting they  attend. If the commissioners attended the minimum number of meetings held each  year, 84, they would be paid $14,280, according to the commission's secretary.  </P> <P> The five-member Planning Commission holds wide power over whether, or how land  may be developed in unincorporated areas of Orange County. The commission, for  instance, can approve or deny land-use permits, variances and site plans that  are crucial to developers who have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake.  Decisions of the commission can be appealed to the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Leavenworth's votes in 1988 regarding the Mission Viejo Co. encompassed  approvals of the company's proposed area plans and tentative tract maps,  according to Planning Commission records. On April 12, 1988, for instance,  Leavenworth and his colleagues voted unanimously to deny an appeal of a Mission  Viejo Co. tract map for the Aliso Viejo Planned Community. The appeal had been  lodged by The Laguna Greenbelt Inc.  </P> <P> Records also show that over six years, from 1984 through 1989, Leavenworth has  reported receiving $1,207 worth of gifts from the Mission Viejo Co. During that  same period, Leavenworth reported that eight other development-related firms  gave him gifts worth a total of $1,470.  </P> <P> Other planning commissioners have reported receiving gifts from developers. But  none, other than Leavenworth, received more than $250 worth of gifts a year  from any single company, according to the records.  </P> <P> Leavenworth answered questions over the telephone from his home in Anaheim but  declined to grant an interview in person. The commissioner said that he does  not know of any law that prevented him from voting on matters after he had  accepted gifts of any value.  </P> <P> Leavenworth declined a reporter's invitation to show him, in writing, the state  conflict-of-interest law.  </P> <P> The prohibition is contained in the Political Reform Act, the post-Watergate  reform that was enacted overwhelmingly by California voters in 1974.  </P> <P> Leavenworth instead pointed out that Orange County's so-called TIN CUP  ordinance does not apply to him because, as an appointed official, he does not  accept campaign contributions. The county ordinance was designed to prevent  county supervisors from participating in decisions affecting development  companies that give more than $1,808 to the politician's campaign.  </P> <P> Terry Andrus, a deputy Orange County counsel, confirmed that the TIN CUP  ordinance does not apply to members of the Planning Commission. Andrus also  said that the commissioners are subject to the $250 gift ceiling contained in  the state's conflict-of-interest law.  </P> <P> Leavenworth, asked about the eight meals that he reported as gifts from the  Mission Viejo Co. in 1987, said those sessions increased his knowledge of the  matters that he was to vote on. Leavenworth said the meals provided good,  low-key opportunities to ask questions of company executives about a project.  </P> <P> "It takes a couple hours out of your time," said Leavenworth, a retired  aerospace engineer. "And it usually is a very comfortable way to have a  one-on-one discussion. . . . In any case that comes before us, the person that  knows the most about it is the applicant."  </P> <P> Leavenworth also said that he has not been influenced by the $125 worth of free  golfing privileges provided during that year by the Mission Viejo Co. In fact,  Leavenworth said that he has extended a "standing invitation" to David A.  Celestin, the Mission Viejo Co.'s executive vice president for planning and  governmental affairs, to be part of the commissioner's golfing foursome on  Saturday mornings at the Willowick course in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "We're brought into contact and we enjoy the same things," Leavenworth said.  </P> <P> Celestin did not return calls seeking comment. Wendy Wetzel, spokeswoman for  the Mission Viejo Co., said that the company provides gifts to members of the  county Planning Commission and an array of other business contacts.  </P> <P> "We do business with the Planning Commission," Wetzel said. "They're our  business associates."  </P> <P> Asked about the theater-related gifts he received from the Mission Viejo Co.,  Leavenworth said they were, in part, the result of the cultural focus of the  firm and its corporate parent, the Philip Morris Cos. Leavenworth said the  theater-related gifts he reported from the Mission Viejo Co. involved  performances of the Joffrey Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre.  </P> <P> "I think it's a great thing that Philip Morris is doing," Leavenworth said.  "We're happy to support the ballet, in effect, by going."  </P> <P> The FPPC's Michioku said that any official who reaches the $250 gift limit  should abstain for 12 months from decision-making that effects the donor of the  gifts. In other words, if Leavenworth's gifts from the Mission Viejo totaled  $250 as of October, 1987, he should have abstained on matters affecting the  company until October, 1988.  </P> <P> It is not clear from reading Leavenworth's financial-disclosure statement  precisely when he reached the $250 limit. But the records indicate he reached  that point in either November or December of 1987.  </P> <P> The precise date would be important to calculating exactly how many times  Leavenworth's votes affecting Mission Viejo Co. occurred after he reached the  $250 state limit. County Planning Commission records show that he voted eight  times on matters affecting the company in 1988 and 14 times in 1987. Two of the  votes in December, 1987, were clearly after Leavenworth passed the $250  threshold, because they occurred within days after his last reported gifts from  the company that year.  </P> <P> Planning Commission records show that, of the 22 occasions during 1987-1988  that Leavenworth voted on matters affecting the Mission Viejo Co., each time he  took the position sought by company representatives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEAVENWORTH'S VOTES AFFECTING MISSION VIEJO CO.  </P> <P> Planning Commissioner C. Douglas Leavenworth participated in 22 votes in 1987  and 1988 that affected the Mission Viejo Co. In 1987, Leavenworth reported  receiving $365 in gifts from the firm. State law requires officials who have  received $250 or more over a 12-month period to abstain from voting on matters  affecting the gift giver.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: March 10, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Appeal by the Saddleback Coordinating Council of a tentative tract  proposed by the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> Action: On motion of Leavenworth, commission votes 3-2 to deny the appeal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: March 23, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Consideration of a site plan and an area plan proposed by the Mission  Viejo Co.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to approve both plans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: April 13, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Site plan proposed by the Mission Viejo Co. also requested revision to a  finding in a county staff report.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to approve the site plan  and to revise the staff finding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: June 15, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Appeal by activists of Mission Viejo Co. tentative tract map.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to deny the appeal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: June 22, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Site plan of Mission Viejo Co., opposed by representatives of local  Nellie Gail Ranch.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to approve the plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Sept. 14, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Withdrawal of site plan sought by Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> Action: Commission votes 4-1, Leavenworth with majority, to approve withdrawal  of site plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Oct. 13, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Approval of Development Agreement covering Mission Viejo Planned  Community sought by Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to approve the Development  Agreement and to recommend its adoption by Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Oct. 27, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Approval for area plan sought by Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to approve the plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Nov. 10, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Approval for amendment to area plan sought by Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to approve amendment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Nov. 17, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Approval of area plan sought by Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> Action: Commission votes 4-0, with one abstention, to approve the plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Dec. 8, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Delay, sought by Mission Viejo Co., of area plan.  </P> <P> Action: Commission votes 4-1, Leavenworth with majority, to delay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Dec. 15, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Amendment to area plan, sought by Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to approve the amendment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Dec. 21, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Appeal of site plan, sought by Saddleback Area Coordinating Council.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to deny the appeal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Dec. 22, 1987  </P> <P> Issue: Area plan and coastal development permit sought by the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> Action: Leavenworth and colleagues vote unanimously to approve the plan and the  permit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Date: Jan. 12, 1988  </P> <P> Issue: Approval of area plan sought by Mission Viejo Co.

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Risks ahead in Germany WHEN TIMES are hard in Germany, Katastrophe tends to be an overworked word. Yet it is now starting to seem an apt description of the plight of the German economy. The Bonn government, habitually optimistic to the point of insouciance on the economic outlook for united Germany, is forecasting no growth for east and west Germany in 1993. Many German manufacturers are uncompetitive as a result of high increases in labour costs during the 1989-1991 unification boom and the recent rise in the D-Mark against other European currencies. German exporters are thus unlikely to profit more than marginally from any US-led recovery in the world economy later this year. For the first time in the postwar era, Germany this year is likely to register an unfavourable combination of an above-average inflation rate, a current account deficit, zero or negative growth and (if the 'Clinton effect' persists) undue D-Mark depreciation. Deprived of growth in an economy making up more than a quarter of EC GDP, Germany's neighbours face an outlook only a little less sobering. The Brussels Commission's forecast of only 0.8 per cent expansion in EC economies this year indicates that the Community may experience a rerun of the 1981-82 recession. Industrial destruction Against this dispiriting background, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has been labouring to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' with unions and employers. Mr Kohl wants to trade agreement on measures to curb the budget deficit with undertakings from trade unions to hold down wage growth in east and west. The results so far have been disappointing. In trying to reshape Germany's economy to weather a cyclical downturn in the west and a restructuring crisis in the east, Mr Kohl is climbing a mountain. He is still only halfway up the slope. His longer-term objective is to lower the costs of reunification, rising sharply as a result of transfer eastwards of west Germany's rich-economy system of wages, social benefits and regulations. This has hastened east Germany's industrial destruction, and increased the dependency of its population on subsidies. The shorter-term objective is to convince the Bundesbank that inflation, at an underlying 4 per cent, has reached its peak. If Mr Kohl manages to stitch together a convincing package, the Bundesbank should be able to start a new round of discount and Lombard rates reductions next month. The central bank is not yet, however, persuaded that the conditions are right. Exorbitant rises Bundesbank caution is understandable. Wage growth in west Germany, certainly, will slow sharply this year, with many sectors likely to settle for increases of about 3 per cent. But this is a result not of the 'solidarity pact' but of the recession. Mr Kohl has not yet managed to persuade unions to renegotiate exorbitant 26 per cent wage rises payable to east German engineering workers in April. The government should announce that, unless this step is rescinded, it will reconsider its recent decision to inject fresh subsidies into moribund east German industrial regions. On the fiscal front, yesterday's federal government budgetary announcements include some welcome moves to curb tax breaks. But, while avoiding across-the-board tax increases until 1995, the measures fall a long way short of the vigorous attack on public sector spending and subsidies needed to reshape the German budget. There is little sign that the government is considering fresh privatisation measures as a means of increasing revenues. State and municipal governments have yet to show they are prepared to join in Bonn-ordained fiscal austerity. Mr Kohl and his cabinet have so far proved incapable of bringing about the reordering of German economic priorities made necessary by reunification. For two years, the necessity has been unquestioned, including by Germany's leaders. What has been lacking is the will and authority to take action. A long recession would further diminish the room for fiscal and monetary manoeuvre. The Bonn government - and the rest of Europe - must profoundly want to avoid the economic and political dangers of a prolonged downturn. But time is fast running out.</p>

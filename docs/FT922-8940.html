			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Fresh scandals rock Indian stock market THE Indian monetary authorities were anxiously attempting yesterday to prevent an uncontrolled slide in stock prices as fresh financial scandals undermined investor confidence. In an escalating series of disclosures now touching some of the major financial institutions, it was revealed on Saturday that Mr MJ Pherwani, the chairman of the National Housing Bank (NHB), had resigned after his bank failed to make payments due of Rs3.4bn (Pounds 65.9m) on purchases of government securities. Last week NHB, a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, was unable to meet payments due to Canbank Mutual Fund and Deutsche Bank on inter-bank promissory notes known locally as bankers' receipts. These are notes which banks have issued to each other to register the transfer of government securities because of long delays in the Reserve Bank's own clearance system. Mr Pherwani's resignation is seen as an ominous signal because he took a strongly bullish view of the market when chairman of the Unit Trust of India (UTI), the largest state-owned mutual fund. NHB was to have paid Rs3.4bn to Canbank with funds owed to it by Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker whose activities are now under investigation by a government-appointed committee of inquiry. Mr Mehta was recently forced by State Bank of India, the largest state-owned bank, to settle payment on Rs6.2bn of bankers' receipts. This precipitated the slide in stock prices. Until reaching a peak on April 22, the Bombay stock market had more than trebled in value over the last year. Since the slide began, the index has fallen 18 per cent. The fears now are that Mr Pherwani's resignation will have a chain effect as other banks come under scrutiny. Bankers believe that there could be as much as Rs30bn-Rs40bn of outstanding loans issued as bankers' receipts to finance stock purchases.</p>

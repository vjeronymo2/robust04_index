Posvyanskiy, RAS Institute of Radioengineering  and Electronics, Moscow, Russia]    [Abstract] Resonant-tunnel diodes (RTD) based on GaAs/AlAs  heterostructures were produced using the method of  molecular-beam epitaxy, and their static volt-ampere  characteristics were examined. A two-barrier structure (TBS)  with a 14 nm thick non- doped GaAs layer as a spacer was grown  on a 1.5 m thick n[.sup]+[/]-GaAs (doped by Si) with a 3 x  10[.sup]18[/] cm [.sup]-3[/] concentration of impurity.  2.5 nm thick AlAs layers were grown as TBS barriers. A 4.5 nm  GaAs layer was used to form the TBS potential well. The  difference in optimal temperatures of growing GaAs and AlAs  constitutes the particular feature of growing this structure.  Because of this feature, the temperature of the substrate was  varied during the growing process. The TBS was grown at the  substrate temperature of 690C, and the GaAs layers at the  temperature of 620C. Differences were detected in the  volt-ampere characteristics of the RTD produced on identical  heteroepitaxial structures. An equivalent RTD model is proposed.  The volt-ampere characteristics of the RTD were computed within  the framework of this model for different conditions. Figures 5,  references 7: 1 Russian, 6 Western</p>

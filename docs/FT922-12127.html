			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / People: ICI challenge for Brogden Michael Brogden, a chemical engineering graduate from Leeds University, will need all his skills in alchemy to transform ICI's Chemicals and Polymers division where he has just been appointed chief executive officer. The division is ICI's most pressing problem. From peak profits of Pounds 452m in 1989, it crashed into losses during the last quarter of 1991 and is expected to report further losses during the first quarter this year. Its plight is not helped by the state of the bulk chemicals sectors, such as plastics and petrochemicals, which are in trouble generally. ICI explained that Brogden, who is on holiday, would not want to talk about his plans until he had spoken to the employees. A former general manager of personnel at ICI's group headquarters, he will probably continue scaling down the workforce; the division has already said it wants to cut 4,700 jobs from its 38,000 workforce. Brogden may also want to continue the policy, established by his predecessor, Ralph Hodge, of disposing of non-core businesses. Both the salt and the soda ash businesses have been sold in recent months. There are also rumours that the division could be sold or or floated. ***** Stephen Howard, chief executive of group corporate development at COOKSON, has been appointed a director and chief executive of the engineered products division. Howard graduated from the University of Michigan Law School and joined Cookson America in 1985. ***** Bob Muir and Adrian Busby have been appointed chief executive and deputy chief executive, respectively, of Booker Belmont Wholesale. Terry Noble has been appointed chief executive of the Food Service Group. These moves follow the splitting of BOOKER's food distribution business into two parts. ***** Alan Marshall, who had been responsible for Sims Food Services before it was sold, has been appointed md of RUSSELL HUME, a division of the Sims Food Group. ***** Michael Day has become company secretary of VSEL CONSORTIUM in place of Julian Davies who has been appointed finance director of its subsidiary Cammell Laird Shipbuilders. ***** David Jenkinson, md of The Catering Guild, is also appointed md of Vendepac; both are subsidiaries of the TM GROUP. ***** Malcolm Naylor, formerly sales and marketing director of Baxi, has been appointed marketing director of Potterton Myson Boiler Group, part of BLUE CIRCLE Home Products.</p>

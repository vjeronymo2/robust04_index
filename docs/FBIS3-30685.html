The bill determines general rules for broadcasting and  specific provisions for public service media and commercial  media.    Under the bill, parliament will set up public foundations to  provide guarantees for the operation of Hungarian Radio and  Hungarian Television as public service media. The assets of the  foundations will be handled by boards of trustees.    The presidents of both media will be appointed by the  president of the republic, at the prime minister's proposal.    Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television will be controlled  by large supervisory committees, representing all strata of  Hungarian society. The boards will operate independently from  the public foundations.    The bill specifies a general framework for the operation of  local public service broadcasters, guarantees their independence  from the local authorities, and creates the necessary social  controls.    Parliament held a vote on a former version of the media bill  in late December 1992, at which time it was rejected.</p>

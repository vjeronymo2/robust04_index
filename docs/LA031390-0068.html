			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> WILL GORBACHEV'S REFORMS BRING BREAKUP OF NATION?  </P> <P> Who lost Lithuania?  </P> <P> That question is bound to arise if Lithuania secedes from the Soviet Union as  desired, and with it will come tougher, more fundamental questions about the  ultimate impact of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's liberalizing reforms.  </P> <P> In permitting the upsurge of ethnic nationalism and then not suppressing  secessionist drives, has Gorbachev not created conditions for the breakup of  the whole Soviet Union? If Lithuania goes, what will bind Latvia and Estonia,  the two other Baltic republics, Azerbaijan or Georgia in the south, Moldavia on  the Romanian border, or the Ukraine?  </P> <P> In withdrawing the Communist Party from day-to-day management of the government  and the economy, and then accepting a multi-party political system, first of  all in Lithuania, has Gorbachev not stripped the party of its authority and  even its legitimacy? Will the party's decision to yield its monopoly on power  not bring its downfall?  </P> <P> What will Gorbachev's reforms have achieved if the Soviet Union has been left  in political chaos and dismembered as a state? And would his liberalism survive  such developments?  </P> <P> Gorbachev's political survival will undoubtedly depend on his ability to defend  himself from these and other charges that his policies have brought the  collapse of the Soviet Union as a superpower and as the leader of world  socialism.  </P> <P> He has long argued that the country's multiple political, economic and social  crises are the result of its prolonged stagnation under the late President  Leonid I. Brezhnev and the "deformation" of socialism that occurred earlier,  notably under dictator Josef Stalin.  </P> <P> Glasnost, or political openness, may have brought suppressed problems to the  surface, Gorbachev has contended, but it did not create them. And without such  openness, they could not be solved.  </P> <P> In Gorbachev's view, Lithuania's complaints -- starting with its forced  incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940 under a deal between Stalin and  Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany -- only confirm the need for radical  political and economic reforms, including the establishment of a new federal  system for the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But such arguments run counter to the temper of the times and receive less and  less of a hearing here.  </P> <P> Confidence in perestroika, as Gorbachev's reforms are known, is declining,  according to all recent opinion surveys here. After five years under his  leadership, the country has grown increasingly impatient, and the mood is one  of growing pessimism.  </P> <P> The belief in liberalism that grew in the first three or four years of  perestroika has given way to the conviction that a "strong hand," even "an iron  rod," is needed to bring the country to order and ensure progress.  </P> <P> In this political atmosphere, many would interpret Lithuania's decision to  secede from the Soviet Union as the first step in the dismemberment of the  country -- and evidence that perestroika is consequently failing.  </P> <P> The apparently analogous loss of Eastern Europe as the Soviet Union's buffer  with the West might have been a major political and military setback -- Moscow  contended that it was not -- but the psychological impact was relatively small  since most people here, in fact, welcomed those changes.  </P> <P> Lithuania's secession is different. This is Soviet territory that would be  lost, and it is Soviet security that will be directly diminished by this gap in  its defenses. This is Soviet socialism that was overwhelmingly rejected in  Lithuania's parliamentary elections, and this is Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet  reformer, whose vision of a better future for the country inspires no hope in  Lithuania.  </P> <P> Lithuania's secession, in this context, would have the effect of validating the  criticism of Gorbachev and perestroika that is accumulating so steadily. And,  with discussion about a possible military takeover now relatively commonplace  in Moscow and other Soviet cities, though such talk is totally speculative, the  question would be whether the army -- were it to replace the party in running  the country -- would have tolerated the secession.  </P> <P> The point is not that Lithuania, with its 3.6 million people, would be such a  great loss for the Soviet Union, whose population is now nearly 290 million,  nor that the small republic's agricultural output and production of electronic  goods are essential to the Soviet economy.  </P> <P> Nor is the point that perestroika hinges on the future of Lithuania. The  crucial test for Gorbachev's reforms remains that of the shop shelves: how soon  perestroika will improve the supplies of food and consumer goods, how soon it  will redeem its promises of a better life.  </P> <P> What Lithuania would become in its secession is a point of acute political  vulnerability on which Gorbachev would have difficulty defending himself. His  low-key response Monday to the Lithuanian action -- criticism and then a call  for legislative assessment -- reflected his need not to focus attention on the  likely breakup of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Gorbachev himself, however, had told the Lithuanians during a visit there in  January that his fate was now tied to their decision on whether to remain part  of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Soviet leader's options are few.  </P> <P> At considerable political risk, he had committed his prestige in December to an  unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Lithuanians not to quit. He has offered  them maximum autonomy, political as well as economic, within a restructured  federal system. He has borrowed many of their ideas for reforms for the country  as a whole. He has met repeatedly with Lithuanian Communist Party officials and  other leaders from the republic.  </P> <P> The failure of these efforts has already diminished his political position, and  further inducements appear likely to fail.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has tried more recently to discourage Lithuania with demands that it  repay about $34 billion in investments and other debts to central government if  it leaves. He has warned that trade between Lithuania and the Soviet Union  would have to be put on a dollar basis at terms unfavorable to Lithuania. And  he has even talked of those wanting to retain their Soviet citizenship leaving  Lithuania, and Lithuanians in the Soviet Union being asked to move back.  </P> <P> Lithuanians feel that he might use the greater powers that he is likely to  receive later this week as the Soviet Union's first executive president to  declare a state of emergency, suspend the new Lithuanian government and take  over administration of the republic himself.  </P> <P> This would probably help restore Gorbachev's domestic image as a strong,  resolute and decisive leader, one able to cope with the array of crises  confronting the country.  </P> <P> Short of force, however, Gorbachev has little leverage, certainly not to bring  a total Lithuanian retreat, and he long ago ruled out the use of force in favor  of political solutions to the country's problems.  </P> <P> Gorbachev also seems to lack the will to take such action, even though the  political cost to him of Lithuania's secession might be even greater than the  criticism he would encounter abroad if he intervenes.  </P> <P> This leaves him pursuing his economic reforms at a faster pace in anticipation  that they will soon show results here, promoting his political reforms in the  hope that somehow they will satisfy both right and left and -- using Lithuania  as an object lesson -- accelerating the restructuring of the Soviet Union's  federal system.  </P></p>

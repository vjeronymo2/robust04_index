			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: KIO executive quits paper unit MR MAHMOUD al-Nouri, chief executive of Grupo Torras, the Kuwait Investment Office's troubled holding company in Spain, has resigned as chairman of the group's paper unit, Torras Papel. His surprise move underlines the increasing uncertainty that surrounds the KIO's Spanish business operations. Torras Papel, the leading domestic newsprint and writing paper producer, is under severe pressure from two of its main creditors, Lloyds Bank and Bank of America, the UK and US banks. It is also facing legal proceedings by Sarrio, the Italian-owned cardboard producer, over outstanding debts totalling Pta8.6bn (Dollars 72m). Quelling rumours that Torras Papel might be forced into receivership, Mr al-Nouri said that the paper producer was 'on the right track' to financial recovery and that he had left the company in order to 'concentrate on the overall strategy of Grupo Torras.' However, Lloyds and Bank of America are insisting on the rapid payment of overdue interest and Lloyds, which is owed Pta250m on a Pta2.5bn loan, has already obtained a court order in Spain embargoing Torras Papel assets. Payment of the interest is understood to be dependent on the sale of Grupo Torras' insurance unit, Amaya, but this unit has, in turn, been embargoed by the regional government of Catalonia, which is claiming unpaid back taxes. Lloyds and Bank of America have part of their loans to Torras Papel secured by shares in the Kuwaiti group's food company Ebro Agricolas, but plans for the latter's sale appear to have stalled. Sarrio's lawsuit centres on two outstanding instalments owed by the Kuwaiti group following the purchase by Torras Papel of Sarrio's paper assets in February 1991.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO NASTY MARINES  </P> <P> On June 27, Calendar reported that Marine Corps officials in a number of bases  have removed 2 Live Crew's rap album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" from base  stores ("The Marines Have Landed -- on 2 Live Crew"). I guess the reasoning is  that young and impressionable troops don't know what's best for them.  </P> <P> This is, of course, outrageous.  </P> <P> If young Marines are mature enough to decide they're willing to die for this  country and its First Amendment freedoms, they're mature enough to enjoy these  freedoms and decide what music they will listen to. Were the (probably  predominantly white and middle-aged) censors willing to die in their place, it  might be another matter.  </P> <P> The article says Camp Pendleton's Lt. Col. G. C. Schoppe "reviewed the record  personally" before he pulled it. My tax dollars were spent to pay a military  officer to listen to rap? Oh well, I suppose some good may come of it. At least  it will keep alive the Marine tradition of moral purity that produced Col.  "Shredder" North.  </P> <P> BRUCE ALLEN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

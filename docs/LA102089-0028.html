			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PACIFIC NORTHWEST;  </P> <P> OLD FORESTS WOULD BE SAVED UNDER PLAN  </P> <P> A top U.S. Forest Service official, Associate Chief George M. Leonard, said his  agency has adopted a policy for managing forests that would lead to the  preservation of about half of the old-growth forest lands that are unprotected.  But environmentalists questioned whether the policy is specific enough to have  a serious impact on timber sales in the old-growth forests, areas where rare  species such as the spotted owl thrive in centuries-old habitats. The  Wilderness Society estimates there are 2.4 million acres of old-growth in the  Pacific Northwest, of which 1.6 million acres are not protected from  clear-cutting.  </P></p>

Argentina has asked Brazil for  "compensation" to its growers to counterbalance the "unfair  competition" from the Canadians. The Itamar Franco government  has, however, already made its decision: "The state does not  intervene in the grain market, which is absolutely free."    In a conversation with CLARIN, Foreign Trade Secretary  Renato  Marques said: "As of 1991, wheat purchases are no longer  handled by the state. Today private parties freely import  wheat. Brazil no longer exercises foreign trade control."    [CLARIN] There was the situation when Brazil granted  Argentina compensation after confirming that U.S. wheat sold to  Brazil was subsidized...    [Marques] That was an entirely different case. The United  States was exporting wheat under the Export Enhancement Program,  and this involved oficial recognition that wheat was being  subsidized.</p>

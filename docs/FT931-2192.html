			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Decree revives memories of 1917 bloodshed THE CIVIL war which engulfed Russia after the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917 and foreign countries intervened in the conflict is a powerful memory etched on the minds of most Russians. It has never loomed as large as now, with President Boris Yeltsin declaring special rule-by-decree pending a referendum next month to let Russians decide whether he or parliament should rule the country. Fears of a new split in the army, seven decades later, prompted Mr Yeltsin, as commander-in-chief, to order the armed forces to stay out of politics. But although he declared yesterday that the army would remain neutral, Gen Pavel Grachev, defence minister, was inevitably taking sides when he signed a government statement supporting the president. Gen Grachev, who owes his position to his support for Mr Yeltsin in resisting the August 1991 coup, was joined by the security and interior ministers, who also pledged their respect for 'constitutional principles'. In supporting Mr Yeltsin's gamble to break a constitutional deadlock by violating a Communist-era constitution, the heads of the three so-called power ministries must now hope that they backed the right horse in the conflict with parliament. For this to happen, they must also rely on the forces they command - the armed forces, the police and the successor organisation to the KGB - to keep on obeying orders. Passivity and indifference have been a dominant sentiment in the armed forces to date. But the parliament has already picked up a powerful ally: Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, who is not only a popular politician but an air force general. Gen Rutskoi's first concern is to position himself as a successor to Mr Yeltsin if everything goes wrong. He could, however, also come to capitalise on discontent in the armed forces if corruption is not dealt with, living conditions continue to deteriorate and the troops are pulled into situations where they might have to choose sides. 'We are in shock, we are in a trance about what President Yeltsin did. We do not like it,' said one Moscow police officer yesterday.</p>

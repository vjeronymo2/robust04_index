			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits down at SA Gold Fields' mines despite price rise GOLD mines in the South African Gold Fields group performed disappointingly during the March quarter, with net profits slightly lower despite a firmer gold price and successful containment of costs. After-tax profits fell to R267.4m (Dollars 84m) from R270.2m in the December quarter. At the operating level, however, the group improved, with operating profits rising by 9.5 per cent to R330.8m from R302m. The quantity of gold produced was largely unchanged at 30,575kg compared with 30,661kg, but sales revenue rose to R1bn from R981.9m due to a better average gold price of R32,716 per kg, up from R31,988 per kg. Production costs fell to R21,934 per kg from 22,175 per kg. The group results suffered, however, from a fall in net sundry revenue to R13.98m from R42.5m in the previous quarter, when the figure was boosted by seasonal dividend payments and fire insurance pay-outs. Driefontein, the group's largest mine, had a better working quarter, with East Driefontein recovering from a poor December performance. Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said West Driefontein had shown an improvement, 'but not enough'. Net profits rose to R139.7m from R137.4m. At the Kloof mine, a good performance from the Kloof division was offset by a R10.5m operating loss at the recently-integrated Libanon division. This was the result of disruption to production caused by a fire. Mr Munro said he was determined and confident that the division would soon be paying its own way. Fires also affected production at Deelkraal, which, in Mr Munro's words, had 'a very poor quarter'. A 20 per cent decline in the ore milled fed through to the bottom line, with after-tax profit falling to R3.4m from R13.7m the previous quarter. This compares to capital expenditure during the quarter of R10.6m. The marginal Doornfontein mine turned a R6m loss the previous quarter into a R3.4m profit thanks to clean-up operations. The mine is heading towards becoming a surface dump operation, in which old waste dumps are reworked to extract residual gold, and Mr Munro said the possibility of closure remained strong.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to the Ministry of National Defense [MND]  and the field army on 22 March, North Korean loudspeaker  announcements heard on the South's east and midwest frontlines  near the DMZ have begun calling Kim Chong-il "president  [chusok]" since early March instead of the usual "beloved and  respected leader" or "supreme commander of the army." Noting  that the change coincided with the resumption of dialogue,  including the working-level contacts between the South and the  North, relevant authorities including the MND are speculating  that this may mean a change in system, including the complete  transfer of North Korea's supreme power to Kim Chong-il, or a  change in policy toward South Korea.</p>

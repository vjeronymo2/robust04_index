			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Gore warns over greenhouse gases Global climate change is more dangerous to the US than the British navy was to the American colonists in their war of independence, Vice-President Al Gore warned yesterday in a call for more action to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. 'Our enemy is more subtle than the British fleet. Climate change is the most serious problem our civilisation faces,' Mr Gore told government and business officials working on climate change issues, who he described as 'the Paul Reveres of the environmental movement'. But as Mr Gore issued his warning, scientists were questioning whether the US was doing enough to reduce its own emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are widely believed to contribute to global warming. The US, like other signatories of the Global Climate Treaty agreed in Rio de Janeiro two years ago, is committed to bringing emissions of greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels by the year 2000. For the US, which produces around one fifth of the world's greenhouse gases, that means a return to annual emissions of 1.24bn tons of carbon dioxide, from a level that reached 1.37bn tons last year and is still climbing. A study issued yesterday by the Union of Concerned Scientists argued current climate change plans are likely to achieve a reduction in emissions of only about 34m tons over seven years, roughly a third of what is needed. After the Clinton administration failed to pass a significant increase in energy taxes, which would have cut fuel consumption and thus emissions, it has focused largely on voluntary efforts with industry. The Energy Department this week signed an agreement with five large electrical industry associations to promote more energy-efficient commercial technologies, to invest in forest management and tree-planting, to develop the market for geothermal heat pumps and to promote electrical vehicles. Mr Gore yesterday ridiculed those who argue the threat of global warming was not yet scientifically proven, comparing them to the tobacco industry executives who claim that there is no firm proof that smoking causes lung cancer.</p>

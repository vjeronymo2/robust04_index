			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Riordan LA win setback for Clinton MR RICHARD RIORDAN, a white conservative Republican lawyer and financier, has been elected mayor of Los Angeles, in an upset for the Democratic party and a setback for President Bill Clinton, who had endorsed his opponent, Mr Michael Woo, a Chinese American liberal Democrat. Mr Riordan's election reflects a high voting turnout among the affluent suburban and predominantly white segments of the electorate, where he has drawn strong support. Although only 40 per cent of Los Angeles voters are white, they typically make up two-thirds of those who cast their ballots. However, his victory signals a deepening chasm between racial and economically disparate groups in the second largest US city, sections of which were devastated by last year's riots. 'Fear and despair must come to an end. We must create a will in every Angeleno to turn this city around,' Mr Riordan declared at a victory rally on Tuesday night. However, critics give him low marks as a consensus-builder and question his ability to unite the city's diverse population. Mr Riordan, 63, will succeed Tom Bradley, a Democrat and one of the first black mayors of a large US city, who is retiring after 20 years in office. Mr Riordan spent Dollars 3m of his own money and raised an additional Dollars 3m to sell himself to Los Angeles voters as a political outsider who is 'tough enough to turn LA around.' Citing his business accomplishments, including the turnaround of Mattel, a toy manufacturer that faced insolvency in the mid-1980s, Mr Riordan succeeded in persuading voters that he could bring new jobs to the city at a time when local industry is being hit by cutbacks in defence spending. During the election campaign, Mr Riordan tried to distance himself from such former business associates as Michael Milken, the junk bond dealer who was convicted of securities fraud. 'My involvement with Mike Milken has been in a charitable context,' said Mr Riordan, who serves on the board of the Milken family Foundation. The centrepiece of Mr Riordan's election campaign has been a plan to lease the LA International airport to private industry and to use the income to hire 3,000 additional police officers. He reasoned that if people feel safer in LA, businesses are more likely to be attracted to the city. Opponents of Mr Riordan question the viability of the airport deal. They also charge that Mr Riordan represents a throwback to the days when political power in LA was held by an elite of predominantly white businessmen. One of the biggest challenges facing Mr Riordan when he takes office on July 1, will be to win over the city council, which is dominated by Democratic liberals and holds veto power over some of the city's most important commissions, including those that run the airport and water and power departments. Mr Riordan, a Princeton philosophy graduate and a University of Michigan graduate in law, moved to Los Angeles in 1956 to work for a law firm. He is a land developer and investment banker. Mr Riordan has long exerted his influence in LA politics through large campaign contributions and service on various commissions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station reporter (Cai Xiaoling): "Let the </F> Sprit of Law Enforcement Strike Root in Economic Life"; from the  "News and Press Review" program]    [Text] Improvement of the legal system has been a focal  topic at the National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] sessions year  after year. In his latest government work report, Premier Li  Peng again emphasized the needs for a sound legal system to  guarantee the establishment and perfection of a socialist market  economic system; and the necessity of governments at all levels  to learn to use legal means to govern economic and social life.    We may as well say that notable achievements have been made  in improving the legal system, especially economic legislation,  over the past more than a decade. However, we should also  realize that law enforcement and awareness in the Chinese  economic life leave much to be desired. Many NPC deputies and  CPPCC members have deplored a pervasive weak sense of law  enforcement and failure to observe laws, strictly enforce them,  and punish lawbreakers in economic life. In reality,  legislation is important, but law enforcement is even more  important. Failure to enforce laws is tantamount to  lawlessness. Only by paying equal attention to law enactment  and enforcement can the legal system serve as a guarantee for  economic development.    Deputies and members said: At present, a considerable number  of officials, including those directly engaged in economic work,  often interpret market economy simply as free economy. As a  result, lawbreakers are not aware of their violation of the law  and, when confronted by law enforcement personnel, defend their  actions with perfect assurance. There were even such strange  occurrences of law violators adamantly filing law suits against  baffled law observers. Apparently much remains to be done to  enable the people to reach a consensus of identifying market  economy with the economy ruled by laws.    It is heartening that the Eighth NPC and its Standing  Committee have, since their inauguration, given top priority to  accelerating legislation, especially economic legislation. Of  the laws currently in force, some 170 were promulgated between  the PRC's founding and the end of 1992. However, during their  tenure, the Eighth NPC and its Standing Committee have planned  to enact 152 laws. So far, a number of important laws for  developing the market economy, standardizing the norms for the  market, keeping the market in order, and tightening  macroeconomic regulation and control -- such as the Company Law,  the Law Against Unfair Competition, and the Law for Protecting  Consumers' Rights and Interests -- have been promulgated; and  efforts are being stepped up to formulate the Securities Law.  Last year is the year in which the largest number of laws and  decisions on laws were examined and approved since the founding  of the country. We are convinced that along with the continuous  improvement of China's legislative work, the concept of law  enforcement will surely strike a deeper root in the hearts of  the people and their economic life, and that the goal of  establishing a socialist market economy will certainly be  smoothly realized with the guarantee of a sound legal system.</p>

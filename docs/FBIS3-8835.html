Mr. Hajdari spoke about the  commission and the work of the parliament in support of the  democratic reforms and discussed new legislation passed by the  parliament. Mr. Bouvard appreciated the great work carried out  by the commission in revising Albanian laws, which are now  completely different from those which existed under the  communist regime. Further on, Mr. Bouvard spoke of the role of  the North Atlantic Assembly he directs, in the field of defence  and security of its member countries. "I am also happy for the  unanimous efforts of the member countries of our alliance to  accept Albania as an associate member in the pact. We consider  it a moral obligation toward your country because you have  suffered for 50 years under a communist dictatorship. Our  alliance follows attentively the efforts of the people of  Kosova, led by their honoured President Rugova, under Serbian  occupiers, in defence of their human rights." Mr. Bouvard also  underlined the efforts of the alliance not to allow a spillover  of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina toward the south. [passage  omitted]</p>

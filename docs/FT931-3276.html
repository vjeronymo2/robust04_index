			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BBA gets Pounds 58m for stake BBA, the engineering group, yesterday sold its 57 per cent stake in Pacific BBA, the Australian industrial and automotive manufacturer, for ADollars 122.5m (Pounds 58m). The shares were placed with institutions. The sale reduces BBA's net debt, which stood at Pounds 227.5m in December, bringing down gearing from 61 per cent to 44 per cent on a year-end basis. Mr Peter Clappison, finance director, said this was about the group's 'comfort level' for gearing. BBA's share price gained 7p to close at 171p. The group said it was concentrating on developing its core operations in Europe and North America. It has a policy of disposing of non-core activities 'depending on their performance and the interest among potential buyers'. The diversified group, which has automotive, industrial and aviation divisions, defines a core business as having a strong international market share, technological leadership and where barriers are high to the entry of competitors. In terms of acquisition priorities, Mr Clappison said the most likely area would be the industrial division. This was the biggest contributor to the group's Pounds 47.4m pre-tax profit, on sales of Pounds 1.32bn, announced last week. Pacific BBA had been operating as a separate entity within the group, particularly since it gained a listing on the Australian stock exchange in November 1989. Mr Peter Cottrell, Pacific BBA chairman, said it was 'pleasing to be able to reverse the trend of overseas acquisitions of Australian assets'. The company's priorities lay with expanding in the Asia Pacific region. Earlier this month Pacific BBA announced a rise in after-tax profit to ADollars 9.78m (ADollars 7.51m) for 1992 on sales of ADollars 291m. Its contribution to BBA's profits after tax and the minority deduction was Pounds 2.7m. Pacific BBA shares closed 14 cents higher at ADollars 2.90 on the Australian stock exchange.</p>

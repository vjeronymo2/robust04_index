			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Viktor </F> Shulman and AZERTAJ correspondent Natig Abdullayev]    [Text] Kazakh (Republic of Azerbaijan), 12 Mar -- The  Armenian Armed Forces should leave within 20 days the territory  of the Gubadlinskiy, Fizulinskiy, Dzhebrailskiy, Kelbadzharskiy  Rayons of Azerbaijan that they occupy, and also the populated  areas of the Lachinskiy Rayon of the republic, with the  exception of the so-called Lachinskiy corridor. A preliminary  agreement on this was reached today during talks between Rasul  Guliyev and Babken Ararktsyan, head of the parliaments of  Azerbaijan and Armenia that took place in the Kazakhskiy Rayon  of Azerbaijan on the frontier of the two republics. It went on  for about an hour and a half behind closed doors in a specially  isolated carriage set up on the border of the two Caucasian  republics.    Reporting this at the news conference that took place at the  end of the talks, Rasul Guliyev noted that under the accord, the  Armed Forces of the warring sides will be simultaneously  disengaged from each other by 10 km [as received]. A buffer  zone will be created between them. The Armenian side is to  withdraw its troops 10 km inside the territory of  Nagorno-Karabakh, and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces will  accordingly occupy the liberated areas to guarantee the safe  return of the refugees.    The Azerbaijani parliament speaker said that the buffer zone  will be handed over to the control of international observers.    As for the liberation of the Azerbaijani town of Shusha that  is also occupied by Armenian troops, according to the chairman  of the republic's Supreme Soviet, this will be discussed during  the month at a meeting between experts of the two countries. In  line with the planned schedule, this town situated right on the  territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is to be liberated in two month's  time.    Referring to what his Armenian colleague said, Rasul Guliyev  stressed that "Armenia has never recognized and will never  recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent republic."    According to the statement by the Azerbaijani parliament  head, the details of the accord that was reached will be  examined specifically in two or three days time in Moscow at a  meeting of representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs  and Defense of Azerbaijan and Armenia. He noted that Russia and  other intermediaries, including the CSCE, will play their role  in the peace-keeping process as before.    Speaking to journalists after the talks ended, Rasul Guliyev  and Babken Ararktsyan noted the similarity of their opinions  during the discussion of many questions. For instance, both  sides agreed that the process of ceasing fire and stopping  combat actions was irreversible. They also noted that despite  all the complexity of the problem, it can be resolved by  peaceful means. The head of the parliament of Armenia stressed  in particular, that although representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh  were not present at these talks, the Azerbaijani side for the  first time did not object to their participation in the meeting.  According to him, that bears witness to the fact that the sides  are gradually finding points of contact. It was also reported  that a meeting between experts of the two countries who are to  draw up concrete proposals to achieve peace in the region will  take place soon.</p>

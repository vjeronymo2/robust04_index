			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Unit trust charge rules to be eased A further step in the process of deregulating the Pounds 100bn unit trust industry came yesterday with rules liberalising charges and the range of markets in which unit trusts can invest. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, said the regulations would apply from the start of November. Unit trust schemes will be allowed to impose exit charges when an investor sells units, provided these are properly disclosed. The other significant change will be the replacement of SIB's list of approved securities and derivatives markets with a duty on managers to ensure that the markets where they invest meet certain criteria. The deregulatory measures come against a background of broader changes expected in the industry. On Tuesday the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private investor, published plans for requiring unit trust companies to provide customers with more information. The most important shifts are the likely introduction next year of open-ended investment companies and a move away from the existing system of pricing unit trusts.</p>

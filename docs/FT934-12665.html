			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / IRA explosion causes rail chaos in south: Bomb damage delays 40,000 commuters - Belfast holds silent memorial / Ulster's economic image dented THE IRA brought chaos to rail travellers in southern England yesterday as a result of Sunday's bomb explosion at Reading on the main line from London Paddington to the west and south Wales. It was feared that there would be further chaos today after an explosive device damaged a road bridge over the London Marylebone to Banbury line at Brill, Buckinghamshire, yesterday. British Rail said last night that the Reading line reopened during the day but the stretch of track between Princes Risborough and Bicester on the Marylebone-Banbury line remained closed and passengers were being bussed between the two towns. There was uncertainty about whether the line would be open by this morning. A third line from Reading to London Waterloo and the spur to Gatwick Airport remained closed because of signalling damage, BR said. This line had been replaced with a bus service between Earley and Wokingham in Berkshire but services were expected to be back to normal in time for this morning's rush-hour. Police were 'keeping an open mind' about the Brill explosion but did not know when the blast happened. They were not linking the explosion with the one in Reading late on Sunday night and, together with bomb squad officers, were planning a further examination of the track in daylight. BR urged passengers and people living close to railway lines to watch out for anything suspicious. Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, said after visiting the scene of the Reading blast: 'Let's face it, our lines are exposed. What we need is vigilance by everybody concerned.' Thames Valley police said train spotters and station security cameras could hold vital clues in the search for the terrorists who targeted Reading. The trackside explosion came seven hours after a device was found in a toilet. Police believe this device was meant to go off afterwards, hitting emergency services summoned to the scene. 'This was a deliberate attempt to lure emergency services into the path of an explosion with total disregard for human life,' said Det Supt John Bound. The blast damaged a signal post and caused a crater up to 18 inches deep but it was not thought the track itself was damaged. BR said 40,000 people using the main rail link to London from the west and south Wales were delayed by about an hour yesterday. Police said a warning was given about the Reading bomb, claiming it to be the work of the IRA. Another device was made safe on Sunday at Basingstoke station in Hampshire. Thousands of workers in Belfast downed tools yesterday to join a silent tribute to the victims of Saturday's IRA bombing in the Shankill Road. About 6,000 workers - the vast majority Protestants - from the Harland and Wolff shipyard and the Shorts aerospace factory marched across the city for a service of remembrance outside the Methodist church next to the site of the bombed fish shop. The service was arranged at the request of shop stewards from the two factories. A 22-year-old Catholic taxi driver shot in Belfast hours after the Shankill Road bombing died in hospital yesterday, police said.</p>

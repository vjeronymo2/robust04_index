			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lidiya Ruta: "The Bungler is a Bad Workman </F> Everywhere"]    [Text] The governments of Ukraine and the Russian  Federation have drawn up an agreement concerning cooperation in  the area of consumer rights protection. The agreement was signed  by L. Bochyn, head of the Russian Federation State Committee for  Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures and  V. Yermakov, head of the State Committee for the Protection of  Consumer Rights in Ukraine.    There was a press conference after the signing of the  agreement.    --How will the agreement benefit the rank and file  consumers?  the journalists asked L. Bochyn.    --The signing of the agreement will untie our hands, so to  speak, and will help to control our Russian, and your Ukrainian  unscrupulous producers, to resolve problems of technical  servicing of comples domestic technology such as radio sets,  constructed in both countries, and guarantee spare parts, etc.  In other words, normal, civilized forms of cooperation between  countries will be in effect.    --But many feel that the law of Ukraine concerning consumers  rights protection, let us say, is more oriented towards the  interests of consumers, than the corresponding law of the  Russian Federation. Won't these discrepancies become a stumbling  block in consumer rights protection in Ukraine?    --In order for consumers of Ukraine and Russia to be an  equal  level, says L. Bochyn, we must first make the laws equal. But in  the final analysis, it is not a matter of the constitutionality  of the law but its realization; the specific protection of  consumer rights. If we go through 16.5 thousand cases and they  all turn out to the advantage of the consumer - this says  something. Normally, any type of law requires a definite  compromise between enterprises-manufacturers and structures  called on to protect consumers.    --What do you expect from this agreement?, V. Yermakov was  asked.    --Ukraine's main foreign economic partner is the Russian  Federation. Therefore the absence of an agreement as to the  regulation of processes that take place at consumer markets,  problems connected with mutual supply of goods, and the  guarantee of their quality and other issues, did not allow  consumers of both countries to fully realize their rights with  respect to legislation in force in Ukraine and Russia. There are  such agreements now. The time has come to work out the  mechanics, so that the agreement would work for the people. We  think that the acceptance of the agreement will help to improve  the situation in the consumer market of Ukraine and Russia,  answered V. Yermakov.    Well, we expect that now we will not be denied, let us say,  service, repair or return of highly complex domestic technology  on the grounds that it is made in Russia, and they will not  ignore us when we complain about the poor quality of goods made  in a neighboring country.    To the point, in agreements for active trade cooperation  between member countries of CIS, the problem of protection of  consumer rights against poor quality products, which the partner  countries are supplying, takes on a particular concreteness.  Russia has made similar agreements with the Kirghiz Republic and  preparatory work is being carried out with the Kazakhstan  Republic. Of course, Ukraine also will not be limited by its  agreement with Russia. Because it is necessary to protect the  consumer in the whole economic expanse of the member countries  of the commonwealth. For now there is an agreement only with  Russia. But the main thing is that it work. If, of course the  sides which reached an agreement, are not bounded by  declarations, but develop positive mechanisms for our protection  and in their compromises between producers and consumers do not  forget the basic rule: the consumer is always right.</p>

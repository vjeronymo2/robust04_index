			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nuclear Armament of S. Korea and Japan Denounced"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front  (Hanminjon) [SKNDF] made public a statement denouncing the South  Korean puppets and the Japanese authorities for trying to  accelerate their nuclear armament by a new method, according to  a report of radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul.    Noting that the South Korean and Japanese authorities who  have concealed their moves for nuclear armament for the recent  several years and acted as shock brigades in the U.S. nuclear  row against the DPRK announced the development of a new  modified version of light-water reactors simultaneously, the  spokesman said: This is a trick to evade the denunciation of  the world public away from them in a crafty way and press on  with the development of nuclear weapons.    The modified version of light water reactors the South  Korean  and Japanese authorities are intending to develop are plutonium  reactors under changed name, he noted, adding: The South Korean  and Japanese authorities must not employ petty tricks but give  up, first of all, the development of the modified version of  light-water reactors and fast-breeder reactors intended to  deceive the world opinion, and dismantle the heavy-water  reactors and reprocessing facilities now in use for the  development of nuclear weapons.    The spokesman expressed the hope that the governments,  political parties, organisations and peaceloving people of all  countries will look squarely at the substantial moves of the  South Korean and Japanese authorities for nuclear armament and  lift up louder voices to check them.</p>

[passage omitted]    Airport workers also responded to the call. Thus, all  domestic and international flights were suspended. Commercial  activity was paralyzed at the port of Algiers after workers  there stopped working for several hours. [passage omitted]    According to the UGTA, the rate of participation in the  nationwide strike is estimated at 87 percent.    March 22 will remain an anniversary for the condemnation of  acts of violence, a symbol of refusal and a rejection of  disagreements between the children of this wounded homeland.</p>

The strongest Moslem attacks with artillery support are  taking place on Mount Ozren and Mount Trebava, south and east of  Doboj.    Bosnian Serb military sources said that Moslem troops from  Zavidovici are trying to make a breakthrough in the area on  Mount Ozren in a bid to link up with Moslem forces from Maglaj.    The same source said that Serb fighters stopped the  attackers  with effective fire and forced them to retreat.    The Bosnian Serb Army command said that Moslem Leader Alija  Izetbegovic had ordered all his units to take Doboj and Mount  Trebava at any cost and that fresh units from central Bosnia  have been brought into the Zavidovici area for this purpose  since Moslem-Croat fighting there had abated in intensity.    Moslem units launched several attacks on Serb positions  north  of Maglaj, in northern Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military sources  said.    The Herzegovina corps of the Bosnian Serb Army said on  Thursday that Moslem formations on several ocassions opened  infantry fire on Serb positions between Mostar and Nevesinje, in  southwestern Bosnia, on Wednesday afternoon.    After the fire was responded to, the provocations ceased, it  was said. A complete lull reigned on this part of the front  during the past several months.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Yablokov: ``Who is on the Green </F> Platform? Comparative Analysis of the Ecology Sections of Party  and Block Electoral Platforms'']    [Text] It often happened before that deputies elected to  the agencies of state power on the basis of ecological slogans  soon forgot about them. Today the situation must change, since  now the responsibility for fulfilling such promises is borne by  a specific political party or association, which in the not too  distant future will once again have to turn to the voters for  support in the next elections. Our task is not to allow  the politicians to forget their ecological promises.  Therefore, it is rather important specifically now to recall and  analyze the ecology sections of the pre-election platforms.    In the programs of the ``Future of Russia--New Names''  block,  the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and the Communist  Party of Russia, sections on ecological policy or program  proposals on the resolution of ecological problems have been  absent altogether. The programs of the ``Women of Russia''  movement and the ``Dignity and Charity'' block contained only a  few fragmentary statements of the most general nature. The most  complete representation of Russia's ecological problems appears  in the programs of the constructive-ecological movement  ``Kedr,'' ``Choice of Russia'' and the  ``Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin'' block (``Yabloko'').    By its broadness of scope in encompassing political problems  in the sphere of ecology, ``Kedr,'' is, of course, in first  place. Second is ``Choice of Russia,'' third--the ``Party for  Russian Unity and Accord'' (PRES), and fourth--``Yabloko.'' In  terms of the depth of economic development of ecological  problems, the priority undoubtedly goes to PRES, while the other  three places are shared by ``Choice of Russia,'' ``Yabloko'' and  ``Kedr.'' In terms of the detailed nature of development of  specific problems presented in the pre-election platforms, the  leaders are ``Choice of Russia,'' ``Kedr'' and the Agrarian  Party of Russia.    We must say that the problem of the economic mechanism of  regulating the activity of ecologically hazardous industries and  natural resource utilization has gained greatest recognition  among this group of political parties and movements. Five  parties and movements have included some kind of declaration to  this effect in their platforms. Four parties and movements have  included demands on compensation of ecological loss and rational  utilization of nonrenewable natural resources in their  platforms. Three parties have declared the need for tightening  procedures for ecological expert analysis of all projects,  programs and decisions by agencies of state power and  administration, and three parties have a program of first  priority measures in the field of ecology.    On the whole, however, analysis shows that none of those who  aspire to the State Duma of Russia from the all-federal  electoral district have presented a sufficiently comprehensive  program for the ecological revitalization of Russia. Even if we  put together all the announced positions, all the questions of  ecology raised in all the pre-election platforms, they would  still not reflect in full measure the ecological problems facing  Russia. We get the impression that the ecological sections of  all the parties and movements were hastily written and weakly  developed. I must conclude with disappointment that the deputies  who have gained membership in the State Duma according to the  party lists will not be able to provide objective and in-depth  solutions to the ecological problems facing the country. We may  only hope that the deputies coming to the State Duma from  regions for which the state of the environment is not a purely  theoretical question, but a most vital one, will be able to  correct the legislative activity of the parliament in the sphere  of ecology.    An analysis of the presence of ecologists among the  candidates for deputy in the State Duma presented by party lists  also allows us to make certain curious observations. We will  note that under such an analysis, ecologists were considered to  be not only those candidates who actually called themselves  ecologists, but also biologists, glaciologists, and specialists  having a higher education in the field of natural sciences. With  such a broad approach, it turned out that, within the voting  list of ``Kedr,'' 45 percent of the candidates for deputy could  be called ecologists. However, unfortunately this movement found  itself outside the bounds of the State Duma. Second in the  number of ecologists was the ``Dignity and Charity'' movement,  with almost 14 percent. But, alas, it too was unable to bring  its representatives to parliament. In third place was  ``Yabloko,'' with almost 6 percent of the candidates for deputy  who could be called ecologists. In the ``Women of Russia''  movement, 5 percent of the candidates for deputy could be called  ecologists, in ``Choice of Russia''--4 percent, in the RDDR  [Russian Movement for Democratic Reform]--3 percent, in the  PRES--2 percent, in the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia]--1  percent, and among the agrarians and the LDPR--less than one  percent. In last place were the communists, whose electoral list  did not contain a single person who could be called an ecologist.    A comparison of these data with the analysis of the  pre-election platforms of the parties and movements allows us to  draw certain conclusions. As we have already stated, ``Kedr,''  ``Choice of Russia,'' and PRES had more or less well-developed  ecological programs. However, by the number of ecologists  presented in the electoral lists, PRES is only in eighth place,  while ``Choice of Russia'' is in fifth place. Thus, despite the  notable presence of ecologists in the other electoral blocks,  this did not sufficiently influence the development of  ecological problems in the pre-election programs of the blocks.  This may indicate either a random selection of candidates for  deputy, or an insufficient participation of these candidates for  deputy in the preparation of the pre-election platforms of their  parties and movements.</p>

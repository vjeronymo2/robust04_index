			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEY READ IT IN THE PAPER CLIPPINGS;  </P> <P> IN HER FAMILY, A PUBLIC MEDIUM RELAYS MEMBERS' PRIVATE MESSAGES  </P> <P> Most days, mail call at our house is a ho-hum event. Only an occasional letter  breaks the monotony of all those catalogues, credit-card applications,  sweepstakes entries, and Cape Cod time-share lures that burden our mail carrier  and quickly fill our wastebaskets.  </P> <P> But several times a month an oversize envelope bearing a Florida postmark and  the familiar handwriting of one of my parents appears in the mailbox. Instantly  my spirits rise: another batch of clippings!  </P> <P> For more years than I can remember, my parents and I have been trading  clippings the way boys trade baseball cards. In the beginning, we simply  enclosed an article or two in the same envelope with a letter. But gradually,  as we spent more time talking on the telephone and less time writing letters,  the clippings assumed a life of their own. Now bulky Manila envelopes regularly  wing their way between our respective ZIP codes, carrying everything from  editorials, political cartoons and interviews to columns, book reviews, and  recipes.  </P> <P> The best packets of clippings are, in fact, like a balanced meal, offering  something nutritious -- a well-argued op-ed piece, perhaps -- topped off with  something light and sweet such as a cartoon or comic strip.  </P> <P> Armed with scissors and a ballpoint, veteran clippers approach each day's  newspaper with enthusiasm. We read. We clip. We underline. We write relevant,  and sometimes funny, comments in the margins. We also attach yellow Post-It  notes explaining our choices or amplifying points.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Network Expands  </P> <P> Over the years, my network of newsprint pen pals has expanded. In a typical  week, I might save an article about a major auction for an aunt and uncle in  Milwaukee who collect antiques. For my sister, a high school Spanish teacher in  Minneapolis, I may clip a travel story about museums in Mexico City. A New  Yorker cartoon about cats and a story on Madonna's controversial new video will  be tucked into the next letter to our daughter at college. And the latest  position paper on the Great Books controversy will find its way into an  envelope for a self-improvement enthusiast in California.  </P> <P> Even the most dedicated clipper knows better than to think that borrowed words  on folded newsprint can ever take the place of a real letter containing  personal news and private opinions. But for those of us whose busy schedules  allow little time for proper correspondence -- and who have the phone bills to  prove it -- these patchwork collections, custom-tailored to the recipient, can  serve as love notes on the run.  </P> <P> Not everyone agrees, of course. There are those who disdain the smudgy  practice, harrumphing all the way to the post office that only a handwritten  letter in the 18th-Century manner constitutes a proper communication with  friends and relatives.  </P> <P> But as a veteran collector of mailable tidbits, I disagree. I like to think of  a clipping as a compliment, a shorthand way of saying, "You're in my thoughts."  </P> <P> Over time, a collection of clippings forms a mosaic, creating a portrait of the  sender. In our choice of articles and jokes and photos, we give ourselves away,  revealing our senses of humor, our politics, our serious and not-so-serious  interests. Indirectly we are saying, "This is who I am."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coded Messages  </P> <P> At the same time, as we choose subjects of interest to the recipient, we are  saying, "This is who I think you are; send me a clipping if you think I'm  wrong."  </P> <P> On sensitive subjects, clippings can serve as diplomatically coded messages. My  mother, for instance, might send a page from a catalogue with the notation, "I  think these curtains could look very nice in your family room." An article on  overwork, passed along without comment, is her oblique way of expressing  maternal concern.  </P> <P> As a daughter, I love this particular form of conversation with my mother. So  charmed am I by her mastery of the game that one Mother's Day I sent her a  sterling silver paper clipper -- the perfect gift from one clipper to another.  </P></p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Clowes theft appeal fails MR PETER CLOWES, the former financier jailed for stealing investors' funds from his Barlow Clowes investment empire, yesterday lost his appeal against 10 convictions for theft, John Mason writes. The Court of Appeal also rejected Mr Clowes's appeal against the length of the 10-year sentence. Mr Clowes' argument that he was not guilty of theft because investors had signed a mandate giving the company absolute discretion over the handling of their money was rejected by three judges. Mr Clowes is considering whether to ask for leave to appeal to the House of Lords. An appeal against conviction by Mr Clowes's second-in-command, Dr Peter Naylor, was also dismissed.</p>

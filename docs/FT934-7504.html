			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / People: Schroders' young guard advances It is the turn of two younger men to head the investment banking division at Schroders, as David Challen, who has run that side for the last four years, moves on with effect from April of next year, acquiring the new title of group director of corporate finance. He does not move onto the main board. 'It is a pretty pressurised kind of business,' the merchant bank's chief executive Win Bischoff remarks, adding that executives typically run the area for about four or five years in their early to mid 40s. Challen turned 50 this year. Challen will continue to be responsible for key UK corporate clients, and will also work on expanding the group's Far Eastern business. In a surprise move that sees corporate finance director Gerry Grimstone passed over in this round of promotions, 41-year-old Will Samuel and 48-year-old Derek Netherton become joint heads of the investment banking division. The splitting of the job reflects the overall growth of business and the gathering importance of continental Europe. The division will now be managed by an executive committee, on which will sit, in addition to Netherton and Samuel, Richard Broadbent, John Reynolds and Robert Swannell.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Salomon lifted by strong figures from brokerage SALOMON'S share price rose sharply yesterday after the company reported fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 143m following a strong showing from Salomon Brothers, its Wall Street securities brokerage, which offset heavy losses at its Phibro Energy operations. In the same quarter a year ago, Salomon incurred a net loss of Dollars 29m. The strong final quarter took Salomon's full-year earnings for 1992 to Dollars 550m, up from Dollars 507m a year earlier. Last year's profits would have been a record Dollars 714m, but for the Dollars 164m special after-tax charge the company recorded in connection with the 1991 US Treasury auction scandal. Salomon's earnings in 1991 were also affected by charges related to the scandal. Investors applauded Salomon's results, bidding up the stock to close at Dollars 40 on the New York Stock Exchange, a net gain of Dollars 3. The markets were particularly impressed by the record operating profits at the brokerage unit Salomon Brothers, both for the final quarter and for the year. The brokerage firm made pre-tax profits of Dollars 503m in the fourth quarter (after a Dollars 67m charge to cover personnel relocation expenses), and Dollars 1.4bn in the full year, proving that it has recovered from the negative impact of the 1991 Treasury auction scandal. The company said that results from proprietary and customer-related trading activities had been especially strong. However, the parent group earnings were once again held back by another disappointing showing from its energy trading and refining operations, which were merged into Salomon at the end of last year as part of a restructuring and reduction of the lossmaking Phibro Energy unit. The Phibro Energy division, which covers oil and oil products trading and ship chartering, incurred a loss of Dollars 181m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 194m in the year, which included special charges to cover the withdrawal from certain business lines. Phibro Energy USA, the oil refinery operation, recorded a loss of Dollars 31m in the quarter, which took total pre-tax losses for 1992 to Dollars 47m. This reflected, Salomon said, the weak demand for energy products and the narrow margins in the refining business. Phibro Energy Production, which covers Salomon's interest in the White Nights oil production joint venture in Russia, also lost money last year. Salomon's expenses rose sharply in the fourth quarter and full year, to Dollars 761m and Dollars 2.8bn respectively. The increases were primarily attributable to a big rise in salary and bonuses at Salomon Brothers, where employee compensation is tied to the company's earnings performance, and to higher occupancy costs following the consolidation of the brokerage firm's New York locations.</p>

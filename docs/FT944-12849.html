			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / The Mark Thatcher Affair: Dabbler in a variety of sectors - His career The little bit of help which Mr Mark Thatcher received in his US investment business from his mother's corporate friends is strikingly reminiscent of the affair which first drew attention to his business career. This was his role as a consultant more than a decade ago working for Cementation. Cementation's owner, Trafalgar House - like Hanson and Mr Li - is another substantial Conservative party donor. There was a political storm when his role for Cementation was disclosed, because Oman awarded the company a contract for building a university at about the same time as his mother visited the country. Mr Thatcher was at that period working with his friend Mr Stephen Tipping, a former racing driver, in a consultancy company called Monteagle International. Mr Tipping said this week that his business dealings with Mr Thatcher ceased in 1985, when Monteagle went into voluntary liquidation, although he remained a friend of the former prime minister's son. One of Mr Thatcher's most visible business ventures was in Hong Kong in the 1980s, where he was paid to appear in television commercials for whisky and clothes. Mr Thatcher had become something of an international celebrity in his alternative career as rally driver, having got lost in the Sahara desert for six days. He has also dabbled in a variety of sectors as a 'consultant' or middleman with mixed results. Mr Leon Walger, an Argentine businessman, this week talked of his 'frivolous business relationship' with Mr Thatcher. Mr Walger said: 'We wanted to sell electrical power stations to Peru and there was a project in Paraguay to build a railway from Asuncion to Paranagua port in Brazil for the shipment of soya.'

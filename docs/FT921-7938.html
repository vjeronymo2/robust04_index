			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Give 2 3/4 cheers for a hung parliament We used to be told by psephologists that a hung parliament - one in which no party has an absolute majority - was very unlikely in the UK, however close the two main parties seem to be, because of the vagaries of the British voting system. Now, however, the same experts seem to regard it as much more likely; and I hope they are right. Most City writers have expressed an opposite opinion. Until very recently, they were saying that a hung parliament would be the worst possible outcome for sterling. The cliche explanation is that uncertainty is bad for markets  -which ignores the fact that players in financial markets earn their living by dealing with risk and uncertainty and should thrive on so doing. A stock remark used to be that a government dependent on third-party support would shrink from taking tough unpopular measures. But which tough measures exactly? The economy needs a fresh monetary or fiscal squeeze like a hole in the head. What is needed is a willingness to exercise patience until Germany has got over the hump of its unification problems and interest rates in Frankfurt start to fall. It means accepting that, whatever small changes in British interest rates can be squeezed in, the UK is basically in the same boat as Germany. It means, too, avoiding huge spending increases or unaffordable tax cuts. But, alas, my advice to concentrate in the Budget on purely temporary and self-reversing measures to boost investment and spending has fallen on deaf ears. There may be some temporary measures. But the emphasis is all too likely to be on the cruder type of tax bribes such as real increases in the tax allowances, 1p or 2p off the basic rate, or quite likely both. This will be combined with some other morsels such as a reduction in the Uniform Business Rate (for which a case can be made) and cuts in Inheritance Tax or Stamp Duty. John Lipsky and Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers, who canvass a list of this kind, usefully remind us that the 1991 Budget contained an overspill of Pounds 1.6bn of extra revenue not due until 1992-93, owing mainly to the delayed effects of the VAT increase and National Insurance contributions on company cars. The Treasury could call this bonus in aid, to make a tax remission of Pounds 4bn look more like Pounds 2bn. Indeed, I can imagine Norman Lamont being personally more hesitant about fudging his medium-term tax strategy than either his political colleagues or even some of his official advisers. It would only take a moderate shortfall in economic growth below that assumed in the Autumn Statement and a moderate tax give-away to take the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement to the Pounds 25bn to Pounds 30bn range in 1992-93. This would represent 4 to 5 per cent of gross domestic product. It takes the eye of faith to believe that deficits of this size are entirely due to the recession and that the Budget is still in balance over the whole cycle - remembering too that privatisation proceeds of Pounds 8bn per annum are abnormally large and almost certain to go down in the next parliament. I do not want to pretend to austere fiscal beliefs which I do not really have. Even the Maastricht treaty, of which the Bundesbank approves, allows for a Budget deficit of 3 per cent of GDP; and no less a financial hawk than the Bundesbank vice-president, Hans Tietmeyer, accepts that this should be considered over the whole economic cycle. Moreover, the UK has a small public debt ratio compared to other European countries. But that is hardly a reason for moving in the wrong direction. An excessive budget deficit in the coming couple of financial years would be like a slow fuse. Tax moves of the size for which we are being prepared would be chickenfeed as a Keynesian fiscal stimulus, but enough to cast doubts on the government's medium-term fiscal strategy. My own view is that the timing and extent of the climb out of recession will depend on the usual mixture of animal spirits and monetary policy. The latter will depend more on German wage bargaining than on anything Mr Lamont can do. The best case that can be made for cutting income tax is that by increasing the likelihood of a majority Conservative government it will cheer up business and middle-to-affluent consumers - an argument I have heard even from Labour-voting economists. This takes us straight back to the hung parliament with which I began. Those who fear it have not realised that under a so-called weak government, the power over interest rates will shift decisively to the Bank of England. There has already been a partial and pragmatic shift under the influence of European developments and economic fashion. It would go much further under a chancellor who could not even tell the governor that he had a parliamentary majority. The most satisfactory long-term result would be two hung parliaments in a row, which really would put electoral reform on the map. From a purely short-term financial point of view, there is much to be said for a Labour government dependent on Liberal Democrat support. Mr Paddy cards here better than Jo Grimond, Jeremy Thorpe and David Steel did in the past - would prevent Labour from pushing up marginal tax rates to 60 per cent, although he would sensibly help it to abolish the ceiling on employees' National Insurance contributions. As Giles Keating of Credit Suisse First Boston writes: These pressures 'plus the Liberals' . . . commitment to making the Bank of England independent could offset the pressure on sterling which might otherwise be caused by political uncertainty.' But from the more important long-term viewpoint of constitutional reform, a Conservative government dependent on Liberal Democrat support  - and not strong enough to get by with Ulster Unionist support - would be a better bet. For since the Second World War, whenever Labour has formed a minority government, the electorate has finished the job by increasing Labour's strength the second time round. In the last analysis, attitudes to two hung parliaments in a row should depend, not on financial market reactions, but on whether one would like to see constitutional reform, which would include a move to proportional representation. Unlike many PR supporters, I have never used the argument that PR would be a 'fair' system. My reason for supporting PR is that there would be less danger of party zealots trying to impose 'irreversible transformations' on British society not by persuasion but by what Lord Hailsham called 'elective dictatorships'. One of the few contributions that has made me pause is a pamphlet* by the Oxford political scientist Nevil Johnson, who was formerly sympathetic to these arguments. He has changed his mind, not as a result of cheap debating points about changing Italian governments, but of studies concentrated on Germany where PR has produced stable administrations. He is now impressed by the absence in Germany of the personal 'competition and risk' existing in Britain under which politicians 'perform on a high wire without a safety net'. In Germany, by contrast, members of the political class are there for life with little danger of losing their seats or their livelihood. The main reason why I still back PR is that the danger of elective dictatorships, although less obvious than in the 1970s and 1980s, is dormant rather than dead. Moreover, the present system still gives undue influence to those interest groups and clusters of attitudes which are over-represented in the Labour and Conservative parties. Other checks and balances are, of course, required, including a constitutional court and an independent central bank - all much less likely under the winner-takes-all system. * The Political Consequences of PR, Centre for Policy Studies, 52 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU</p>

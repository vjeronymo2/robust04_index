			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> GANESHA BLVD. RENAMED  </P> <P> The City Council voted Monday to bestow the name "Fairplex Drive" on Ganesha  Boulevard and parts of McKinley Avenue and E Street to give increased  recognition to Fairplex, the site of the Los Angeles County Fair and other  expositions.  </P> <P> Fairplex Drive will become the designation for the full length of Ganesha, from  Route 71 north to McKinley Avenue.  </P> <P> Also redesignated as Fairplex Drive will be the portion of McKinley west of  Ganesha Boulevard, and E Street from McKinley north to the city limits. The  portions of McKinley and E Street that are being renamed are along the  perimeter of the Fairplex property.  </P> <P> The change will require the state to replace the Ganesha off-ramp signs on the  San Bernardino Freeway. Robert DeLoach, city public works director, said the  name change will take effect after the state Department of Transportation  authorizes and makes the new freeway signs, which could take as long as nine  months. He said the Los Angeles County Fair Assn. will pay the cost of the sign  changes, estimated at $13,000 for the freeway and $3,000 for city streets.  </P></p>

Last year, they made great strides in attracting  funds from abroad and developing lateral ties at home.    Last year, our region formally approved 41 projects to  attract funds from abroad and develop lateral ties at home,  reaching agreements on bringing in more than 100 million yuan.  The funds brought in by those projects were intended for  Tibet's communications and transportation sector, light  industry, textiles, machinery and electronics, and commercial  sector.    Tibet, known as "the roof of the world," is a virgin land  that waits to be developed. As the policy of reform and opening  up has deepened constantly, the high plateau has thrown its  doors open and attracted the attention of people at home and  abroad. To accelerate reform and opening up, actively attract  foreign and domestic capital, and promote rapid economic  development, in 1992 the autonomous regional people's government  formulated "Several Provisions on Encouraging Domestic and  Foreign Investment in Tibet," as well as the "Interim Measures  for Rewarding People Who Are Instrumental in Bringing in  Domestic and Foreign Investment Into Tibet." Moreover, it set  up an office in charge of concrete work under the autonomous  regional economic coordination committee for introducing funds  from abroad and developing lateral ties at home. In the past  year, Tibet has begun to show good progress in attracting funds  from abroad and developing lateral ties at home. Hong Kong's  Shiheng Group began investing in our region in 1992, the year in  which Tibet took initial steps toward bringing in funds and  developing lateral ties. Together with the Lhasa City  Electrical Power Bureau and the tourist company affiliated with  the autonomous regional physical culture committee, it developed  the Hongjingtian series of products for use on highlands, as  well as mineral water. This marked the beginning of Tibet's  efforts to introduce funds from abroad and develop lateral ties  at home. Shortly afterward, businessmen from other countries  and regions, such as the United States, Japan, Germany, Nepal,  and Malaysia, came to the plateau to negotiate business  ventures. The autonomous regional economic coordination  committee for introducing funds from abroad and developing  lateral ties at home launched 49 projects to attract investment.  Last June, Atewufei [transliteration of name as received]  Company from the United States invested 9.5 million yuan to set  up Tibet Yak Meat Products Limited Company in conjunction with  the autonomous regional association of self-employed laborers.  Preparations for this business venture are now under way.  Nepalese businessmen invested 7.5 million yuan to set up Tibet  Carpet Limited Company with the Chengguan District Ethnic  Handicrafts Administration in Lhasa City. Construction of the  factory premises is near completion. Hong Kong's Dadi Real  Estate Development Company, and Liyuan Scientific and  Technological Development Company under the autonomous regional  economic research center jointly set up the Tibet-Hong Kong  Yishou Products Limited Company to produce a series of health  care products, the mass-production of which has commenced. Last  year also saw the establishment of Tibet Qomolangma Carpet  Limited Company, Tibet Kawajian Carpet and Woolen Handicrafts  Limited Company, and Tibet Zhihui Cultural Development Limited  Company. A number of enterprises from other parts of the  country also set up companies in Tibet. China Ferrous Metals  Corporation and Chengdu Qiaofeng Modern Office Equipment Company  also invested in Tibet and achieved notable economic results.    The policy of attracting funds from abroad and developing  lateral ties at home has somewhat alleviated the shortage of  investment funds in some of Tibet's industries, has brought in  technology and information, injected vitality into our region's  market economic development, and promoted economic construction.  It has been reported that although Tibet is making rapid  progress in introducing funds from abroad and developing lateral  ties at home, most of the projects involve short periods between  technology development and application, are of medium  technological levels, and yield speedy economic results.  Medium- and long-term investment projects are relatively rare.  However, it is believed that as Tibet accelerates its pace of  reform and opening up, it will become a much-sought-after  destination for domestic and foreign investors. It will not be  long before Tibet develops and utilizes its abundant resources.</p>

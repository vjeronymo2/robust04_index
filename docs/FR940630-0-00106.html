The Department emphasizes, however, that the requirements of section 3 are triggered by economic opportunities generated by the expenditure of certain HUD assistance. A housing authority that uses funds, other than section 3 covered assistance, to improve the economic situation of their residents deserves commendation and credit. However, the fact that the HA may be locating economic opportunities for their residents through such means, does not relieve the HA of the responsibility imposed by section 3 to recruit low- and very low-income residents, or to solicit section 3 business concerns for economic opportunities arising from the expenditure of section 3 covered activity. The fact that economic opportunities are generated from section 3 covered assistance triggers the applicability of section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the rule should require recipients and contractors to provide long-term employment opportunities, and not simply seasonal or temporary employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department cannot dictate the types of jobs for which recipients and contractors must give preference to low-income and very low-income persons. Again, section 3 is not a job creation program. The economic opportunities that are available to low and very low-income persons are those that the recipient or contractor has determined are necessary for the project or activity funded by section 3 covered assistance and that would be available on the job or contract market with or without section 3. However, the objective of section 3 is to provide low- and very low-income persons, especially those on government assistance, with the types of economic opportunities that will allow them to become self-sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters stated that the rule should emphasize that section 3 does not mandate the employment of any low-income person who is not qualified for job for which he or she applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This statement is made in the text of the regulation, and the Department believes this statement clarifies this point without further elaboration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitoring by Recipients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A majority of the commenters raised objections to the requirement in the proposed rule that recipients must monitor the operations of their contractors and subcontractors to ensure compliance with the regulations of part 135, and questioned how recipients were to perform this monitoring function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed in the response to the fourth comment under the ``General Comments'' section, while the interim rule continues to require recipients to ensure that their contractors and subcontractors are in compliance with section 3, this responsibility is not the same as the ``monitoring'' responsibility imposed on recipients by the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VII.

This Finding remains applicable to this interim rule, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 as a significant regulatory action. Any changes made in this interim rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection in the Office of HUD's Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh St. SW, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact on Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this interim rule, and, in so doing, certifies that the interim rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Recipients and contractors that receive HUD financial assistance subject to the requirements are currently required, to the greatest extent feasible, to give economic opportunities generated by such assistance to low-income persons, and to businesses owned by or that substantially employ low-income persons. This interim rule, which implements the amendments made to section 3 by the 1992 Act, provides greater guidance on how the requirements of section 3 may be met, and decreases the administrative burden on recipients from that contained in the existing part 135 regulations. The interim rule eliminates much of the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the proposed rule, and provides recipients and contractors with greater flexibility in complying with section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Department anticipates that the interim rule will increase the number of small businesses that will benefit from the implementation of amended section 3, the Department also anticipates that the lower dollar threshold in HUD's housing and community development programs (lower than that provided in the previous codified part 135 regulations), and the absence of a dollar threshold in HUD's public and Indian housing programs, may increase the number of small business concerns that will be subject to compliance with the part 135 regulations. However, as with those small businesses expected to benefit from the revised part 135 regulations, the increase in the number of small businesses that may be made subject to compliance with part 135 is not considered so great as to constitute a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that this interim rule would not have a substantial, direct effect on the States or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities among the various levels of government. The interim rule provides, consistent with section 3, that the preference requirements of section 3 are to be carried out consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact on the Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Family, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that the interim rule may have the potential to promote family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. If the revised part 135 regulations, implemented by this interim rule, contribute to successful implementation of section 3, an increased number of low-income persons will be employed which may promote family unification and general well-being. Since the impact of this interim rule is anticipated to be beneficial, no further review under the Order is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Agenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule was listed as sequence number 1669 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20466), under Executive Order 12826 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 135  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative practice and procedure, Community development, Equal employment opportunity, Government contracts, Grant programs_housing and community development, Housing, Loan programs_housing and community development, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, 24 CFR part 135, consisting of &sect;&sect;135.1 through 135.92 and Appendix to part 135, is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHALLENGING THE MYTHS OF GERMANY'S THIRD REICH  </P> <P> Half a century ago, after six years in power, Adolf Hitler looked invincible.  He ordered his generals to prepare for the invasion of Poland, in the  blitzkrieg that precipitated World War II. An oral history, "Voices From the  Third Reich," to be published this month by Regnery Gateway Inc., examines what  it was like to watch and participate in the rise of Hitler from many points of  view -- concentration camp victims, SS men, resistance activists, teen-age  Nazis, emigres. The following is adapted from the book's epilogue:  </P> <P> The Third Reich changed the history of the world, yet it endured for only a  brief moment in time -- 12 years. The years of Nazi rule left Germany's cities  destroyed, its people scattered, its government abolished. Foreign soldiers  walked its streets as masters while millions of refugees sought safety from an  Eastern Europe staging its own solution of the German question by systematic,  brutal expulsions.  </P> <P> What had become of the cheering crowds of 1933? Of 1938? Were the wartime  Germans a generation of opportunists, rejecting the Nazi order only when the  bill came due? This question is particularly significant because of the nature  of the National Socialist regime. It was not a state like all the rest, a state  which made its bid for world power, fought a war and lost. It was a criminal  system that committed its atrocities "in the name of the German people."  </P> <P> But questions of right and wrong are seldom as obvious at the time as they seem  in retrospect, even under Adolf Hitler.  </P> <P> The pace of events was rapid enough to sweep along millions of people with a  current that seemed to flow ever faster. Modern states and modern ideologies  have the means to blur processes of choice and action. Particularly for young  people, there was no time to reflect, no refuge from the endless pressure to  participate.  </P> <P> World War II had no parallel in history. It was waged without rules or mercy.  It assumed a life of its own, as though it would go on forever. Yet at the same  time it was waged with malevolent intelligence. No one in Europe escaped it.  World War II mobilized children for the front. It made women the prizes of  victory. It demanded the annihilation of entire peoples. It generated realities  worse than any nightmare. Auschwitz, Stalingrad, and Berlin have in common that  the abnormal became the stuff of everyday life. Chaos seemed natural. It was  the way things had always been, the way things always would be.  </P> <P> Clear thought was further discouraged by ignorance based on lack of  information. Books, newspapers, radio, all were rigidly controlled. Even  private conversations involved significant risk. Soldiers, whether at the front  or in home garrisons, were in an even more restricted environment than  civilians. Thousands of men in Werhmacht uniforms were executed or imprisoned  for "damaging the national war effort" by "crimes" as insignificant as  listening to foreign radio broadcasts.  </P> <P> If guessing was risky, knowing too much posed more than simple physical danger.  Those who by chance glanced into the Nazi abyss promptly looked away. They  denied it existed. They talked of "exceptions" or "excesses." They forced  themselves to forget. Anything was preferable to the truth, because the truth  was too horrible to acknowledge.  </P> <P> The men and women who share their lives in "Voices From the Third Reich"  challenge three familiar myths about Germans under National Socialism. The  first is the myth of collective opposition, the myth that the German people  from the beginning rejected Hitler's siren call. The myth makes everyone at  heart a Christian, a Marxist, a simple soldier or something else having as  little as possible to do with National Socialism. Susanne Ritters, 17 at war's  end, offers a bitter critique:  </P> <P> "We believed in Hitler. We believed in the whole system, the entire leadership.  There we were, already half-dead, still believing in victory. We could not do  anything else. That was our generation and he was our idol. We didn't just  adopt something. It was a given. It came from inside of us. And we sucked it in  like mother's milk."  </P> <P> Yet there is also denial of an opposing myth, the myth of collective guilt that  makes every German living through this period an active, committed Nazi,  endorsing when not supporting every aspect of the regime. Richard Lowenthal,  forced into exile as a Jew and a Social Democrat, says he was "very much aware  that anti-Semitism had always existed in Germany, but before Hitler's time it  was confined to a very small minority. If I were to compare Germany with other  countries before Hitler, I could say that there was considerably less  anti-Semitism in Germany than in France, to say nothing of Poland or Austria.  </P> <P> "What many people fail to realize is that Hitler did not come to power because  of his anti-Semitism . . . . Hitler's coming to power was based on a wave of  nationalism and the miserable economic situation in Germany."  </P> <P> What attracted millions of Germans were National Socialism's positive appeals.  Family, community, homeland -- these values are not contemptible in themselves,  nor were they invented by the Nazis. Hitler spoke to a desire to have things  better. He even delivered -- at least for a while -- long enough to add the  German people to his list of victims.  </P> <P> Our interview partners finally challenge a third myth -- the myth of oblivion,  sometimes described as "Waldheimer's Disease": Live long enough and you forget  you were ever a Nazi. German history neither began nor ended in 1945. The  Federal Republic sometimes speaks of a "Zero Hour" from which all somehow began  anew. East Germany boasts of a postwar revolution which swept away the old  order. But the generation that bore the burden of Hitler's war remembers, far  too well for its own comfort, the part it played.  </P> <P> For the survivors, their war was not a collective experience. It was a  composite of personal events and decisions, random happenings and blind chance  against a background of confusion. They have struggled -- not least by  participating in this project -- to come to terms with their country's history  on a personal level. If recollection sometimes finds positive elements --  courage, comradeship, empathy -- that should occasion neither alarm nor  surprise. Such memories are not harbingers of a Fourth Reich. They are rather  part of the process of mastering a painful past.  </P> <P> Since 1945, Western thought has been permeated by a utopianism leaving no room  for misjudgment, no room for immaturity, no room for conversion. What is  important is being right, morally right, the first time and from the first  hour. In both Germanys younger generations say, "It would never have happened  to us." They declare themselves too clever, too sophisticated, to have become  part of Hitler's Reich. Our interview partners' experiences suggest another  important lesson: the potential to learn from error, to learn from history,  which remains a record of mistakes made for good reasons. They have been taught  humility, and have paid high prices for the instruction.  </P> <P> "Greater Germany" died with Hitler. But "Germany" remains a living concept on  both sides of the current border. The emphasis may differ, but the roots are  the same: two states, but one ethnic and cultural entity, one nation. The war  generation built this new Germany as it had fought for the old one. After the  war, this generation had to ask itself: What is more important, yesterday or  tomorrow? Its answer can be seen by any visitor. Civilization owes these men  and women, if not gratitude, then at least recognition.  </P></p>

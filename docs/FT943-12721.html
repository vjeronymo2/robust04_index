			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / C&amp;G makes most profit per customer Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society made an average of Pounds 82 profit out of each of its 1.4m customers last year, according to analysis carried out by Datamonitor, the market research group. This made it the society profiting most from its customer base. The next most profitable per customer was Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third largest, which made an average of Pounds 39 out of each its 4.2m customers. It was the most successful at generating commission income through its branches. The research into the different strategies adopted by societies for their branch networks revealed that the way the network was run was unprofitable for some societies. The figures suggest that Leeds &amp; Holbeck made a loss of Pounds 24 a customer on its branch network last year, while Nationwide, the second-largest society by asset size but with the largest branch network, made a Pounds 13 loss per customer. They also show that for a significant minority of societies analysed, the branch network was broadly neutral in terms of profit last year. Datamonitor said yesterday that the calculations took account only of the profitability of societies' branches, and not of profits from other aspects of their activities, such as dealing in wholesale money markets, or from estate agents. Although C&amp;G is the sixth-largest society by assets, it has only 236 branches and mortgage centres, contributing to a low cost-income ratio. It is the object of an agreed cash bid of Pounds 1.8bn from Lloyds Bank. Datamonitor said its research showed Halifax, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Nationwide, three of the four largest societies, had relatively low commission income per customer but higher numbers of customers per branch, while other societies concentrated on generating higher levels of net commission per customer. Halifax is to set up its own life insurance operation from the start of next year, and Nationwide announced in May that it too intended to set up life insurance and unit trust subsidiaries. Datamonitor saw the greatest scope for percentage increases in generating new net income for A&amp;L and Nationwide.  ------------------------------------------------------------ Retail profit (loss) per customer   Pounds  ------------------------------------------------------------ Nationwide                        (13) Halifax                            22 Woolwich                           39 Leeds Permanent                     2 Alliance &amp; Leicester                1 Bradford &amp; Bingley                (1) Britannia                           8 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester            82 Bristol &amp; West                     24 Yorkshire                          35 (National &amp; Provincial figures not available)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Datamonitor  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

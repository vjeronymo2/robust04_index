			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / People: Hickson chooses Hann as chairman James Hann, the outspoken chairman of Scottish Nuclear, has taken the helm at Hickson International following the speciality chemical company's six-month search for a successor to Sir Gordon Jones. The 61-year old Wykehamist, below, will remain part-time chairman of the state-owned nuclear power company, but is expected to spend two days a week with the Castleford-based chemicals group. 'His understanding of the safety management culture and policies of one of the UK's major nuclear companies will be of great value,' said Sir Gordon, 67, who announced his decision to retire in March. Hickson refused to disclose details of Hann's package or whether it would match the Pounds 60,000 paid last year to Sir Gordon, who is also chairman of Yorkshire Water and The Water Industries Association. By comparison, the Scottish Nuclear chairman earned Pounds 34,439. Earlier this year, Hann criticised the government for slowing Scottish Nuclear's transformation into a more commercial operation. 'Every time our industry tries to move forward it is being halted in its tracks as a result of operating in the public sector,' he said at the time. Before joining Scottish Nuclear in 1990, he was chief executive at Seaforth Maritime, the offshore oil and gas business.</p>

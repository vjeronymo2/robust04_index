The committee's actions will not depend on the anticipated  contract with Russia on the further use and dismantling of the  radar station, said the committee head, the country's  Environmental Protection and Regional Development Minister Girts  Lukins.    The group sees its chief task in rehabilitation of  residents'  health and sanation of the environment, said Lukins.    "The committee's work will be over only when the locals  start  to feel better, and this is by no means connected with this  treaty between Latvia and Russia," said the minister.    The group was set up in February. It includes officials of  the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry,  Welfare Ministry, Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry, Finance  Ministry, physicians and local authorities.    As reported, Russia has promised to get its troops out of  Latvia until Aug. 31 if the Baltic country allows it keep the  radar for five and a half years.</p>

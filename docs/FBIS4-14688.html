			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Sergey </F> Ostanin, and Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku April 1 TASS -- The idea to hold a meeting of  Azeri and Armenian parliament members in Bishkek early this May  was backed by Azeri President Geydar Aliyev here today. He  announced his decision during a meeting with a delegation of the  CIS interparliamentary assembly, which arrived in Baku on  Thursday.    At the same time, the head of the Azeri state objected to  the  participation of Nagorno-Karabakh representatives in this  meeting. He said that "Karabakh was part and parcel of  Azerbaijan, not a state. The structures, artificially set up in  this region during the conflict, have nothing to do with the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly. Aliyev said this question was open  for discussion. The president believes that the Bishkek meeting  should be well prepared: it is necessary to achieve definite  positive changes in the confrontation zone, thereby creating a  favourable foundation for talks between the parliament speakers  of the two republics.    "In this sense," Aliyev stressed, "I pin great hopes on the  peace-making mission of the delegation of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly." He noted that its present  composition differed qualitatively from that of the previous  delegation, formed last autumn by this supranational CIS  institution for the purpose of settling the Armenian-Azeri  conflict.    The head of the Azeri state specially noted the need to work  out approaches to the settlement of the conflict. In his  opinion, the principle "of equal responsibility of both sides"  was unacceptable, "because the hostilities are occurring on  Azeri territory and a considerable part of the republic is  occupied". The Commonwealth of Independent States, the Azeri  president stressed, "cannot and must not remain indifferent to  the fact that two states that are members of the Commonwealth  and signatories of its collective security treaty are actually  in a state of war."    In the opinion of Medetkan Shirinkulov, chairman of the  Kirghizian [Kyrgyz] Supreme Soviet, who heads the CIS  parliamentary delegation, "there are grounds for an important  conversation in Bishkek". It could be based on the new Russian  draft document for solving the Karabakh problem, forwarded today  to the Azeri side by Vladimir Kazimirov, envoy of the Russian  president.    The contents of this draft and details of its implementation  were discussed behind closed doors. The delegation plans to  visit Stepanakert today afternoon.</p>

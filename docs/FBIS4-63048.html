			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 17 May, in its "Details" program,  broadcasts a 10- minute report on the work of the Presidential  Security Service by correspondent Eduard Gindileyev.    Gindileyev begins his report by saying: "We know nothing  about the presidential guard. We do not know, for instance,  that quite recently the president's personal chauffeur and one  of his closest bodyguards were replaced. And one and a half  months ago the deputy chief of the Kremlin guard was dismissed.  We know nothing of this, and we are not meant to know.    "The SBP [Sluzhba Bezopasnosti Presidenta] is the  abbreviation for a new Russian special service, or rather a new  name for an old unit. It is the Presidential Security Service,  the tip of the iceberg of the former Number Nine [Devyatka], the  ninth directorate of the USSR KGB, later the Main Guard  Directorate of the Russian Federation.    "As an independent federal body subordinate only to the  Russian president, the SBP has been functioning since 11  November last year. After the second putsch, Boris Yeltsin  clearly decided to close the ranks of the Kremlin guard more  tightly. After all, during the period of the October events,  two special subunits of the Main Guard Directorate, Vympel and  Alpha, did not obey the president's orders to storm the White  House. Now Vympel has been transferred to the Interior Ministry  and not much is left of it. The Alpha command held out with  difficulty in the Kremlin. Relations with it are fairly cool.  But there is also an official explanation for the  reorganization of the former Number Nine."    At this point the video shows a man being interviewed,  captioned as Andrey Oligov, Russian Federation Presidential  Security Service. Oligov says:    "The creation of the new federal body called the  Presidential  Security Service is a logical step in the general reorganization  of the special services of the former Soviet Union and the  special services of the Russian Federation. You are well aware  that the State Security Committee which existed for a long time  and which operated within the system of the USSR now exists in  Russia as several special services, each of which is engaged in  specific functional duties linked either with intelligence  operations, or counterintelligence operations, or information  operations. In view of that, a new federal service is being  created which will fully ensure the security of the president of  the Russian Federation, and according to his instructions, be  responsible for guarding top state leaders."    Correspondent Gindileyev then continues: "After the  presidential decree on the reorganization of the Main Guard  Directorate of the Russian Federation, its chief -- Commandant  of the Kremlin (Mikhail Barsukov) -- was somehow moved out of  the spotlight. The spotlight was taken over by (Aleksandr  Korzhakov), chief of the president's personal guard, who was  already strong from a political point of view. The 44-year-old  Korzhakov is the closest man to Yeltsin in the Kremlin. He was  already guarding the future Russian president when the latter  was a candidate member of the CPSU Politburo. He left the ninth  KGB directorate at the same time as Yeltsin left the party  Central Committee. He was remembered for that, both by the KGB  and by Yeltsin."    The video then shows film footage of Korzhakov working with  Yeltsin on various occasions, following which the interview with  Oligov continues. Oligov says: "Like any special service, the  Presidential Security Service has its own structure. In it  there are subunits which ensure the president's security  directly, that is, effectively an institution of bodyguards. In  order for that subunit to function, naturally a very powerful  support base is needed -- this includes an analytical subunit, a  special staff which performs not only dispatching functions but  also simultaneously processes the information coming in. There  is also an operational subunit, that is, the Presidential  Security Service is empowered by the operational investigation  law to carry out operational investigations -- to gather  information related to terrorism, and in general to investigate  threats which could harm the president's security."    In answer to a question about whether the Presidential  Security Service is growing into a "super special service",  Oligov replies: "The very fact of the division of the Main Guard  Directorate into two departments -- the Main Guard Directorate  and the Presidential Security Service -- on the contrary  illustrates the narrower specialization of subunits doing their  own specific jobs. So I think it is wrong to say that the  presidential Security Service will grow and become some kind of  monster, some kind of entirely new special service. It has  clear tasks, and not a great number of staff."    Gindileyev concludes his report by noting that, according to  unverified figures, approximately 2,000 people are now working  under General Korzhakov. These include a number of soldiers on  compulsory service who have served in CIS trouble spots.  "However," Gindileyev says, "basically the SBP remains an  elite, and the most closed secret service in Russia."    During the report the video shows, as well as Andrey Oligov  being interviewed, and shots of General Korzhakov working with  Yeltsin, feature movie pictures of a motor convoy under attack,  the presidential box at the Bolshoy Theater being prepared for  Yeltsin's arrival, men training with handguns, personnel on  guard at an airport, and men performing martial arts exercises.</p>

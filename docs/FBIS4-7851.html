			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] South Slav media have been carrying  reports that the Yugoslav military leadership has become  increasingly worried about troop morale. Fewer and fewer  soldiers are going to war voluntarily, and the authorities in  Serbia and Montenegro have had to resort to forceful  mobilization of Serb refugees. Commenting on this issue in a 3  February interview on Sarajevo radio, Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic said that the Yugoslav military may be suffering a  "shortage of manpower" and having problems with "the morale of  that manpower."    In the 17 March issue of the Ljubljana daily DNEVNIK, the  Slovene Press Agency [STA] reports that few conscripts are  responding to call-ups in Montenegro. Many of them obtain  medical certificates attesting that they are physically  incapable of serving in the armed forces. Quoting the Podgorica  weekly LIBERAL, STA states that such false medical certificates  are sold by draft officers at a high price, adding that many  reservists prefer going to jail to enlisting for the "defense of  the fatherland." According to the report, the military police  are quite active, picking up draftees on the streets and  delivering them to military barracks.    STA reports that the "action" is supposedly coordinated by  Major Veselin Sljivancanin, a "man on the wanted list" and the  "hero of Vukovar." As commander of the 5th Motorized Brigade of  the Podgorica Corps, he is also in charge of all Montenegrin  draft boards. According to "well-informed sources," he was sent  from Belgrade to Montenegro to "put military affairs in order  and raise the morale of the military." "Other sources" claim  that his assignment is to prevent the possible secession of  Montenegro from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, if necessary  by utilizing the "methods he employed in Vukovar." Examining his  role in Montenegro, the 5 November issue of the Podgorica  opposition weekly MONITOR concludes that Sljivancanin, "a lover  of the Socialist Party of Serbia" and a proven fighter for the  "Serbian cause," had been sent to exert "federal" pressure on  the Montenegrin Government. Although he was allegedly received  "cooly" by his immediate superior, General Milorad Obradovic,  MONITOR reports, many people feel that Sljivancanin might remain  in Podgorica permanently, while others believe that his  assignment must be viewed as a "temporary solution" within the  context of personnel changes in the Yugoslav Army.</p>

In an interview with the paper, Director-General Hans Blix,  who is now staying in Japan, said that he could not know when  the facility would be completed, but when it is built, North  Korea's capacity of producing plutonium -- which will be used  for a nuclear weapons program -- would double.    Director-General Blix stressed that the IAEA needs to  inspect  two nuclear facilities which North Korea did not report to the  IAEA before in addition to its overall inspection [chonmyon  sachal] of the complex of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon.</p>

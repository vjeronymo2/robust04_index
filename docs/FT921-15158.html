			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Fed chairman warns against fiscal measures MR Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday said he would take whatever steps were needed to ensure a 'sustainable economic expansion' but warned Congress that fiscal measures to stimulate the economy were 'premature'. He told a joint hearing of the Senate banking and budget committees that action to reduce the US's long-term structural budget deficit ought to be the main fiscal priority. The last thing the US needed was policies leading to further borrowing and debt creation. Mr Greenspan's remarks followed President George Bush's pledge yesterday to unveil an 'ambitious plan for economic growth' in the state of the union address later this month. Mr Greenspan said the recovery had clearly faltered and conceded that the Fed had not yet got the monetary response it wanted from lower interest rates. However, he expected the one-point cut in the discount rate before Christmas to provide a 'considerable impetus' for the economy. He said the timing of any interest rate cuts would be influenced by the need to ensure a steady fall in long-term bond yields. Mr Greenspan said recent economic data did not support the degree of public concern currently expressed. The economy was stalled rather than falling sharply. Unemployment remained low by the standards of previous downturns. He said this implied people were mainly concerned by the poor longer-term outlook. These 'broader and deeper' concerns were best addressed by structural measures to increase savings and investment rather than a short-term fiscal stimulus.</p>

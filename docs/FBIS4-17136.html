			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Leaders of Ukraine's Communist Party (KPU)  held a news conference on 19 April at which Petro Symonenko, KPU  central committee first secretary, said the party's minimum task  had almost been achieved. The communists won 86 seats, while  the left bloc as a whole had more than one third of the votes in  the parliament. In the words of Petro Symonenko, the KPU  revealed itself as a significant political force. The communist  faction is counting on fruitful cooperation with other factions  and with nonaffiliated deputies. Petro Symonenko said: "We are  entering parliament as a constructive force. We have a  constructive platform that is aimed at creating conditions for a  normal life for the people of Ukraine."    It was reported at the news conference that more than 10  million citizens of Ukraine had voted for the communists during  the elections to the Supreme Council, which in the party  leadership's opinion, is proof of the adherence by a significant  part of Ukraine's population to the ideas of socialist justice,  internationalism, and an equal union of independent states.    Regarding activity in parliament, Petro Symonenko noted that  the communists would not give in to provocations by nationalists  who "continue to frighten the people with supposedly the  communists will paralyze parliament's work by submitting for  discussion the issue on state symbols." In the words of the KPU  leader, for the communists, the Supreme Council's first steps  will be the formation of parliamentary and government  structures, as well as the implementation of an economic program  that envisages the introduction of state regulation in the basic  sectors of industry and agriculture, introduces changes to the  taxation system that, in the communists' opinion, is directed  against workers and changes to the financial and credit systems  etc. After this, the communists intend to submit for the  parliament's consideration the issue of repealing the ban on the  KPU and on returning assets that for the most part have become  the property of commercial structures.    Petro Symonenko informed journalists that in the near  future,  a meeting is expected to be held with Leonid Kravchuk, president  of Ukraine, at the latter's instigation. The KPU also proposed  that Ivan Plyushch form a working group to prepare the work of  the new Supreme Council. This was agreed. It was stressed that  the communists are taking part in the presidential campaign only  for the sake of publicizing communist ideas among Ukraine's  population. In the event of a communist contender being elected  (Petro Symonenko's candidacy has been approved), he would do  everything to ensure that power in Ukraine belonged exclusively  to the councils.    Replying to questions from journalists regarding the  division  of the Black Sea Fleet, Petro Symonenko said that in order to  resolve this problem it would be necessary to return to a  defense union with Russia, within which the problem would be  resolved peacefully. Replying to a question about Ukraine's  place in the world, Borys Oliynyk, KPU central committee member,  said relations with other states should be built on the basis of  equality.</p>

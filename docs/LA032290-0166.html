			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLOBAL TRADE GROWTH SLOWS DURING YEAR  </P> <P> Global trade hit a record $3.1-trillion last year, but it grew less rapidly  than in the previous year and seems set to slow further in 1990, the world  trade forum GATT said in a preliminary estimate Thursday.  </P> <P> The United States regained its place as the world's leading exporter after  three years in second place behind West Germany.  </P> <P> Japan retained third position.  </P> <P> Trade volume in 1989 rose by an estimated 7%, compared to 8.5% in 1988, the  report said.  </P> <P> Although this was enough to push the total above $3 trillion for the first  time, the rise in value at 7.5% was almost half the rise of 14% in 1988, it  said.  </P> <P> GATT added that the outlook for 1990 was generally optimistic with no world  recession in sight.  </P> <P> But economic growth was expected to slow in advanced nations to just under 3%,  and the rise in trade volume could ease to between 5% and 6%. Even that rate  would equal or exceed trade performance in seven of the past 10 years.  </P> <P> The forecasts were part of a report by the secretariat of the 96-nation General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade based on data available in late February.  </P> <P> The report noted the value of world trade was below $2 trillion as recently as  1985, and the 7% volume increase in 1989 was the third largest during the  1980s.  </P></p>

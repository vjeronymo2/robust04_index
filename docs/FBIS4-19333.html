			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gian Antonio Stella report: "Irene, the Lombard Maid -- </F> She Was Elected With the Slogan: Your Soul to God, Your Vote to  Bossi"]    [Text] Rome -- An armored tank in a pastel-colored,  two-piece suit: "Catholics cannot always recognize everyone's  right to profess their own religion." If old Monsignor Marcel  Lefebvre, the crusader of precouncil fundamentalism, was still  alive, no doubt his eyes would shine with emotion. Could he  ever have dreamt, at the time the hated Rome of the Papacy was  drifting toward modernism, that a traditionalist like Irene  Pivetti would be nominated for the post of speaker of the lower  house?    Each word is like a stone being thrown: "It is a Catholic's  specific duty to endeavor to convert others and not leave them  prey to error." Does Article 18 of the Declaration of Human  Rights not guarantee everybody the right to profess their own  religion? "It is a Catholic's duty not to subscribe to it  uncritically." Because there is only one possible goal:  "Building a society in which Catholic religion is shared by  everybody."    Combative Irene -- the League's true Joan of Arc -- has  never  been afraid to speak up. She has never given up making polemic,  adamant, cutting remarks. Against the progressive  intellectuals: "I do not give a hoot." Against Cardinal Paolo  Martini: "He manages the Milan curia [archbishopric] like a  holding." Against those who accuse her of wanting to foster the  northern race. "There is nothing wrong with that. It is not  the League saying there are fewer births in the north than in  the south, it is a statistical fact." She is always  straightforward with what she believes in: God, Bandwagon  [League nickname], and family -- forward like a tank advancing  on gentle tracks with the hoarse thundering voice of someone who  has smoked too many Gauloises cigarettes and against everything  and everybody, including her own boss, if necessary. Like that  time when [League secretary] Bossi invited "that dear little hot  number [Federation of Italian Socialists Secretary] Boniver" to  taste the strength of "hard-on-ism." With her strict air of a  Swiss nanny of the Frau Rottermayer variety, the Bandwagon's  virgin maid frowned and said: "I felt uncomfortable. A vulgar  attack...." She even burst out: "I felt like punching him in  the nose."    She carries her 31 years with somewhat starched  gracefulness:  vaporous, chestnut-colored, 30's-style hairdo; somewhere between  dove-color and sapphire blue, transparent eyes; a slightly  absent, suffering air; a beautiful mouth which rarely opens into  a smile. Irene Pivetti was born in Milan, on 4 April 1963, on  St. Isidore's day. Daughter of a film-director and an actress,  both of them Catholics, she attended the scientific high school,  deepened her religious faith by taking part in spiritual rites  and contemplative experiences, discovered commitment by dealing  with ethnic music for the curia's broadcasting station "Radio  A." She chose the path of modern languages, enrolling in the  Sacro Cuore University and graduating with the highest marks,  having submitted a thesis on 15th-century linguist Benedetto  Varchi's unpublished work -- a choice which was in line with  family traditions. Once sarcastically branded by FAMIGLIA  CRISTIANA as "the League's titmouse," she is in fact the niece  of Aldo Gabrielli, the author of the dictionary published under  his name, whose latest edition she supervised herself.    Intelligent, cultured, willful, politically educated by FUCI  [Italian Catholics University Federation] and ACLI [Christian  Association of Italian Workers], she told of how she had  discovered the League just over four years ago: "I wrote an  article against those who dismissed the League too offhandedly.  Bossi phoned me and treated me to a pizza." Love at first  sight. She was immediately entrusted with the bandwagon's  Catholic Consultation Office [Consulta], together with Giuseppe  Leoni (who, years later, censored her, saying she "speaks like a  Lefebvrian"), immediately stood as a candidate for the Chamber  of Deputies, and was immediately elected with a forceful slogan  "Your soul to God, your vote to Bossi." A meteoric rise which  was offset by a family crisis, namely the deterioration of her  relationship with her husband, Paolo Taranta, a young left-wing  Catholic economist close to the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left]. A Catholic-Communist (the worst possible combination, in  Irene's view) who greeted his wife's election to the Chamber of  Deputies with an icy: "Congratulations. What a shame you happen  to be in the wrong party."    Dressed always in yuppy manageress suits -- often enlivened  by the glimmer of a gold necklace (the "Vandee [18th-century  French counterrevolutionary movement] cross," testifying to her  faith in revolt: "A beautiful example of the people's religious  heroism"), dismissed by [Forza Italia sympathizer] Deputy  Vittorio Sgarbi with an anti-Scalfaro quip ("We have moved from  the contemplation of the Madonna, to the Madonna herself"),  Irene Pivetti has now been for years at the center of -- often  violent -- polemics.    Let us mention only three. The first was a campaign in the  name of Cardinal Ratzinger ("a true guarantor of Catholic faith  and morals") against Cardinal Martini, conducted in such harsh  tones as to lead Umberto Bossi to say that "like all Catholics,  Irene also often adopts fundamentalist attitudes worthy of  Khomeyni."    The second campaign was that against abortion: "The law must  be reviewed from top to bottom. In the abortion surgery  factories, there must also be doctors who object to abortion and  enlighten people's consciences."    The third polemic was aimed against the "antiracist  Savonarolas" [virulent 15th-century Florentine moralist  preacher] who, in her view, had stirred up a "great fuss" by  demanding an antiracist law only because of a few "stars of  David stuck on the shopwindows of a few Jewish people in Rome."  A multi-episode polemic: Accused by a foreign newspaper of  using anti-Semitic tones, the League deputy (beware of calling  her "right honorable": "I cannot stand it") submitted a motion  in parliament -- [Radical leader] Pannella recalled -- asking to  be protected against the "Jewish freemasonry." Replying to those  "more or less well-known members of the Jewish community" who  had dared criticize her (such as [Journalist] Arrigo Levi, in a  CORRIERE DELLA SERA article), she replied with three words which  her uncle only included in his dictionary with bashful  embarrassment: "Balls, balls, balls!"</p>

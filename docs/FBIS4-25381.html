			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Southwest China staff reporter Yang Yung-nien </F> (2799 3057 1628): "Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Secretary  Xie Shijie Says During a Special Interview With WEN WEI PO  Reporter That Sichuan Is Determined To Let Foreign Businessmen  Make Profits and To Display the Superiority of the Market With a  Population of 100 Million"]    [Text] Chengdu, 1 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- Xie Shijie, member  of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Sichuan  Provincial CPC Committee, told this reporter during a recent  exclusive interview that his province this year would implement  a strategy of "advancing great development by great opening up,"  a major move to implement the "crucial reform operation year"  program set forth by the central authorities. Xie said this  operation is to highlight Sichuan's special characteristics. In  talking about seizing the opportunity, we mean to seize the  opportunity in this respect: To expand and intensify the  opening up process, to launch more cooperative projects, and to  strive to score real results in forwarding economic development,  he said.    As the party committee secretary of the most populous  province of China, he told this reporter that Sichuan, as an  inland province geographically isolated from the outside world,  has made progress and done a good job in expanding contact with  the outside world in recent years. The province has established  friendly ties with dozens of Chinese and foreign provinces and  cities. Now Sichuan is maintaining economic relations and  trading with more than 120 countries and areas, and nearly 4,000  foreign-funded enterprises are operating in the province. Two  years ago, there were only several hundred foreign-funded  enterprises in the province. Since Deng Xiaoping's southern  tour, new foreign-funded enterprises have been established in  Sichuan at a rate of more than 1,000 per year. The size of  projects ranges from small to large, and projects of extra-large  size are being launched one after another. An agreement has  been signed with Mr. Tsui Tsin-tong to run the joint project of  Mianyang-Chengdu expressway. Mr. Li Ka-shing is planning to  invest in Sichuan province too, one of his projects being a  housing project covering a total area of several million square  meters.    Secretary Xie Shijie said: Chronologically speaking, Sichuan  has made progress. But compared with other provinces in the  country, this province is still lagging far behind. In view of  this, early this year, eight provincial leaders, bringing dozens  of department heads and bureau directors along with them, made  fact-finding tours in six developed provinces, namely,  Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shandong.  They drew a conclusion from their tours that Sichuan province  lags behind others mainly in two aspects: First, in terms of  the extent of emancipation of mind, and second, in intensity of  opening up. After repeated and thorough discussion on this  question for several months, a consensus has now been reached  within the province, from the upper to the lower levels. In  order to develop its economy, Sichuan province needs to promote  reform and development through opening up, and great opening up  will in turn result in great development. Secretary Xie said:  Sichuan province's financial resources are so limited as to be  called "subsistence finance." So it is unrealistic to expect  more funds to be allocated to finance construction projects. Of  course we have considered asking for money from the central  government in Beijing. Can we do this? Of course we can. But  we can ask for money only once or twice, and we cannot keep  asking for money again and again. Now we have an opportunity  before us. Funds are available abroad, and foreign investors  are looking for cooperation partners and investment  opportunities. The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary  noted: Now lots of investment projects have been launched in  every coastal city which offers opportunities for investment,  and preferential policies have been applied to wherever  preferential policies should be applied to. Sichuan has a  potential market with a 100 million population, and in the world  today one cannot find another market with a 100 million  population which is waiting to be explored. The province's  economy is to be developed, the people's living standards are to  be improved, and the demand is to increase. So this place with  a population of 100 million will become an amazing, vast market!    The first in command of Sichuan province said: This year  Sichuan province has taken new steps toward this target.  Practice over the past few months shows that the results we  have scored are quite good. The Chongqing mayor recently  returned from an overseas trip with signed contracts involving a  total value of $ 1.1 billion, including a value of $400 million  that foreign partners have promised to pay in. Deyang city has  drawn in a $100 million worth of foreign investments.  Dujiangyan city has secured some $40 million worth of  investment funds.    This provincial party committee secretary, born in the rural  areas of eastern Sichuan, received his higher education at an  agricultural college, and worked up step by step from the county  and prefectural to provincial levels. Until today he still  retains the simple and honest character of a Sichuan peasant.  He chatted frankly and honestly without talking big. He said:  "We have made it very clear that we will assure foreign  investors of profits. Just imagine that they are coming a long  way to make investments in this remote inland province. No  project could possibly be started if it promises no profit."    Xie Shijie told this reporter that he and his colleagues had  reached this consensus after drawing lessons from their past  experience. Some localities invited many people to pay visits.  The hosts and guests talked with each other cheerfully at  meetings and parties. But no follow-up work was done after the  meetings or parties, thus nothing was achieved. One of the main  problems is that some of our people have haggled over every  ounce. Therefore, the provincial party committee secretary has  often warned cadres at all levels to ignore petty and short-term  profits but focus on big and long-term interests instead. He  said: We must do our best to really draw in foreign funds.  After all, from a long-term point of view, it will be  beneficial to Sichuan if we can have infrastructure and factory  buildings built here.    The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary said: We  must not apply the same formula to every investment plan, but  must adopt tailor-made measures. Anyway, we must make every  effort to retain foreign funds in our province. To conclude the  interview, Secretary Xie Shijie said to this reporter with an  open mind: Sichuan province has started opening up a bit later  than others, and we have less experience in this regard. But we  have made up our minds to blaze new trails and to do a good job.  The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary urged this  reporter to pass a message on to readers abroad: Sichuan  province is trustworthy, its cadres have liberal minds and will  sincerely and wholeheartedly cooperate with friends from abroad.  The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary also promised:  "We certainly will protect all investors' legitimate interests."</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Pit cuts stoke closure fears British Coal has told unions it expects to cut staffing at Ellington colliery, Northumberland, its last remaining pit in north-east England by more than half. The move came as Mr Neil Clarke, the corporation's chairman, indicated there was a need for further mine closures. Mr Clarke said plans by generators to run down stocks increased pressure on the need to cut production. His remarks fuelled expectations that the corporation will announce further closures in the new year on top of the seven announced in the past two months. At Ellington unions were told to expect the loss of 650 jobs by 1996, with 180 going by April. The pit employs 1,240. Production in 1994-95 will be cut from 2.2m tonnes to 1.5m, probably requiring a further 100 redundancies. Further job losses are likely in 1995-96, cutting staffing to 590. Meanwhile, British Coal is to offer cut-price coal to generators at considerably less than production costs. It believes there will be no sales this financial year but hopes electricity generators will buy several million tonnes next year. Even if it achieved that target, it is unlikely that more than 15 of the remaining 22 pits would remain open by privatisation. Private View, Weekend FT Page XXII</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER PITCHES AGOURA TO TITLE IN 1-A SOFTBALL FINAL  </P> <P> The Agoura High softball team, which won only one game in the 1986 and 1987  seasons combined, completed a rags-to-riches journey by winning its first  Southern Section 1-A Division title with a 4-1 victory over Big Bear in the  championship game Saturday at Mayfair Park in Lakewood.  </P> <P> The Chargers (23-2), in their first venture outside the opening round of the  playoffs, got a strong performance by sophomore right-hander Melissa Thatcher,  the pitcher of record in every Agoura decision this season. Thatcher threw a  four-hitter, walked two and struck out nine -- including the side in the second  inning.  </P> <P> "I got a lot of them on curves," she said of the strikeouts. "I didn't throw  too many fastballs. I tried to make them guess what's coming."  </P> <P> Thatcher had no clue as to what was coming after the game when her teammates  covered her with whipped cream. Agoura Coach Linda Moule received similar  attention when the Chargers dumped a cooler of water over her head.  </P> <P> Big Bear Coach Mike Clifton was not in the mood to celebrate, however.  </P> <P> "It was not our best effort," said Clifton, who coached the Bears (22-4) to the  Small Schools Division title last year. "When you play the final, you have to  play your best game to win.  </P> <P> "They put the ball in play and we didn't play defense."  </P> <P> With her team trailing, 1-0, in the first, Agoura's Jill Hartwig reached base  on a fielding error and, with one out, Thatcher singled. Both scored on Leslie  North's double to center field and the Chargers led, 2-1.  </P> <P> Agoura, which won its last 20 games of the season, was limited to four hits by  Marjie Sievers (20-4). But the Chargers picked up a pair of important insurance  runs in the fourth.  </P> <P> Robyn Bailey reached base on a throwing error and scored when Big Bear first  baseman Leigh Anne Drake threw the ball into center field after Tamara Dulansky  was retired on a sacrifice bunt.  </P> <P> Wendy Baertschiger followed with a bunt single, advanced to second on a  sacrifice and scored the Chargers' final run when third baseman Daphne Staricka  overthrew Drake after fielding Lisa Little's ground ball.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, 26 April (SNARK) -- The Armenian parliament  deputy, Ashot Bleyan, appeared in the Supreme Council with a  statement charging the authorities in conduction of "undeclared  war." He claimed that nearly 15 thousand Armenians became the  victims of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. " Only during the last  three or four months more than one thousand Armenian youths were  killed", announced the deputy.    Bleyan's indignant colleagues did not let him finish the  appearance, blaming him of lie, so that the speaker had to  interrupt the session.    Ashot Bleyan, known for his pacifist position, has abandoned  two years ago the ruling party -- the Armenian National Movement  -- and founded a new social-policy organization " New Way",  whose non-numerous followers appear for the immediate compromise  solution of Nagorno-Karabakh problem. Nearly a year and a half  ago, this deputy visited Baku, which caused a non-unanimous  reaction in Armenia.    Being a professional teacher, Bleyan is known also as a  director of advanced educational center in Yerevan, "Mekhitar  Sebastatsi."</p>

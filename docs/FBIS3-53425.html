			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Real Beneficiaries of an Independent </F> Kurdistan"]    [Text] Dismemberment of Iraq's Kurdistan is a serious  security threat to the entire Middle East.    Over the past few days, Iraq's Kurdistan has witnessed  bloody  clashes and conflicts sparked by heavy attacks launched by Jalal  Talabani's group against the Muslim Kurdish Movement.    Through these hostilities are commonplace in Northern Iraq,  the bloodshed in the past several days has been too violent and  horrendous even by Iraqi standards.    Despite all these atrocities in northern Iraq, the Western  mass media have been suspiciously silent.    In fact, taking advantage of the post-Persian Gulf War  conditions, the West strives to promote "ethnic nationalism"  aimed at paving the way for the dismemberment of the regional  countries.    To reach this goal, the West is manipulating the weakest  link  in the area's security chain, namely the Kurds.    In the first phase, the West set forth the issue of "the  Kurdish Parliament," and in the second stage it put forward the  concept of "the Kurdish government." To this end, the West made  utmost use of Iraq's current confused political climate.    In view of the West's hatred of Saddam Husayn, their next  move will be to promote the recognition of this self-proclaimed  "Kurdish government".    A plot of profound depth and breadth is thus in the offing,  namely, the creation of a new Israel in the region possessing  the Karkuk oil resources which can seriously jeopardize the  territorial integrity of all the regional countries.    With time racing ahead, the massacre of the Muslim Kurds by  Talabani's group should serve as a serious warning to all  concerned parties.    Actually, this signifies that Talabani and his group have  been designated to be in charge of enforcing this plot, and  recent massacres prove that they are ready to go to any length  and to commit any crime in order to bring this sinister plot to  fruition.    Consequently, co-operation between Iran and Turkey, as the  pivotal core of a coalition, is called for to thwart this  Western ploy.    Alongside this collaboration, the two should also consult  with Iraq and Syria.    In recent years Saddam's regime has meted out a great deal  of  oppression to the Iraqi Kurds. It should, however, be borne in  mind that all Iraqis have been subjected to oppression. But  this does not necessarily mean that the Iraqi Shiites, for  example, will opt for dismemberment of Iraq.    Today, the conspiracy to dismember Iraq's Kurdistan stands  out as a serious peril, therefore, providing moral, political,  or material support to these groups by Turkey and Syria cannot  be justified, and in this regard convening of an extraordinary  meeting of the foreign ministers of Iran, Turkey, and Syria is  called for at this time.</p>

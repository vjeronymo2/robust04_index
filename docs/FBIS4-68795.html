			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [First paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment] </F>   [Text] The slogan of civil accord is the key fashion today.  The Right calls upon the Left to adopt it, the Left calls upon  the Right, the Centre--upon the flanks, and further on all along  the front. But already the first approaches to negotiations have  shown: "civil accord" is a notion replete with many  interpretations.    With this publication MN offers its own negotiating process.  <H5>  A very timely idea </H5>   Boris YELTSIN: "The need for an Agreement on reaching civil  accord in Russia has been brought forth and prepared by the  entire course of political life in the country, however  contradictory it may seem, and by the requirement to ensure  society's political stability and to support the seeds of civil  peace."    Ella PAMFILOVA (Russia's Choice faction): Agreement among  all  the opposing sides is possible in principle. It will be a big  achievement if the opponents come to terms with the civilized  methods of political struggle, and give up violence. But it is  difficult to reach even this kind of agreement. There is no  certainty that those who signed will not harbor cunning thoughts  and will not use the agreement to lull the vigilance of  opponents. It is even more difficult to reach accord on the  fundamental questions of policy and the economy, most  importantly, on the methods and aims of the reform. There is a  risk that the document will be limited to demagogic formulations  which can bring about unprincipled compromises. As a result, we  shall continue rotting in the quagmire.    Gennady ZYUGANOV (Communist Party of the Russian  Federation):  I will speak not about the idea of accord, but about the idea of  national reconciliation. It really hangs in the air. And we have  this kind of historical experience. In December 1941, when the  Nazis were at the walls of Moscow, victimized Cossacks,  dispossessed peasants and exiled intellectuals participated  together in a nationwide front. Now we also have a common  adversary--it is the anti-people, anti-policy which has been  called radical reforms.    Sergei SHAKHRAI (Party of Russian Unity and Accord):  Agreement is possible in principle. I am not surprised that  preparations are proceeding with difficulties. There are many  reasons for this. First and foremost, we lack political culture:  everyone is impatient, everyone is settling accounts with  everyone else. Moreover, there is no full-fledged multiparty  system in the country. Social groups are not associated with a  party of their own. And, lastly, the country is at a turning  point, in conditions of the deepest political and economic  crisis. The most important thing now is not to permit a war over  how to create peace.    Vladimir LYSENKO (Republican Party of Russia, "Yabloko"  faction): The idea is very timely. But we already signed several  agreements (true, not such wide-ranging ones) with the  President. (For instance, in December 1991 between the President  and the political parties.) Yet none of them was fulfilled. The  President forgot all about these documents right after their  signing. What was important for him was the process, not the  result.  <H5>  To adopt as the basis? </H5>   Boris YELTSIN: "The first stage of work on the text of the  Agreement is over... The possibility of joint constructive work  by representatives from different branches of authority, parties  and trade unions became clear already in the process of drafting  it."    Ella PANFILOVA: In the draft presented by the President,  there is something to work with. But the document needs to be  examined very thoroughly--among other things, the social aspects.    Gennady ZYUGANOV: The document contains reasonable  proposals.  But, if we are to speak about it as a whole, it is written very  simple: don't touch the "sacred cow" known as the Constitution,  don't re-elect ahead of time those who have reduced the country  to its present-day condition. And forget what happened on  October 3-4. In exchange? We promise not to abuse you...    Sergei SHAKHRAI: The draft presented by the President is  almost in finished form. And though we have made our proposals  for improving it, in principle we are ready to sign it even now.    Vladimir LYSENKO: When the document was ready in its rough  form, it had to be discussed with the various factions, parties  and the President. But for some reasons the President instructed  his aides to expand it. Regrettably, he met only with Russia's  Choice though it would not be bad at all to exchange views with  the others, too...    Our faction--"Yabloko"--has not yet made the final decision.  In the Republican Party, however, the draft was discussed, and  we are preparing a package of proposals. But the overwhelming  majority believes: the draft can be signed, things will not be  any worse.  <H5>  Ground for accord? </H5>   Boris YELTSIN: "One hears sceptical voices claiming that an  Agreement is impossible given the present-day state of society.  This point of view leads us into an impasse. The population, the  majority of political parties and a considerable part of the  deputy corps are interested in accord and political stability..."    Vladimir LYSENKO: "I believe that the whole Agreement should  consist of two points. The opposition guarantees that in the  course of two years it will not press for the dismissal of the  President and will quietly wait till the next elections. In  reply, Yeltsin guarantees that he will not dissolve the Federal  Assembly and let it live until the next President is elected.  Besides, the Agreement must necessarily be signed by all the  factions of the State Duma. If it has been signed solely by the  trade unions, businessmen, directors, the government, the  republics and the President and has not been signed by  representatives from the opposition, this document will be  meaningless.    Gennady ZYUGANOV: Our faction has very thoroughly discussed  the presidential draft and formulated the conditions on the  basis of which, we believe, accord can be reached. They include:  a change of the present-day course, the formation of a  government of national confidence, urgent measures aimed to  combat corruption and theft, steps for the social protection of  the population (indexation of pensions, an increase and timely  pay of stipends to students, timely pay of wages, paying the  debts to the peasantry). As far as the signing procedure is  concerned, this is a question of fundamental importance. The  Agreement must primarily be signed by political forces. And for  this there is a need for decisions by elective bodies--at  plenums, conferences and congresses.    Sergei SHAKHRAI: The point is not so much in the content of  the document as in the procedure of its signing. It is important  that representatives from polar forces should take their seats  at the negotiating table. Each politician and each political  force must pass this document through themselves, to consider  this text to be their own and not submitted from above.    Ella PAMFILOVA: Today everyone agrees on a similar selection  of populist catchwords--for a great Russia, against the  impoverishment of the masses. But even catchwords must be  treated very carefully. Is it possible to unite Russia on the  principles of rigid nationalism? Is it possible to vanquish  poverty by giving up economic reforms? There is still a need to  unite on a clearly formulated foundation.  <H5>  Guarantee coupon </H5>   Boris YELTSIN: "The Conciliatory Commission controls the  observance of the provisions formalized by this Agreement...  Upon ascertaining the facts of the Agreement being violated the  Conciliatory Commission:    --makes a pertinent statement in the mass media;    --poses a question about excluding the participant from the  number of those who signed the Agreement;    --tables a proposal on measures bearing on the political  responsibility of persons...all the way to relieving them from  the leading positions they hold and laying down deputy powers."    Sergei SHAKHRAI: I would name three main guarantees for the  fulfilment of the Agreement. First, the honor and dignity of the  people from different political forces. Second, control over the  mass media. And third, we have suggested that this Agreement be  adopted as a law. And here the sequence of steps is important.  The law must be adopted after all have signed it. But even if  someone disagrees, once the law has been adopted, it affects  everyone.    Gennady ZYUGANOV: Accord can be reached if the document is  created from below. This is the best guarantee. All the more so  since no legal norms must be built into it. Only moral and  political commitments.    Vladimir LYSENKO: The question about guarantees is the most  difficult one. The President suggests setting up a Conciliatory  Commission which will censure and penalize someone. I think that  this is naive. If someone violates the Agreement, it will mean  that it is not in force. At best there will be a need to appeal  to public opinion. Any attempts to formulate some political or  legal mechanism are unfeasible.  <H5>  Weather for tomorrow </H5>   Boris YELTSIN: "I believe that adoption and implementation  of  the Agreement are feasible."    Gennady ZYUGANOV: The chances of signing the document on  accord are high enough. We don't have any special choices. There  are only three variants for the development of the political  situation in Russia: first--a criminal-mafiosi state; second--a  large-scale conflict and mass social eruptions, and third--the  evolutionary path of changes. The first two roads will hardly  suit the President. But if the evolutionary process proceeds in  a democratic way, at least on the surface, then the Left-centre  forces will come to power in a legitimate way...    Vladimir LYSENKO: The Agreement has a chance for success.  Relations between the opposition and the regime have become more  positive. The pendulum has continued moving leftward. Therfore  the opposition has quieted down. Earlier they wanted to topple  the President immediately. Now the opposition, at any rate the  parliamentary one, has come to the conclusion that it is better  to wait two years than provoke clashes.  <H5>  MN policy desk </H5>   The draft Agreement prepared by the President has been made  public. This event is, in effect, a starting point of the  official negotiating process. Judging by comments, the way to  civil reconciliation will not be easy. Making the first  statements, the sides have so far designated their extreme  claims. A process of long political bargaining lies ahead which  must result in mutual concessions. But will there be any? And if  there will, will it be possible to keep the course towards  democracy and the market alive? For the time being, at any rate,  accord has been reached on only one thing--on the sides'  readiness to renounce unconstitutional action. This, as  politicians believe, is the minimum program. It is not ruled  out, however, that this minimum is the maximum for today's  Russia.</p>

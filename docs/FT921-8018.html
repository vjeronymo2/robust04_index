			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reverses early climb on Fed's surprise move Wall Street US STOCK markets staged a remarkable turnround yesterday, with share prices falling sharply from early highs in the wake of an unexpected announcement from the Federal Reserve that it was cutting bank reserve requirements, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.24 at 3,224.73, having earlier in the day been more than 20 points ahead and nearing its record close of 3,276.83. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished a sharp 5.10 off at 407.38, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks showed a drop of 10.02 at 626.41. Turnover on the New York SE came to 235m shares. The Fed's announcement that, as from April 2, it was reducing reserve requirements on bank transaction accounts from 12 per cent to 10 per cent initially lifted sentiment, on the grounds that the move would allow banks to pass on lower funding costs to customers in the form of cheaper credit. Within hours, however, the market had turned around as investors took their cue from a decline in bond prices, which were depressed by fears that the Fed's actions ruled out another interest rate cut. As the falling 30-year bond pushed benchmark long-term interest rates up towards 8 per cent, equity investors took flight. The news of the reduced reserve requirements, however, helped some bank stocks. Chase Manhattan rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 24, Citicorp Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 16 1/2 , BankAmerica Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 40 3/8 and Banc-One Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 46 7/8 . Airline issues were in the limelight in the wake of positive comments on the sector from analysts at two broking houses, Shearson Lehman Brothers and First Boston, and lower crude oil prices. UAL advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 148 1/4 , AMR (parent of American Airlines) Dollars 2 to Dollars 76, Delta Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 70 1/8 and USAir Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 3/4 . Walt Disney jumped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 146 1/2 after the entertainment group announced plans for a four-for-one stock split. On the American Stock Exchange, Greyhound Lines slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 10 7/8 after the bus operator said it would purchase new buses for Dollars 24m. Turner Broadcasting 'A' eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 5/8 after news that the company will soon unveil plans for a new cartoon television network. Among mostly weaker oil shares, Phillips Petroleum receded Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 7/8 after stating that it would cut its workforce by 1,100 by the end of June, and Occidental declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 19 1/2 in spite of revealing that it will sell a variety of coal properties for Dollars 41m. Marvel Entertainment, a relative newcomer to the market and which has enjoyed explosive growth in its share price since flotation, plummeted Dollars 11 3/8 to Dollars 54 5/8 in the wake of press reports highlighting that the comic book publisher remains highly leveraged. Canada A LATE sell-off in the US and Canadian bond markets dragged Toronto stocks down in moderate trading. The composite index fell 19.6 to close at 3,551.2. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 335 to 255, while volume amounted to 27m shares. Dominion Textile slipped CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 8 1/2 . The company said it will discontinue operation of its Dominion Fabrics unit, and will permanently close two plants run by the unit. Abitibi-Price reported a fourth-quarter loss of CDollars 48.1m, or 70 cents a share, after a restructuring charge of CDollars 24.4m. The stock was unchanged at CDollars 15 3/8 .</p>

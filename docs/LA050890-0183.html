			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NIGERIA SLASHES OIL PRODUCTION  </P> <P> Nigeria announced a big cut in its oil output today in line with moves by other  OPEC states to support prices, which have fallen by up to 25% this year.  </P> <P> "The amount that Nigeria was supposed to be making in excess of its quota was  140,000 barrels per day.  </P> <P> This is the amount by which we intend to cut down," said Oil Minister Jubril  Aminu.  </P> <P> The 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided at  an emergency meeting in Geneva last week to cut output by 1.445 million barrels  a day to try to mop up an oil surplus seen as responsible for the sharp fall in  prices.  </P> <P> Nigeria's output was estimated at 1.75 million barrels a day in April against  an allocated quota of 1.611 million.  </P> <P> With total group output 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day above its 22  million barrel-a-day ceiling, set last November, prices for the actively traded  Brent oil crashed below $16 a barrel last month from as high as $20 in January.  </P> <P> OPEC's target price for a basket of its crudes is $18.  </P></p>

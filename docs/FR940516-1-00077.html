			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Testing and Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance is comprised of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial performance testing and continuous compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification, or monitoring. The proposed requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial compliance testing and any periodic or continuous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement to verify ongoing compliance are based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission stream characteristics that would be encountered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either at the outlet of the control device or at the point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of release to the atmosphere for uncontrolled emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streams. Often, an important factor to consider in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating emission stream characteristics is the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device that is preceding the emission stream. Also,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operating parameters of the device can be used as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicator of the level of control of the device and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, the outlet emissions. The selection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate test methods for initial and ongoing compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, is related to both the characteristics of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream and to the type of device used to control it. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of both factors is presented below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Emission Stream Characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic to consider when evaluating measurement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods are whether the streams are from continuous sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or whether they are from batch sources. Streams that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from continuous sources would have minimal variation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics; the test measurement method therefore can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be intermittent in nature. For example, flowrate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration can be sampled on an intermittent basis to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain an average emission value that presumably will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vary significantly. Batch emission streams, however, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to have wide variation in flowrate, composition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and conditions throughout the course of a batch (i.e., with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time). Often, proportional sampling of flowrate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition over the course of a batch to arrive at a total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission number over the entire batch is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, simultaneous measurement of flowrate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition must be made to arrive at an instantaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission rate. Because these methods are difficult, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial compliance test requiring concentration measurement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not recommended for most batch operations. Specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these NESHAP, equations are provided in the regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine HAP emissions from the batch reactor used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WSR production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second important characteristic of the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream to consider during selection of a test method is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition. If organic material other than HAP are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the stream, it may be necessary to speciate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream or at least identify the HAP constituents in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream. This identification limits how continuously the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream can be sampled. The most common technology that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used in identification is gas chromatography, specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in EPA Reference Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas chromatography, coupled with the quantification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material typically done with a flame-ionization device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FID), EPA Reference Method 25A, can be done at sub-minute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals, but not continuously. However, if identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of organic species is not necessary, an FID alone can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used. This technology will provide a continuous reading of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Control Devices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The devices used to abate HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions will affect the outlet stream composition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions and therefore affect the degree of confidence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the initial and continuous compliance methods. Devices that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are commonly used in the basic liquid resins and WSR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry to control process vents and storage tank emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are condensers, gas absorbers (water scrubbers), carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adsorbers, and flares. These devices differ from one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another in the type of streams that they control and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlet conditions of the streams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Condensers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of condensers, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually applied to saturated emission streams and by design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yield saturated streams, it can be assumed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components will be present at levels corresponding to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saturated values (equilibrium) at the outlet conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This measure provides a worst-case estimate of emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the direct measurement of concentration often may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be foregone in lieu of the measurement of stream temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and flow rate and subsequent calculation to yield mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. For wet strength resin batch reactors, this is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required measurement to determine HAP concentration in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both initial and continuous performance tests. Because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission streams controlled by condensers in basic liquid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resin manufacturing will be more likely to have multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources with numerous components that will affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to predict HAP concentrations by measurement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary parameters, the direct measurement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration is required at least in the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance test. Thereafter, concentration measurements to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish continuous compliance may be reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximated with a measurement of outlet gas temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

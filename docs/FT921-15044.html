			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: Business park in Brno A joint venture company has been formed by BOVIS and the City of Brno in Czechoslovakia to develop a Pounds 130m science, business and technology park on the campus of Brno University. Work on the first phase of the project will begin in the summer; the development will be managed by Bovis Abroad and construction management controlled by Bovis International, from its Prague office, using a range of local contractors to complete the building and civil engineering work involved. The 243 acre greenfield site is 4.5 kilometres north of Brno city centre and adjacent to the city's technical university. Over the next five years 135,000 sq metres of commercial accommodation will be built for research and development and office use, together with a 6,000 sq metre retail centre, a 200 bedroom hotel, 200 executive-style homes, an 18 hole golf course with clubhouse and all supporting infrastructure works. The first phase will comprise 20,000 sq metres of commercial starter units for tenants or owner-occupiers, together with a 15,000 sq metre office block, designed to act as a landmark for the campus development. Bovis, Bovis Abroad and Bovis International are all members of the P&amp;O Group.</p>

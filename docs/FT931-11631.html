			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Call for textile training boost TEXTILE and clothing comp-anies should invest more in training managers, says Lancaster University's textile industry research group. Training systems in textiles and clothing are better organised in Germany, Italy and France, it says in a report. Training provision in Britain is closer to the poorly co-ordinated systems in Greece, Portugal and Spain. Dr Roger Penn, one of the authors of the report, criticised the 'lack of effective training'. The report's recommendations include: Greater investment in training management. 'The textile industry needs to accept that training does not end once professional and technical qualifications in textiles have been attained.' Better co-ordination between employers and education and training institutions. The Department of Trade and Industry should take a lead. A modification of pay to reflect individuals' training development. Unions could take a lead by insisting that such issues became integral to collective bargaining. The industry is concentrated in north-west England, the east Midlands, the Scottish borders and Ulster. Training in the Textile and Clothing Industries.

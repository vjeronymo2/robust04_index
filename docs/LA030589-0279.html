			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN CRITICAL CONDITION;  </P> <P> PHYSICIANS SAY INCREASING NUMBER OF PATIENTS AND MOUNTING FINANCIAL LOSSES ARE  BEGINNING TO PLAGUE THE EMERGENCY-CARE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY  </P> <P> The crisis in emergency medical care that has shaken Los Angeles has begun  rippling through the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Temporary closures of emergency rooms and tense waits by paramedics to find  available beds once were unheard of in suburban hospitals.  </P> <P> But in recent months, troubles have hit the region in ways few could have  imagined as recently as two years ago.  </P> <P> Consider these incidents in the San Gabriel Valley that occurred in early  January:  </P> <P> Covina's Inter-Community Medical Center diverted paramedic ambulances carrying  critically ill patients for all but 48 hours during a 12-day period because its  intensive care and coronary care units had no available beds.  </P> <P> Ten of the 16 hospitals in the San Gabriel Valley were simultaneously closed to  critical patients for three hours on Jan. 10 because there were no empty beds.  </P> <P> And for the first time that anyone can remember, Huntington Memorial Hospital  in Pasadena, the largest hospital in the San Gabriel Valley, had to temporarily  close its emergency room to paramedic ambulances on Jan. 9 because it was  overrun with patients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approaching Limit  </P> <P> The flu season has been a major reason for the number of emergency room  closures in the San Gabriel Valley. Even so, conditions have not approached the  snarling disarray that has become the norm at County-USC Medical Center in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> But most doctors agree the San Gabriel Valley's emergency system is approaching  its limit, and the first signs of stress appeared well before winter.  </P> <P> The troubles in the emergency medical care system, which some have described as  a "brownout," have brought a bounty of changes, some routine, others ominous.  </P> <P> When Arcadia's Methodist Hospital of Southern California noticed its emergency  room consistently filling with patients 18 months ago, it ordered all emergency  physicians to install car phones so they could be summoned at any time.  </P> <P> Dr. John A. Mardones, head of the emergency room at Monterey Park Hospital,  said he has just begun noticing a new phenomenon among patients that he calls  "emergency room shopping."  </P> <P> "It's like looking for a good restaurant," he said. "They'll go to one place  and then another to find one with less waiting."  </P> <P> At Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte, the crowding and increased costs of  maintaining an emergency room have led the hospital to threaten to close it to  paramedics at the end of March.  </P> <P> Most emergency physicians at San Gabriel Valley hospitals say patients have not  been seriously affected in the suburbs, and they know of no deaths attributed  to the problems. But those doctors are now casting an eye toward Los Angeles,  which they see as a harbinger of their own future.  </P> <P> "It's like a snowball coming down the hill," said Hallie Hetzel, chief  operating officer of San Gabriel Valley Medical Center. "It's going to hit us  sooner or later."  </P> <P> Tracing the cause of the brownout is like trying to piece together a jigsaw  puzzle that has been strewn on the floor. There are no single sources, but  several interlocking problems.  </P> <P> The growth of the San Gabriel Valley as well as the aging of the population and  the shortage of skilled nurses have all contributed to overloading the system.  </P> <P> Most doctors, however, say the critical link in the chain of events was the  skyrocketing cost of providing care for Medi-Cal, Medicare and uninsured  patients.  </P> <P> Medi-Cal and Medicare reimburse hospitals for their services, but the payments  have failed to keep pace with the rising cost of health care, the doctors say.  Medi-Cal provides health insurance to the poor and Medicare to the elderly and  disabled.  </P> <P> The losses have created a financial drain that has deprived hospitals of the  funds and incentive to expand their emergency rooms, doctors say.  </P> <P> Consider the case of a 5-month-old baby who was brought to the emergency room  at San Gabriel Valley Medical Center with seizures. The child was stabilized,  tested and then transferred to Huntington Memorial. The bill came to $1,187.  The hospital received $157.  </P> <P> "I could find 30 cases in a row just like that," said Dr. W. Richard Bukata,  head of San Gabriel Valley's emergency room. "The hospitals are losing money  left and right."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Insurance Study  </P> <P> Compounding the problems is the growing number of patients who have no  insurance. In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, one in four people under the  age of 65 is uninsured, the highest proportion of any area in the country. Just  a decade a ago, the figure was one in five, according to a recent study by two  UCLA public-health professors.  </P> <P> With nowhere else to go, these patients have turned to emergency rooms where  they cannot be turned away.  </P> <P> The losses for hospitals have been enormous. In 1982, unreimbursed costs for  treating Medi-Cal, Medicare and uninsured patients at the 16 hospitals in the  San Gabriel Valley reached $36.5 million. Last year, the figure topped $73.5  million.  </P> <P> The problems have hit inner-city hospitals the hardest, but they have spread  outward toward private suburban hospitals linked with the large county  hospitals in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> County-USC Medical Center has the prime responsibility for caring for the  county's poor. So private hospitals in the San Gabriel Valley have long  transferred most indigent patients there once they are stable enough to move.  </P> <P> Those transfers, however, have become much harder in the last 12 to 18 months  because of the lack of space, said Dr. J. Paul Holland, director of the  emergency room at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chain Reaction  </P> <P> Last year, almost 60% of the potential transfers from Queen of the Valley, or  150 patients, were rejected by County-USC.  </P> <P> The result frequently is a chain reaction. Critical-care patients brought to  Queen of the Valley are diverted to other hospitals, which then fill up and  must divert patients to yet other hospitals.  </P> <P> "We run at near-capacity almost all the time, and it takes just a small change  to saturate us," Holland said.  </P> <P> The most publicized victim of the crisis has been the county's trauma-care  system, which was set up in 1983 to guarantee victims of serious injuries a  maximum 20-minute ambulance ride to a specialized emergency room staffed 24  hours a day by a team of emergency physicians.  </P> <P> Hospitals competed fiercely for the prestigious designation of being a trauma  center.  </P> <P> But staying in the system was more expensive than many imagined, and eight of  the 23 original trauma centers have dropped out, including three in the San  Gabriel Valley: Queen of the Valley, Methodist Hospital and Pomona Valley  Community Hospital in Pomona.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Delays in Treatment  </P> <P> Today, Huntington Memorial is the only trauma center left in the San Gabriel  Valley.  </P> <P> The number of trauma cases has always been small. For example, out of the 4,786  patients seen at Pomona Valley's emergency room in January, just 42 were trauma  patients  </P> <P> But the loss of three trauma centers in the San Gabriel Valley has meant  occasional delays in treating the seriously injured. Trauma patients are now  taken to the nearest hospital, but sometimes must wait for a surgical team to  be summoned, a process that can take half an hour or more.  </P> <P> For the most part, the San Gabriel Valley hospitals have been able to adjust to  the new load of emergency room patients.  </P> <P> To begin with, the system has several protections to avoid outright disaster.  </P> <P> No hospital, no matter how crowded, can turn away a patient when it is a matter  of life or death. Emergency rooms always accept walk-in patients or those who  have been transported by ambulances that do not have paramedics on board. And  in the worst case, when every emergency room in the area is closed, the county  requires every hospital reopened to prevent a total blackout of emergency care.  </P> <P> But recently, rumors have begun surfacing that some hospitals are not playing  by the rules and are closing to lessen their workload or avoid treating  indigent patients.  </P> <P> Last month, the county warned Greater El Monte Community Hospital and  Inter-Community Medical Center for closing even though beds were still  available.  </P> <P> Inspectors visited both hospitals in late January and found three out of six  emergency room beds empty at Greater El Monte and 10 of 13 empty at  Inter-Community.  </P> <P> But officials at both hospitals say their emergency rooms were reported closed  because of misunderstandings, and the county agrees that neither case was a  deliberate attempt to break the rules.  </P> <P> But some paramedics and doctors believe instances of abuse have probably  occurred because the temptation is strong.  </P> <P> "People are people," said Mardones of Monterey Park Hospital. "There's no doubt  the temptation is there."  </P> <P> Even with a system that functions properly, some doctors worry that the load  has reached the point where it is only a matter of time before a patient is  harmed because they had to be diverted to a more distant hospital.  </P> <P> "I don't care how good you are, you're not God, and you make mistakes," said  Dr. Russell Maatz, head of the emergency room at Methodist Hospital. "You have  to go by the information the paramedics give you and you make the best guess  you can. Now, something unexpected doesn't happen 99% of the time, but it does  happen."  </P> <P> The predictions of a collapse in the system are only part of the picture. Some  hospitals have actually welcomed the increase in emergency room patients.  </P> <P> Although emergency rooms are generally money losers, they also are an entryway  for paying patients who end up staying in other parts of the hospital.  </P> <P> "I'd be thrilled to death to get more patients," said Dr. Keith J. Rosing, head  of the emergency room at St. Luke Medical Center in Pasadena. "Its a problem  I'd love to have."  </P> <P> St. Luke has always played second fiddle to its much larger cross-town cousin,  Huntington Memorial, which receives most of the emergency patients in the city.  </P> <P> In the past eight years, the number of emergency patients at St. Luke has  dwindled from 24,700 to 16,500.  </P> <P> "We're not in a poor area and we a have a nice mix of patients," Rosing said.  "More patients wouldn't hurt us at this point."  </P> <P> </P> <P> High-Priced Care  </P> <P> But even hospitals like St. Luke worry that as Medi-Cal and Medicare  reimbursements fall farther behind hospital costs and the indigent population  increases, they too will feel the pinch.  </P> <P> "Even if we wanted to take care of these patients for nothing, you can't do it  without the facilities," said Maatz of Methodist Hospital. "The nurses, the  equipment, the space, everything about emergency care is high-priced."  </P> <P> Looming on the horizon is the possibility that some hospitals will ultimately  find it too expensive to maintain their emergency rooms and simply close them.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, French Hospital and Linda Vista Hospital downgraded the status  of their emergency rooms last year. They no longer accept patients brought by  paramedic ambulances. In January, Queen of Angels Medical Center closed its  entire facility to merge with Hollywood-Presbyterian Medical Center.  </P> <P> No emergency room in the San Gabriel Valley has moved to ban paramedic traffic,  although Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte is threatening to be the first.  </P> <P> The hospital originally announced that it would close its emergency room to  paramedic ambulances March 1 unless the county approved a request to add 23  beds to the hospital's nursing home. The hospital decided last week to extend  the deadline to the end of the month and has left open the possibility of  extending it yet another 30 days. Santa Teresita officials expect their  proposal to add the beds to be approved. The emergency room lost $400,000 in  1987 and $600,000 last year. By enlarging its nursing home, the hospital  estimates it could make an extra $800,000 a year, which would offset its  emergency room losses.  </P> <P> Closing Santa Teresita's emergency room to paramedics would have a limited  effect on hospitals outside of its immediate area, health officials say.  </P> <P> But many doctors worry that other hospitals may eventually consider downgrading  their emergency rooms because the problems are so widespread and the rationale  to close, at least on an economic level, is so compelling.  </P> <P> The loss of one emergency room could be absorbed by other hospitals, but how  many more would it take to begin affecting care throughout the San Gabriel  Valley?  </P> <P> "If things continue to go the way they are going with no new funding, you're  going to see other emergency rooms close or downscale," said Jeffrey P. Winter,  administrator of Greater El Monte Community Hospital. Then clearly it's just a  matter of time, he said, before the tangled congestion in inner-city hospitals  becomes a reality in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOSPITAL SATURATION IN A SAMPLE WEEK Sunday Jan,1.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulatory requirements of the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Program that limit production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances were promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 10, 1993 (58 FR 65018), and on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69235). These rules set out the requirements of an Allowance Program (the Program). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Allowance Program was originally developed in 1988 (published on August 12, 1988, 58 FR 30568) in response to the 1987 ``Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,'' an international agreement that requires nations that are Parties to the Protocol to reduce and eventually eliminate their production and consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Several minor revisions to the original 1988 rule were issued on the following dates: February 9, 1989 (54 FR 6376), April 3, 1989 (54 FR 13502), July 5, 1989 (54 FR 28062), July 12, 1989 (54 FR 29337), February 13, 1990 (55 FR 5005), June 15, 1990 (55 FR 24490) and June 22, 1990 (55 FR 25812). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1990, the Parties to the Protocol amended the Montreal Protocol during their meeting in London and added other ozone-depleting chemicals and designated phaseout dates for production and consumption of these chemicals. Shortly after the 1990 meeting of the Protocol Parties, the United States Congress passed the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAA). The CAA requires the phaseout of ozone-depleting chemicals on a schedule parallel to, or in some cases more stringent than, that of the Protocol. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Allowance Program promulgated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , first on March 6, 1991 (56 FR 9518), and then as a final rule on July 30, 1992 (57 FR 33754), was designed to ensure that the United States meet its obligations to control and phase out these substances under the Protocol and consistent with Title VI of the CAA. Since that time, the Parties to the Protocol agreed to accelerate the phaseout of all class I substances (except Group VI), to control class II substances and to add methyl bromide and hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs) to the list of class I substances. EPA modified its control requirements in a final rule promulgated December 10, 1993, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , to be consistent with Title VI and the Protocol adjustments and amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The substances that are listed in the Protocol, and controlled in the accelerated phaseout, are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> CLASS I <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Halons; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Carbon Tetrachloride; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Methyl Chloroform; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Methyl Bromide; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> CLASS II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> (These substances are described in greater detail in 58 FR 65018). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA promulgated regulations on December 10, 1993, accelerating the phaseout of halons to January 1, 1994, the phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, and HBFCs to January 1, 1996, and the phaseout of methyl bromide to January 1, 2001. The rule also accelerates the phaseout of class II substances, HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;141b and HCFC&hyph;142b. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the Protocol and the Clean Air Act require the phaseout of production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. In the context of the Program, the use of the term consumption may be misleading. It is not the ``use'' of these substances that is controlled through the regulations but rather the amount of the substance available for U.S. domestic consumption, defined as production plus imports minus exports of bulk virgin chemicals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing the regulatory program, EPA collected information on the amounts of ozone-depleting substances produced, imported, exported, transformed and destroyed domestically. This information was used to establish the U.S. production and consumption ceilings for these chemicals. The data was also used to assign company-specific production and import rights in most cases for companies either importing or producing during the base years of the data collection. These rights are called allowances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Companies expend allowances when they produce or import ozone-depleting substances. With certain restrictions, the allowances can be traded among companies both domestically and internationally (between Party countries). To control production, the Agency allocated baseline production allowances to producers of specific ozone-depleting chemicals. To control consumption, the Agency allocated baseline consumption allowances to producers and importers of specific ozone-depleting chemicals. Allowances for class I substances are currently provided to companies on an annual basis except for the production of halons, which was phased out on January 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

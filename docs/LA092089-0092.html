			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GIANTS MAY MISS DORSEY MORE THAN JOE MORRIS  </P> <P> Deficits do not seem to scare the New York Giants. And mistakes have not  haunted them.  </P> <P> The one frightening aspect of the Giants' 24-14 victory over the Detroit Lions  on Sunday was the broken metatarsal bone suffered by left defensive end Eric  Dorsey. It was an injury that could weaken the defense for the season.  </P> <P> Dorsey is not expected to return after breaking the bone that connects to the  little toe on his right foot.  </P> <P> "I don't think he could even hope to be back for the regular season. Basically,  it's very much like Joe Morris' (injury) and may be even a little more  serious," Giants Coach Bill Parcells said Monday. "He's a bigger man. There's  more pressure (on the foot).  </P> <P> "I don't have any hopes he can come back. I think you have to figure he's gone  for the year. That's the way I feel right now."  </P> <P> Any Giant satisfaction felt from a second consecutive come-from-behind victory  was wiped out by the loss of Dorsey.  </P> <P> When Morris broke the second metatarsal bone in his foot in the final  exhibition game, the loss of the team's all-time leading rusher was a blow to  the offense. But the Giants could turn to Ottis Anderson, the National Football  League's 10th all-time leading runner, and still have capable veterans in  reserve.  </P> <P> Such is not the case on the defensive line.  </P> <P> In the final weeks of preseason, the Giants realized that John Washington was  their only adequate backup and they were actively seeking to trade for a  lineman. Dorsey's injury leaves five linemen: starters Leonard Marshall and  Erik Howard, Washington, Robb White and Mark Duckens.  </P> <P> White is in his second year. His only playing time last season was on special  teams against the New Orleans Saints and he has been slowed by a sprained right  knee since the final exhibition game. Duckens, a first-year free agent, spent  1988 on injured reserve.  </P> <P> "Yeah, right now (it's the worst spot for an injury to happen) because we don't  have a lot of experience, Parcells said. "We had four guys (with experience);  now we have three. We're down to five linemen and (Duckens) has only been here  a week.  </P> <P> "You can certainly see we're not in too good of shape in that spot."  </P> <P> The Giants haven't even committed to putting Dorsey on injured reserve, nor has  a decision on surgery been made.  </P> <P> It was unusual to see someone as massive as Dorsey stopped for the season  simply by chasing after Lions quarterback Bob Gagliano. One wrong turn of  Dorsey's right foot has had far-ranging repercussions for the defense.  </P> <P> Parcells wouldn't go through his options, but Washington will probably slide  over from right end to Dorsey's spot. Defensive line coach Lamar Leachman said  Washington would more than likely have to make the switch to the other side of  the line.  </P> <P> "I think he'll do a good job," Leachman said. "He has got some experience and  he's played every spot across the board. I think he'll be OK."  </P> <P> Washington, a third-round pick in 1986, has steadily improved in four years  with the Giants, but he has started only five games. He started the opening two  games last season for the injured Marshall and played in all 16 games,  finishing with 12 tackles.  </P> <P> "I think there's a good chance I'll move over to the left side next week,"  Washington said. "But I'll have to be ready regardless of the situation. I hate  to see that happen to Eric. He was playing pretty well."  </P> <P> Inserting Washington into Dorsey's spot doesn't completely solve the problem.  </P> <P> Washington, 6-foot-4 and 275 pounds, isn't an adept pass rusher and the second  half of the Lions' game illustrated how important pressure on the quarterback  is to the success of the secondary. Duckens was used mainly as a pass rusher by  the Redskins, but his ability to stop the run is unknown.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BULLDOZING INDIANS' SACRED HISTORY  </P> <P> North American Indians always have held close spiritual ties with their  ancestors. So when charges surface that human remains and religious artifacts  from sacred Indian burial grounds have been unearthed by developers and tossed  in a scrap heap, kin groups and tribal elders go on the warpath.  </P> <P> "We believe the remains of our people are sacred," says Vera Rocha, chairwoman  of the Gabrieleno Indian Tribe, whose ancestors once occupied the hilly lands  near Newport Beach. "Every time one of our burial sites gets destroyed, a piece  of our religion also gets destroyed."  </P> <P> Orange County is fast becoming a treasure trove of fossils and cultural  resources with historical significance. Indian villages and burial grounds are  scattered throughout the county, and as residential and commercial construction  continues many more are likely to be found.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. has spent roughly $6 million over the last three years on  excavations within the 9,432-acre Newport Coast property between Corona del Mar  and Laguna Beach. To date, the project has yielded natural rock shelters,  grinding tools and spearheads, and the remains of a young Indian woman who  lived 4,000 years ago.  </P> <P> These treasures and others have allowed researchers and archeologists to study  the Indians who once inhabited the area -- Gabrielenos and Juanenos. Human  remains, in particular, help reveal a culture's diet, environment, evolution.  </P> <P> But members of these two tribes say that development has not only threatened  the sacred sites along the coast and elsewhere but has sent the spirits and  souls of their ancestors into a sort of earthly void -- all in the name of  progress.  </P> <P> "Our religious beliefs deserve the same respect as anyone else's," Rocha says.  </P> <P> Some of the more than 12,000 American Indians living in Orange County are  starting to assert their right to speak to the final destination of their  ancestors.  </P> <P> Thanks to a strong revival of Indian culture and an increasing awareness of  their political and social identity, Indian leaders have organized protests and  demanded that developers leave the bones of their ancestors undisturbed.  </P> <P> "Our people should not be removed with a scooper and a hopper," argues David  Belardes, chief of the San Juan Capistrano-based Juaneno Indian tribe.  </P> <P> The question of how best to protect the bones and burial sites already found,  and those yet to be found, still remains at the center of a dispute among  Indian groups and developers.  </P> <P> In the past, developers performed only cursory review of Indian burial grounds,  says Michael Macko, former archeological director at the Newport Coast project.  Macko surveyed the unincorporated area where the Irvine Co. now is building  2,600 housing units.  </P> <P> "Up until a few years ago, it was helter-skelter review," Macko says.  </P> <P> These days, archeological and paleontological studies are routine. Under state  law, American Insians' remains that are unearthed by developers either must be  turned over to the most likely descendant or reburied within the project site.  </P> <P> Of 92 archeological sites identified on the Newport Coast property, 67 will be  preserved in open space -- Crystal Cove State Park and Irvine Coast Wilderness  Regional Park.  </P> <P> So far, researchers have found evidence of two Indian groups. The first tribe  arrived about 9,000 years ago but mysteriously vanished. The second tribe  arrived about 1,500 years ago and used bows and arrows.  </P> <P> "I realize they're not going to stop development because of a few arrowheads,"  says Belardes of the Juanenos. "But if we can't stop progress, at least allow  us some dignity in how we bury our ancestors."  </P> <P> The vast majority of sites offer little more than "shell debris and rock  features," says Robert Selway, chief of cultural and historical programs for  the county.  </P> <P> Yet it's not as though developers and Indian leaders are fighting over mere  fragments. Or are they?  </P> <P> Four years ago, for example, the Juanenos asked the Mission Viejo Co. to allow  tribal representatives on site during grading of an area near where the remains  of 11 Indians were found in 1978. The company refused their request since state  law already required it to have on site a certified archeologist.  </P> <P> Developers and Indian groups still have yet to agree on the extent of the find  at Hellman Ranch in Seal Beach. The Mola Development Co. conducted a subsurface  investigation and found one finger digit. "The site was never classified as a  burial, but some people are using this to try and stop development," says Kirk  Evans, project manager for the company.  </P> <P> Mostly charred bones have surfaced at Pelican Hill in the Newport Coast project  -- quite possibly the largest single archeological excavation in California.  </P> <P> Some developers claim that these delays in construction schedules merely drive  up their cost of doing business, thus raising prices of new homes.  </P> <P> A few developers such as the Irvine Co., however, hire on-site Indian monitors  or consultants when artifacts are likely to be found. Monitors ensure that  sensitive burial sites are not disturbed and Indian relics are preserved.  Occasionally, these monitors perform reburials.  </P> <P> The requirements for Indian monitoring vary from county to county, and state  guidelines are vague. Developers have complained about the fees charged by  Indians, while the issue of who qualifies as a likely descendant has started  tribal warfares among American Indians.  </P> <P> "A lot of developers don't use Native Americans as monitors because we've  gotten a bad rap over the years for charging big bucks and then standing around  doing nothing," Belardes says.  </P> <P> Jim Valasques is a coastal Gabrieleno descendant and is employed as an Indian  observer at the Newport Coast project. He also is on the Irvine Co. payroll.  </P> <P> "Whenever human remains are discovered, I am consulted as to how I would like  to dispose of them," he explains. "My job is to see that they are exhumed by  hand with dignity and returned to the earth with dignity."  </P> <P> Most of the remains from the Newport Coast project were placed in a wooden box  about the size of a small suitcase and reburied.  </P> <P> "We're not always sure what's going on with regard to reburials," says Rocha of  the Gabrieleno Indian Tribe, who has long refused to recognize Valasques as a  member of the tribe. "We're typically informed about these burials at the last  minute when everything is either plowed under or bulldozed. Up until a month  ago, we were involved in only one reburial."  </P> <P> A powwow, of sorts, was held earlier this year between one developer, the  Irvine Co., and the Gabrielenos and Juanenos.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. assured the two Indian tribes that they will have a new role in  monitoring future archeological digs.  </P> <P> "All the human remains and funeral-related items found on the Newport Coast  site have been returned to Mother Earth," insists Bernard Maniscalco, project  director for the Irvine Co. "All other artifacts will be donated to the Orange  County Museum of Natural History and Science."  </P> <P> In fact, the company is eager to turn over the artifacts and to put to rest all  Indian remains and descendants' concerns.  </P> <P> "Clearly, this is a racial issue because we're not digging up the bones of any  other ethnic group," says Dr. Dudley Varner, executive director of the Orange  County Museum of Natural History and Science. "But the Irvine Co. has done  everything in its power to mitigate the issue of burial sites and  funeral-related artifacts."  </P> <P> Archeologists typically excavate about 5% of artifacts before the bulldozers  level the land. The Irvine Co. reviewed close to 20% of the Newport Coast area.  </P> <P> "It's all a matter of sampling," says Roger Mason, current archeology director  at Newport Coast. "Do you have a big enough sample? That decision has to be  made on a site-by-site basis." (A final report on the human remains and  religious artifacts found at Newport Coast will be released sometime next  year.)  </P> <P> Human remains probably can be found at every one of the roughly 1,200 recorded  archeological sites in Orange County, says Belardes of the Juanenos and Macko.  The problem is it's like finding a needle in a haystack. Meanwhile, battle  cries from developers and Indian leaders continue to echo in Orange County  canyons.  </P> <P> "I don't profess to have all the answers, but we're talking about our cultural  heritage," adds Belardes. "If we don't do something now, we're not going to  have a heritage."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: NEW TRENDS ARE SEEN IN S.D. DESIGN  </P> <P> Only a few months into a new decade, San Diego architecture is showing signs of  significant breakthroughs.  </P> <P> Not only are local architects addressing social problems by designing  interesting, economical buildings, but they are exploring architectural  languages more suited to this area than ever before.  </P> <P> Four out-of-town architects came to these conclusions after spending two days  here last week to select the winners of this year's design awards from the  local American Institute of Architects chapter.  </P> <P> Perhaps there was no better sign of the times than the sole winner of an honor  award the top level of achievement): architect Rob Quigley's J Street Inn  downtown, a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO) done with plenty of imagination  on a limited budget, but without some of the whimsical frills Quigley added to  earlier projects.  </P> <P> "It was extremely well handled," said juror Leigh Breslau of Skidmore Owings  &amp; Merrill, Chicago. "The layout was good, the entry was well defined, the  ground floor public spaces, such as the reading room, are well identified.  Colorful tile mosaics outside help make it very unstigmatizing for its (low  income) users."  </P> <P> Overall, 16 winners were selected from 132 submissions. Awards were given in  three categories: honor, merit (second level) and citation of recognition  (third level).  </P> <P> Besides Quigley's honor award, he earned citations of recognition for the  not-yet-built Sherman Heights Community Center, the new Escondido Transit  Center, the interior light fixtures at the Linda Vista Library and the Beaumont  Building downtown, which contains the architect's offices and penthouse  residence.  </P> <P> The library award came under a new category called "Divine Detail." Glass  display panels at the Dale Fitzmorris dress shop in La Jolla, designed by M.W.  Steele Group, became a second "Divine Detail," in this case a merit award. Also  new this year was the "Interior Design" category, with a citation of  recognition also going to M.W. Steel's dress shop. Jurors admired a low-key  interior that lets the bold designer dresses sell themselves.  </P> <P> Quigley's award for the Beaumont gave the architect some vindication; the  building has been the subject of much debate, loathed by many, loved by a few  and misunderstood by most. It received an undeserved Onion in last year's  Orchids &amp; Onions program, the public's idea of the best and worst local  buildings.  </P> <P> "It's so different from anything else, it certainly has an eccentric quality,"  said juror Joe Esherick of the San Francisco firm Esherick Homsey Dodge &amp;  Davis. "For people who don't want to view the unexpected, it must be a shock.  But the closer I got, the more impressed I was. If people would imagine going  into the building, enjoying the experience, they'd understand it much better.  The idea that you make a snap judgment whether to like something or not is like  judging people, not letting them speak to us and reveal their inner thoughts  and aspirations."  </P> <P> The winning projects were recognized last Saturday night during a program at  the Aventine in La Jolla, a project designed by Princeton, N.J., architect  Michael Graves. The Aventine borrows pseudo-classical forms and rich materials,  and the setting offered quite a contrast to this year's winners, mostly small  projects done with a restraint the jurors found refreshing.  </P> <P> Clients -- developers, public officials, and others -- deserve some of the  praise for this year's winners, especially for their attentions to low-cost,  socially oriented buildings that in the past have been written off as necessary  evils. There seems to be a growing awareness that, even on projects with modest  budgets, good architecture can be had.  </P> <P> Besides Quigley's SRO, honors given to buildings with a social conscience  included a merit award to Visions Architects for the Lemon Grove Community  Center (for seniors), plus citations of recognition to Casa de las Madres, a  not-yet-built home for unwed mothers in Escondido designed by Rene Davids and  Christine Killory, Quigley's community center, and the not-yet-built Marina  Court downtown apartments by the Austin Hansen Group.  </P> <P> Breslau praised the Davids and Killory project for its floor and site plans,  and called the forms "solid, recognizable, well massed."  </P> <P> Juror Norman Pfeiffer of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer in Los Angeles liked the Marina  Court as a good "background" building, and credited the architects for  proposing various knock-out wall panels to allow apartments within the building  to be configured in a variety of sizes.  </P> <P> The evening's socially responsible aura continued through three public  buildings honored. Though such buildings don't address social problems, they  are built with public money. As such, they do genuine social duty, inspiring a  civic pride in public architecture that hasn't been felt often in San Diego  County in recent years.  </P> <P> Besides Quigley's library and transit center, the other winning public building  was a fire station in Sorrento Valley designed by Visions Architects (merit  award), combining simple box-like forms in an interesting way.  </P> <P> San Diego's new downtown convention center, designed by Canadian architect  Arthur Erickson -- with help from design consultants Loschkey Marquardt &amp;  Nesholm and San Diego architects Deems Lewis McKinley -- received a merit  award. Apparently jurors were able to overlook the poor city planning that  allowed this massive but well-designed edifice to close off the waterfront from  public views and easy access.  </P> <P> "There are just a lot of masterful things there," said Esherick. "The sail  structure on top is especially nice."  </P> <P> The Tsao residence in Singapore, by Pacific Associates Planners Architects, won  an award of merit. Jurors were impressed with the way the architects, led by  Randy Dalrymple, subtly captured the architectural character of its city.  </P> <P> Other citations of recognition went to a not-yet-built visual arts facility by  Neptune Thomas Davis in association with Rebecca Binder, and architect Richard  Yen's own studio.  </P> <P> Last, but not least, jurors gave a special "distinguished building award" to  Bertram Goodhue's California Tower in Balboa Park, the centerpiece of one of  San Diego's most romantic architectural groupings. Completed for the Panama  Pacific Exposition in 1915, the tower was no architectural breakthrough, but in  the context of Balboa Park, it gives a large set of buildings the kind of  visual focal point most new developments so sorely lack.  </P> <P> One of the few negatives the jurors voiced was a certain sense of impermanence  to some of the buildings, partly due to their materials (often stucco) and  less-than-perfect detailing.  </P> <P> During the past three years, the AIA architects who run the awards program,  including awards chairman Russ Stout, have invited jurors with credits on both  large and small projects, hoping more large projects will be honored. This  year, though, they found no worthy large projects, tending to confirm one's  suspicion that, in San Diego, big developers are still more knowledgeable about  making money than making good buildings.  </P></p>

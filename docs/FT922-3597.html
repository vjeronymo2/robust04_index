			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Letter: Graduates should think smaller Sir, The otherwise excellent article by Andrew Adonis ('School's out', June 6) the plight of graduates in the 1990s failed to recognise that there is a huge potential market for graduates in small businesses in the UK. Unfortunately, owner/managers of small businesses are still daunted by the prospects of using a graduate, and many graduates believe that success in job-hunting is measured mainly by the size of the company they join. This is often reinforced by parents giving the strong impression that you only have a 'proper job' if you work for ICI or Marks and Spencer. The experience at Durham is that when we do succeed in getting a graduate into employment in a small company, it nearly always works very well for both the business and the graduate. Many stay with the businesses for several years, and even when they move on they usually opt to stay in the small company sector. As more and more graduates come on to the market we need to re-double our efforts to open up these opportunities via increased use of various programmes such as STEP, the 'Teaching Company Scheme', and the 'Graduate Associate Programme'.

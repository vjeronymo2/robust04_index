			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Transfer device for deposits is upheld A SCHEME to maximise the compensation payable for money lost when BCCI collapsed has been held by a High Court judge to be valid. Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor - the senior Chancery judge - ruled yesterday that people to whom BCCI depositors assigned parts of their deposits qualified for compensation. He emphasised that his ruling was made on the assumption that the assignments were genuine and valid transactions and that there had been no arrangement that an assignee would hold compensation for the benefit of the original depositor. He added that the Deposit Protection Board, which administers the compensation fund, had reserved the right to pursue such matters. The judge said that, under the 1987 Banking Act, compensation was payable to depositors on the insolvency of a recognised bank or licensed institution. The maximum payment was Pounds 15,000: 75 per cent of a deposit of Pounds 20,000. The judge said that when the Bank of England started winding-up proceedings against BCCI in July last year, 'an enterprising firm of accountants' suggested a scheme under which a depositor would assign part of his deposit to family members or friends 'who can be trusted'. About 50 depositors assigned several million pounds to more than 200 assignees. The scheme was stopped by parliament which closed the loophole with the Banking Act 1987 (Meaning of Deposit) Order 1991, which said that from July 30, 1991, a 'deposit' excluded a sum to which a person became entitled after presentation of a winding-up petition. However, Sir Donald said, the BCCI scheme had, as a matter of law, achieved its purpose in that it entitled assignees to compensation on those deposits transferred to them.</p>

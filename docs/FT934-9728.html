			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report GOLD'S price was 'fixed' in London at a three-month high of Dollars 377.90 a troy ounce in the morning. But it eased back to close 50 cents down at Dollars 376.25. The failure to build on Friday's gains prompted light liquidation of long positions built up during the recent rally, dealers said. The shake-out had been expected, given the lack of follow-through buying in the morning, but the move had not dented the market's generally bullish outlook. Support for the metal was expected to hold at Dollars 375. A report that Russian ALUMINIUM exports would be between 1.8m and 2m tonnes this year, up from 1.5m tonnes in 1992, caused little surprise in the market, which is close to eight-year lows. Yesterday the three-month LME price drifted down another Dollars 5.25 a tonne to close at Dollars 1,062. COFFEE prices in London ended slightly lower after disappointment in New York over the relatively small purchase of 10,000 bags in Friday's second Brazilian auction in the retention scheme. The January futures contract closed Dollars 2 lower at Dollars 1,228. It had earlier reached Dollars 1,250. Compiled from Reuters</p>

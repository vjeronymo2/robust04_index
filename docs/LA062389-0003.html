			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BENAZIR BHUTTO  </P> <P> Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's pledge to continue military and  financial aid (in conjunction with the CIA) to the fanatical Islamic rebels  fighting to overthrow the regime of Afghan President Najibullah is in complete  contradiction to her expressions of the need for democracy and a broad-based  settlement, politically, in Afghanistan.  </P> <P> It seems that the United States and its ally, Pakistan, have not learned the  historical and political lesson of not interfering in the internal affairs of  other countries.  </P> <P> In view of the fact that her country is facing one of its worst economic crises  ever, Bhutto would do well not to purchase the 60 new F-16 fighters at the cost  of $1.4 billion from the U.S., and concentrate on raising the standard of  living of her people.  </P> <P> SAMUEL HOFBERG  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

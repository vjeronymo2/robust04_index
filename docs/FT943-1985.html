			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Widening trade deficit pushes Dow down Wall Street US equity investors reacted badly yesterday morning to news of widening US trade deficit, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 67.63 lower at 3,869.09, in worst single-day performance since March. The sell-off was not confined to the blue chips. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 7.49 at 463.36, reflecting the broad base of the retreat. Declining issues on the Big Board swamped advances by more than a four-to-one margin on heavy volume of 325m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 2.98 to 458.15, while the Nasdaq composite was down 9.98 at 766.74. The Commerce Department's trade report carried negative implications in two respects. First, the overall deficit was reported to have increased to Dollars 11bn in July, against expectations of Dollars 9.5bn. Investors feared the yawning gap could complicate forthcoming US-Japanese trade talks, putting more pressure on the dollar and the bond market. Second, the July increase came in spite of a downturn in exports, which suggested the possibility that overseas markets were becoming less fertile ground for US companies. Unfortunately, the bond market chose to ignore this aspect of the trade report, which may have buoyed sentiment among fixed-rate traders looking for any signs of economic weakness. Government securities were down sharply in the morning, but managed to whittle down their losses during the afternoon. The depressed mood in both stocks and bonds probably had less to do with trade than with the growing belief that another move to tighter credit conditions was imminent. Yesterday's data served to draw the underlying pessimism to the surface. It was certainly evident in the performance of the blue chips. The Dow industrials plunged 23 points at the opening. From there, the session only deteriorated. By the close, 28 of the 30 Dow components were showing declines, with two issues unchanged. The erosion touched nearly every sector. Caterpillar, a big cyclical, was off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 55 3/8 , rate-sensitive American Express shed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 29 3/4 and Sears, a leading retailer, slumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 48 7/8 . In semiconductors, Micron Technology lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 in heavy volume of 4m shares. Goldman Sachs removed the issue from its recommended list. In computers, Digital was a rare bright spot, adding Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 28 on expectations of a return to profitability. There was a shred of takeover news to flavour the session. Shares in National Medical Enterprises, a leading hospital group, fell Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 17 7/8 on a report that it was close to acquiring American Medical and Healthtrust to create the second biggest US hospital chain. However, American, up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 23 1/4 , said it was also in talks with other possible partners. Healthtrust climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 30 7/8 on the news. On the Nasdaq, Chiron, the biotechnology concern, plunged Dollars 43 1/16 to Dollars 69 1/4 and Advanced Materials Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 48. Canada Toronto prices tumbled in moderate trading, as Canadian bonds slumped amid mixed economic signals. The TSE 300 composite index fell 59.09 points, or 1.33 per cent, to close at 4.376.87. Declining issues outnumbered advances 467 to 305. Volume was 65.58m shares, up from Monday's 60.77m, and trading value was CDollars 973.1m compared with CDollars 919.7m. Canada's benchmark 30-year bond slumped 0.70 amid continued inflation concerns.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Since the time when health  institutions were usurped by the Serbian regime, the health  situation of the Albanian population in Kosova has been  continuously deteriorating. Regarding the way health protection  functions under the conditions of occupation, let us follow the  report by correspondent Ramadan Mucolli:    [Mucolli] Those few studies that have so far been carried  out regarding the health situation in the republic of Kosova  have given distressing results. In several areas of the  republic, the New Researchers Association has registered a great  number of people sick with tuberculosis, jaundice, scabies, and  other deficiency diseases.    A global reflection of the people's health situation is done  even in some other cases, but very little has been done to cure  the sick, and even less to eliminate the causes of these  diseases. A bit more organized work has been done in schools,  where several actions have been undertaken to cure pupils sick  with scabies and to eliminate lice.    However, the organization of such actions from one case to  another does not mean that an independent health system has been  created in the republic of Kosova. The establishment of  outpatient clinics for the poorest strata of the population  presently serves only as a cover for the health organizations  and associations. Even today, these associations have no draft  program at all for setting up and creating health institutions  to cure serious, chronic, and acute diseases.    With more consistent work, setting up such institutions is  not an unrealizable project. Furnishing them with equipment and  supplying with herbs and necessary items can be done with the  help of international humanitarian associations and  organizations, which are ever more present in Kosova. However,  to set up these institutions, it is necessary to manifest a more  serious approach and commit oneself right away, without  improvisations and baseless justifications.</p>

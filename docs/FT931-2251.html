			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Sport: Wall of death at 230mph - Motor racing SURGICAL expertise is never acquired in the abstract. The Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, for example, is quite the best place in the world for treating bullet wounds to the brain. At the Methodist Hospital, Indianapolis, Dr Terry Trammell's expertise at stitching together injured racing drivers is quite exceptional. Last May, the man on the table was Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet. He had run into the unyielding wall of the Indianapolis motor speedway at around 220 mph. The front of the car disintegrated; so, too, did Piquet's left ankle. 'The bone was just pulverised to the point where it essentially wasn't there,' reported Trammell after eight hours of micro-surgery. IndyCar racing, in which Britain's Nigel Mansell makes his debut tomorrow, is the blood'n'guts version of motor sport. Two things make it especially dangerous; gladiatorial, even. One is that the cars are much quicker than the F1 projectiles, averaging 230 mph at some circuits. The other is that the oval circuits, hemmed by a concrete wall, leave no opportunity for such niceties as 'spinning off.' Tomorrow the season begins with 65 laps, totalling 181 miles, around a street circuit on the Gold Coast, Australia's answer to Las Vegas. Because of Mansell, it will be the sport's admission to the big-time for European fans: British terrestrial commercial television has bought the rights to the season's racing which will also go out on satellite TV. On his first day in the cockpit in Phoenix, Arizona, Mansell came within 0.5 secs of breaking the track record set by Michael Andretti. Actor Paul Newman  -co-owner of the team - leant into the car and shook the Englishman by the hand saying: 'That was a mother of a lap.' Newman's partner, Carl Haas, was equally impressed. 'I knew he was good but not that good,' said Haas. 'For someone to come in cold and immediately go that fast is scary. The guy has fantastic car control, experience and skills. if he can do that on an oval, on a road track he will be totally awesome.' Mansell himself was uncharacteristically humble: 'Nothing about it compares to anything I've ever done before or anything in Formula One. It's a completely different world,' he told a huge media crowd. 'It holds your attention totally. And as far as physical stress is concerned, it's very hard.' To some of its fans IndyCar retains the 'purity' of F1 before it went hi-tech with semi-automatic gearboxes, intelligent suspension and radio-telemetry between engine and the pits. IndyCars produce more raw horsepower through bigger engines. One should not dismiss it as crude. Honda, which stopped supplying F1 engines in 1992, will supply them to the 1994 IndyCar world series. Some detractors say that on the oval circuits Indy is just a barbaric test of nerve. The laws of physics mean that on the extreme edge of the track, where the curves are shallower, cars travel fastest. They are also closest to the concrete wall. Tyres sometimes brush the wall as the cars lap at 230mph or so. Experienced Indy drivers rarely hide how frightened it can make them. Tom Sneva, winner of the 1983 Indianapolis 500, was asked if he had run a little close to the wall on the final turn. 'I don't really know,' he replied. 'Usually you have your eyes closed at that point.' There is the possibility that an IndyCar oval may be built in Britain. At least one circuit owner is deep into a feasibility study. Outline planning permission is already secured. The sport is enjoying a PR boost even the advent of a movie star driver (Newman) could not create. 'Our appointment of Nigel has created a gravy train for all the other teams in IndyCars,' said a spokesman for Newman-Haas. The only doubt is the possibility that Mansell - whether he admits it to himself or not - may just be taking a sabbatical from the F1 big time. He maintains his F1 career is over; leaving at the top with 30 wins and the world title. Others are doubtful. Frank Williams, his former boss at Williams-Renault, predicts that before the year end Mansell will be talking to F1 people about a contract for 1994. The oval tracks may be a struggle but Williams said recently that Mansell would do enough on the street and road circuits to win the title. 'Nigel will demonstrate when he starts driving in the States that Indy is not the same standard as F1. I think he will be in a class of his own and just disappear,' he added. There are precedents. In the 1960s two British drivers, Jim Clark and Graham Hill, came to the heart of US auto-racing and won the Indianapolis 500. Both returned to F1.</p>

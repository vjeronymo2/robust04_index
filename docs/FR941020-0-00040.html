			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) After adoption by the State of the Stage II requirements, section 182(b)(3)(B) of the CAA establishes three deadlines for the installation and application of Stage II controls. The phase-in schedule given in the CAA is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) 6 months after adoption for all facilities commencing construction after November 15, 1990;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) 1 year for all facilities which dispense 100,000 gallons or more of gasoline per month; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) 2 years for all other facilities required to be regulated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) System Certification. An approved system should be tested and certified as meeting a minimum requirement of 95 percent emission reduction efficiency. The USEPA believes that this efficiency rate has been demonstrated to be feasible. As stated in the General Preamble, the States may meet the testing and certification requirement by utilizing one of the following three alternatives:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) A method tested and approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) An equivalent testing program adopted by the State, conducted by the Program Oversight Agency (POA) or by a third party recognized by the POA, and submitted and approved by USEPA for incorporation in the SIP; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A system approved by CARB. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 4.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Facility Verification of the Proper Installation and Function of Stage II Vapor Control Systems. The General Preamble indicates in order for the State Stage II requirement to be enforceable, the State should require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated facility to verify proper installation and function of the Stage II equipment. The Enforcement Guidance specifies use of a Liquid Blockage Test which determines if there is an acceptable low point in the piping, and a Leak Test, which measures the vapor tightness of the Stage II system. The Enforcement Guidance also states that a facility should recertify the functions of the Stage II equipment at least every 5 years, or upon major facility modification (75 percent or more change), whichever comes first. (See 57 FR 13514 (April 16, 1992) and Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 8.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Recordkeeping and Reporting. In the Enforcement Guidance, USEPA identifies various records that the State should require facilities to keep and to make available upon request. The USEPA believes that these documents need to be available in order to make the Stage II requirements enforceable. These documents include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Licenses/permits to install and operate the Stage II systems;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Verification of passing functional tests after inspection of the equipment (this includes the Liquid Blockage Test, Leak Test, and all shutoff/flow prohibiting device testing)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) General station file records containing initial station information such as motor vehicle fuel throughput information;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Equipment maintenance and compliance file logs containing verification that proper maintenance has been conducted in accordance with equipment manufacturers's specifications and requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Training certification files (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 8.0)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Periodic Inspection of Regulated Facility. The State POA should conduct a minimum of one compliance inspection per facility per year with mandatory follow-up at facilities with violations. USEPA believes such inspections are necessary to ensure that affected facilities are complying with the Stage II requirements. This would result in bringing sources that are violating the Stage II requirements into compliance. The compliance inspection should consist of a visual inspection of the required paperwork, and Stage II equipment, and a functional inspection to determine if the facility's Stage II equipment is functioning properly. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 5.2(d).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Enforcement and Compliance Mechanisms. Requirement to ensure regulated facility compliance with program requirements through enforcement mechanisms, and a penalty schedule that establishes appropriate penalties for facilities violating the Stage II requirements. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 5.2(e))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Results of USEPA Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Installation of Stage II Controls and Determination of Regulated Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ohio's SIP submittal requires the installation of Stage II vapor recovery systems on any gasoline dispensing facility that dispenses a monthly average volume of 10,000 gallons or more. The submittal establishes a 50,000 gallon per month cut point for independent small business marketers of gasoline (ISBM). Ohio's definition of ISBM meets the definition outlined in section 324 of the CAA. The submittal also includes a requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected facilities be identified by calculating the average volume of product dispensed per month for the two year period prior to adoption of the rule by the State. The USEPA believes this is acceptable since it is in full compliance with the Federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (2) A Time Schedule for Installation of Stage II Control Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The time schedule in the Ohio submittal mandates installation of the Stage II Control equipment by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) September 30, 1993, for facilities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> started construction after November 15, 1990;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) March 31, 1994 for facilities which started construction before November 1, 1990, and dispense more than 100,000 gallons of motor fuel per month; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) March 31, 1995, for facilities which started construction before November 1, 1990 and dispense less than 100,000 gallons of motor fuel per month. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Ohio's Stage II rules became effective on March 31, 1993. Therefore, USEPA believes this time schedule for implementation is acceptable since it is in compliance with the Federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (3) System Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Ohio rules mandate that all Stage II vapor control systems used be certified by CARB to meet 95 percent emission reduction efficiency, by weight. The USEPA has specified in its guidance documents that it believes that CARB approved Stage II systems meet the CAA requirement with no additional efficiency testing required. USEPA believes the specified system certification in the Ohio submittal is acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Verification of Proper Installation and Function of Stage II Vapor Control Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference  Japan will do what it should do, whether or not there are any  agreements with the United States. He said Japan will notify  the U.S. Government and other countries once it makes specific  decisions and that the Japanese Government will consider  specific measures after consulting with relative ministries and  agencies.    He pointed out that Japan has already hammered out an action  program and it will take measures in line with that.    Describing the summit talks between Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton as "meaningful" in that  they were able to discuss items of common interest, Saito said  it was regrettable that the two countries failed to reach an  accord in the microeconomic field of the trade framework talks.  But he said it was impossible for Japan to accept U.S. demands  in the framework talks since Washington did not change its  stance of urging the introduction of numerical targets to  measure foreign access to Japan's markets.    Japan is opposed to the setting of numerical targets  claiming  it would lead to managed trade.    The two governments were expected to draw up a progress  report on the framework negotiations by Friday when Hosokawa and  Clinton met in Washington. But they remained at loggerheads  over the interpretation of the application of "objective  criteria."</p>

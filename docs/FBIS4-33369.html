			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio has  characterized as biased and unfair the gruesome images shown by  "NTC News" from the video in which Amnesty International  denounces human rights violations in Colombia. The foreign  minister said the situations presented in the video cannot be  considered the result of a premeditated government policy.    [Begin Sanin de Rubio recording] I cannot, under any  circumstance, allow the government to be blamed for this  violence, these murders, and this so-called social cleansing. I  cannot agree with that, nor can I believe that everyone in the  police force is corrupt. [end recording]    The foreign minister said that the government's doors are  open to visits from the international community and that she has  issued specific instructions to Colombia's ambassadors to invite  nongovernment human rights organizations to Colombia.</p>

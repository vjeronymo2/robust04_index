			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIPS FOR WATCHING  </P> <P> Naturalist Suzanne Campbell's Whale Watching Tips:  </P> <P>  * Reservations are recommended for most cruises, so call at least a day ahead.  </P> <P> * Dress warmly, preferably in layers, and wear rubber-soled shoes.  </P> <P> * If you think you'll need it, take motion-sickness medication an hour before.  Check the label to be sure it doesn't cause drowsiness.  </P> <P> * Bring binoculars, sunscreen, sunglasses and snacks, because some boats don't  have galleys.  </P> <P> * Be patient and keep your eyes open. You might also see sharks, sea lions,  dolphins, sea birds and other species of whales.  </P></p>

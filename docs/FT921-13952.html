			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Suez confirms bullish 1991 forecast COMPAGNIE de Suez, the French financial and industrial holding group, yesterday estimated that profits would rise to between FFr3.8bn and FFr4bn for 1991, compared to FFr3.7bn (USDollars 670m) in the previous year. The forecast, in line with the group's earlier estimates, marks a significant recovery from 1990, when Suez's profits fell by 9 per cent. Mr Gerard Worms, the chairman, wrote to shareholders: 'I am convinced that the market will soon realise that Suez's prospects are thoroughly positive.' The increase comes despite a FFr1bn earnings setback from Suez's exposure to non-ferrous metals through its mining investments. However, the group put on a strong performance in its other activities, embracing banking, insurance and a range of industrial investments. These other businesses 'will have been able, in the context of a deteriorating economy, to compensate for the lion's share of this reduction by increasing their contribution to profits by 25 to 30 per cent,' he said. Mr Worms singled out Banque Indosuez, the investment banking arm, as one of the best performers. Suez's discussions were at a decisive stage with Union des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned insurance group, which owns 34 per cent of Groupe Victoire, Suez's main insurance subsidiary, he said. UAP has been pressing for co-operation with Victoire, against resistance from the company's managers. Suez's FFr7.5bn asset sale programme, announced in November 1990, was nearly complete, and the group's asset value was now well over FFr500 per share, said Mr Worms. This compares with yesterday's closing price of FFr305.8, which was up FFr1.90 on the day.</p>

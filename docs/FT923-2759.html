			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Canadian group's investors face losses SEVERAL European banks and many individual investors stand to suffer heavy losses from their exposure to Castor Holdings, the Montreal-based property holding company at the centre of a tangled international group controlled by financier Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg. A bankruptcy trustee, Richter &amp; Associates of Montreal, has identified contingent liabilities of CDollars 743m (Pounds 323m) since Castor was placed in receivership two months ago, but total losses to investors are expected to be considerably higher. Castor's bank lenders include Credit Suisse, which has an unsecured exposure of about CDollars 100m, Paribas and Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank. The biggest creditor is Chrysler Canada's pension fund, with an exposure of more than CDollars 200m. A number of secured creditors have begun proceedings to seize their collateral. Castor was set up in the mid-1970s to invest European funds in North American property. The full extent of its operations is far from clear, and is expected to take several years to untangle. A lawyer involved in the proceedings said Castor made a 'multitude of loans' to various property developers, including Imry Merchant Developers in the UK. It is also known that Castor lent money to York-Hannover Developments, a group controlled by German-Canadian property financier Mr Karsten von Wersebe. York-Hannover is at the centre of allegations in Switzerland that Rothschild Bank of Zurich, the associate of UK merchant bank NM Rothschild, contravened banking rules by advancing more than 20 per cent of its capital in unsecured loans to a single customer. Castor also has connections with other companies in Canada, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Cyprus and Curacao. One of the Cyprus-based subsidiaries, CH International (Overseas), is currently being wound up. Mr Stolzenberg, who lives in London, appeared with his lawyer at a creditors' meeting in Montreal last month. He has also had a brief, informal meeting with the bankruptcy trustee, and has indicated a willingness to be interviewed more thoroughly on Castor's affairs.</p>

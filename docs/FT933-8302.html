			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Exim Bank loans to Boeing THE Export-Import Bank has promised to provide Boeing with Dollars 6.2bn in financing to help the company in its drive to win a huge jet order from Saudi Arabia, an Exim Bank official said, Reuter reports from Washington. The bank said it was its biggest preliminary financing commitment, and could involve a combination of direct loans and loans guarantees. Saudia, Saudi Arabia's national carrier, is seeking to buy up to 80 US airliners worth as much as Dollars 8bn. It has been been courted by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie, the Europe consortium made up of British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of Spain. The Exim Bank commitment would enable Boeing to match the financing terms available to Airbus for its bid, the bank said. Financing terms on such orders are governed by an agreement among industrial nations under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A spokeswoman for the bank described the potential order as a 'multi-aircraft transaction' with deliveries to the year 2000. Exim Bank normally does not provide details on preliminary commitments, but did so in this case with Boeing's approval.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Report on Current Events" program] </F>   [Text] Dear listeners: On 13 January, Wang Zhaoguo, vice  chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] National Committee and director of the  Offices of Taiwan Affairs of the CPC Central Committee and State  Council, stressed that China resolutely opposes any form of  claims of two Chinas, one China and one Taiwan, or two equal  political entities, and that it resolutely opposes any claims  and actions aimed at promoting Taiwan's independence.    Addressing the third meeting of the First Council of the  Chinese mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS], Wang Zhaoguo said: Relations across the Taiwan  Strait made major advances last year. The publication of the  white paper on the Taiwan Issue and China's reunification, which  comprehensively and systematically expounds China's principled  stand and policies on the Taiwan issue, has had both an  immediate and far-reaching impact on the development of  relations across the strait and on China's reunification. After  the attempt by the Taiwan authorities to participate in the  United Nations was thwarted at the 48th UN General Assembly,  some people in Taiwan began to publicly advocate the so-called  two Chinas as a phase. This merits our close attention and  vigilance.    Speaking of the working-level talks between the two sides of  the Taiwan Strait, Wang Zhaoguo said: The characteristics of  the working-level talks between the ARATS and the Strait  Exchange Foundation [SEF] have become somewhat different from  those of the past. This is reflected mainly in the fact that  the SEF tried to use the handling of administrative matters to  create so-called independent sovereignty and complete judicial  jurisdiction, thereby achieving the goal of making the mainland  and Taiwan two equal political entities.    Wang Zhaoguo stressed: In light of this, we must uphold the  principle of one China and, based on the common understanding  that the ARATS-SEF talks are nongovernment, economic,  administrative, and functional in nature, avoid sensitive  political issues to seek common ground while putting aside  differences. We must make active efforts to advance the talks  and to produce positive results on administrative matters.    Wang Zhaoguo spoke highly of the ARATS's fruitful efforts in  promoting cross-strait exchanges and developing relations  between the two sides in the two years since its establishment.    He said: During the last year, thanks to the joint efforts  of all localities and departments and the people throughout the  country, including the Taiwan people, economic and trade  relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have  developed more rapidly. Exchanges in personnel and in other  areas have made new breakthroughs. The number of Taiwan  businesses investing in the mainland has increased sharply.  From January to November of last year, indirect trade between  the two sides reached $12.1 billion. The two sides have forged  closer economic interests. More than 1.5 million people visited  the mainland from Taiwan last year. The number of people from  Taiwan's higher hierarchy and public figures from all walks of  life has increased 50 percent from the same period in 1992.  More people from the mainland also visited Taiwan to carry out  a wide range of exchanges. Facts show that exchanges in  personnel and in other areas have a positive impact on the  development of relations across the strait.    Wang Zhaoguo called for consistent efforts to promote the  establishment of direct postal, trade, and navigational ties  between the two sides and to push for the exchanges between  people on the mainland and Taiwan and exchanges and cooperation  in every field in accordance with the policies of peaceful  reunification and one country and two systems. He called for  vigorous economic cooperation in particular to jointly  revitalize China's national economy.    He said: In line with the development of the situation, the  State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office will coordinate with the  relevant State Council departments to authorize the ARATS to  hold talks with Taiwan's SEF on economic matters, science and  technology exchanges, and cooperation in the development of  energy resources, while continuing their talks on administrative  matters.    He urged the ARATS and SEF to institutionalize meetings  between their responsible persons and to further promote contact  and cooperation with each other in accordance with the relevant  agreements reached during the Wang-Gu talks. He also said that  he hoped to see an early, successful materialization of the  second meeting between Chairman Wang Daohan and Mr. Gu Zhenfu  [Ku Chen- fu] to advance the development of cross-strait  relations.</p>

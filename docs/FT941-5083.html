			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hong Kong SE proposes broad reform The Hong Kong stock exchange, now the sixth biggest in the world, yesterday unveiled its blueprint for the next three years and beyond, with proposals including greater self-regulation among market players and tougher disclosure requirements in line with its bid for increasing internationalisation. The consultative paper, which follows more than 50 meetings with market professionals and the relevant government and private-sector bodies, proposes to switch from a common law-based regulatory system to one which relies more on disclosure enforced by sanctions, conforming with US and international market practice. There are also calls to remove the onus for vetting listing documents and disclosures from the exchange and place it directly on the issuers and their professional advisers. According to its proponents, self-regulation would speed the processes of listing approval and disclosures, now considered too slow. A company listing in Hong Kong typically waits three to four months for the go-ahead; in the US this can be as short as six weeks. The document warns that as the domestic market is approaching saturation in terms of companies seeking listings, the exchange must look to China and beyond both for new issues and investors, and position itself to meet their needs. The exchange was also urged to look at ways of extending market automation - especially in terms of trading, settlement and registration - and to speed up plans for developing the listed debt market. Other issues on the agenda include: Putting a cap on the Compensation Fund, which now stands at more than HKDollars 280bn (USDollars 36bn), and using excess levy receipts for other initiatives to help the market community; Looking at creating Hong Kong depository receipts on regional blue chip companies; More exhaustive disclosure, and the introduction of annual valuations of assets; Abolishing the board lot system and scrapping share certificates - possibly along with the rules for spreads; Reduction or removal of stamp duty; Development of further indices on the Hong Kong market.</p>

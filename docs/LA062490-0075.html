			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR LOST FOR A GOOD REASON  </P> <P> I was surprised to learn that Cameron Cosgrove is a Republican ("Is Pioneering  Spirit History in Irvine?" June 18).  </P> <P> And he's right that it shouldn't matter in a nonpartisan race, but it was Mayor  Larry Agran and City Councilman Cosgrove more than any others who turned Irvine  politics into partisan, nationally oriented politics.  </P> <P> And now he has the gall to complain. It's not surprising that Cosgrove was  ignored in the campaign. Except for Sally Anne Sheridan, the council was a  rubber stamp for Agran. Irvine voters didn't like that.  </P> <P> As for his being a Republican, in contrast to his Democrat-flavored words and  actions, it only reinforces the old saying, "There isn't a dime's worth of  difference!" Of course, I say that from the viewpoint of a Libertarian.  </P> <P> STEPHEN J. MOORE  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

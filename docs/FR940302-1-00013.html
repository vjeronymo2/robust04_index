Changes made by this law which VA proposes to incorporate into the regulations by these amendments are: The addition of a requirement that the holder provide notice to the Secretary when refusing to accept partial payment on a loan in default; and a clarification of when a veteran has liability to the Secretary for a loss due to a loan default. These changes will ensure that no veteran loses a home because a loan holder returned partial payments in violation of VA requirements and will aid VA in obtaining the cooperation of veterans in reducing loan guaranty losses by pursuing alternatives to foreclosure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before May 2, 1994.

All written comments will be available for public inspection in room 170, Veterans Service Unit, at the above address between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday (except holidays) until May 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mr. Leonard A.

Public Law 101&hyph;237 requires the holder to notify the Secretary when refusing to accept partial payment and provides that the Secretary may require certain specific information in the notice. VA proposes to amend &sect;&sect;36.4275(f) and 36.4315(b) to incorporate the requirement that the holder notify the Secretary within 10 days after refusing a partial payment. These sections will also be amended to require that the notice include the date of the tender, the amount tendered, the date the payment was returned, and the reason for the holder's refusal. This information will enable VA to verify that the lender's reason for refusal is in compliance with the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 36.4323(e) provides that the veteran owes a debt to the United States equal to any amount paid by the Secretary on account of the veteran's liability for the loan. Public Law 101&hyph;237 provides that an individual obtaining a guaranteed or insured loan closed after December 31, 1989, shall have no liability to the Secretary for loss resulting from a default on the loan, except: (1) In the case of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith by the individual in obtaining the loan or in connection with the loan default; or (2) where under 38 U.S.C. 3729(b) an individual pays a fee or is exempt from paying a fee to assume a loan; or, (3) where an individual obtains a loan for any purpose specified in 38 U.S.C. 3712, which pertains to manufactured homes. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4323 to reflect this change and to add a definition of bad faith to the loan guaranty regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

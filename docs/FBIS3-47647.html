Former Deputy Prime  Minister Josefata Kamikamica, expelled from the Fijian Political  Party last month, said the rebirth of the Fiji Association was a  political necessity. Mr. Kamikamica accused Mr. Rabuka's  coalition government of ineptitude, deception, and dishonorable  behavior. Mr. Kamikamica was one of seven government dissidents  expelled from the governing Fijian Political Party after helping  to defeat the 1994 budget in parliament last November. Mr.  Rabuka called a snap election for February.    The Fiji Association plans to contest 27 of the 37 seats set  aside for Fijians under the racially-biased 1990 constitution.  If it gained enough support in those seats in the 33 seats open  to Fiji Indians and other racial minorities, it could threaten  Mr. Rabuka's hold on power.</p>

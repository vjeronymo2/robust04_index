"We do not want any future head of state of South Africa to have the kind  of power that (Iraq's) Saddam Hussein has over everything that lives and  breathes in his land," Buthelezi told the inaugural conference of his Inkatha  Freedom Party. Inkatha supporters and pro-ANC Zulus are in a power struggle  that has claimed about 4,000 lives.  </P></p>

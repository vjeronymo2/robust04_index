			<p>BFN     [Text] Government leaders yesterday said they agreed to a  proposal by anti-narcotics officials to introduce money  laundering law provided it did not constitute an infringement on  the freedom of the individual.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he approved of the idea in  principle because a money laundering law would prevent dishonest  people from converting their ill-gotten wealth into legal  currency.    "In principle, the idea of preventing money laundering  should  do no harm to society. But we have to look into details of the  proposed law to see whether the freedom of the individual would  be compromised in the process," Chuan said.    The prime minister said the Office of the Narcotics Control  Board (ONCB) had yet to submit its proposed anti-money  laundering legislation to the Cabinet.    On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said he  approved of the proposed law in view of complaints by anti-drug  officials that, without such a law, drug traffickers would  continue to flourish from their illegal trade.    ONCB officials say many major traders in illicit drugs are  beyond the reach of the law because law enforcement officials  normally do not have hard evidence to link them to the crime.  They say a money laundering law would make it much more  difficult for drug traffickers to convert drug proceeds into  legal assets.    The government's support for the idea came after it was  alleged that at least eight MPs were involved in the trade of  marijuana.    Nakhon Phanom MP Thanong Siriprichaphong has been accused by  the United States' Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) of involvement  in the shipment of 45 tonnes of marijuana to the United States  between 1977-87. His assets in the United States -- a house and  a luxury car -- have been seized under an order by a district  court in California although US law enforcement officials have  yet to formally charge him with any crime.    Chuan, asked to comment on reports about a thesis written by  an ONCB investigator which says eight MPs were involved in the  marijuana trade, said he had seen the document, which lists  certain lawmakers among other suspected drug traffickers.    But the prime minister added that there was "no hard and  fast  evidence. Some of them closely linked to local influential  people or those who are suspected of involvement in drug  trafficking."    He said he was told by ONCB officials that they could not  find enough evidence to initiate legal action against most  people on the list of suspected drug traffickers.    Chuan said he had instructed ONCB officials to take action  without fear against anyone involved in the illegal drug trade  as long as there was sufficient evidence.    Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said he agreed that  Thailand should have a money laundering law which would help  anti- drug officials fight drug dealers more effectively.</p>

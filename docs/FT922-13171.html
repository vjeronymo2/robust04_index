			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Congress meets in attempt to bury Nehru's doctrine INDIA'S Congress party meets today for a historic three-day conference expected to consolidate the political authority of the prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, and to endorse his pro-market economic policies. The plenary session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the party's main policy-making body, is the first to be held since independence in which no member of the Nehru family will be present. About 100,000 delegates and party supporters are gathering at this pilgrimage centre in southern India - a location deliberately chosen by Mr Rao to strengthen the Congress party's Hindu credentials and to woo support from the Hindu radical Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main challenger to the Congress. One of the main divisions in the Congress, and expected to be on the conference agenda, is over its approach to the BJP, which is in power in the large northern Hindi-speaking states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The infrequent plenary sessions of the Congress have in the past been the occasions for signalling important shifts in doctrine. The 1955 session proclaimed the party's commitment to industrialisation through public ownership and the 1985 meeting under Rajiv Gandhi opened the door to economic liberalisation. This session will effectively bury the Congress party's commitment to socialist central planning and the dominance of the public sector. But because of the widespread opposition within the party to abandoning the legacy of Nehru, Mr Rao will present his pro-market policies as an extension of the Nehru heritage. In spite of the party's readiness to give an overall endorsement to the new reforms, a large section of the party remains opposed to retrenchment. The strength of the opposition from both within the party and the unions has led the prime minister to stall a rationalisation of the state-owned banking system and to postpone measures making it easier for companies to reduce their work force. For the prime minister the plenary session is important in both consolidating his own leadership and in establishing a hierarchy beneath him. Mr Sharad Pawar, the minister for defence, and Mr Arjun Singh, the minister of human resources, are expected to emerge from the meeting as the two most likely candidates to succeed Mr Rao. Seen as a stop-gap leader when he took power last June, Mr Rao has succeeded in neutralising challenges from Rajiv Gandhi loyalists and from party bosses in the north. The Gandhi faction has been marginalised by Mrs Sonia Gandhi's reluctance to enter politics and the resurfacing of allegations that the Gandhi family benefited from the Bofors scandal.</p>

In December, the parliament's rightist opposition demanded  to  take a vote of confidence in the minister for allowing to burn  toxic fuel in boiler houses of several Lithuanian towns and  regions. As a result, a number of people suffered from  gas-poisoning, the opposition said.    In a statement released Monday [3 January], Stasiukynas said  state-run and commercial structures have the right to import and  to sell oil and oil products in Lithuania in accordance with the  Aug. 31, 1992 government resolution. The resolution allows all  enterprises within the jurisdiction of the Energy Ministry to  purchase oil products without any special permissions.    Absorbent-1, a toxic fuel used in some areas, was purchased  by the state-run Siluma (Heat) company from the joint  Lithuania-USA company Lamaringas.    According to the established order, oil products can be  imported into Lithuania only if their import is officially  permitted, or if a special permission is issued by the  Environmental Protection Department. The minister said  Lamaringas imported the toxic fuel unlawfully and is fully  responsible for its realization in Lithuania. The minister said  the case has been handed over to the prosecutor's office.</p>

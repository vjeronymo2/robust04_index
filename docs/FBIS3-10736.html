He said the organization is trying to gather 50,000  signatures all over the country to endorse an amnesty bill  within the framework of the popular legislation mechanism  Congress is debating.    Pastro Vives categorically emphasized that the movement is  exclusively of a civic nature and that it has no other political  objectives. He added: "Gen. Salinas has no political ambitions,  as he himself explained on several occasions."    He explained, however, that Salinas can make his own choice  after being released and that the organization has nothing to do  with it.    For his part, Salinas' lawyer, Javier Valle-Riestra, said  during the presentation of the movement on 18 February -- and  also in interviews that he granted to the media a few days later  -- that Salinas might be a good presidential candidate for 1995.</p>

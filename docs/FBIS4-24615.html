			<p>BFN     [Text] Qian Qichen, PRC deputy premier and foreign  minister, has received Dr. Franjo Greguric, chief economic  adviser of [Croatian President] Dr. Franjo Tudjman and managing  director of the Croatian oil company INA, who is leading an INA  delegation on a visit to China, and Andrija Kojanovic, the  Croatian ambassador in Beijing.    Qian Qichen stressed that he recalls with pleasure his visit  to Zagreb last year and his meeting with President Tudjman,  Prime Minister Valentic, and Foreign Minister Granic. At the  same time, he asked Dr. Greguric to convey to President Tudjman  and the Croatian leadership the Chinese leadership's wishes for  the improved well-being of Croatia.    China, Qian Qichen stressed, supports the territorial  integrity of the Republic of Croatia within its internationally  recognized borders and advocates the peaceful resolution of  problems.    Greguric stressed that President Tudjman and the Republic of  Croatia have an enduring desire for peace. He asked for China's  further support in the UN Security Council, especially as  regards the mandate of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], with  whose work the Republic of Croatia is not satisfied.    Dr. Greguric conveyed the request of President Tudjman and  the Croatian Government that China advocate more effective work  by UNPROFOR. He also reported on the current situation in the  Republic of Croatia, on relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina in the  wake of the Washington and Vienna agreements, on the process of  setting up a Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and future confederal  relations between Croatia and a Bosnia-Herzegovina federation,  as well as the stagnation of the negotiations with  representatives of local Serbs in Croatia.</p>

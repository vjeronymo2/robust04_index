			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (11): Green shoots in communism's ruins - Eastern Europe's low-paid labour force attracts western investment EASTERN EUROPE has emerged as a crucial new element in the struggle by European and US car-makers to reduce their costs and increase market share in their global struggle with the Japanese producers. Volkswagen and Fiat, Ford and General Motors have spearheaded the move into Eastern Europe with substantial investment in new assembly plants and component factories in former east Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. Among a plethora of smaller-scale licensing and production pacts Renault and Citroen of France are discussing the upgrading of long-standing licensing assembly operations in Romania. Rover group, the UK car manufacturer, is involved in a joint venture with the Bulgarian defence ministry to assemble cars, as well as Landrovers and pick-up trucks, at former military factories in that country. The Japanese carmakers have so far shown their habitual caution before investing in largely uncharted areas, although they have been actively boosting sales of cars from their UK and other plants into Poland and other new markets. Suzuki has been the first Japanese producer to take the plunge, building an assembly plant to make 60,000 Swift models a year at a new plant at Esztergom in Hungary. The Suzuki plant, built on the site of a former Soviet military base, is building up production from components imported mainly from Japan. But it plans to export most of its output to European Community markets so its viability depends heavily on Suzuki's ability to switch from expensive imported components to at least 60 per cent local content by 1995. The caution of the Japanese has been partially justified by events. The transition to a market economy is proving a complex, bruising process accompanied by a sharp fall in industrial production and a steep decline in real incomes for large sections of the population. At the same time, however, income gaps have widened. Societies formerly marked by a large measure of egalitarianism at a low level of income have seen rising unemployment and the pauperisation of large sections of the industrial working class. It will be a long time before most of these people will be able to afford a car, especially a new car. At the same time, however, the last three years have seen the emergence of a small, but rapidly growing class of wealthy, or relatively wealthy individuals. This is reflected in rapid growth, albeit from a minuscule base, in the sales of luxury cars, especially Mercedes and BMWs. But the rapid growth of the private sector, especially in Poland but on a rising scale throughout the area, has created a strong demand for imported new and second hand cars. Poland alone imported nearly 400,000 western vehicles last year, of which 60,000 were new. Czechoslovakia and Hungary showed a similar pattern as those with hard currency savings - senior employees of newly set up foreign-owned companies and local entrepreneurs - rushed to satisfy their pent up desire for a western car. This demand helped to fuel last year's booming European car market, both directly and by underpinning used-car prices. But it will clearly take much longer than originally expected before the markets of eastern Europe, and especially the markets in Russia and the other former Soviet republics, live up to their long term potential as mass markets. This means that manufacturers are down-grading their expectations of domestic sales from their new plants and placing greater emphasis on the hoped for lower costs of production of vehicles and components destined for European Community markets. This is specially true of Fiat which decided to source Europe-wide sales of the new Cinquecento model from the FSM plant in southern Poland where it plans to spend another Dollars 850m over the next few years. Low wage costs of around 10 per cent of German levels for assembly line workers were a major attraction to new investors. The prospect of lower costs was behind Fiat's plan, for example, to take 90 per cent control of FSM and make the new Cinquecento mini-car in Poland as part of a Dollars 2bn long term investment project. The aim is to build up Cinquecento output to 240,000 a year and introduce a new model at the nearby Biasko Biala plant. But this strategy began to look decidely risky when unofficial unionists staged a seven week sit-in strike to press for wages more in line with ltalian workers at similar plants in Italy. Thanks largely to the Polish government's tougher policy on labour disputes the strike ended in mid-September on terms originally agreed between Fiat and the official unions. This provided for a 30 per cent rise in wage rates but fell far short of the strikers' demands for wages equivalent to 10 per cent of the retail price of the Cinquecento. Nevertheless the strike lost output of 15,000 vehicles, wrecked Fiat's expensive advertising campaign, and allowed Subaru to sneak into Fiat's crucial home market by selling 6,000 of its own mini-cars while Fiat looked on helplessly. Volkswagen, meanwhile, is building a new plant at Mosel in the Saxon region of former east Germany to produce 250,000 Golf cars a year while hoping to repeat in Czechoslovakia its successful re-vamp of Seat in Spain. The German company, whose initial 30 per cent stake in Skoda Automobila, the Skoda-VW joint venture, will rise to 70 per cent by the middle of the decade, is busy raising a Dollars 1.2bn syndicated loan. This will finance the start of a DM8bn investment programme which will raise capacity from the present 200,000 to 460,000 by mid-decade, and progressively introduce new models alongside the existing Skoda cars. VW is also assembling up to 30,000 Audi models a year at Bratislava, the Slovak capital. Volkswagen, General Motors and Fiat have been in the forefront of moves by the major western manufacturers to secure tariff protection for the the products of their new eastern plants. The battle has been particularly strong in Poland where VW plans to assemble vans and GM, whose main investment in Central Europe is its Dollars 300m engine and Astra assembly plants at Szentgotthard in Hungary, has just produced a modified plan to assemble 35,000 Astra cars a year in a Dollars 75m investment at the FSO plant in Warsaw. On top of the 30 per cent tariff on imported cars the 'big three' are also pressing for a 30,000 tariff free import quota to be divided among themselves - to howls of protest from other importers like Peugeot. The automobile industry in Eastern and Central Europe has come a long way in three years, but not quite along the route originally imagined.</p>

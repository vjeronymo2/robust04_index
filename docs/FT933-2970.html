			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Accountancy Column: In support of the profit and loss account - Balance sheets should show the results of the company's transactions The Accounting Standards Board has been in operation for three years and is fully into its stride. But I am worried that it may be striding in the wrong direction. I believe its approach puts undue emphasis on the balance sheet, to the detriment of the profit and loss account, and to the disadvantage of users of accounts. The board has now published all but one of the chapters of its draft statement of principles. This is designed to provide a conceptual framework on which to base future standards. In a political context it might also be seen as a kind of manifesto, setting out the board's vision of accounting to seek the endorsement of the business community. In these terms, it would not attract my vote. Perhaps more worryingly, there has been very little public debate on the whole project, and there is a danger that we will end up with the framework being adopted without many people realising what it entails. The ASB's proposals implicitly make the balance sheet the central plank of the financial statements, with the profit and loss account dependent upon it. Financial statements are to be built around rules for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities, not the allocation of transactions to accounting periods by the matching of items of income and expense. Consistent with this perspective, the ASB appears to favour current valuations in preference to historical costs. Their approach seems to be to try to make the balance sheet more like a statement of wealth, with the movement in net assets being the primary measure of performance. Financial reporting, from this standpoint, is essentially an exercise in valuation. I take a different view of the purpose of company accounts. I do not see them as trying to value the business, or even to value its individual assets, but simply as reporting the results of the transactions the company has entered into. It is for the market-place to value businesses; it is the role of accounts to provide some (and only some) of the information the market needs for that purpose. Companies are generally valued, not by reference to their assets, but on the basis of the stream of cash flows which they are able to generate for their stakeholders. The financial reporting priorities which are relevant to this should focus on the profit and loss account more than the balance sheet. This is in fact how accountants have traditionally approached the task of preparing accounts: by analysing the transactions recorded in the company's books and using the matching and prudence concepts to allocate them to periods, not by conducting an inventory of its assets and liabilities. Because of this different perspective, I see historical costs as possessing a relevance which the ASB does not acknowledge. Historical costs represent the amounts at the time a company's transactions were actually undertaken and which gave rise to its actual cashflows. In contrast, current values are often more in the realm of opportunity costs. I agree that there can also be a place for current value systems of accounting, but I see no need to abandon historical cost accounting as the basis of the principal financial reporting model. In any case, it can always be supplemented by valuation information in the form of additional note disclosure if this is thought to be useful. Perhaps memories are too short. Previous efforts to introduce systems of current value accounting, both in this country and elsewhere, have been unhappy experiences. The inflation accounting saga of the late 1970s and early 1980s was generally regarded as an embarrassing fiasco and did considerable harm to the standard setting process thereafter. Valuations which are not verified by actual transactions are hypothetical and sometimes too far fetched to have much relevance to the business whose accounts are being presented. The business community's faith in the reliability of property valuations has been shaken by the turmoil in market conditions in the last few years, for instance, while the problems of valuing assets such as brands are even greater. Apart from these measurement issues, there are some other respects in which the balance sheet and the profit and loss account approaches to accounting diverge. This is because the ASB's proposed definitions of assets and liabilities will sometimes create a conflict with the matching and prudence concepts which form the basis of existing generally accepted accounting practice in the UK. For example, FRS 3, the new standard on the profit and loss account, does not allow any provision to be made for the expected loss on sale of a business until a binding sale agreement has been concluded. The argument is that there is no liability until that point. But prudence would suggest that the loss should be provided for as soon as it can be foreseen, even if the contract has not yet been signed. In my view, the allocation of transactions to the profit and loss accounts of successive accounting periods should determine what goes in the balance sheet, and not the other way round. Some people may see this as an irrelevant distinction, arguing that the choice of route makes no difference, because you come back to the same answer. But the balance sheet under the matching approach which I prefer will include deferred items which do not meet the ASB's definitions of assets and liabilities, and should be seen more as a statement of residuals than as a statement of wealth. The practical difference between the two approaches emerges in some of the more complex areas of financial reporting, such as accounting for deferred tax, foreign currency hedges or pension costs. For example, under the matching approach which forms the basis of present accounting practice, the cost of any past service pension enhancements is deferred and amortised over the future working lives of the employees who benefit from the enhanced award. In contrast, under the balance sheet approach the increased cost would have to be written off immediately, because it would not meet the ASB's definition of an asset. Does it matter if the balance sheet includes such deferred items? Should it not be confined to 'real' assets, as the ASB proposes? It might matter if it were ever possible for a balance sheet to show the wealth of a company in the first place. But except for investment trusts and similar companies, this is an unattainable goal. At best, accounts can be expected to present only a rather stylised model of a company's financial affairs. We should never forget that financial reporting is not an end in itself, but simply a means of presenting information which allows its readers to gain an understanding of the commercial reality which lies behind it. The most tangible expression of this reality is to be found in the cash flows which the company generates and the transactions which give rise to them. It is these transactions which users of financial information really need to understand, and which should provide the starting point for the preparation of the accounts. Trying to start with the balance sheet is like building a house from the roof downwards. Ron Paterson is a partner in the technical services department of Ernst &amp; Young.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Abducted children suffer significant harm. It is not uncommon for child victims of family abduction to have their names and appearance altered, to experience medical or physical neglect, unstable schooling, homelessness, or frequent moves. They are often told lies about the abduction and the left-behind parent, even that the left-behind parent is dead. Many child victims of family abduction experience substantial psychological consequences and emotional distress. Trauma symptoms may be evident for up to four or five years after recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Non-Family Abduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An estimated 3,200 to 4,600 short-term non-family abductions are known to law enforcement each year. Of these, an estimated 200 to 300 are stereotypical kidnappings where a child is gone overnight, is killed, is transported a distance of 50 miles or more, or where the perpetrator intends to keep the child permanently. Young teenagers and girls are the most common victims. Two-thirds of short-term abductions involve a sexual assault. A majority of the victims are abducted from the street. Over 85 percent involve force, and over 75 percent involve use of a weapon. Most episodes last less than a day. The number of short-term abductions is considered by most researchers and practitioners to be underestimated due to police reporting methods and lack of reporting on the part of victims. Based on FBI data, there were an estimated 43 to 147 stranger abduction homicides of children annually between 1976 and 1987. There are an estimated 114,600 attempted non-family (stranger) abductions each year, usually involving an attempt to lure a child into a car. In a majority of these cases, the police were not contacted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Child Exploitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Children are at risk of being victimized as the result of a wide range of circumstances that fall into essentially three categories; running away, being thrownaway by parents or guardians, or being otherwise lost or missing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are an estimated 446,700 runaways from households each year. In addition, an estimated 12,800 children run from juvenile facilities. Many children who run from households also run from facilities. About one third of these runaways left home or a juvenile facility more than once. Of all runaways, 133,500 are without a secure and familiar place to stay during their episode. More than a third of runaways run away more than once during the year. One in 10 go a distance of more than 100 miles. Of runaways from juvenile facilities, almost one-half leave the state. Runaways are mostly teenagers but almost 10 percent were aged 11 and younger. They tend to come disproportionately from step-parent households. Family conflict seems to be the heart of most runaway episodes. Between 60 and 70 percent report being seriously abused physically. Sexual abuse estimates range from 25 to 80 percent. Runaways, particularly chronic runaways, are at higher risk for physical and sexual victimization, substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancies, violence, and suicide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are an estimated 127,100 thrownaway children who are directly told to leave the household, have been away from home and are not allowed back by a caretaker, whose caretaker makes no effort to recover a child who has run away, or who has been abandoned or deserted. By comparison, there is 1 child who is a thrownaway for every 4 that are runaways. An estimated 59,200 thrownaway children are without a secure and familiar place to stay during the episode. Most thrownaways are older teenagers, but abandoned children tend to be young (half under the age of 4). Thrownaways are concentrated in low income families and families without both natural parents. Compared to runaways, thrownaways experience more violence and conflict within their families and are less likely to return home.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

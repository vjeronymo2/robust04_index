			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program selling hits Dow Wall Street TRADING ended 1992 in quiet fashion, with a handful of economic statistics giving little direction to the market, writes Nikki Tait in New York. For most of Thursday the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted very modest advances, having opened with a three-point gain and, aside from a brief setback midday, holding on to this for most of the session. However, in the last half-hour of trading, an unexpected spate of computer-guided program selling developed and the index ended the session with a loss of 19.99 at 3301.11. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended the day with decline, 3.10 to 435.72, although the American Stock Exchange rose 3.48 to 399.23. The Nasdaq composite increased by 5.10 to 676.95. Dealing volumes, however, remained light on all markets, with the New York Stock Exchange registering some 166.7m shares traded. Advances outweighed declines by approximately two to one. In early trading, the market's main focus was on further data suggesting that the economy is recovering and that confidence is beginning to return. The initial unemployment claims report for the week ended December 19 showed an unexpectedly sharp fall of 28,000 to 332,000 - news which pushed down bond prices but generally heartened the stock market. Later in the day, the National Association of Purchasing Management's index for December - accidently released four days early - also indicated further expansion in the manufacturing economy. There was a virtual dearth of corporate news, and even the mostly actively traded stocks showed only narrow gains or losses. IBM, for example, added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 50 3/8 , while Citicorp, the largest commercial banking group, gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 22 3/8 . On the consumer front, RJR Nabisco, the tobacco and food group, rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 5/8 , Philip Morris eased back by Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 77, and Coca-Cola lost Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 41 7/8 . Amongst industrials, Westinghouse was one of the more actively traded stocks, adding Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 13 3/8 . Some retail shares continued to climb, on thoughts that the holiday season has been encouraging for US stores and that any revival in consumer confidence will boost prospects further. J C Penney, for example, gained Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 77 3/4 , Dayton Hudson added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 75 3/4 In the transportation sector, only one of the three big airline stocks ended the year on a positive note; AMR gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 67 1/2 , but UAL slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 126 1/8 while Delta Air Lines nudged Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 50  7/8 . Canada TORONTO climbed in thin dealings on some year-end position-squaring and short-covering, the TSE-300 index closing 23.6 higher at 3,350.4 in volume of 26.1m shares valued at CDollars 182.7m, compared to 30m shares on Wednesday. The market ended 1992 some 4.6 per cent lower than a year ago. The TSE's media and metals groups led gains.</p>

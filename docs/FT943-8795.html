			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Stockholm Shuddering after its own rate rises, Sweden should field half-year reports from Electrolux tomorrow, and Ericsson on Thursday. UBS reckons that, for the latter, analysts will focus on news of the order book. For Electrolux, Unibors Securities says the group's two main US competitors in the white goods manufacturing sector, Whirlpool and Maytag, have respectively reported earnings up by 50 per cent, and operating profits up by 300 per cent for the first half of 1994. Unibors is looking for a 40 per cent growth in operating profit at Electrolux, and earnings to outpace this over the full year due to greater production efficiency.</p>

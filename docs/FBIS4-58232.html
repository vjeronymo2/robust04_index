			<p>BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, May 1 (AFP) -- A United Arab Emirates  (UAE) coastguard was wounded in a clash when a boat bringing in  illegal immigrants was intercepted in the Gulf, the official  news agency WAM reported on Sunday.    Coastguards had to call in air force reinforcements when  they  came under fire from the boat on Friday off al-Sha'm, in the  northern emirate of Ra's al-Khaymah, the agency quoted the  Interior Ministry as saying.    "A clash took place between the coastguard patrol and the  boat, but after an aircraft intervened the boat and all the  people on board were seized," said acting border- and coastguard  chief Salih al-Shalwah.    He did not say where the boat came from or identify those on  board.    However, police records show most of the illegal immigrants  captured over the past two decades came from Iran, Pakistan and  Afghanistan. They came in search of jobs in the oil-rich Gulf  state.    Al-Shalwah gave no further details of the incident, but said  the wounded soldier was taken to a Dubai hospital and his  condition was satisfactory.    "It is not the first incident of its kind," a Ra's  al-Khaymah  coastguard official told AFP by telephone.    "There have been many cases involving clashes with  infiltrators," he added, but refused to reveal the nationalities  of those involved in Friday's incident.</p>

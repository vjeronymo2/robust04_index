What the article says is  reasonable. It is worthy of reading. The so-called "migrant  upsurge" is often used from the city dwellers's point of view.  From rural dwellers's point of view, it is a shift of surplus  manpower in a form of rural labor export. This is precisely a  major problem that we must solve in carrying out rural reform  and development. After the Spring Festival, a new so-called  "migrant upsurge"; that is, an upsurge of rural labor export for  the new year will soon arrive. In what way can we correctly  understand and deal with this major event? How can we guide it  to meet the requirements of the socialist market economy? How  can we handle this major event well?    If it is said that the rural household contract  responsibility system with remuneration linked to output is the  first assault and that the vigorous development of rural  enterprises the second assault, then the so-called "migrant  upsurge" is precisely the third assault to China's ossified  outmoded system of planned economy in the past. This tide for  reform and opening up and for development and prosperity is  another creation and contribution made by peasants to China's  great reform program. The current tide of civilian workers is  gaining momentum year after year. It involves more and more  people and covers an increasingly wider area. In addition, with  the vigorous development of China's national industrialization,  rural urbanization and agricultural modernization, the so-called  "migrant upsurge" will further expand. Some people say that the  nation-wide "migrant upsurge" involves 50 to 60 million people,  while others say 70 to 80 million people. According to a  sampling survey conducted by the Jiangxi Rural Survey Team in  more than 2,000 rural villages in over 30 counties in the  province, the number of Jiangxi peasants who work either  seasonally or all the year round in other provinces reached  1.588 million in September 1992, marking an increase of 85  percent as compared with that at the end of 1991. This number  rose to 2.13 million during the same period in 1993, accounting  for 15 percent of the total rural labor force in the province  and registering an increase of 34.2 percent over the same period  in 1992.    Naturally that fact that Jiangxi's rapidly increasing export  of labor to other provinces is neither accidental nor man-made.  Its emergence and development are inevitable in the course of  carrying out reform and promoting rural economic development in  China. It is an important sign reflecting peasants' emancipation  of their thought and demonstrating social progress. It has its  social roots and intrinsic requirements. The following natural  and strong "forces" are fostering this trend.    1. Pressure. Jiangxi has 34 million mu of arable land and a  rural labor force of 14.28 million people. If a calculation is  made on the basis of the fact that each peasant handles five mu  of farmland, the province only needs 6.83 million peasants for  its rural areas. It would have a labor surplus of 7.45 million  people. This has created a high pressure on the countryside.  "Where should the people go?" Many good arrangements for the use  of rural labor force have been made such as the comprehensive  utilization of agricultural resources, the development of  "three-high" agriculture, the establishment of village and  township enterprises and the building of small cities and towns.  However, peasants have also noticed that the supply of labor  falls short of demand in special economic zones and the coastal  developed areas. These are the places where the surplus labor  force in Jiangxi's old liberated areas and less developed  districts can be fully utilized.    2. Pulling force. Since the implementation of the household  contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to  output in the rural areas, peasants have consciously and  unconsciously applied the law of value, and begun to "do  whatever is money-making." If one goes out to work outside of  Jiangxi, one can make 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per year. If one stays  at home and carry out farming, he can only make several hundred  yuan a year. Realizing the huge difference and the high  remuneration, how can the poverty-stricken peasants remain  indifferent? The instinct to shake off poverty and become  well-to-to and the kind of natural movement that "water tends to  flow to the lowland and people tend to seek improvements at all  times" makes peasants feel uneasy. They will not resign  themselves to being confined to the pieces of land where they  have worked hard for generations. They demand to leave the  farmland and their hometown, move to somewhere else and look for  other jobs. As a result, peasants have tried one thousand and  one ways, overcome all kinds of difficulties, endured untold  hardships, crossed ten thousand crags and torrents and accepted  jobs that no one else wants to become "ordinary workers."    3. Temptation. First of all, those who left their hometown  send a great deal of money home. Girls who used to live in the  hills have become modern "young ladies." They spend money  freely, and often talk about the "beautiful world outside."  They have repeatedly awakened those who live in the hilly  districts and often dream about becoming rich; and induced them  to make decision to go out and see the world. Those who live in  the hilly districts no longer mechanically sing that "eating  brown rice and burning charcoal, I am as happy as a fairy." They  spread the news to hundreds of people. With the old guiding the  new, their relatives calling other relatives, neighbors  notifying other neighbors and friends helping other friends,  they leave their farms and mountain villages in groups for  Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai or Beijing. The  quiet old liberated area in Jiangxi is now seething with  excitement.    4. Thrust. As a matter of fact, agriculture has been  neglected in many localities. The comparative advantage of grain  crops and cotton is small, thus increasing the thrust to the  peasants to leave their farmland.    5. Force of guidance. The macro-climate in carrying out  reform and the relaxed external environment have created fine  conditions for the export of the labor forces. In the past,  peasants were not allowed to "leave their land and hometown."  Right now, peasants may go south or north to see the outside  world by using their identification cards. In this connection,  the government does not "conduct check-ups in villages and  townships and subject those who seek to leave the countryside to  the approval of the county authorities." It actually provides  peasants who want to leave with information, training, services  and protection. If it is said that the objective conditions  provided by the reform program turns the export of the labor  force into a possibility, then the enthusiastic support,  guidance and services provided by the government have turned  this possibility into a reality.    People's views on the "migrant upsurge" are similar to their  views on the rural household contract responsibility system with  remuneration linked to output and on the vigorous development of  village and township enterprises. At the very beginning, people  do not know much about it. Some people praised it, while others  denounced it. Originally the term "migrant upsurge" was  journalist language. It seems to be a derogatory term which  peasants dislike. Right now, peasants are asking for a correct  term for their activities to go to different districts. Experts  believe that China's reform begins from the countryside.  Peasants have created the household contract responsibility  system with remuneration linked to output and developed the  village and township enterprises. Right after that China's  reform was extended from the rural areas to the cities, and  attracted worldwide attention. Currently, peasants have once  again brought about the flow of rural labor force to other  districts. This is another great pioneering undertaking made by  peasants after they had attained their right to carry out and  manage their production on their own. This is something  inevitable in the course of building the socialist market  economy. Peasants have walked out of the countryside, out of a  closed environment to the outside world, and to the society to  promote development and progress by tens of millions. This is  something most gratifying to the people. Peasants have further  emancipated their minds. They have fiercely assaulted the  dualist social structure which separates the cities from the  townships and the workers from the peasants; and shifted the  large number of rural surplus labor force to the secondary and  tertiary industries. Meantime, they are also creating  conditions for carrying out fairly large-scale operations in  farming, accelerating the building of small cities and  townships, developing village and township enterprises and  realizing agricultural modernization.    Experts point out that people have different views on  economic phenomena such as the "migrant upsurge." This is  something inevitable. However, all new-born things have gigantic  vitality. Following the development of the "migrant upsurge,"  people have finally become more clear about the role of this  tide and the profound historic significance. In the past, some  people called this trend a "blind flow." They even called the  "migrant upsurge" as "blind flow of laborers" and regarded such  blind flow of laborers as great scourge like fierce floods and  savage beasts. They also blamed "blind flow of rural laborers"  for disrupting the transportation and bringing unbearable  pressure to the cities.    When we examine an issue, we should always pay attention to  its course, essential aspects, and the main trend. With regard  to the "migrant upsurge," it should be correctly termed as an  abrupt phenomenon of a large number of rural labors flowing to a  certain district to seek employment without obtaining accurate  information on job availability and going through the proper  procedure and arrangement. Such "migrant upsurge" took place in  Guangzhou, Wuhan and other localities. As for the "blind flow of  rural laborers," they only happened in some areas, and they  should be considered as individual cases. We cannot generalize  the entire situation by citing some individual examples. Nor  should we brand everything as bad. The flow of population was  nothing new since ancient times. Market economy itself is "an  invisible hand." It will not call itself market economy if  there is no risk at all. China's railways are always quite  overloaded. The traveling of a large number peasants by railway  during the Spring Festival naturally gives the railway  department additional pressure. The excessive number of  travellers often cause disasters in some localities. However,  under no circumstances should we totally negate the "migrant  upsurge," and shift all responsibilities to our peasant brothers  and sisters. Nor should we attribute all the problems in public  security in the cities to the "migrant upsurge."    The existing problem right now is not mainly on the export  of labor itself but on the fact that the relative conditions for  social management still fails to keep pace with the vigorously  developing situation. We will be able to offset the negative  effect of the "migrant upsurge," so long as we carry out our  work conscientiously, deepen the reform and achieve our goal in  "orderly exporting the labor force, controlling the import of  labor, providing good services to the flowing labor force,  working out measures to make readjustments and handle emergency  cases."    At the very beginning, the Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee  and the provincial government have paid great attention to the  export of labor. They have carried out their work in this  connection actively and on their own initiative. As early as in  1987, Governor Wu Guanzheng had already said that on the basis  of the rapid economic development in the coastal areas, Jiangxi  must implement the policy of "supporting the export of labor,  working out follow-ups and replacing those who have left." He  called for efforts to keep the doors of Jiangxi's mountain  villages wide open and vigorously organize those who wish to  leave to go to the coastal areas. The offices under the  administration of the provincial government set up in Guangzhou,  Shenzhen, Amoy, Shanghai and Beijing regard the export of labor  from Jiangxi as a major item in their work. The party and  government departments in various localities in the province  have consciously regarded the export of labor as another task in  support of rural economy after the vigorous development of  village and township enterprises. Work stations to help labor  export have been set up in various prefectures, cities, counties  and townships in Ganzhou, Jian, Shangrao, and Fuzhou where there  is a larger number of surplus labor. There are departments and  people specially assigned to provide guidance and to serve,  help, protect and help those who seek to leave the province.  Some localities have also made follow-ups to truly help millions  of peasants who wish to leave the province to work in other  provinces and to solve their problems.    As for the labor markets operated by nongovernment  organizations, various localities have adhered to the principle  of not trying to interfere with them, drive them out of business  or making things difficult for them. They allow, encourage, and  help them adopt all types of forms and measures to export labor.  In order to alleviate the pressure on the railway transportation  imposed by such "migration upsurge," Jiangxi has made full use  of its geographical superiority to facilitate the flow of labor  out of the province. Many localities have sent out buses to  Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shanghai for use by workers from  Jiangxi, winning wide acclaim from the large number of civilian  workers and the railroad department. During this year's Spring  Festival, the Jiangxi provincial government made special  arrangements and called on various prefectures (cities) and  counties to take initiative to make things easy for workers out  of Jiangxi to return their hometown in the province to spend  their Spring Festival. It urged them to dispatch persons or send  out buses to places where most of workers from Jiangxi are  working to help them come back and return. A provincial-level  leading comrade said that we will be able to help our rural  labor flow smoothly to various districts in good order; promote  what is beneficial and abolish what is harmful; and steadily and  healthily develop this trend, so long as we have the government  guidance and market demands, keep traffic open between cities  and the countryside, adopt various measures to help the flow of  rural labor, provide good socialized services and improve the  legal system in this connection.</p>

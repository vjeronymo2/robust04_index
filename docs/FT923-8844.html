			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Model view of war - Lee Miller saw herself as recorder rather than artist LEE MILLER is not the first photojournalist whose life was more interesting than her photojournalism. But then, given the Manonesque range of her lifestyles and liaisons, this leaves her work a certain amount of scope. These words and pictures - and a London exhibition of the pictures - record Miller's brief but wholehearted calling as a war correspondent between 1944 and 1945. For a woman who had been a Vogue model and an intimate of some of the best-known figures in 1920s Paris, this was just another chapter in a life at the centre of events. But the events in question were the hottest photo-thing since solarisation - the Normandy invasion. By 1944, when Miller managed to wangle accreditation to the US forces, she was no novice behind the camera. American-born, she had run her own studio in New York from 1932 to 1934, when she threw it all up to marry a well-born Egyptian tycoon and moved to Cairo. This did not last. The outbreak of German hostilities found her back in Paris and married to Roland Penrose. On the day Hitler invaded Poland she and Penrose left France for London. There she covered the Blitz for Vogue, but as preparations for the Normandy landings got under way, she became determined to be part of the story. The only woman combat photographer to trail the Allied armies across Europe, Miller's first assignment was in a US evacuation hospital behind Omaha Beach. From there she moved into the thick of the battle for St Malo (the town from which, ironically, she had fled France in 1939), covered the liberation of Paris, and went on to the Haute Savoie front line. She clicked and jotted her way across Germany, photographing the US-Soviet link-up on the Elbe and the grisly liberation of Buchenwald and Dachau, and finally busked her way into Hitler's private apartment in Munich. One of the more entertaining pictures is of Miller soaping herself in Hitler's bath. Miller sensibly saw herself as recorder rather than artist. 'I'm busy making documents and not art,' she snapped at a nervous German guide who suggested that Munich' s destroyed Hofbrau Haus would not make an 'interesting' picture. Her pictures and her despatches are descriptive, not probing. The Allies are the good guys, the 'Krauts' are the bad, and her lack of sympathy for German civilian refugees and prisoners-of-war predates her appalled entry to the concentration camps. Part of the pictures' appeal lies in their novelty, as unfamiliar images of much-photographed events. Many have not been published before and those that have were last seen in wartime Vogue. Indeed, the book had its genesis in a call from Conde Nast to editor Antony Penrose, Miller's son. They had these boxes of photographs. If he did not want them, they would be binned. Miller, the human being, was not unobtrusive. Nor was Miller the photographer. Her subjects are always aware of the camera - one of the burdens of being a gorgeous war photographer, but you sense she liked it that way. The best pictures - as pictures - are her portraits, where photographer and photographed have had time to get each other's measure. These range from a gently composed Parisian law student in a bullet-riddled bistro, to the disarmingly direct mug shot of a brutally beaten Buchenwald guard. Some of the most historically useful pictures are not military at all, but of her old and newly liberated Paris chums and connections, Picasso, Cocteau, Maurice Chevalier, Paul Eluard. The most disturbing are of those who did not enjoy the luxury of acquaintance - the dead. There is the arrested menace of an SS corpse beneath the surface of a canal, the still pathos of a hopeless suicide, daughter of the German burgomeister of Leipzig. The pictures, though not the words, are on display at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) until September 6. And here the circle closes. The ICA was founded by none other than Roland Penrose. Lee Miller's War edited by Antony Penrose (Conde Nast Books Pounds 35, 280 pages).</p>

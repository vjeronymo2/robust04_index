			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOZENS OF PROTESTERS REPORTED SLAIN IN KASHMIR;  </P> <P> INDIA: TROOPS OPEN FIRE IN CLASHES AFTER NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE RALLY FOR  INDEPENDENCE.  </P> <P> The Indian army shot and killed dozens of demonstrators in the embattled  Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday after nearly 1 million  protesters gathered in the state capital for the largest-ever rally for  Kashmiri independence.  </P> <P> State-run television and radio announced from the strategic border state that  at least 29 people were killed and scores injured after demonstrators stoned an  army convoy, attacked buses and tried to grab weapons from the soldiers.  </P> <P> Partisan sources in Srinagar, the state capital, described the day's carnage as  a "massacre." They said women and children were taken off buses and shot in the  head by soldiers. They put the death toll at 70 and charged that none of the  secessionist protesters were armed.  </P> <P> The Indian government expelled all foreign journalists from Srinagar last month  after the Indian army was deployed to suppress a growing independence movement  in the state, which borders Pakistan, India's traditional foe.  </P> <P> All requests by journalists to visit Kashmir have been denied in New Delhi, and  the only news from the state has been from official government media or  long-distance telephone conversations with Srinagar residents, most of whom  appear to support the secessionist drive.  </P> <P> One such source said by telephone this morning that the army "massacred" 16  civilians, among them women and children, in a bus near the Srinagar airport  and that an additional 48 demonstrators near the city's Zakura district were  gunned down in cold blood.  </P> <P> Several other sources reported that the day's death toll exceeded 60, although  official radio and television asserted that the army had killed the 29 and  injured 45 others in firing aimed at thwarting "a well-knit plan" by Kashmir's  underground secessionists.  </P> <P> Quoting from "intelligence sources," the state-run media said the  pro-secessionist Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front was trying to kidnap  schoolchildren from the buses when the army opened fire near the airport,  killing eight.  </P> <P> The official account added that the army killed an additional 14 in Zakura  after protesters stoned an Indian army convoy and "tried to snatch arms" from  soldiers attempting to break up the demonstration.  </P> <P> The majority of Kashmiris are Muslim, and they have enjoyed considerable  autonomy from Hindu-dominated India since deciding to join the Indian nation in  1947, when the subcontinent was divided along religious lines to create an  independent India and the Islamic state of Pakistan.  </P> <P> India has accused Pakistan of supporting the Kashmiri secessionists, who have  gained far-reaching support since New Delhi reacted to months of growing street  demonstrations by sending in thousands of Indian soldiers and barring outside  journalists.  </P> <P> Sources in Srinagar said that Thursday's huge demonstration included engineers,  doctors, lawyers, educators and laborers, reflecting an expanding grass-roots  support for the movement.  </P> <P> Indian authorities, though, have labeled all of the secessionists "terrorists."  </P> <P> Jammu and Kashmir, which has long ranked among India's most lucrative  international tourist destinations, is also one of its most strategic states.  Two of the three wars India has fought with neighboring Pakistan stemmed from  their dispute over the region, and the third involved fighting there. The  United Nations is still charged with policing the cease-fire line through it.  </P></p>

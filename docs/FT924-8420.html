			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Anglo-German priorities CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl is doing his best to scotch fears, entertained in 1989-90 in some British government quarters, that he could become a hectoring leader of a dominant united Germany. For the moment, the Federal Republic's main problem - manifested by Mr Kohl's indecisiveness on financing German unity, on international deployment of the Bundeswehr, or on handling refugee inflows - is not strength, but weakness. Perceptions of Mr John Major have changed, too. The European strategy of the man who has proclaimed Britain's place 'at the very heart of Europe' has become ensnared in a tangle of domestic politics. These leaders of one very important and one less important European country meet in Oxfordshire today at a time when both governments appear bereft of direction. In the comely surroundings of Ditchley Park, there is a risk that hesitation will shake hands with irresolution, and vacillation will sit down with equivocation. To avoid this outcome, Mr Kohl and Mr Major must rediscover common purpose, and ignite the flame of joint action, for the good of their countries and their continent. Much is at stake. The first small waves of a potential transatlantic trade war are washing towards European shores. Mr Kohl's instinctive desire to forge ahead with European integration may be undimmed. But the realities - in the economic, social and psychological sphere - of Germany's great challenge over unification are making his country look inwards. Germany's persistence in following fiscal policies which indirectly export unemployment to other EC countries could hardly be less communautaire. If, partly because of the effects of these policies, Germany enters recession before Britain has departed from its own, the pressures of parochialism will increase in both countries. The economic downturn across the whole of Europe provides one powerful reason why the Maastricht ratification process is in disarray. A much worse result is that the rich EC is not living up to its duty to help stabilise the poor and fragmented countries of the former communist bloc. In the bilateral field, Mr Major has mended some Anglo-German fences broken by his predecessor. But the failures of communication and understanding between the British and German monetary authorities during the events preceding sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism underscored the limits of their co-operation. In three areas, Britain and Germany can use today's meeting to make headway. Mr Major should persuade Mr Kohl to bring maximum pressure to bear on President Francois Mitterrand to find a solution to the oilseeds quarrel which is threatening the Uruguay Round. The two countries' defence ministers should strain every sinew to find a sensible compromise over the future of the European Fighter Aircraft, based on the plan for large cost savings outlined by the aerospace industry. On policies towards Europe, Mr Kohl must make clear to Mr Major that one of Britain's main aims - enlarging the Community northwards and eastwards - could be endangered by UK prevarication over ratifying Maastricht. The British government probably realises that Anglo-German relations will never grow into a source of European strength unless London can simultaneously improve the quality of its links with Paris. Nonetheless, Bonn and London have a compelling interest in working out priorities for moving Europe forward. These will always involve difficult choices. But if bilateral summit meetings become no more than a forum for airing platitudes, governments should save themselves the expense of organising them.</p>

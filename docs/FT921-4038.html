			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Smith sees his wardrobe stolen - Labour FOR MORE than a few moments there was a distinct impression of dither from the Labour Party. It had always expected the Budget to be a clothes' stealing exercise, but few calculated that Mr Norman Lamont had his eye on most of the wardrobe. What is more, Mr Neil Kinnock's response to the speech appeared to be the script prepared for the widely-expected 1p cut in the 25p basic income tax rate. His repeated attacks on 'borrowing for tax cuts' appeared to pre-empt any inclination Mr John Smith, his shadow chancellor may have had to swallow hard and accept the proposed new 20p tax band. Some suspected that Mr Smith's furrowed brow suggested he would have preferred a little more time to consider. Yet within the hour it was clear Labour would reject the reduced rate tax band. Once the 'line' was established, it was distributed freely and vigorously around the lobbies and corridors. 'It is an incredibly defensive budget - designed to stuff Labour and not to sell themselves to the electorate. A big error,' was one party official's verdict. Another underlined that the Tories had priced votes at 'a miserable Pounds 2 a week.' Yet privately some Labour MPs conceded that the package had 'muddied the waters.' One frontbencher described it as 'an incompetent bribe.' But it was a bribe nonetheless. From his very first sentences, Mr Lamont made clear that he would be borrowing liberally from Labour's programme. The merger of the annual autumn statement on public expenditure with the Budget was just the beginning. The concept of the 'budget for recovery', the increases on pensions (though only for those on income support) and the scrapping of the Business Expansion Scheme had distinct echoes of Mr Smith's carefully worded pre-budget utterances. As Labour's economic backroom boys work over the figures for their alternative budget - due next Tuesday - the short-term task was to expose the Tory 'bribe', disparage it and prepare a glittering shop window of public spending pledges in a package wrapped in the language of prudence. In headline terms, however, the options are limited. Labour's figures say its revenue raising measures - higher top tax rates and an end to the ceiling on National Insurance contributions - will bring it Pounds 3.85bn. These broadly cover its plans to raise Child Benefit and lift pensions by Pounds 5 for a single person and Pounds 8 for a couple and to fund the bulk of a Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme including measures for training, employment creation and tax breaks for industrial investment. But some optimistic hopes of a very large windfall for public expenditure have had to be tempered. The new tax band is costed at Pounds 1.8bn in the 1992-3 tax year. Labour must now maximise the use of that limited money to better its electoral hopes by carefully targetted new spending. Mr Smith's team have always been careful not to rule out the possibility that some of this sum may be needed to adjust its tax raising plans. As the midnight oil burns in the shadow chancellor's office, his team will not forget the opinion poll conundrum that shows voters' opting for public spending above tax cuts - but then adding that, on reflection, they would rather like the money.</p>

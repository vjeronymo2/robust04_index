Patriotism, therefore, is measured by  expenditure on the military budget. That is why recently in the  Yugoslav assembly, not only the Socialists but also experts and  politicians from the Democratic Party stated decisively: We  shall vote for this proposal for the federal budget only because  it is a military one. Fair enough! Things are what they are.  Of the planned 1,674 million dinars, 1,264 million dinars, or  75.5 percent, of the budget has been allocated to military  requirements. That is the way to go: Our army -- is that not  so? -- has always been the surest guarantee for the maintenance  of our homeland and its (unknown) borders.    However, a few days ago the owner of a private business  spoke  out, saying that he was no less patriotic than those who  proposed the federal budget, but since he was personally  contributing a sizable amount to the military budget, he would  like to know "what the people will be getting out of the 100,000  soldiers and 100,000 policemen?" After all, the citizens must  get something in return, perhaps beatings and more beatings....  Because, God forbid that the authorities could be thinking that  it is in the interest of the taxpayers to fill the coffers of  the army and the police to the maximum, while at the same time  making only minor contributions to the coffers allocated to  diplomatic activity, to which the government allocated precisely  39 million dinars. Really. Will it be the generals or the  diplomats who will pull us out of the crisis? Taxpayers,  particularly owners of private businesses, have begun to ask  this out loud. Perhaps in vain. Because this is not the United  States, where people pay taxes, but under the motto: "No  taxation without representation!"</p>

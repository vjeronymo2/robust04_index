			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: DOIN' THE HOT LAMBADA  </P> <P> The place is jumping like a Joe Carioca cartoon.  </P> <P> Miranda Garrison is in the middle of the room, black dress slit to her waist  and decolletage down to her legal limit, both arms flung out and pelvis thrust  forward, dancing with a kid who is sweating from more than just physical  exertion.  </P> <P> She is moving to a pulsating Latin rhythm in a way that contributes to the  Greenhouse Effect and shouting "feel the beat, feel the beat," as maybe 80  others dance or practice in front of a wall of mirrors, their behinds swaying  like palm trees in a Santa Ana.  </P> <P> They're doing the lambada.  </P> <P> Well, that is to say, they are attempting to do the lambada, because that's  what everyone who is anyone is doing (right?), and we've all got to be up there  swaying and thrusting with the rest of them.  </P> <P> Not since the Romans discovered the social nature of an orgy have so many been  doing the same thing at the same time in the same room.  </P> <P> Naturally, they were doing it in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Miranda, a choreographer, and Loreen Arbus, a television producer with an  unexplainable interest in Latin dances, are offering lessons in the lambada at  the Landmark Studio.  </P> <P> I dropped by because public eroticism appeals to my sense of recollected evil,  tapping a memory of youth when something called the dirty boogie was an  underground hit.  </P> <P> I never did actually dance it because my mother said that if I did I'd go to  hell, but I had a great time watching and shouting, "Hey, man, that's what I  crave," which were the words of the song that set us high school studs into a  primitive frenzy.  </P> <P> The mere memory makes my palms itch.  </P> <P> Not withstanding that faint stirring, I became interested in the lambada  because, as I said, that's what you all seem to be doing and I don't want you  doing anything of which I don't approve. Think of me as a kind of hovering,  celestial presence.  </P> <P> To prepare for my afternoon of live lambada, I first saw the movie "Lambada,  Set the Night on Fire." Trust me when I say it doesn't.  </P> <P> It is, briefly, the story of a pretty male high school teacher who says things  like "Hey, chill out, man," and gets involved with some pretty barrio kids who  want to, like, make it in the pretty Anglo world by learning trigonometry.  </P> <P> You see it all the time in the barrio, kids tripping out on trig.  </P> <P> Additional dialogue, for those who favor the art form, includes "You're not the  brightest candle on the cake" and "Let 'em duke it out with their brains."  Shakespeare couldn't have said it better.  </P> <P> Interwoven through all this for no apparent reason is the dancing of the  Brazilian-born lambada, during which enough pelvises are rubbed together and  legs entwined to cause smoke, if not fire.  </P> <P> I hear you say wow, that sounds, you know, erotic, but don't be fooled. Sex and  vacuity are more feral than sensual, and unless you're turned on by the mating  call of a bowhead whale, this movie isn't for you.  </P> <P> In the theater at the time were 14 teen-agers, two old ladies, a male pervert  and me. The film was so unappealing that even the pervert left before it was  over. I stayed because, well, it's my job.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back in Hollywood, I am watching Miranda Garrison on the dance floor  having more fun than an otter on a mud bank, while the kid she's dancing with  is trying to look cool and not scratch his palms.  </P> <P> I realize the juxtaposition of an otter with a dancer is an uncomfortable union  of metaphors, but it seems oddly apropos in this case. Use your imagination.  </P> <P> The lambada isn't all sexual, but those aspects of it that are can tingle loins  from Miami Beach to Malibu. At one point my wife, who always accompanies me on  columns of an erotic nature, looks at me and says, "Close your mouth, you're  drooling."  </P> <P> I swear to you I never drool, no matter what. She is using that to illustrate  the degree of attention I bring to a project I am researching for future  composition.  </P> <P> Neither she nor Miranda see the dance as particularly sexual, though my wife  will grant the old Tom Lehrer observation, "When properly viewed, everything's  lewd."  </P> <P> "It's the media that makes it sexual," Miranda says as she cools off outside  the dance studio. "You'd see more than this at a bar mitzvah. What we interpret  as nasty is natural in Brazil, even religious."  </P> <P> Miranda advises me to join in. What she says is, "spread your feet, bend your  knees and hang out."  </P> <P> I am tempted, but my wife reminds me that I have a bad back and no sense of  rhythm, so I decline.  </P> <P> "It's just as well," she says as we leave, "you don't want to end up in hell."  </P> <P> Maybe yes, maybe no.  </P></p>

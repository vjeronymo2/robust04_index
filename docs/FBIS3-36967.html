A source at the  Russian Foreign Ministry has reported the signing of a  trilateral pact on military cooperation between Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. This plan to form a strong military  coalition in Central Asia came as a surprise to Russia.  According to available information, even Boris Gromov, Deputy  Defense Minister of Russia, who visited Bishkek recently, was  not informed about the treaty signing.    During the talks, Subanov expressed his preparedness to sign  a bilateral treaty with Russia. The parties agreed to begin  immediate preparations of the documents. These documents will  be signed during Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's  visit to Kyrgyzstan in late February.</p>

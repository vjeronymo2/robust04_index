It is hoped that this small  service will be useful.    Legal Council of ABRAR    Article 1    Article 1. Various types of checks are:    1) A normal check is a check issued by an individual on a  personal bank account, and the holder has no guarantee other  than the credit of the person who has issued it.    2) A verified check is a check issued by an individual on a  personal current account in the bank, and the bank verifies the  payment of the funds.    3) A certified check is a check that the bank issues upon  the  request of a customer, and its payment is guaranteed by the bank.    4) A traveler's check is a check that is issued by a bank  and  is payable by the branches of that bank or an agency of that  bank.    Article 2. Checks issued on banks that have been or will be  established in Iran in accordance with Iranian laws and also  their branches abroad are considered obligatory documents, and  if the holder of the check goes to the bank and does not receive  the total or a part of the funds due to lack of funds or for any  other reason that causes the check to be returned and not paid,  he can collect the total amount or the remainder from the issuer  in accordance with the laws and regulations concerning the  implementation of official documents.    For the issuance of an indictment, the holder of the check  must submit the original check and certificate cited in Article  3 or certificate cited in Article 4 to the local Document  Records Executive Office.    The Documents Records Executive Office shall issue an order  for implementation if the signature on the check and that of the  issuer are verified to be the same by the bank.    The holder of the check includes the person to whom the  check  has been issued, the person in whose name the check has been  endorsed, and the person holding the check (in regards to the  checks issued to cash) or their legal representative.    Article 3. The issuer of the check must on the day of issue  have the equivalent funds in the bank (in cash or usable credit)  and must not remove all or any portion of the funds for which he  has issued a check in some way from the bank or instruct the  check not to be paid. Also, he must not issue the check in such  a way that the bank refuses to honor it due to the signature not  matching, crossed out items on the check, or a discrepancy in  the contents of the check, and the like.    If a condition is made for the payment of the check, the  bank  shall disregard such a condition.    Article 4. Whenever the funds for a check are not paid, for  any reason cited in Article 2, the bank is responsible to state  clearly on a special form on which the specific information  concerning the check and the identity and full address of the  issuer is mentioned the reason for not paying, to sign and seal  it, and to give it to the holder of the check.    That sheet must contain the verified signature of the issuer  with the sample of the existing signature in the bank (within  the normal banking limitations).    The bank shall be responsible for informing the issuer of  the  check by immediately sending the second copy of this sheet to  the last address of the owner of that account that exists in the  bank.    That sheet must contain the first and last name and the full  address of the holder of the check.    Article 5. If the funds in the account of the issuer of the  check in the bank are less than the amount of the check, upon  the request of the holder of the check, the bank is obliged to  pay the available amount in the account to the holder of the  check, and the holder of the check, by writing the amount  received on the back of the check and submitting it to the bank,  shall receive a certificate including the specifications of the  check and the paid amount from the bank. The above-mentioned  check will be considered insufficient funds for the amount that  has not been paid, and the bank certificate in this case shall  be for the holder of the check a substitute for the original  check.    In regards to this article also, the bank is obliged to send  the announcement stated in the previous article to the owner of  the account.    Article 6. Banks are obliged to print the first and last  name  of the owner of the account on every check.    Article 7. Anyone who commits a violation stated in Article  3  shall be sentenced to prison from six months to two years and,  according to the case, the payment of a cash fine equivalent to  one-fourth of the insufficient funds at the time that the check  was submitted to the bank.    Article 8. Checks that in Iran are issued on banks abroad  and  result in affidavits of insufficient funds shall be in penal  terms subject to the regulations of this law.    Article 9. If the issuer of the check pays the amount of the  check in cash before the date of complaint to the holder, or  upon the agreement of the private complainer an arrangement is  made for its payment or he makes arrangements in the bank for it  to be paid, he cannot be prosecuted.    In the latter case, the above-mentioned bank is obliged to  block up to the amount of the check in the account of the issuer  and pay it to the holder of the check as soon as he comes in and  submits the check.    Article 10. Anyone who issues a check with the knowledge  that  his account is closed, shall be regarded as having issued a bad  check and shall be sentenced to the maximum punishment stated in  Article 7, and the set punishment shall not be postponed.    Article 11. Offenses stated in this law cannot be prosecuted  without the complaint of the holder of the check, and if the  holder of the check does not go to the bank within six months  after the date on which the check has been issued to collect the  funds from the bank or does not make a complaint within six  months after the issuance of the certificate of insufficient  funds, he shall no longer have the right to a legal complaint.    What is meant by the holder of the check in this article is  the person who submits the check for the first time to the bank.  To determine who has for the first time gone to the bank to  collect the funds for the check, banks are obliged to write the  full and precise identity of the holder with the date on the  back of the check as soon as he goes to the bank.    A person to whom the check is transferred after it has  returned from the bank shall not have the right to a legal  complaint unless the transfer was obligatory.[.sup]1.[/]    If the holder of the check wants to collect the check  through  another person as his representative and preserve the right to a  legal complaint, and if there are insufficient funds, he must  write his name and address and explain that the person is his  representative on the back of the check. In this case, the bank  shall issue the announcement in Articles 3 and 4 in the name of  the owner of the check, and his right to a legal complaint shall  be preserved.    Note.

The issuance of the stopping of prosecution in the penal  court shall not prevent the court from examining and issuing a  ruling regarding other damages demanded.    Whenever, after the issuance of the final ruling, the  complainant withdraws his complaint or the convicted person in  the above-mentioned ways pays the funds for the check, late  payment damages, and other damages stated in the ruling, the  implementation of the ruling shall stop and the convicted person  will only be obliged to pay an amount equivalent to one-third of  the cash fine stated in the ruling, which shall be collected for  the government upon the order of the prosecutor.    Article 13. Issuance of a check as guaranteed, or providing  funds for conditional, dated, or blank with a signature are  prohibited. If the other party makes a complaint and the funds  are not paid, the issuer shall be sentenced to a jail term of  six months to two years in addition to a cash fine of 100,000  rials[Rls] to Rls10 million.    Article 14. The issuer of the check or his legal  representative, by stating explicitly that the check has been  lost, stolen or forged or obtained through deception or  violation of trust or other such crime, can instruct the bank in  writing not to pay the funds designated in the check. After  verifying the identity of the person making the request, the  bank shall refuse to pay the funds, and if the check is  presented to the bank, it shall issue and submit a certificate  of nonpayment with the reason stated on it.    The holder of the check may make a complaint against the  person who has issued instructions for nonpayment, and if the  claim that has resulted in nonpayment is proven, in addition to  the punishment stated in Article 7 of this law, he shall be  condemned to pay all the damages to the holder of the check.    Note 1. The interested party in this article is the person  in  whose name the check is issued or endorsed or to whom the check  has been transferred (or to whom the check made out to cash has  been transferred).    In a case when the interested party instructs nonpayment,  the  bank is obliged to keep the amount of the check in a blocked  account until the examining authority has made a decision or the  person who has requested it changes his mind.    Note 2. The person issuing the instructions is obliged to  submit his complaint to the judicial authorities after  announcing it to the bank and submitting a certificate of his  complaint to the bank within a maximum period of one week,  otherwise, after the period has ended, the bank shall pay the  funds for the check upon the request of the holder from the  available funds.    Article 15. The holder of the check can demand the amount of  the check and his losses in the penal court that examines the  case.    Article 16. Examination of all penal and legal complaints  and  disputes concerning checks in the Prosecutor's Office and the  court, up to the completion of adjudication, shall be immediate  and shall takes precedence over other cases.    Article 17. The existence of a check in the hands of the  issuer is proof that its funds have been paid and the  complainant has withdrawn his complaint, unless the contrary is  proven.    Article 18. If the funds for the check are not provided in  the bank, the examining authority is obliged to obtain from the  accused a cash bond or bank security (which is valid until the  final decision). If the issuers of the check are more than one  person, the prosecuting authority may divide the amount of the  bond or bank security in ratio to the responsibility of each,  and if that is not clear, equally among all of them.    If one of the accused has paid the equivalent of the total  amount of the check in bonds or bank security, appropriate  security will be obtained from the other accused persons.    In the instances stated in Article 14 also, according to the  case, if the funds for the check are not provided in the bank,  as long as no justifiable evidence and proof of the claim of the  issuer of the check or the beneficiary is available, the  examining authority shall collect the above-mentioned security.    Also, if the accused requests time to pay the funds for the  check, the examining authority may, if he finds it appropriate,  grant him up to one month by receiving another appropriate  security.    In this case, if the accused does not pay the funds for the  check within the set period, the above-mentioned security will  be converted to bonds.    Note. If the bond or banking security mentioned in this  article is deposited, the security required from the property of  the accused is not permissible. In this case, the losses of the  private claimant shall be paid from the bond or the bank  security.    Article 19. If the check has been issued on behalf of the  owner of the account, whether an actual or legal person, the  issuer of the check and the owner of the account shall both be  responsible for the payment of the check, and the executive  order and the ruling on the losses shall be issued on the basis  of the responsibility of both. In addition, the signatory of the  check, according to the regulations of this law, has the legal  responsibility unless he proves that failure to pay is evidenced  by the action of the owner of the account or his next  representative, in which case the person who has caused the  failure to pay shall be legally responsible.    Article 20. The civil responsibility of the endorser of a  check shall continue on the basis of laws and regulations.    Article 21. Banks are responsible for closing all current  accounts of individuals who have issued bad checks more than  once and whose prosecution has resulted in the issuance of a  bill of indictment and to refuse to open another current account  for them for three more years.    The responsible member of the branch of any bank that does  not act in accordance with the above-mentioned duty, according  to each case, considering the circumstances, resources, number  of times, and the offense, shall be sentenced to one of the  punishments stated in Article 9 of the law of investigation of  administrative violations by the Administrative Violations  Investigation Committee.    Note 1. The Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is  responsible for keeping a record of individuals who have issued  bad checks regularly and place the list of the names of these  persons at the disposal of all the banks in the country for the  implementation of this law.    Note 2. The rules and regulations concerning the denial of  the right of individuals to open a current account and the  procedures to respond to the announcements of the banks shall be  on the basis of bylaws that will be prepared within a period of  three months by the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic and  ratified by the Cabinet.    Article 22. If the accused is not accessible, the last  address of the accused in the bank shall be considered his last  legal residence and any sort of notification shall be sent to  that address, unless the accused, in the manner stated in the  penal adjudication regulations, has given another address.    Whenever the accused is not identified with the banking  address or the address he has given or such a location does not  exist, the verification of the official shall be regarded as  notice of papers, and investigation shall continue without the  necessity of summoning the accused through the press.    Article 22 of the law of issuance of checks ratified in  Khordad 1344 [22 May-21 June 1965] is hereby nullified.  Notes    Article 7 read as follows prior to amendment:    Article 6.

Article 10 read as follows prior to amendment:    Article 9. Anyone who issues a check knowing that his bank  account is closed, his action shall be regarded the same as  issuing a bad check.    [.sup]1.[/]From the vote on the Unified Process Ruling  Number 31, Line 2/58, dated 16/12/1361 [3 March 1983].    ...In cases when banks are in charge of collecting the funds  of the checks on behalf of the holder of the check, the  representation does not need to be explicated.    Article 13 read as follows prior to amendment:    Article 12. In the following cases, the issuer of the check  cannot be prosecuted on the basis of the law:    1) If it is proved that he has given a signed blank check.    2) Whenever there is a condition stated in the text of the  check for the collection of its funds.    3) Whenever it is stated in the check that the check is a  security for a transaction or obligation.    4) Whenever, without it being stated on the check, it is  proved that the collection of its funds depends on meeting a  condition or the check was issued as security in a transaction  or obligation.    5) If it is proved that the check was issued without a date  or the actual date of the issuance of the check is prior to the  date stated on the check.    In regards to this article, the testimony of witnesses alone  does not prove the claim.    Article 14 read as follows prior to the amendment:    Article 13. If the issuer of the check or the beneficiary or  their legal representatives instruct the bank in writing not to  pay the funds of the check by stating clearly that the check has  been lost, stolen, forged, or obtained through deception,  violation of trust, or other offense, after verifying the  identity of the person who has so instructed, the bank shall  refuse to pay the funds, and if the check is presented to the  bank, the bank shall issue and submit a certificate of  nonpayment stating the reason.    The holder of the check may make a complaint against the  person who has instructed the bank not to pay, and if the claim  that has resulted in nonpayment is proved to be false, the  person who has given instructions in addition to the punishment  stated in Article 6 of this law shall be condemned to pay  one-fourth of the amount of the check in psychological damages  to the plaintiff and also damages for late payment (if asked) at  12 percent annually from the date of the presentation of the  check to the bank.    Note. The interested party in this article is the person in  whose name the check has been issued or endorsed or to whom the  check has been transferred (or to whom the check is made out to  cash and transferred).    Should the interested party instruct the bank not to pay,  the  bank is obliged to keep the amount of the check in a blocked  account until a decision has been made by the examination  authority or the instructor changes his mind.

If the issuers of the check  are more than one person, the prosecuting authority may divide  the amount of the bond or the banking security in proportion to  each person's obligation, and if it is not known, equally among  them.    If one of the accused persons has given the total amount of  the check in bonds or banking security, appropriate security  will be obtained from the other defendants.    In the instances stated in Articles 12 and 13, as long as  the  justified evidence and reason to prove the claim of the issuer  of the check has not been obtained, the investigating authority  shall collect the above-mentioned security.    Also, if the defendant asks for time to pay the funds in the  check, the examining authority, if appropriate, may grant  another month to him by obtaining other appropriate security.

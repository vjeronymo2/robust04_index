He said in his speech: At present, there are many problems  in social order and in the many factors affecting stability.  Serious economic crime cases, serious criminal cases, and the  phenomena of social evil have yet to be put under effective  control. The criminal cases of hooligans, robbers, and thefts  continued to increase. Therefore, we must be neither blind nor  optimistic about social order. We must keep from becoming  careless or paralyzed ideologically or practically.    Ye Liansong said: The year 1994 is key to satisfactorily  accomplishing the Eighth Five-Year Plan and to strive to fulfill  the target of quadrupling the GNP ahead of schedule. On the  basis of two consecutive years of fast economic development, we  should continue to maintain rapid economic development.  Therefore, the party committees and governments at various  levels and the judicial, procuratorial, and court departments  should accurately understand that development is the purpose,  reform is the motivation, and stability is the prerequisite and  grasp their dialectical relations. The party and government top  leaders should ideologically understand the importance of  stability as they understand reform and opening up. In doing  their practical work, the party and government top leaders  should exert real efforts to grasp stability as they do to grasp  economic work.    Ye Liansong stressed: Safeguarding stability is the common  task of the whole party and the whole society. So, the whole  party and all social forces should be mobilized and make  concerted efforts to comprehensively improve social order.    He urged: The party and government top leaders should not  only be leaders for economic construction but also be the first  to safeguard stability. We should strengthen the struggle for  strictly dealing blows to criminal activities, expand the extent  of attacks, and bring the rising tendencies of major cases under  control. We should positively and actively wage the struggle  against corruption and conscientiously investigate and handle  major and appalling cases involving legal persons.  Simultaneously, we should strengthen the construction of the  contingent of the masses preventing and controlling criminal  activities and enable it to come into full play as the first  line of defense for eliminating contradictions, preventing  crimes, and stabilizing society.</p>

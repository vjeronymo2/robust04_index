			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's partnership with NATO "should be different  in its scale and intensity than with other countries,"  President Yeltsin said in an exclusive interview with INTERFAX.  He was asked about terms for Russia's acceptance of the  Partnership for Peace program.    In his words, there is a goal "to reach a special agreement  with NATO, befitting the place and role of Russia in world and  European affairs, its military power and nuclear status."    "In general, we have been acting without haste. We have  conducted consultations with CIS states, and now we are  approaching the time when we need to sign a framework document,"  Yeltsin said.    Russia, he continued, "has its own concept of cooperation in  Europe. Its central element: CSCE as a priority common  regional political forum and the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council as the leading mechanism of military and political  partnership should coordinate activities of other structures,  NATO included."    Asked by INTERFAX's special correspondent Vyacheslav  Terekhov, what lessons politicians should learn from that which  the people of Russia went through last October, Yeltsin stressed  the need "above all to ban violence and extremism and prevent  ignoble agitation and disturbances."    He believes that all possible efforts to forestall a tragedy  similar to the events in Moscow on October 3-4 "must be for any  politician in Russia the supreme goal and a must for both  himself and his associates -- whatever their convictions may be."    "Elections -- that's the way to reach political objectives,  Yeltsin remarked. [quotation marks as received] Rebellions,  uprisings, etc. Are outlawed as politically immoral. That's  the first lesson from the October tragedy." In his opinion,  this lesson "is just being learned, and with difficulty at  that." As testimony of this, he referred to the preparation of  an agreement on civic peace, "which more and more parties and  organizations have been willing to join."    "There is yet another lesson from those somber days -- the  vital need to consolidate the state. No one must be allowed to  ruin state buildings, assault TV premises, man armed  detachments, etc. The state must safeguard its citizens against  all that," Yeltsin said. "Regrettably, extremism then was curbed  only at the last moment. And if those efforts had failed -- what  streams of blood would have flown in Moscow and all over  Russia?" Yeltsin remarked.    In his words, there is now the essential minimum, above all  the democratically adopted Constitution, to consolidate the  state.    As he noted, the Constitution "has put an end to dual power,  has offered peaceful and civilized ways to resolve differences  and has laid the basis for interaction between all sensible  forces in Russia. "Sentiments in favor of searching for  agreement are prevalent now, Yeltsin said. I see my task in  making such concord a realty."    Asked about his intention to nominate himself for a new  presidential term, he described this question as "premature."    On his chief task in the coming two years before  presidential  elections, Yeltsin said that there was nothing more important  than to ensure stable relations "between full-fledged efficient  branches of power -- executive, legislative, and judicial."    In his words, there is a new climate of interaction evolving  with the Federation Council and State Duma alike. "The dialogue  is developing, Yeltsin noted. I will do all I can so that this  constructive mood will strengthen, so that parliament can  complete its entire term, so that the next scheduled elections  are precisely that kind of elections and that they take place in  the conditions of stability and a higher political culture."    In Yeltsin's view, there is a second task linked to that --  to make Russia, "our Federation" more united over these two  years. Having admitted that work to coordinate federative  relations has at times been painful and tense, Yeltsin noted  that "on the whole this process is under control not only  centrally but regionally."    "Over these two years we need to advance in earnest within  the Commonwealth of Independent States and elsewhere, Yeltsin  stressed. I do not want to talk in detail at this stage about  our plans, this is a separate big topic. But I think in two  years our states will be much closer towards each other.    He called economics as third in his list of priorities. "All  of us are now going through a grueling school. If we recall  what the last 2-3 years have been, we can say with confidence  that we have learned something," he said. Noting that only a  tiny part of the experience gained in Russia through the  centuries and subsequently destroyed has been returned so far,  he stressed nonetheless that "this return is going on in  increments." "The next two years will become exceedingly  important in this respect, Yeltsin noted. "I hope that in time  our economy's multiple ills will begin to disappear to the  relief all of us."</p>

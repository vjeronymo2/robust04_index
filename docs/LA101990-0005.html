			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 144;  </P> <P> PRISON BREAK  </P> <P> During the 1980s, the number of prisoners in California rose from about 20,000  to more than 90,000, all of them crammed into prisons designed to hold about  50,000.  </P> <P> The Department of Corrections plans to more than double prison capacity by the  mid-1990s, leaving them holding only about one-third more inmates than they  were designed for.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian has said that Californians might have to approve bond  issues in every general election between now and then to complete the plan.  </P> <P> Voters have, in fact, approved prison bonds in every general election since  1984 and in the primary this year.  </P> <P> Proposition 144 on the Nov. 6 ballot calls for another $450- million worth of  bonds, but there seem to be good reasons for letting the timetable on prison  bonds slip a few months.  </P> <P> First, Deukmejian will turn over his office in January to a new governor who  should be given time to review the state's prison policies, particularly in  light of a recent commission report on prison management.  </P> <P> The state will not run out of prison money while a review goes on. Counting  revenue bonds approved by the Legislature in July, the state already is  authorized to sell more than $2-billion worth of prison bonds.  </P> <P> Finally, Californians have approved $4-billion worth of bond issues so far this  year and will vote billions more next month.  </P> <P> Virtually all are for good causes. Few can afford delay, but Proposition 144 is  an exception. For these reasons, we urge a no vote on 144.  </P></p>

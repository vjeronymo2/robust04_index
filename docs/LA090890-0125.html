			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFICA IN SLOPPY WIN OVER WOODBRIDGE  </P> <P> Pacifica High School emerged from Friday night's penalty-plagued season- opener  with a 28-10 non-league victory over visiting Woodbridge at Bolsa Grande High  School.  </P> <P> The defending Garden Grove League champions took advantage of the penalty- and  turnover-ridden Warriors, who are moving from the Pacific Coast League to the  Sea View League this season.  </P> <P> Woodbridge was penalized 15 times for 146 yards and committed three costly  turnovers to help seal its fate.  </P> <P> Pacifica's first-quarter touchdown, a nine-yard pass from Chris Castellano to  Dave Anderson, was aided by 40 yards in penalties. Mariner safety Rich Main,  who also had two sacks and returned an intercepted pass 30 yards for a  fourth-quarter touchdown, stopped Woodbridge's ensuing drive to the Mariner  eight-yard line by recovering wide receiver Miguel Morales' fumble of a 19-yard  pass from quarterback James Wyatt.  </P> <P> Pacifica pulled away from a 7-3 halftime lead on a 25-yard touchdown pass from  Castellano to Scott Lesser and a 61-yard fumble recovery return by Chris  Maroney in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Woodbridge scored its only touchdown in a fourth-quarter, 94-yard drive capped  by Nathaniel Haugh's one-yard plunge. Brian Nurick kicked the conversion to go  with his 23-yard, second-quarter field goal. TOM BIRSCHBACH  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORIEGA'S DEFENSE TEAM UNDERGOING EXPANSION;  </P> <P> PANAMA: CHIEF COUNSEL FRANK RUBINO SAYS FIRST TO BE ADDED IS A LAWYER WHO IS AN  AUTHORITY ON THE USE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.  </P> <P> The chief defense attorney for Manuel A. Noriega announced Friday that his  two-member legal team is being expanded to include lawyers from other parts of  the country who are expert in classified information and international and  constitutional law.  </P> <P> The statement by attorney Frank A. Rubino follows criticism by other lawyers  that the drug-trafficking prosecution of the deposed Panamanian dictator raises  too many significant issues to be handled by two "sole practitioners" from  Miami.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the independent counsel in the Iran-Contra investigation, which  found evidence that Noriega offered in 1986 to assassinate Nicaraguan  government officials for the United States, moved to examine the "massive  amount" of documents obtained by U.S. forces in Panama.  </P> <P> David Runkel, the Justice Department's chief spokesman, confirmed Friday that  the counsel's office had called about seeing the documents, which are being  studied in Panama by Justice Department lawyers and FBI and Drug Enforcement  Administration agents.  </P> <P> Runkel said Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh had directed that there be "fullest  cooperation" with the independent counsel's request.  </P> <P> Also on Friday, Magistrate Peter Palermo, over government objections, set bond  for Noriega co-defendant Daniel Miranda at $1 million. However, Miranda  remained in custody while prosecutors appealed the decision on grounds that  there is a high risk he will flee.  </P> <P> Rubino announced the defense team expansion as he met with reporters outside  the U.S. courthouse after conferring with Noriega in his basement cell.  </P> <P> Rubino said that the first outside expert to be hired is New York lawyer David  Lewis, an authority on the use of classified information in criminal trials.  </P> <P> Lewis served as a defense attorney for former CIA agent Edwin P. Wilson in his  trial for plotting and attempting to carry out the assassination of two federal  prosecutors and several witnesses from his previous trials.  </P> <P> Rubino declined to comment on reports that Noriega soon would be moved to a  more secure location outside the Miami area. It was learned that government and  defense lawyers discussed such a proposal at a closed-door court hearing  earlier Friday.  </P> <P> Rubino's news conference came as defense lawyers involved in the case learned  of a physical attack against Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane, by a man  wielding a crowbar.  </P> <P> O'Kane, his head heavily bandaged and his shirt bloodstained, told about the  attack at a bond hearing held for his client. The attorney said he was clubbed  as he stepped outside his home Friday morning by an assailant whom he chased  and subdued with the help of a passing motorist.  </P> <P> The suspect, arrested by police, said that he had been sent by someone,  according to O'Kane. But he apparently did not reveal who sent him.  </P> <P> O'Kane, whose list of past clients has included narcotics traffickers, said he  believed that the attack was related to recent publicity about his  representation of Miranda, a pilot who has been accused of transporting  $800,000 in drug money to Noriega.  </P> <P> Miami police late Friday night discounted the theory that the attack on O'Kane  was related to the Noriega case, saying that the assailant held a grudge  against O'Kane because of a drug prosecution last year.  </P> <P> O'Kane had been criticized by federal prosecutors this week for alleging, in  open court, that the secretive U.S. National Security Agency had conducted  electronic eavesdropping on telephone calls and other communications between  defendants in the Noriega case.  </P> <P> Government lawyers had asked U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler to censure  O'Kane for raising the matter in a public session, but the judge took no  action.  </P> <P> Rubino, asked about the attack on O'Kane, said: "I hope people know that Gen.  Noriega, as well as anyone else in our country, is entitled to legal  representation and a fair trial."  </P> <P> He said that he hoped an expanded legal team of four to six attorneys could be  assembled within a week or two.  </P> <P> Noriega's alleged offer to assassinate Sandinista leaders in Nicaragua came to  light during the trial of former White House national security aide Oliver L.  North. The government acknowledged that the offer had been made by a Noriega  representative to North, who told him that U.S. law barred such actions.  </P> <P> However, with the alleged backing of former President Ronald Reagan's National  Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, North met with Noriega in London and  discussed sabotage of Sandinista targets, according to government admissions  during the North trial.  </P> <P> While a spokeswoman for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh declined to  discuss the request for documents, it appears to be aimed at filling gaps in  the Iran-Contra affair rather than to initiate new prosecutions.  </P> <P> Jackson reported from Miami and Ostrow reported from Washington.

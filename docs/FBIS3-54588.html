Lawyers also invariably described Aminul Haq's removal as  "surprising," although he is known not to be a supporter of the  ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).    The official BSS news agency announced late Saturday [22  January] that "the government has appointed Additional Attorney  General Abdul Wadud Khandakar as attorney general of Bangladesh  in addition to his own duties, until further order."    Khandakar is known for his close links to the BNP.    The appointment, BSS said, was effective January 2 and had  been approved by Bangladesh President Abdur Rahman Biswas as Haq  was under medical treatment abroad.    But Haq said Sunday he had returned home last Monday and had  met Biswas on Friday, yet was not informed of his removal and  had continued to work as attorney general the last few days.    "I have not yet received any official letter and was  surprised to hear the government announcement," he told AFP by  telephone.    A top justice official confirmed the firing. "Yes, he (Haq)  has been relieved of his responsibilities and papers are being  processed to enable Khandakar to take full charge," the official  said.    After hearing of his removal Haq said he was not going to  the  office Sunday, a normal working day in predominantly Muslim  Bangladesh.    The ministry official refused to comment as to why Haq had  not been informed.    Haq came to the limelight after successfully sending the  deposed Ershad to jail for 20 years on weapons and graft  charges, and was appointed attorney general by acting president  Shahabuddin Ahmed's interim government in 1991.    One opposition member of parliament was quoted as saying  that  "he (Haq) did not join the government politically, but served  his position well."    Khandakar told the daily MORNING SUN newspaper that he had  received the order and had assumed the post of attorney general.    "The gentleman (Haq) was not in the country and in (his)  absence an attorney general cannot handover charges to anyone,"  Khandakar said. "That is why it has been given retrospective  effect, otherwise there would be a constitutional problem."    He said the president appoints the attorney general under a  constitutional provision as recommended by the prime minister.    The former attorney general had offered to resign soon after  Prime Minister Khaleda Zia came to power in March, 1991, but he  was asked to carry on. He again offered to resign in April,  1992, when the government charged 24 main organisers of a  "peoples' court" for treason.    The mock "peoples' court" condemned Golam Azam, chief of the  Moslem fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami party, to "death" for  crimes allegedly committed during Bangladesh's 1971 independence  war, but the government said the peoples' court action was not  legal.    Haq, besides pursuing several more graft charges against  Ershad, was also entangled in the citizenship case of Azam. A  High Court bench last year restored Azam's citizenship, but Huq  had appealed against it.    The former attorney general was reluctant to say much about  his removal and replacement by a man who apparently enjoys  closer political ties to the government.    Asked his feelings on the government decision, Haq replied:  "I have no feelings."</p>

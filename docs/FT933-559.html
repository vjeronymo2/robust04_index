			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (6): Near-perfect parable of the phoenix's rise - Kevin Rafferty admires an elegant account of Japan's rebirth from the ashes of war / Economic History JAPAN'S CAPITALISM: CREATIVE DEFEAT AND BEYOND by Shigeto Tsuru Cambridge University Press Pounds 24.95 277 pages ONCE UPON a time, a Japanese village had three brothers, Strong, Rich and Warmhearted. At first Strong was the dominant force, using his might to make things right, until age began to tell, his strength faded and he yielded his power to Rich. Rich built a big empire, but his wealth was stored in warehouses which were burned to the ground in a fire, leaving him penniless. Warmhearted, meanwhile, had been studying medicine, which knowledge was put to good use in diagnosing, isolating and treating the epidemic that raged after the fire, saving countless lives. Warmhearted became the real and lasting hero of the village, commemorated by a statue in its centre. 'Warmhearted triumphed over Strong and Rich,' notes Shigeto Tsuru, concluding the children's story. The inclusion of such fairytales tells a lot about Tsuru's broad and humanitarian approach. Of his scholarship there can also be no doubt. Distinguished as both a practical and an academic economist, his understanding of the politics as well as the economics of war and peace was honed successively as student leader against the Japanese military; as a Harvard academic assisting Gottfried Haberler and Wassily Leontief; as Japanese wartime infantry private and later foreign ministry official; under the same roof as his wife's uncle and Lord Privy Seal Marquis Kido when Kido was attempting to end the war; as vice minister on the post-war Economic Stabilisation Board; then as professor of economics and later president of Hitotsubashi University. This book is quite simply the best history yet written of Japan's Phoenix-like rise from the defeat and ashes of the War. It is spare but incisive. Tsuru's mastery of sources is marvellous. He has consulted dry-as-dust government documents, corporate reports, classical and modern economists, the oriental classics, fairytales - even modern journalism. He has distilled their essence, added the lessons of his own practical experience and political understanding, and turned the account into English prose that is easy, even sweet to read. One of the pleasant things is to see remembered with affection unsung heroes such as Wolf Ladejinsky, who helped in the post-war land reforms and went on to assist Taiwan, then India. Tsuru carefully explains important and powerful Japanese practices like window guidance (the Bank of Japan's dealing out of credit) and administrative guidance (under which government agencies without explicit legal authority direct or induce private Concerns to take or refrain from actions). He concludes: 'It may well be that the traditional dislike of open legal procedures in the social climate of Japan has nurtured the practice of resolving an issue through informal, quasi-voluntary jawboning and finger-pointing of the type peculiar to Japan.' He also offers a valuable assessment of the extent to which Japan relied on export-led growth. In spite of its slimness, there are few deficiencies in the history. Tsuru has illuminating insights into how Japan succeeded in building its sewing machine, camera and watch industries and how collusion between government and manufacturers helped nurture the growth. It would, however, have been nice also to have examples of the failures of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in guiding Japan's miracle. Tsuru's natural sympathies are with the left, revealed in his quotation of John Ruskin's address to manufacturers at Bradford in 1859: 'You must remember always that your business, as manufacturers, is to FORM THE MARKET as much as to supply it . . . But whatever happens to you, this, at least, is certain, that the whole of your life will have been spent in corrupting public taste and encouraging public extravagance.' He expresses great anger at Japan's other GNP or 'Great National Pollution', righteously and rightfully indignant at the way the Inland Sea, a rich natural treasure-house of resources, has been violated by heavy industry. The author's concluding concern is whether modern Japan will become Warmhearted, or instead be selfishly Rich. In Tsuru's view, this is probably the most important part of the book. It is certainly the most thought-provoking, but also the weakest. He needed more space to expand his ideas. The greatest weakness is the gap between the author's five prescriptions for future Japanese policy - essentially that it should be a centre for excellence and promotion of international understanding and aid - and the real world of grubby politics. His highly pertinent comments on the US-Japan Security Treaty, and his criticisms of the GNP Growthmanship of Rich Japan, lose their impact precisely because his ideal world is so far from the real one, whereas. in the historical sections Tsuru was 'at nose length' from the major events. Historians, political scientists and economists alike should nevertheless be grateful for this account, and practising politicians and bureaucrats in and outside Japan would do well to consider its implications. Right to the end Tsuru is cheering Warmhearted. He mixes folk-wisdom with scholarship, remembering that it is 'the sun, not the north wind, (that) may make the traveller take off his coat.'</p>

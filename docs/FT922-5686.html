			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: AJ Archer suffers 62% fall to Pounds 267,000 AMID EXTREMELY difficult trading conditions at the Lloyd's of London insurance market, AJ Archer Holdings, the listed Lloyd's agency group, reported a 62 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 708,000 to Pounds 267,000, in the six months to March 31. Earnings per share fell to 0.7p (1.9p). The interim dividend is 2.2p (3.15p). During the half year agency fees rose to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.19m). but fees received for winding up - which are no longer receivable by managing agents - dropped to just Pounds 4,000 (Pounds 137,000). Operating expenses rose to Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 987,000), principally due to the inclusion of the costs relating to the Henry G Nicholson members' agency last year. Interest receivable also fell - reflecting falling interest rates and less money on deposit - to Pounds 215,000 (Pounds 373,000). Archer warned that profitability would be further depressed when the group reports its results for the full year since profit commission earned from the 1989 underwriting year and re- ceived since March 31 fell to Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 2.2m). Of the 10 syndicates managed by the group in 1989 half produced profits and half losses, with two of the syndicates' losses amounting to less than 1 per cent of stamp (capital base). For the 1992 year of account Archer's managed capacity - the amount of premium income its syndicates are allowed to accept according to Lloyd's rules - fell from Pounds 330m to Pounds 290m. The group's members' agency capacity rose to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 16.8m).</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Taiwan moves to end 'state of war' TAIWAN'S National Assembly yesterday rapidly finished revising the constitution to end a state of war with China that has lasted for 43 years - in the absence of opposition and independent delegates who walked out in protest. Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist Chinese government suspended the constitution with additional emergency clauses, and declared a 'Period of Communist Rebellion' just before it was driven to Taiwan by Mao's Communist forces in 1949. The removal of the clauses allows President Lee Teng-hui to end the period of 'Communist Rebellion' in early May and usher in a new era of constitutional democracy for Taiwan. Taipei hopes it also signals the start of a new relationship with the communists in Peking, from whom it is expecting a positive response. Both governments still staunchly claim sovereignty over all of China including Taiwan, but a rapprochement of some sort has been forced upon them by growing interchange between their peoples in recent years. The opposition Democratic Progressive party and a number of other groups oppose the National Assembly's adoption of a constitutional reform package that allows the president to keep emergency powers.</p>

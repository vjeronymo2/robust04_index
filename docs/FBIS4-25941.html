			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by Gu Zhenqiu and Xiong Mingshan: "Calm </F> Atmosphere Prevails in Lagos"]    [Text] Lagos, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Calmness and tranquillity  today greet the first anniversary of the annulled presidential  election in the Nigerian commercial and financial capital of  Lagos.    The traffic is light as the residents are enjoying their  weekend in the city, which is well known for its bustle and  hustle traffic movement during the weekdays.    Armed police are seen manning strategic points in the  metropolis.    On the lawn patches near the national theater, Nigerian kids  and youngsters are playing football, one of the most popular  sports game in the West African nation.    Nigerian head of State General Sani Abacha said in his  broadcast to the whole nation this morning that his government  is determined to seek the successful implementation of the  agenda of the proposed national constitutional conference,  slated for June 27.    Meanwhile, he also warned against any act to endanger the  peace and security in the nation, saying that saboteurs would be  sternly punished.    A young Nigerian woman, who identified herself as a high  school student, said Abacha's broadcast "is not specific."    "If only he (Abacha) can identify those bad elements in our  society," she said.    On Awolowo Road, a petit peddler told XINHUA, "I know  nothing  about Abacha's speech and I do not know (anything) about (the  fact that Moshood) Abiola was wanted" by the Nigerian Police.    "I don't care about politics, but I do care about my  business  because my family lives on" the petit business, he said.    At a shopping center near the American Embassy in Nigeria, a  Nigerian Army soldier named Alassan said Abiola "Is doing  something at a wrong time."    "You see, the election was annulled a year ago by the  (General Ibrahim) Babangida administration, but one year later  Abiola still insists (on) the restoration of the election," he  said, adding that "I think he's joking."    Asked about what he will do if Abiola is standing before  him,  he said calmly, "The fact is that Abiola is missing now. But if  he is standing before me, I'll arrest him and I think he'll be  tried."    "You can't establish a government within the government  headed by General Abacha," he said, "That's why Abiola's action  is viewed as treason."    Meanwhile, Alassan said if he arrested Abiola or had the  information which leads to his arrest, "I will be 50,000 (naira)  richer."    However, no information so far is available to confirm  whether the Nigerian police have promised to offer a reward of  50,000 naira (about 2,270 U.S. dollars at the official exchange  rate).    Abiola, widely believed to have won the annulled  presidential  election last year, repeatedly threatened to form a rival  government with him as "the president of Nigeria."    While declaring Abiola wanted, the Nigerian Police on  Saturday [11 June] asked the general public with information of  his whereabouts to come forward with such information.</p>

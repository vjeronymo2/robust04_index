			<p>BFN     [Text] Spurred by fears of war and anxiety over the  possible collapse of the Kim Il-song regime, senior North Korean  party, government and military officials are hoarding U.S.  dollars, gold, jewelry and other valuables.    A persistent distrust in the local currency of the North,  the  won, is also driving the North Korean elite to convert their  money into currency of capitalist nations or to buy up  valuables, according to information filtering through from the  North.    Pyongyang's leaders have been instilling a war mentality  among their countrymen by boasting, "We will accomplish  unification through the barrel of a gun." Of late, they have  been putting ordinary citizens in fear by claiming that South  Korea and the United States are about to invade the North  because of the deadlocked nuclear row.    The Stalinist state's leaders have contributed further to  the  atmosphere of anxiety by ordering power blackouts and air raid  exercises. As a result, many North Koreans apparently now  believe that war will eventually break out on the peninsula.    One member of the pro-Pyongyang Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chochongnyon) who claims to know the  commander of the Fourth North Korean Army Corps, identified only  as Gen. Chang, said many North Koreans were buying U.S. dollars  and Japanese yen from ethnic Koreans in China who trade goods  across the border. Others are secretly amassing stores of gold,  he said.    In particular, military generals like Chang are hording  hundreds of thousands of dollars and gold ingots as large as 15  cm long, 5 cm wide and 4 cm thick. Some are also hoarding  pearls, gold necklaces, gold bracelets and ear-rings.    The Chochongnyon official said one of his relatives,  identified only as An, a senior member of the Central Workers  (Communist) Party in charge of agriculture, is hiding an  unspecified amount of yen and jewelry.    NAEWOE PRESS, South Korea's official watcher of North Korean  affairs, said another reason North Koreans are hoarding foreign  currency and valuables was because of a possible, abrupt  exchange of old bills with new ones like the swap carried out  July 15, 1992.    At that time, the Pyongyang regime conducted a one-to-one  exchange of old and new cash but limited the amount citizens  could change, forcing them to deposit the excess at the central  bank and other financial institutions. They were allowed to  withdraw the deposited money under different regulations later  on, NAEWOE said. The Pyongyang regime allowed individual  households to exchange up to 399 won while depositing 30,000 won  and no more. Because of this measure, many angry citizens burned  the excess money they had saved or simply tossed the bills away.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANCE'S BOUVIER WINS CUP SLALOM IN UTAH AFTER PROTEST IS OVERRULED  </P> <P> Nathalie Bouvier of France won a World Cup women's giant slalom Friday after a  jury overruled a protest that claimed she had missed a gate on her first run.  </P> <P> The jury talked with the gatekeeper and reviewed the videotape, then declared  Bouvier the leader over Diann Roffe of the United States with a time of 1  minutes 8.37 seconds.  </P> <P> Roffe, 22, giant slalom gold medalist in the 1985 World Championships, finished  her first run on the artificial surface in 1:09.06 as light snow fell.  </P> <P> In the second run, Bouvier was timed in 1:07.60 for a total of 2:15.97. Roffe's  1:08.14 gave her a total of 2:17.20, placing her ahead of Austria's Anita  Wachter, who was third in 2:17.51.  </P> <P> "I've worked hard and I'm a year older," Roffe said. "I feel I'm finally ready  to be a force."  </P> <P> Wachter moved into second place in the World Cup overall standings with 40  points, one behind West German Michaela Gerg, who finished sixth Friday.  </P> <P> Switzerland's Vreni Schneider, coming off the best season in the history of the  sport, fell on her first run but said she will be ready for today's slalom.  </P> <P> "Tomorrow is another day and I hope to do better," she said. "It is just one  race. The snow was no problem. I had trouble with my inside ski."  </P> <P> The race, held on Willy's Run, was the second in the four-day World Cup event  for about 130 skiers from 18 countries.  </P></p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (3): Accommodating participants Interview with FW de Klerk, deputy president: Question: How well is the government of national unity working? Answer: It got off to a good start. All the participants are going out of their way to be accommodating. I have identified a number of issues where. . . one might experience problems: the question of a truth commission; how should we deal with the past; the question of affirmative action; the whole land issue is going to be a very emotional and sensitive one for years to come. But the whole question of economic policy has basically been breached: it is clear that economic and financial policies will be based on principles which can ensure economic growth, which will build investor confidence, which will continue to maintain inflation at acceptable levels, so in that I find proof that we can and will also reach accommodation with regard to other important issues. Has South Africa ended up with a federal constitution, through the back door? I've always said this is essentially a federal constitution. What is happening now is just proof of that. What is the role of the National Party? One of fully participating in the government, putting aside our differences. . . I'm not saying that on specific issues it will not become necessary for us to say we have to consider our position on this very important issue as a party, but so far it hasn't been necessary. So the ministers and I would be playing the normal role that you play irrespective of which party forms the government. . . But the NP intends also to be an effective opposition. Obviously, one will be inhibited by the fact that one is also participating. It is for this reason that policy frameworks are important. Because once you have agreed on policy frameworks, the political debate, aimed at the next election, is to say 'Our policy is better. We had to make a compromise, yes, but vote for us next time and you'll get a better policy.' Will you still need a government of national unity after the five years entrenched in the constitution? I personally think that five years might be too short. Even if the concept of power sharing were to be weakened in a final constitution, because I don't think it will disappear, I believe it is quite probable that South Africa will move to the situation of so many European countries, where on the basis of proportional representation you will have coalitions because of the election results and because no single party gets more than 50 per cent of the vote.</p>

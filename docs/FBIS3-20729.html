Vico: "How To Salvage the Fleet"] </F>   [Excerpts] Montenegro Prime Minister Mile Djukanovic,  opening a two-day conference on the prospects of the  shipbuilding, repair, and servicing industry in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] organized by the Veljko Vlahovic  Shipyard in Bijela, Montenegro, within the framework of this  year's Mimosa Festival, spoke on the resources available to the  Montenegrin maritime trade sector and on government measures to  safeguard that industry under the conditions of sanctions.    Djukanovic said: "The following data speak about the  significance and the prospects of the maritime trade industry of  Montenegro: a port cargo handling capacity of about five million  tons, a repair capacity of 80 to 100 ships annually, a fleet  consisting of 37 ships with about one million tons displacement,  5,200 workers -- 5 percent of the total number of employed in  the republic. Participation in maritime trade accounts for 17  percent of the GNP of the republic and 20 percent of total  foreign exchange income.    Projects planned for the development of maritime trade were  halted with the introduction of sanctions by the UN Security  Council. Sanctions did not affect any other sector of the  economy to such a degree as they did maritime trade. They  brought into question its very survival. Direct damage from the  sanctions to the maritime trade enterprises of Montenegro has  been assessed at $220 million. The republic government, together  with the federal government, is undertaking measures to  safeguard existing capacities during the sanctions, i.e., to  activate them as successfully as possible after the sanctions  are lifted. [passage omitted]    This is why, with the help of the federal government and the  National Bank of Yugoslavia, $45 million have been earmarked for  that purpose. These funds have saved the ships from  foreclosure." [passage omitted]</p>

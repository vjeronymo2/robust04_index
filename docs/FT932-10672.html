			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Capital and Regional makes Pounds 10m purchase Capital and Regional Prop-erties, a USM-quoted property company, yesterday announced the acquisition of an Aberdeen shopping centre for Pounds 10.1m, along with a Pounds 13.2m placing and open offer. The 200,000 sq ft Trinity Centre in Union Street, Aberdeen, which was developed by Norwich Union in 1984, has 30 shops, including a 100,000 sq ft store let to Debenhams. The annual rental income is Pounds 1.16m, which produces an initial yield of 11.5 per cent. Mr Martin Barber, chairman, said the deal moved the company up into the middle ranks of the property market. However, it will not raise additional money from shareholders for another year. Warburg Securities has placed 9.96m shares at 140p each, and shareholders can claw back on a 1-for-2 basis.</p>

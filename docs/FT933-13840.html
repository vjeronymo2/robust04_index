			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Low inflation fosters long-dated attitudes - Several countries have pushed their PSBR to the limit without obvious success. Unemployment continues to grow, and the solution is to cut rates and stimulate growth / Bonds A FEW years ago, the goal of every investor was bricks and mortar, and the mantra was 'location, location, location'. Now that building societies offer gross returns of around 5 per cent, many more people are moving money to government bonds and the cry is 'duration, duration, duration'. With confidence in long-lasting low inflation growing, the perceived risk of holding long-dated bonds declines, and investors are happier to roll their holdings out to the long-dated maturities, which offer higher rewards when interest rates fall, as they have been doing steadily in Europe for some months. The high-yielding European markets - Italy, Spain, Denmark and Portugal - rallied sharply early last year. Investors were wooed by the convergence argument, whereby interest rates in these countries were to come down towards German levels. However, when the Danes voted against Maastricht on June 2 last year, there was havoc in the bond markets. Investors piled into D-Mark bonds and out of Italy and Spain. Then, last September, the UK and Italy suspended their currencies from the ERM. The UK cut rates aggressively and gilts returned to favour. Also, Maastricht worries began to fade and the high-yielders returned to favour. So far, no other country has removed its currency from the ERM, but the tradition of following Germany's lead has come under pressure. In late June, France cut short-term floor rates below those of Germany for the first time in 26 years. France is considered the only strong-currency nation within the ERM whose currency is not tied to the D-Mark, and the spread between 10-year French government bond and German Bund yields - the market's view of long-term inflationary trends - has tumbled from almost a percentage point at the beginning of the year to around 10 basis points. Many economists have been waiting for French 10-year yields to fall below their German equivalent. If that happens and the move is seen to be sustainable, some argue that it will be a strong pointer to France replacing Germany as the financial anchor within the European exchange rate mechanism. After tense days of heated exchanges between the two nations, Germany cut its key interest rates, reducing its upper limit Lombard rate by 0.25 point to 8.25 per cent and its official floor rate by 0.5 point to 6.75 per cent. That prompted a rash of monetary easing throughout mainland Europe. The increasing trend to cut rates can be seen as a reflection of government failures to lift their countries out of recession. Several countries, notably the UK, have pushed their public sector borrowing requirements to the limit without obvious success. Unemployment continues to grow and the solution is to cut rates and stimulate growth. Mr Philip Saunders, global bond fund manager at Guinness Flight, says: 'Countries have used up all their fiscal bullets on the charging rhino of recession and failed to stop it. Now they have to resort to some fairly heavy monetary artillery.' Guinness Flight is concentrating its global bond investment on Europe, which it gives a 70 per cent weighting. Almost half of that weighting goes to the high-yielding markets in Spain and Italy, and 15 per cent goes to gilts. Outside Europe, Guinness favours yen bonds over US Treasuries, which it sees as carrying too high a risk except for the 30-year maturities which have further room to fall. On the other hand, Mercury Asset Management, which runs a Pounds 250m global bond fund, the biggest in the UK, is a big fan of the UK, and has a quarter of its allocation in gilts. The UK offers especially attractive bond prospects. It is a very liquid market, with the longest dated easily-tradeable maturities in Europe. The traditional bogey remains of boom-bust economics and the accompanying sharp inflationary spirals, but there is a belief that the situation may have changed. Many feel that, although the UK is out of the ERM again, it is effectively linked to European performance and that the low inflationary trend is here to stay. MAM's managing director, Mr David Rosier says: 'The government is not having so much difficulty with its deficit as people think. Ten-year maturities are yielding 8 per cent, and core inflation is around 3.5 per cent, so the real yield is just under 5 per cent which is quite attractive.' Elsewhere, MAM is keen on the US, not for the benefits of Treasury bonds but for the attractions of the currency, and it has 16 per cent of its fund in high-yielding Spanish bonds. Fidelity, which has a Dollars 100m bond fund based in Luxembourg, as well as a Pounds 37m UK-based bond fund, is also concentrating on Europe where it has 52 per cent of its allocation. However, it has a relatively small exposure to the UK, where it believes the rally is about to peak. It has a much larger exposure to the US, about a third of the funds, on the basis of a rising dollar. In fact, the US has provided disturbing signals for the global bond investor. Some specialists have interpreted recent inflationary flickers as a sign that the bull run is about to flag and the world economy is stirring into life again. Those stirrings were dealt a blow by the OECD at the beginning of June, when it cut its current year growth forecast for the 24 nations it covers by 0.7 per cent to 1.2 per cent. Kemper Investment Management, which looks at the performance of 21 national bond markets, says: 'Such a revision could only reinforce the near three-year bull market in bonds.'</p>

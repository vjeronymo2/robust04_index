			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nadezhda Garifullina report: "The Russian Path -- The </F> Third Russian National Union Congress Is Over"]    [Text] The Third Russian National Union [RNU] Congress  took place over two days in Moscow, gathering together around  150 delegates from more than 50 regions of the Russian  Federation.    The main event of the first day was information from State  Duma and Federation Council deputies A. Lukyanov, V. Isakov, S.  Baburin, Ye. Pavlov, V. Tikhonov, S. Glotiv, and others on the  work of the new parliament, and their answers to numerous  questions from the delegates. On the second day there was a  general political discussion on two reports: "On Making  Amendments and Additions to the Russian National Union Rules,"  which was delivered by RNU Coordinating Council Chairman S.  Baburin, and "On the Political and Socioeconomic Situation in  the Country and the Tasks of the Russian National Union,"  presented by N. Pavlov.    On proclaiming the creation of the RNU social movement in  October 1991, its initiators stressed the following in the  program document: The new movement "must be national in order  to embrace Russians and Bashkirs, Yakuts and Ukrainians, Germans  and Poles, the peoples of the Volga Region and the North  Caucasus. We consider the sole demand upon participants in the  movement to be a feeling of love for our common motherland,  Russia." Now, however, Nikolay Pavlov believes that the RNU  must be a movement of Russian citizens, the Russian people, and  that it must defend the interests of the Russian nation. Many  who spoke did not agree with him, in the light of which N.  Pavlov offered his resignation. However, the congress did not  accept it.    A far-reaching discussion was also conducted on the draft  program statement "The Russian Path," in which the basic aims in  the sphere of politics, economics, culture, and the social  sphere are defined, and it was again stressed that the RNU is  not purely a Russian movement but is open to representatives of  any nation and nationality living on Russian territory.    "I am satisfied with the Congress, although it did not pass  off completely smoothly," Sergey Baburin said when I requested a  comment on the results of the forum. "We adopted a decision to  reform the sociopolitical movement into a political party --  that is, to effect a reorganization, and to strengthen the party  principles of the RNU. Together with this, I consider it to be  of major importance that we should preserve the opportunity for  RNU members to participate in other political parties and social  organizations whose programs do not contradict our political  views. Obviously, the criticism directed at our friends and  allies was just -- I am thinking of the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the  Agrarian Party, and others. After all, if all they receive is  praise, if we do not criticize, how can they find their bearings?    "I was also pleased that the congress participants  approached  the question of our political line and priorities in the  political program very seriously. We adopted the program  statement `The Russian Path' as a basis for further work and we  hope that regional organizations will work earnestly on the  provisions of the program, which we hope to adopt in November  1994. Prior to the registration of our amended rules by the  Ministry of Justice, we will be guided by the existing rules,  but we will try to keep the transition period -- from movement  to party -- down to a minimum. As for Nikolay Pavlov's  resignation, the congress rejected it unanimously, and we  declared that Pavlov is destined to gain victory together with  and as part of the RNU."</p>

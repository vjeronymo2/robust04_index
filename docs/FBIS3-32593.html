Marcos is the main military strategist and spokesperson for the  Zapatists, who took up arms in the southern state of Chiapas on  1 January.    "If the electoral system is not revolutionized, regardless  of  whether the Zapatists exist or whether they annihilate us, the  country will rise up," the mysterious rebel leader said in an  interview published today by the newspaper LA JORNADA.    During the interview held somewhere in the Lacandona Jungle,  the EZLN spokesperson, whose identity is concealed by the  classic ski cap worn by the Chiapas rebels, insisted on the need  for guaranteeing democratic elections in Mexico.    "They can negotiate peace in Chiapas in February, but by  June  the country will have another revolt," Marcos said, stressing  the need for political reforms that will prevent the Mexican  Government from controlling the presidential elections scheduled  for 21 August.    The rebel subcommander described the current moment on the  eve of the first direct meeting between Manuel Camacho Solis,  the government's peace commissioner, and the EZLN as being  between a "monologue disguised as a dialogue" and a "potential  war conflict."    "The war is not actual but latent. It could break out at any  moment," the EZLN leader said, explaining that this is why the  EZLN cannot give up its arms.    Marcos said the Mexican Government is handling the dialogue  process as an ultimatum to the guerrillas because it "is  preparing the political conditions for a large-scale military  operation."    In spite of this, Subcommander Marcos expressed his  confidence that the guerrillas can achieve important political  results in their negotiations with the government.    He said that some 15 rebels of the EZLN and of the so-called  Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command, the  main organization of the EZLN, will attend the dialogue with  Camacho Solis. The site of the meeting is not yet known, but  the meeting is supposed to begin this week.    The guerrilla leader said the role of the media was decisive  in making the quick transition from the 12-day war to the  dialogue, for which he admitted the EZLN was unprepared.    "We were prepared for a long war of attrition, of military  clashes, of political disputes over towns, of ideological  struggle, and for a possible dialogue later, once the government  agreed," Marcos stated.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow surges on rise in discount rate Wall Street Blue chip stocks surged yesterday afternoon after the Federal Reserve announced an aggressive tightening of monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 49.11 higher at 3,720.61, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 4.88 at 449.37. Activity on the New York SE was brisk, with trading volume reaching 311.7m shares, while rising issues outnumbered declines by 1,344 to 827. The secondary market indices closed with little net change, however. The American SE composite was up 0.30 at 431.98, while the Nasdaq composite finished 0.39 off at 711.52 after recovering from a solid loss earlier in the session. It was a quiet but restless morning on Wall Street, with the afternoon expected to bring a move by the central bank to lift short-term interest rates for a fourth time since early February. Although few were willing to make big bets under the circumstances, the overall tone was generally positive. The Dow blue chip index held modest gains throughout the morning, even though higher rates could lead to a flagging economy and slower growth in corporate earnings during the rest of the year. Indeed, most investors feared a slight increase in rates more than a bold one. The uncertainty hanging over the markets since the Fed began its gradual shift to tighter money has depressed share prices at least as much as the expected impact of more restrictive policy as the year progressed. In the event, the Fed acted boldly, lifting both the discount rate and its Fed Funds target rate by 50 basis points each. In doing so, the central bank said it had achieved its goal of moving policy to a neutral position, after last year's 'accommodation'. Its announcement suggested that the latest Fed action would be the last in the current series, which began in early February. The response in the bond market was rousing, with prices on the long end of the maturity range showing powerful advances. Stocks responded in kind, especially those which are expected to benefit the most from the current economic recovery. Alcoa advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 1/2 and International Business Machines jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 61 1/4 . Caterpillar was Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 111 3/8 , while Deere appreciated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 72 1/4 . McDonald's climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 60 1/4 and Procter &amp; Gamble put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 56 7/8 . The retailing sector was active as several leading chains reported their quarterly results. JC Penney weakened Dollars 1 to Dollars 50 7/8 after disappointing the market with net income of 84 cents a share, compared with 78 cents a year ago. By contrast, Dayton Hudson moved forward Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 80 3/4 on a 37 per cent improvement in earnings. Home Depot, a building supply retailer, climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 42 5/8 after issuing its results. Technology issues, except IBM, were generally weaker. Hewlett Packard dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 75 1/2 , in spite of reporting a 25 per cent increase in orders. Micron Technology was marked down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 30 3/8 and National Semiconductor closed Dollars  7/8 easier at Dollars 17 1/2 . The early retreat on the Nasdaq was led by Lotus Development. The computer software concern plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 51 3/4 amid speculation, denied by the company, that its inventory levels had risen.</p>

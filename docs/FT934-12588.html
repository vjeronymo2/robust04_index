			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Observer: Rebels and heroes Mikhail Poltoranin, head of Russia's Federal Information Service, says he was never in favour of censorship. Yesterday, he was certainly giving pretty free rein to his own version of what happened a month ago in Moscow. Poltoranin claimed that he had known a day in advance that there was to be a parliamentary rebellion. He therefore warned Victor Yerin, the interior minister, to make sure that the television station was properly guarded. But he was told, he says, not to worry: 'We've got our own disguised people inside.' Sure enough, the next day the rebels stormed the TV tower, in a battle which cost several lives. They were 'provoked' into doing so by the fact that it was not visibly defended, claims Poltoranin. And, he says, censorship was imposed on the press afterwards in an attempt to suppress the truth about the incompetence of the security forces. Indeed, Poltoranin continued, he had seen a decree one week before the rebellion, which planned for emergency rule and censorship, but had managed to get the reference to censorship removed. When censorship was imposed despite his heroic gesture, Poltoranin further claims that it was his telephone calls that persuaded President Yeltsin to order its immediate lifting. Proof, if such were needed, that chaos rules at the top, and that presidential rule gives the president's aides plenty of room to pass the buck. And what happened to Yerin the Unready? He was subsequently rewarded with a medal making him a Hero of Russia.</p>

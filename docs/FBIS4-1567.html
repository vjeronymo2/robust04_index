			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- The task force in  charge of government affairs under the Preliminary Working  Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region [SAR] held its sixth meeting in  Beijing on 29 and 30 march, in which it discussed several issues  of concern to Hong Kong's public servants. Committee members  maintained: It is necessary to offer explanations to dispel  doubts currently harbored by public servants. Public servants  in Hong Kong are encouraged to keep relaying their problems to  the committee. As usual, the task force will pay close  attention to their problems.    The following are answers offered by the PWC's task force in  charge of government affairs on several issues of concern to  Hong Kong's public servants:    [Question] Will Hong Kong's public servants be "completely  replaced" in 1997?    [Answer] No. Article 10 of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law  explicitly states: Public servants serving in all Hong Kong  government departments, including the police department, before  the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, may all remain in  employment. This means public servants serving under the Hong  Kong Government before 1 July 1997 may continue their service  with the Hong Kong SAR Government after that date.    Hong Kong's current achievements are inextricably linked  with  a highly qualified pool of public servants and an effective  public service system. Members on the task force unanimously  and fully affirmed the contributions made by Hong Kong's public  servants to stability and prosperity in Hong Kong society.  Maintaining the stability and continuity of the ranks of public  servants in Hong Kong before and after 1997 is an important  aspect of Hong Kong's smooth transition. Committee members  sincerely hope that public servants currently serving in all  Hong Kong government departments will be able to work without  any worries and continue to serve the Hong Kong SAR Government  and the Hong Kong people after 1997.    [Question] Is there any basis to the statement that  "accounts  will be settled afterward"?    [Answer] No. Public servants working in Hong Kong government  departments before 1 July 1997 perform their official duties in  accordance with Hong Kong's laws, regardless of what government  departments they serve and whether their work is politically  sensitive. When they continue their service with the Hong Kong  SAR Government after 1 July 1997, they will also perform their  official duties in accordance with the law. Moreover, after  1997 the Hong Kong SAR Government will maintain Hong Kong's  original system for hiring and disciplining public servants, as  well as its special bodies, on which basis it will exercise  management over public servants. Therefore, it is simply  impossible to "settle accounts afterward," politically or  institutionally.    [Question] Will public servants in Hong Kong be accountable  to various central people's government departments after 1997?    [Answer] The second paragraph of Article 99 of the Basic Law  states: Public servants must be dedicated to their duties and  be responsible to the Hong Kong SAR Government. This explicitly  specifies to whom Hong Kong's public servants must be  "accountable" after 1 July 1997. To be sure, the Hong Kong SAR  Government, as a local government directly under the central  people's government, should be accountable to the latter. This  applies only to the Hong Kong SAR Government as a whole. This  relationship of accountability will be reflected through the way  the chief executive is accountable to the central people's  government. Article 43 of the Basic Law provides for this  accountability. Article 22 of the Basic Law states: No  department of the central people's government and no province,  autonomous region, or municipality directly under the central  government may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong SAR  administers on its own in accordance with this law. Therefore,  the question of accountability to various central people's  government departments does not exist for the work carried out  by departments under the Hong Kong SAR Government.    [Question] Will public servants in Hong Kong be able to  retain their posts after 1997?    [Answer] Public servants working for the Hong Kong  Government on 1 July 1997 will, in general, be able to retain  their posts. Principal officials, however, will be nominated by  the Chief Executive and referred to the Central People's  Government for appointment in accordance with the provisions of  the Basic Law. The appointment and promotion of public servants  in the Hong Kong SAR after 1 July 1997 will be on the basis of  the qualifications, experience, and ability of public servants  themselves in accordance with the provisions of Article 103 of  the Basic Law; and will be not different from the current  appointment and promotion of public servants in Hong Kong.    [Question] Will foreign nationals be allowed to serve in  government departments after 1997?    [Answer] Certainly. According to the stipulations in  Article 101 of the Basic Law, except for principal officials,  foreign nationals can be employed by government departments at  various levels. However, they must be a permanent resident of  Hong Kong, or must already serve in the Hong Kong Government  before 1997.    [Question] Are public servants in Hong Kong required to  speak Mandarin and write in Chinese after 1997?    [Answer] Article 9 of the Basic Law stipulates: In addition  to the Chinese Language, the English Language may also be used  by the executive authorities, legislature and judicial organs of  the Hong Kong SAR; English is also an official language. Hence,  knowledge of Mandarin and Chinese writing is not the  prerequisite for serving in the Hong Kong SAR Government;  however, it can help promote exchange and communication with  various departments in the hintherland.    [Question] What are the posts that will be excluded from  foreign nationals or people with right of residence in foreign  countries after 1997?    [Answer] Very few posts will be excluded from foreign  nationals or people with right of residence in foreign countries  after 1997. According to the provisions of Articles 60 and 101  of the Basic Law, they are secretary and deputy secretaries of  the Department of Administration, the Department of Finance, and  the Department of Justice; directors of bureaus; the  commissioner against corruption; the director of audit; the  commissioner of police; the commissioner of immigration; and the  inspector general of customs and excise. Also, chief justices  of the Court of Final Appeal and the High Court will also be  excluded from foreign nationals or people with right of  residence in foreign countries.    [Question] Will Hong Kong's existing system of recruitment,  employment, assessment, discipline, training, and management for  public service be maintained after 1997?    [Answer] Article 103 of the Basic Law clearly stipulates  that Hong Kong's previous system of recruitment, employment,  assessment, discipline, training, and management for public  service, shall be maintained, except for any provisions for  privileged treatment of foreign nationals.    [Question] Will the Public Service Employment Committee's  standing committees in charge of public servants' pay and  conditions of service continue to exist after 1997?    [Answer] According to the provisions of Article 103 of the  Basic Law, Hong Kong's previous system of recruitment,  employment, assessment, discipline, training, and management for  the public service, including special bodies for their  appointment, pay, and conditions of serivce, shall be  maintained, except for any provisions for privileged treatment  of foreign nationals. Therefore, the Public Service Employment  Committee and special bodies for pay and conditions of service  of public servants -- including the standing committee for chief  executives' pay and conditions of service, the standing  committee for judicial personnel' pay and conditions of service,  and the standing committee for public servants' pay and  conditions of service -- can continue to exist after 1997 to  perform their duties related to recruitment, promotion, pay, and  conditions of service of public servants.    [Question] Will the salaries, allowances, benefits, and  conditions of service for Hong Kong's public servants be less  favorable after 1997?    [Answer] No. Article 100 of the Basic Law explicitly states  that public servants serving in all Hong Kong Government  departments before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR may  retain their seniority, with pay, allowances, benefits, and  conditions of service no less favorable than before, if they  remain in employment. Article 102 states that the Hong Kong SAR  Government will pay to public servants who retire or leave the  service in compliance with regulations (including those who have  retired or left the service in compliance with regulations  before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR), or to their  dependents, all pensions, gratuities, allowances, and benefits  due them on terms no less favorable than before.    [Question] Does the task force in charge of government  affairs actively support the creation of a long-term wage fund  for public servants?    [Answer] Article 102 of the Basic Law explicitly addresses  the benefits for public servants who retire or leave service in  compliance with regulations: that is, the SAR Government will  pay them or their dependents all pensions, gratuities,  allowances, and benefits due them on terms no less favorable  than before. Retirement pensions for public servants after 1997  are evidently guaranteed by law. Judging by Hong Kong's current  financial status and economic prospects, there should be no  problem paying retirement pensions to public servants in the  future.    Committee members understand that Hong Kong's public  servants  are concerned and worried about their retirement pensions. They  support the demand for creating a long-term wage fund for public  servants. It is hoped that the British Hong Kong Government will  take active and practical measures in this regard.    [Question] How will you treat public servants who have  gained  resident rights in Britain under the "Plan for Granting Resident  Rights in Britain?"    [Answer] The Chinese Government's solemn stand against the  "Plan for Granting Resident Rights in Britain" is intended to  deal with the British Government's intentional violation of the  Joint Declaration, as well as its political schemes; it is not  targeted at individuals who have "gained resident rights in  Britain." Public servants who have gained "resident rights in  Britain" may continue their service with the Hong Kong SAR  Government after 1997. However, the Chinese Government will not  recognize their status as so-called "British citizens." In  addition, they will not enjoy Britain's consular protection in  the Hong Kong SAR and in other parts of China. Moreover,  according to relevant provisions in the Basic Law, they will not  be allowed to serve as leading officials in the Hong Kong SAR  Government, which is also true of foreign nationals, because  they have gained resident rights in a foreign country.    [Question] Is it true that the "Chinese Armed Police Force  will assume the Hong Kong police's functions after 1997"?    [Answer] This statement is groundless. According to relevant  provisions in the Basic Law, the SAR Government will be  responsible for law and order in the Hong Kong SAR. The Chinese  Armed Police Force will not be sent to Hong Kong after 1997.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> AMERICA IS FREE TO GO HOME;  </P> <P> A SOVIET-GERMAN MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR U.S. ROLE IN  EUROPE.  </P> <P> From the time he was appointed general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party,  Mikhail S. Gorbachev has had three principal goals vis-a-vis the West: to  prevent the resurgence of a German threat in the heart of Europe, to break the  Soviet Union out of its technological and economic isolation and to eliminate a  major U.S. presence in Europe.  </P> <P> If Gorbachev stays in power, he has a good chance of achieving all three in  this current season of change and reconfiguration in Europe.  </P> <P> For such success -- if he achieves it -- he will be beholden not only to his  own undoubted ability but, above all, to the extraordinary diplomatic skill and  activity of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his foreign minister,  Hans-Dietrich Genscher. For their trouble, they will also have achieved a  united, sovereign Germany and left the Soviets, the French and the Americans  each feeling that the country whose interest most closely coincides with their  own is Germany.  </P> <P> It promises to be a stunning achievement for both Gorbachev and Kohl.  </P> <P> Soviet officials have made no secret of their fear of resurgent German power.  What a surprise, then, to hear Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze say,  as he did a few months ago, that the security of Europe is better served by the  reunification of Germany than by its division, providing that it takes place in  the context of an appropriate pan-European settlement.  </P> <P> The European settlement that Gorbachev has had in mind is one that would  "overcome" the division of Europe into blocs and hostile alliances; would  integrate the Soviet Union and the East into a common European family; would  give the Soviet economy access to Western technology and financial assistance  and, of course, would almost as a byproduct eliminate a significant U.S. role  in Europe.  </P> <P> It is not wholly clear at what point Gorbachev realized, as Shevardnadze put  it, "it is necessary to utilize in depth the potential of a German-Soviet  economic cooperation." By the time the Soviets understood that the Germans  could help solve their economic problems, the Germans had already understood  that there would be no reunification without Soviet support. A marriage of  convenience was negotiated that promises to help both partners achieve their  hearts' desires.  </P> <P> Kohl and Genscher made themselves representatives of increased Soviet inclusion  in international arenas. In addition, Bonn offered financial assistance highly  favorable to Moscow. It guaranteed a $3 billion credit for the Soviet Union and  agreed that East Germany would pay approximately $750 million toward the cost  of supporting 360,000 Soviet troops and their families in East Germany in the  last six months of 1990, providing Moscow hard currency at a highly subsidized  rate.  </P> <P> Now Kohl, with French President Francois Mitterrand, has sponsored a proposal  for $15 billion in Western aid to the Soviets. Next week, Kohl will travel to  Moscow to report to Gorbachev on progress so far and to appeal for the Soviets  to drop opposition to German membership in NATO -- which the United States and  Western Europeans want as their price for supporting German reunification.  </P> <P> But the Soviets' price is likely to be high and some of its terms may be  ultimately incompatible with meaningful German membership in a meaningful NATO.  </P> <P> Mitterrand has been a willing and active participant in the Gorbachev-Kohl  policy. His own quasi-Gaullist vision of a stable Europe without the blocs  coincides with Gorbachev's in some crucial ways. They also share a barely  articulated desire to reduce the role of the United States and NATO in Europe  and to enhance the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.  </P> <P> Like Gorbachev, Mitterrand looks toward a Europe for the Europeans.  </P> <P> The desired American contribution to the Gorbachev-Kohl design is now clear --  it is for economic aid and a "flexible" policy toward NATO. Where the Bush  Administration will come out is not yet clear. My own sense is that a  meaningful long-term role for NATO will not survive the current reconfiguration  of Europe -- if present trends in the Soviet Union continue -- and that Bush  cannot join Kohl and Mitterrand in a major financial aid program when the  Soviets are still spending nearly 20% of their gross national product on the  military.  </P> <P> But a "no" will not matter that much to the emergence of the new Europe.  </P> <P> Europe is once again absorbed with itself, creating its own complex  correlations of power. And America is free to go home.  </P></p>

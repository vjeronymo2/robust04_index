Congress mandated that NAS determine, to the extent possible, (1) whether there is a statistical association between the suspect diseases and herbicide exposure, taking into account the strength of the scientific evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to detect the association; (2) the increased risk of disease among individuals exposed to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era; and (3) whether there is a plausible biological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship between herbicide exposure and the suspect disease. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2 of Public Law 102&hyph;4 provides that whenever the Secretary determines, based on sound medical and scientific evidence, that a positive association (i.e., the credible evidence for the association is equal to or outweighs the credible evidence against the association) exists between exposure of humans to an herbicide agent (i.e., a chemical in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era) and a disease, the Secretary will publish regulations establishing presumptive service connection for that disease. If the Secretary determines that a presumption of service connection is not warranted, he will publish a notice of that determination, which includes an explanation of the scientific basis for that determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Public Law 102&hyph;4 does not define ``credible'', it does instruct the Secretary to ``take into consideration whether the results are statistically significant, are capable of replication, and withstand peer review.'' Simply comparing the number of studies which report a positive relative risk to the number of studies which report a negative relative risk for a particular condition is not a valid method for determining whether the weight of evidence overall supports a finding that there is or is not a positive association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent development of the particular condition. Because of differences in statistical significance, confidence levels, control for confounding factors, etc., some studies are clearly more credible than others, and the Secretary has given them more weight in evaluating the overall credibility of the evidence concerning specific diseases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing approximately 6,420 abstracts of scientific or medical articles and selecting approximately 230 epidemiologic studies for detailed analysis, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings, NAS issued a report, entitled ``Veterans and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam'', on July 27, 1993. The Secretary announced that same day that he had concluded that a positive association exists between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea tarda. Proposed regulations were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 28, 1993 (See 58 FR 50528&hyph;30). The Secretary also announced that VA would review the remaining findings in the NAS report to determine whether a positive association exists between herbicide exposure and any other conditions. That review has been completed and this notice, pursuant to Public Law 102&hyph;4, conveys the Secretary's determination that there is no positive association between herbicide exposure and prostate cancer, peripheral neuropathy, hepatobiliary cancers, bone cancers, female reproductive cancers, renal cancers, testicular cancer, leukemia, abnormal sperm parameters and infertility, cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, motor/coordination dysfunction, metabolic and digestive disorders, immune system disorders, circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders (other than lung cancer), nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer, skin cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, bladder cancer, brain tumors, and any other condition for which the Secretary has not specifically determined a presumption of service connection is warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

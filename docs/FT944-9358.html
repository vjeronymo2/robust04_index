			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Hualon accused over competition The Hualon Corporation of Taiwan has been accused of planning to go back on its pledge not to compete directly with European producers at its projected Belfast textiles plant. The British Apparel and Textile Confederation is appealing to the European Court against the European Commission's approval of Pounds 61m in government aid for the Pounds 157m project. Mr James McAdam, confederation chairman, told its annual convention that remarks by the company 'have strengthened the grounds of our appeal'. He said the commission's decision to approve the aid 'was based almost entirely on assurances, given by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board, that production from the plant would be high-volume goods of low added value to compete with low cost imports'. But he said the company had 'stated that the opposite is the case and that the output of the plant will be high added-value products competing directly with existing European production. This is in conflict with what the government has contended'. The confederation says the project makes poor use of taxpayers' money, and claims there is 20 per cent overcapacity in the European Union.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMPETITION DISAPPEARS AS LARSON COASTS TO SINGLE-HANDED SAILING TITLE  </P> <P> Coronado's David Houser trailed Morgan Larson by almost six points entering the  final day of the O'Day U.S. single-handed sailing championships. So Larson, a  sophomore at College of Charleston, knew he had better keep an eye on Houser.  </P> <P> But first, he had to find him.  </P> <P> "I kept looking for him so I could cover him, but he wasn't around," Larson  said.  </P> <P> Larson learned after the first of Thursday's three races that Houser had been  disqualified for running into another boat after the first lured mark. And his  misfortune virtually handed Larson the O'Day trophy.  </P> <P> With just two races remaining, Larson only had to finish one -- each competitor  is allowed to drop his lowest finish of the series. Still, Larson went on to  take fifth in Thursday's second race and second in the last of nine races.  </P> <P> He finished with 11.25 points, while Houser, a junior at Coronado High and at  16 the youngest of 14 competitors, took second with 22.25. Three-quarters of a  point was given for first in each race, then two for second, three for third  and so on, with the low total winning. Each race covered an approximate  distance of 2.25 miles.  </P> <P> Of the nine races, Larson's lowest finish was seventh in his second race. He  won three times, with three second-place finishes.  </P> <P> "In a long regatta like this, it's consistency that wins," Larson said. "I just  didn't make any big mistakes."  </P> <P> Instead, he left them for Houser.  </P> <P> "As I went around the lured mark, I just had too much speed going for me,"  Houser said. "I was watching somebody else, and I wasn't paying attention to  the guy in front of me. I thought, 'Oh no.' Because you can't clear yourself  here. You only get one chance."  </P> <P> Still, Houser said he was thankful for the chance.  </P> <P> "I knew I had to get two firsts and a second to win," he said. "It would have  been tough. But I'm happy with the way I sailed."  </P> <P> Larson, who captured the collegiate single-handed championships last year, said  familiarity helped him navigate the 14-foot Laser boats a little more easily.  </P> <P> And the big lead after six races didn't hurt either.  </P> <P> "I felt a little more comfortable," Larson said. "But then there's always the  chance you can screw up, and then you look really stupid. That's why my goal  was to sail my best race first, and after that I could coast."  </P> <P> Last year's champion, Charles Pucciarello of Pensacola, Fla., figured to be in  the hunt again. But he fouled out of five of nine races and finished 11th out  of 14. Jason Rucker, the youth champion from Bedford, Tex., ended up sixth  after being third heading into the final day.  </P> <P> Kim Logan of Miami, who attends Old Dominion, was third with 24 points.  </P></p>

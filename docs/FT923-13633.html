			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pitfalls of property letting - Tax problems for landlords THE RECESSION is forcing many debtors to consider alternative ways of increasing income and making their debts tax deductible. Letting a property or part of a property could be a solution. But be careful  -rules governing interest payments on loans taken out by individuals to acquire, improve and maintain property for letting are stringent and complex. First, the property must be in the UK or the Irish Republic. Next, be careful who you borrow money from. If you choose a non-UK lender you may have to deduct and pay the Inland Revenue 25 per cent tax on behalf of the lender. Always borrow via a loan and not via a bank overdraft. Interest payments on overdrafts are not tax deductible (unless you are trading); neither are interest payments on loans taken out to pay off the overdraft. Where money is borrowed by means of an overdraft as a temporary measure and repaid from a loan account, the Revenue will, by concession, allow the interest to be deducted if repaid within six months. Brooks, in the recent case of Brooks v Lawson, discovered this rule to his cost. He financed property improvements using bank overdrafts over a number of years before negotiating loan accounts with the bank. The Revenue refused to deduct his interest payments on either his overdraft or his loan accounts against his rental income. Brooks appealed. The court found in favour of the Revenue. This may seem harsh, but is nevertheless the law. If you decide not to borrow from a bank, ensure the loan can remain outstanding for more than a year. Short-term interest on non-bank borrowing is not tax deductible. If you get the right borrower and type of borrowings, interest payments could still be disallowed as a deduction if you do not borrow the money for a qualifying purpose. Basically, buying or improving property are qualifying purposes but repairs are not. The Inland Revenue has given some guidance on where it considers the dividing line to be. For example, it will regard underpinning, 'extensive repointing', pebble dashing, texture coating (but not painting) and stone cladding as improvements, but the replacement of a leaky roof or new guttering as repairs. Any interest payable on a loan taken out for repairs is not deductible from rents. So landlords are not encouraged to take out a loan to keep their properties in good repair. If substantial repairs are needed and you must fund them with a loan, it may be possible to get relief if you sell the property into a private trust or company. The property will then be in a new ownership and the interest payments on a loan taken out to do the repair work, will be treated as repairs attributable to a period before the estate or interest was acquired. They will then be treated as 'dilapidations' and become tax deductible. But, before rushing into a sale, take care that in so doing you do not trigger an even worse capital gains tax liability or stamp duty charge. Even with the right borrower and the right purpose for the loan, you still may not be able to deduct your interest payments from your rental income if the letting does not qualify. To qualify, the interest must be payable during any period of 52 weeks during which the property has been let for 26 weeks at a commercial rent. In theory, where interest is payable half-yearly, it should be possible to have a gap between lettings of 76 weeks without loss of interest relief. But it is not good to sail this close to the wind since in the current market you may not be able to find a tenant just when you want one. Nor can you be guaranteed that the tenant will occupy your property without a break to suit your tax plans. The key point is the date when the interest is payable, not when it is actually paid. If letting becomes a problem, you cannot just pay your interest late. You must renegotiate dates on which it becomes payable with your bank. If the property is not let during the period of 52 weeks, it must be available for letting or used as your main residence or undergoing works of construction or repair. It is not always possible to do substantial works within the time scale to suit your tax plans and, if your bank does not agree to an interest free holiday or to a re-arrangement of when your interest becomes payable, the cost of your building works may be increased by the grossed up amount of your interest payments. If you can arrange your finance and lettings so that interest payments can be deducted against the rental income, all the interest can be deducted regardless of the size of the loan. The relief is not restricted to the basic tax rate. If your interest payments exceed your net rental income, the loss cannot be set off against your other income, nor can it be carried back against any previous rental income you may have received and on which you have paid tax. Excess interest payments can only be set against net rents of other properties in the tax year in which the interest was payable, or in subsequent years. It is hardly surprising that the government is criticised for discouraging people from letting property and allowing it to fall into disrepair. Maybe now is the time to encourage, not discourage, the acquisition, improvement and maintenance of let property.

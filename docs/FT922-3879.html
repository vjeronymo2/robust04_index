			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Millers worried about supply of bread-making wheat BRITISH MILLERS fear they could be forced to import substantial amounts of bread-making wheat following the reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy. Simultaneously there is a danger that UK feed wheat exporters could lose the competitive advantage that has led to 4m tonnes of exports a year, according to the National Association of British and Irish Millers. 'We could be in the ludicrous position of UK millers importing bread making wheat while UK growers and merchants are unable to export feed wheat which has lost its competitive edge,' said Mr John Murray, director general of Nabim, yesterday. Bread-making wheat has declined to 20 per cent of the UK harvest. With a perfect harvest this almost meets the millers' requirements of about 3.2m tonnes. The attraction of growing UK bread-making wheat, which fetches a premium, has declined. Feed wheats give yields per hectare up to 15 per cent more than bread-making wheats but their guaranteed price in the intervention system is only 5 per cent lower. Outside Britain, support has been effective at a common wheat level because the yield differential between bread-making and feed wheat is less and favourable climatic conditions for quality grain are more predictable. The UK market has been supported at the feed wheat level. Nabim believes that following CAP reform, it is vital that intervention should be not be based on feed wheat alone - as many other parts of the UK cereal sector are arguing. If the EC goes for a feed-based support system there will be a strong incentive for farmers to go for high yield varieties, which will reduce the amount of UK bread making wheat grown while increasing the amount of feed wheat available for export. 'The wrong intervention system poses a considerable risk on both sides of the equation,' says Mr Murray.</p>

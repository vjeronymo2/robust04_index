			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Julio Riquelme: "People's Party Excluded From </F> Democratic Impetus"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Following lengthy talks that finally  proved fruitless, the government will go ahead with its  "democratic impetus" plan. It involves filling the vacancy for  an ombudsman -- a post that has been vacant for over a year --  and vacancies in the General Council of the Judiciary, the board  of directors of the Spanish Radio and Television Company, the  Nuclear Safety Council, and the Universities Council.    As Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, minister of the Prime Minister's  Office, announced following the cabinet meeting yesterday, there  is an agreement between the Socialist parliamentary group and  those of United Left, Convergence and Union, the Basque  Nationalist Party, the Canary Islands Coalition, and the mixed  group to present the Congress [of Deputies] in plenary session,  following the Easter Week break, with a number of parliamentary  initiatives winding up a lengthy series of talks in order to  complete the above-mentioned "impetus."    Last, the leading opposition group -- the People's Party --  is excluded from an agreement that, according to Perez  Rubalcaba, could no longer be postponed in order to prevent the  above-mentioned bodies' "institutional deterioration."

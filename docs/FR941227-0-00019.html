Law 103&hyph;354, 108 stat. 3178, October 13, 1994). The CFSA is establishing a regulation whereby under the procedures of the Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Program and the Outreach and Assistance Grants for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program, an 1890 Land Grant Institution or other eligible educational institution or community-based organization could enter into a cooperative or other agreement with CFSA to provide outreach, training, and technical assistance to small-scale farmers, especially members of socially disadvantaged groups. This action is necessary to implement the provisions in the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, title XXV, Section 2501 and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) appropriation acts which provide funding for this program. The intended effect of this action is to assist small farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers by making them aware of programs available through the USDA. In addition, this rule amends 7 CFR chapter XVIII to reflect the abolishment of the Farmers Home Administration and the Rural Development Administration and the establishment of the Rural Housing and Community Development Service, the Rural Business and Cooperative Development Service, the Rural Utilities Service, and the Consolidated Farm Service Agency in the recent Department of Agriculture reorganization.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interim rule effective December 27, 1994.

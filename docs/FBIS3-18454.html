Rajoy justified presenting this initiative on the ground  that  "a definition of the model of autonomy is necessary" in view of  the host of topics for debate, which require concluding a new  national agreement similar to the constitutional agreement.    The People's Party leader -- who presented the proposal  together with Secretary for the Autonomy Area Jorge Fernandez --  was very critical of the government's attitude in this issue,  "in which it must not be a bystander as it is," since the  silence "has not only been that of the minister of public  administration but also that of the prime minister himself." In  Rajoy's opinion, the People's Party proposal is important enough  "for it not to be dismissed by saying that it is simplistic."  The People's Party deputy secretary general emphasized that his  party's proposal gives the government an opportunity to tackle  the problem "with all the calm that it deems appropriate, but  with proper seriousness, because the only thing that is no  solution is to do nothing, as the government is doing."    With respect to the standardization of powers among the  autonomous communities, he stated that this does not mean that  they must all compulsorily assume all the powers defined as  transferable if they do not want them, but that they have the  opportunity to attain them. The People's Party is opposed to  "preferential political treatment" for certain communities,  "because the treatment can only be that resulting from the  existence of a distinctive feature which we acknowledge, but  that must entail not different but distinctive treatment."    In Rajoy's opinion, the phrase "cafe for everybody" is often  disparaged, "without taking into account the fact that the cafe  can take many forms, but what is not possible is to be left  without a cafe." With respect to the possibility of these  matters being tackled bilaterally between the central government  and each autonomous community, the People's Party deputy  secretary general stated that the pact should be between the  parties represented in parliament, "which are the ones  representing national sovereignty," and which include the  nationalist parties governing autonomous communities, but the  bilateral relationship, which will also have to be present in  the negotiations for the agreement, "should be conducted within  the framework of the model of the state laid down by the Cortes."    The differences between the Spanish Socialist Workers Party  and the People's Party became clear in many other issues  yesterday, with accusations and aspersions which conflict with  the atmosphere of understanding which has recently existed  between the two parties.

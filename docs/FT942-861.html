			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (4): Malign legacy resurfaces - Russia remains a militarised state The military accounts for some 2.1m men and women in Russia: police and paramilitary account for another 1m. Russia remains, as the Soviet Union was, a militarised state in which the ratio of men under arms exceeds that of most others. It is a reflection of the militarisation of a state which was geared to an aggressive - and defensive - posture vis a vis an encircling world. It is changed greatly: but the legacy of the huge defence machine is not swept away in an instant. This year, the third since Russia's independence, has seen that malign legacy of a communist state which regarded most others as potential enemies impose its imperatives upon the present in a particularly sharp form. The legacy is not just one of bases all over Russia and over much of the former Soviet Union: it is also one of an industry whose best plants were geared to produce weaponry, and whose best engineers, technicians and scientists were set to work on military output and research. The former Soviet war effort, hugely weakened but basically unreformed, now presents the struggling government of Russia with one of its greatest tests. This test may be divided into three parts: First, to redefine the role of the Russian military in the post-cold war world; Second, to restructure the armed forces; Third, to wean industry away from a dependence on military orders towards responding to the civilian market. The first of these has begun. Russia's military doctrine has been published  -itself a huge breakthrough - and although it contains some difficult passages as the right to intervene in conflicts affecting neighbouring states, it generally takes account of Russia's changed circumstances. However, it presents guidelines rather than describing what the military is actually doing: not surprisingly, for that is still evolving. Russia, as its leaders have often said in the past three years, has no enemies: even the intercontinental missiles - Russia still has 30,000 nuclear warheads - have been symbolically detargeted from the US and other Nato countries. However, it remains doubtful about co-operation with new friends - especially with Nato, for so long the closest antagonist to the Warsaw Pact military alliance which the Soviet Union dominated. Nato has proposed a Partnership for Peace, a loose grouping in which the former communist states would draw closer to their former antagonists, stage joint exercises but fall short of joining Nato itself. Russia seems likely to sign up in concert with most other former Soviet states, but only after long hesitation and with many reservations. Russia regards itself still as a superpower which, in nuclear terms, it certainly is; as a regional leader, which it also is; and as a country still liable to be isolated by surrounding states. Russian military tradition has emphasised, naturally, the vulnerability of the flat open spaces of western Russia to invasion. Now, with its borders closer to Moscow than they have been for centuries, Russia feels vulnerable, deprived of protection. It has attempted to solve this problem by making agreements with the neighbouring states to have their borders policed by Russia as well as native border guards. It has also intervened in Georgia - first on the side of the Abkhazian rebels - unofficially - and now as an officially sanctioned peacekeeping force. It retains an army in the Transdnestr area of Moldova to protect the Russian-speaking population there. Its troops shore up the regime in Tajikistan and guard its border with Afghanistan. And they hold bases in all republics which are members of the Confederation of Independent States, except Azerbaijan - and there they are pressing for at least one, as a condition of halting the Armenian advances in that country. The troops have, however, been withdrawn from Lithuania; agreements have been signed to withdraw from Latvia; and in Estonia, negotiations are proceeding with the target date for final withdrawal set at the end of August. The Russian general staff broadly accepts the need for change and has backed the Partnership for Peace. However, it has had to delay joint US-Russian exercises which should have taken place in Russia this month because of nationalist pressure, especially from parliamentary deputies. Decades of isolation and of regarding the west as an enemy have left deep marks. While co-operation continues, the limits of it have become much clearer this year. Though an agreement signed earlier this year between Russia and Ukraine under US auspices to bring the nuclear weapons from Ukraine to Russia is being observed, considerable worries remain over stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons in Russia - stockpiles which, western analysts fear, may not be wholly accounted for by the Russian authorities. Research may even be continuing unknown to these authorities or to which they are deliberately blind. The military remains a conscript force, although with a draft much reduced from Soviet times due to widespread evasion. Morale is said to be low in all services; budget cuts have limited exercises and the state of readiness is thought to be low. The official aim is a professional army, but the resources to transform it are lacking. This has meant a huge oversupply of officers and generals compared to other ranks while the officers remain very often badly housed and sporadically paid. Military industry has suffered in the past two years from very deep cuts in subsidies and orders: at the same time, military conversion has been limited. The current military budget for 1994, set at Rbs40,000bn, would make up about one third of total budget expenditure, but is still said by the top commanders to be too low to preserve the army in a reasonable condition. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, has lobbied vigorously for more resources and the struggle is not yet over. Politically the military remains hugely influential - especially after the October events of last year saw it intervene on the side of the president against the parliament. The need to preserve its loyalty may well dictate extra spending and will further delay necessary reforms. Its traditional loyalty and subservience to civilian leadership has not yet been broken, but the danger is greater than before. The positive side is that it has successfully and peacefully withdrawn from eastern Europe and, in doing so, from the Baltics. Its discipline has held and it is no longer automatically favoured by the authorities - indeed, in some respects it has suffered disproportionately. The challenge facing it over the next few years is to reshape itself into a force capable of guaranteeing national security, while regaining a spirit and an efficiency which would in turn ensure that it remained outside of politics.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Excerpt] The PLO Executive Committee will hold an  emergency meeting in Tunis on Thursday [20 January] to discuss  the results of the Syrian-U.S. summit, Palestinian participation  in the Washington talks, and the deteriorating situation in the  occupied territories.    In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, PLO Executive  Committee  member Yasir 'Amr said that this meeting has been proposed by  Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department.    'Amr indicated that in a telephone conversation with him  from  Tunis, Faruq Qaddumi stressed the importance of this meeting  under the current circumstances experienced by the Palestine  question and in light of the Israeli intransigence on the  implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement.    'Amr stressed the importance of  Palestinian-Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese coordination before going  to the 11th [as published] round of negotiations in Washington  on Monday.    The PLO Executive Committee member praised the results of  the  Syrian-U.S. Geneva summit. He denied that these results have  terrified the Palestinian side.    'Amr said: On the contrary, these results will help the  Palestinians and support their arguments before the Israeli  negotiator. He indicated that the concepts that President  al-Asad raised will obviously and directly help the Palestinian  track. He said that these concepts must be followed during the  interim and the final phases.    'Amr added that this summit has set a formula for resolving  the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East and specified the  concept of a durable peace, a peace that satisfies the parties  concerned and that is based on the resolutions of the  international legitimacy and the principle of trading territory  for peace.    'Amr described President al-Asad as a man of broad vision  with a brave pan-Arab position, a man who is aware of the future  and of the current changes. He noted that President al-Asad is  a man of a profound experience, and that he has placed Israel  before a difficult option if it wants to be part of the Middle  East. [passage omitted]</p>

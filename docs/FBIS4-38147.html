			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Another round of extended talks was held this  morning between the brother leader of the revolution and  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. [passage omitted]    JANA's correspondent in Sirte has reported that all aspects  of bilateral cooperation between the two fraternal countries as  well as other Arab and international topics of mutual interests  were reviewed at this round of talks.    He added that the meeting also dealt with the situation in  Yemen and the Egypt's role, which ought to protect Yemeni unity  and face up to the colonialist schemes aimed at creating schism  and weakening the Arab nation, beginning with Yemen and followed  by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, and the rest of Arab countries.  In this respect, Egypt's leading role in the Arab homeland and  in the world, given Egypt's weight, civilization, and huge  sacrifices for Yemen in the sixties, was stressed.    As for Egypt's pan-Arab role, it was reiterated that the  Israeli schemes were aiming at harming Egypt, because the  program of the Zionist movement was aimed at establishing the  so-called state of Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates.    As far as the Lockerbie problem was concerned, it was  asserted that concocting such a problem was aimed at keeping  Egypt busy with secondary issues and distracting it from playing  its pan-Arab role.</p>

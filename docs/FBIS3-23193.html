(0130 GMT) and only  the captain and his co-pilot remained on board, the [Saudi  Airlines] spokesman said. The passengers, almost all of whom  were Ethiopian, were safe, he said.    There were thought to be three or four hijackers, according  to the spokesman. He said airport officials were negotiating  with the hijackers, but gave no official details on their  demands. But an unofficial source at Jomo Kenyatta Airport said  the hijackers were demanding to fly to Italy and told airport  officials to re-fuel the plan. The Saudi ambassador to Nairobi  had rushed to the scene, the Saudi Embassy here said, but gave  no other information.</p>

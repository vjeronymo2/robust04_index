			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Norwegian fiscal measures Norway yesterday unveiled adjustments to its 1993 fiscal budget which pushed the deficit to a record NKr53.9bn (Pounds 5.1bn), up from December's forecast deficit of NKr51.4bn, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The minority Labour government also announced plans gradually to reprivatise the commercial banks in 1994, beginning with wholly state-owned Christiania Bank, the country's second biggest bank. The finance ministry said the state-backed bank insurance and investment funds would issue a limited number of shares in Christiania this autumn in order to establish an indicative price level in the stock market ahead of gradual reprivatisation next year. In presenting the budget, the finance ministry said the deficit, excluding revenue from North Sea oil and gas, would widen to NKr77.1bn from its December forecast of NKr76.6bn. Norway's overall borrowing requirement will expand to NKr93.7bn from NKr88.2bn seen in December, and NKr55.7bn in 1992, the ministry said. Although the government sees signs of economic recovery, it forecast that gross domestic product growth would slow to 0.8 per cent in 1993 from 1.0 per cent predicted in December.</p>

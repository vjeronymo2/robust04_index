			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Sport: Butch courts Miami and wins again - Tennis which is why Butch Buchholz, Tournament Chairman of the Dollars 2.8m (Pounds 1.6m) Lipton International Players Championships at Key Biscayne, is the toast of South Florida. He has a success on his hands that has benefitted the entire greater Miami area and he is understandably proud of it. It seems a lifetime ago that I sat on the Centre Court at Wimbledon on a sweltering afternoon in 1960 watching Butch as he writhed in agony with an ankle injury that forced him to retire to Neale Fraser, the eventual champion, after holding eight match points in their gruelling quarter-final match. Butch recovered from that setback and turned professional the next year. When his playing days were over, he set about learning the business of tournament promotion before spending four years as the Executive Director of the Association of Tennis Professionals. Today the jet black hair is streaked with grey, the 51-year-old figure is a little fuller, but there is the same determination in the friendly gaze. Determination is a quality that Butch has needed these past seven years. In February 1985 his brave venture to stage a two-week tournament in partnership with the ATP and the Women's International Tennis Association (WITA) began at the elegant but unfinished Laver Racket Club in Delray Beach. That first Lipton, beset with financial problems and cursed with cold winds and rain, nevertheless attracted nearly 123,000 spectators as Tim Mayotte and Martina Navratilova became its champions. The following year the tournament moved along the coast to Boca West and 193,000 attended the matches to see local heroine Chris Evert beat a young Steffi Graf and waited patiently while Ivan Lendl wore down Mats Wilander in a rain-interrupted match that took two days. But more financial difficulties meant that the ill-starred event had to move again in 1987. 'That was a nightmare period,' remembers Buchholz. I had to find a new site in no time flat and I went to Miami to talk to the officials at Dade County. They showed me three or four sites, none of which seemed right, and in exasperation said: 'Well, there's just one more - though you won't like it'. 'They drove me over the Rickenbacker Causeway towards Key Biscayne and as we swooped down off the bridge towards the island with its private atmosphere and semi-tropical vegetation I knew it was right. It had the special ambience that made it different. But when we arrived at the proposed site I could understand their reservations. It was a huge rubbish dump, old cars and refrigerators among the garbage, and we had to hold our noses as we looked it over.' The aroma that assails you today as you stroll through the avenue of maturing royal palms and orchid trees, bordered by flower beds bursting with gorgeous blooms of impatiens, bougainvillaea and hibiscus, is different. Wherever you turn in this tastefully tented site that caters to every gastronomic whim and purchasing impulse, there is the smell of success. Not that the move to Miami and the full commitment of Dade County to further development ended the problems. Far from it, as Buchholz remembers. 'In 1988 the ATP announced their breakaway from the Pro Council and, despite our long-term contract, they said I would have to reduce the tournament to 10 days and bid for the time slot like everyone else. That made Lipton nervous. They had invested in a two week event and told me that our 31-year agreement was at risk if we made the change.' The problems were solved and the tournament is now a 10-day event. It is a family business run by a strong team in which Butch's brother Cliff is the tournament director. His 22-year-old son Trey is the operations manager with an annual budget of Dollars 2m. The event has become a fixture in the tennis calendar and a popular venue for aficionados from all over the world. 'Amazingly, 46 per cent of our spectators come from outside the three counties of Dade, Palm Beach and Broward. Many come up from South America, combining their holiday and shopping expedition with a visit to the tournament.' Some 25 sponsors invest between Dollars 80,000 and Dollars 3m each year towards the Dollars 10m that it costs to stage the event. All of them are excited about the latest expansion plans which include a state-of-the-art stadium, seating 14,000 and costing Dollars 20.5m, which will be completed for next year's event, having overcome the inevitable local objections. 'It is being financed by Dade County,' said Buchholz. 'We will pay a minimum rent of Dollars 500,000 (a year) against 10 per cent of the gross over the next 30 years and I shall be surprised if we do not pay it back twice over.' 'The really exciting thing is that in the first two days of opening the sales office we had sold over Dollars 1m of box seats.' The USTA has designated the site a Player Development Centre. Buchholz has added eight clay courts and will soon start to prepare the three grass courts that will sit comfortably alongside the 17 hard courts that the tournament needs. Like the people of Miami, the USTA knows it is backing a winner.</p>

The minister of defence and security of Indonesia at a press  conference on March 24 said Indonesia would make positive  efforts to see the aggravated situation of the Korean peninsula  solved peacefully, not develop into an armed conflict. He added  that Indonesia would support the efforts of all sides concerned  to avoid confrontation and find a peaceful solution of the  nuclear issue.    In a joint statement published on March 26, seven members of  the State Duma of Russia including V. Ilyukhin, chairman of the  Security Committee of the State Duma who is member of the  Federal Communist Party of Russia, said some quarters of the  United States were again straining the situation by raising new  unreasonable conditions. They urged that all measures should be  taken to continue the talks to maintain peace on the Korean  peninsula, instead of resorting to pressure with strength.    Anzuluni Bembe, first vice-president of the Transitional  National Parliament of Zaire-the higher council of the Republic,  held that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be  settled in a peaceful way.    Thomas Ronstrom, co-chairman of the Nordic Cooperation  Committee for Friendship and Solidarity With the Korean People,  in a statement March 23 said inconsistent reports spread by the  western media show their partiality against the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, and it is an act of blindly  following only the false argument of the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA].    Alexandru Mica, chairman of the Romanian Promoting Committee  for Supporting the Reunification of Korea, and Faustin Justin  Zabe, national first secretary of the youth of the Congolese  Socialist Party, in their solidarity messages, and Jose  Fanequico Lissane, executive secretary of the Mozambican  Committee for Friendship With the People of the DPRK, in a  statement stressed that the United States and some quarters of  the IAEA Secretariat should apologize for their diabolic crimes  against the Korean people and mankind and observe the principle  of impartiality.</p>

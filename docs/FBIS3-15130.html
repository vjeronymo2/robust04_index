In the Finance Ministry's estimate, by the end of the year  the budget deficit will go down to 10.2% of the gross  domestic  product.    The federal budget's revenues will be 7 times greater than  last year, the basic sources of revenues being taxes, whose  share in the gross domestic product will amount to 12.7%  compared to 10.3% in 1993.    Hard-currency revenues and foreign-trade payments are  estimated at $6.1 Bn [Billion]. The basic sources of  hard-currency revenue are export and import duties and income  gained from the centralized credit.    Spending is estimated at 25.1% of the gross domestic  product, compared to 21.0% in 1993. Financial support for  the  territories will represent the biggest spending item  (13.4%).  The growing financial support for the territories is due to a  new system of relations between the federal budget and the  budgets of Russia's constituent members. Expenditures for the  repayment and servicing of the state debt will also increase to  10.5%.    The share of defense spending will practically not change --  37126.0 Bn rubles (20.4% of total expenditures).    Spending on social, cultural and research programs will  amount to 2.2% of the gross domestic product. Compared to  1993, the federal spending on social and research programs will  increase 3.6 times.    The report also contains the main indices for 1993. Last  year's spending stood at 34.1 Tn rubles (75.1% of the  adjusted  budget).    By January 1, 1994 the state budget deficit amounted to 17  Tn  rubles (10.5% of the gross domestic product). The deficit  was  covered at the expense of the gold and hard-currency reserve  (5.1 Tn rubles).    Due to nonpayment of taxes and other payments to the state,  the spending items had to be reduced by 8.5 Tn rubles.    The report says that for the first time in many years there  was a growth of the population's real incomes. The average  income grew about 11 times while prices rose 9.4 times. This is  proved by the wage and salary increases in dollar terms. The  average salary grew 3 times and stands at about $100.</p>

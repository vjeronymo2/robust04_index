			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- China's first labor  law is now under formulation and is expected to be enacted this  year.    Xue Zhaoyun, vice-chairwoman of the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions (ACFTU), told a press conference here today that  the draft labor law prepared by the Labor Ministry, the State  Council's Legislative Affairs Bureau and ACFTU, has been  approved by the State Council and has been submitted to the  National People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation.    If the law is passed, it will be China's first labor law,  designed to standardize labor relations in an "all-round  manner," Xue said.    The union leader noted that "brand new" labor relations are  emerging in China to meet the needs of building a socialist  market economy. And the law is expected to effectively protect  the legitimate rights and interests of both employees and  employer.</p>

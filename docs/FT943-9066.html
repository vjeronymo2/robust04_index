			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Why the players complain it just ain't cricket: The strike could wipe out America's baseball season Thursday night in Baltimore was fit for the end of the world or the baseball season, whichever matters most. With thunder and lightning offstage, the downpour began gently enough ('English rain,' said the man in the seat behind), but soon assumed biblical proportions. The Baltimore Orioles and the Boston Red Sox struggled into the third inning before the umps called for the tarp and nearly three hours later they called it a night. There was no 'make-up' game yesterday. In fact no major league baseball was played anywhere in America yesterday, nor may it be for the foreseeable future. After Thursday night's finale and with 50 days still to go in the regular season, 672 professional players from 28 teams walked out on strike. It is quite possible that no World Series, the ultimate championship, will take place in October, the first such gap in the peacetime autumnal calendar since 1905. This is the eighth labour dispute in America's national sport in the last 22 years and undoubtedly the most serious since 1981, when nearly two months were lost in mid-season. Though it has been coming a long time - the players and owners have had no contract since last year - it casts a long pall. A season that had more than its usual share of magic on the field has been cut short. The dispute pits two so far immovable forces - 28 team owners versus a players' association (union). The owners, probably the only cartel in America with congressional exemption from the antitrust laws, claim the financial stability of the sport is in jeopardy; the players, with many hard-won contractual victories under their spikes, suspect the owners want to reinstate labour servitude. The strike is, of course, all about money but, because it is baseball, the most subtle of all sports, it is much more complicated than mere player pay. This one is essentially about a concept known as the 'salary cap', already in use in American football and basketball. The ceiling is not on the individual contract but on total team payroll. If a superstar is paid a fortune, then savings have to be made elsewhere on the playing roster. The idea stems from the desire of the owners to reach a different revenue-sharing agreement with the players from the 50-50 split in effect under the expired contract. The owners contend that as many as half the teams now operate at a loss, but since no team books are open for inspection this is impossible to verify. Cynics point out that, if even a smallish franchise can change hands for Dollars 125m, as the Seattle Mariners did in 1992, it is unlikely to be a money loser. What the owners have never been able to do is agree how to iron out the revenue differences between big city teams with vast TV revenues, like Ted Turner's Atlanta Braves, which are able to afford a Dollars 54m a year payroll, and those pushed to find even a third of that sum. Ironically, the team with the best playing record this year, the Montreal Expos, has only an Dollars 18.5m payroll, the second lowest after the Dollars 15.5m of the San Diego Padres. The players argue that they should not be forced to suffer from the owners' inability to settle their own problems. But public sympathy is not exactly with the men who play the game. The average major league salary now stands at Dollars 1.2m a year, nearly a tenfold increase in the last 14 years. The fact that Bobby Bonilla of the New York Mets stands to lose Dollars 31,148 per day's work does not exactly cause the suffering faithful at Shea Stadium to weep buckets, given their own take-home pay. There might be more feeling for those on the annual minimum wage (Dollars 109,000), though many of them have been sent down to the minor leagues to keep playing - and to be paid for it. But economists are urging the players to stand fast. Henry Aaron (of the Brookings Institution, not the Henry Aaron who hit 755 home runs) wrote this week that the owners' plan was nakedly designed to increase team revenues at the expense of salaries without guaranteeing that profits would be distributed among the poorer teams. Baseball, he concluded, 'is financially and competitively alive and well'. It is in fact only a medium-sized business. Its estimated annual revenues of about Dollars 2bn put it on a par with, for example, Dell Computer and the New York Times. The strike will mostly hit local economies (about 2,000 are employed directly and indirectly whenever the Orioles play at home), but will not exactly be a factor in Fed monetary policies. Still, baseball was on a roll, with this year's attendance projected at 70m. Marvellous new stadiums in Baltimore, Cleveland, Chicago and Arlington in Texas and popular new teams in Colorado and Florida have attracted vast crowds (an Orioles ticket is like gold dust) and done much to revitalise decaying downtowns. Above all, this season had threatened to be one for the ages. All the six realigned divisions have been competitive, even if the two in the west have competed mostly to be awful. Individual records were under serious attack, like the 61 home runs hit by Roger Maris in 1961. Perhaps the juiced-up baseball has been a factor but, as of Thursday night, Matt Williams of San Francisco, with 43 dingers, was exactly on Maris's pace, with Griffey, Thomas, Bonds and Belle not far behind. Tony Gwynn of San Diego was batting .394 with a fair chance of being the first since Ted Williams in 1941 to hit the magical .400 mark (that is, four hits in every 10 official times at bat). On the pitching side, Maddux, Mussina, Key and Cone were all at their artful best, while Kenny Rogers of Texas pitched only the 12th perfect game (no runner reaching base) in the history of baseball. There were glimmers of cracks in owner solidarity on Thursday night, but little optimism from the players. Ben McDonald, the Oriole pitcher, was asked if President Bill Clinton might intervene, as he has contemplated. Big Ben, who might have heard about the crime bill failure in Congress during the rain delay, acidly replied: 'He can't take care of his own business, much less ours.' A fan's view, Weekend XVI</p>

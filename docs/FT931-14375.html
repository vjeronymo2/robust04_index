			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Letter: Efficiency greater in the parts than the whole Sir, In his column (Economic Viewpoint, January 14) Samuel Brittan states 'The US still produces much more per head than its main competitors, including Japan . . .' This is true only if you compare the Japanese economy as a whole with the US economy as a whole. Sector by sector, you get quite different results. Compare, for example, the efficiency of Japanese agriculture with that of the US. In manufacturing, however, which is what Samuel Brittan was writing about, Japan's efficiency is greater than that of the US.

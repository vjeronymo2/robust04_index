			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Metrotect sets placing price at 108p for Pounds 26m tag METROTECT Industries announced that the price of its flotation by way of a placing was to be 108p per share, valuing the pipeline protection products maker at Pounds 26m. The shares are being placed on a pro forma p/e of 15. The yield is 4 per cent, on a notional net dividend for the year to March 31 of 5.51p, which would be covered 1.7 times by pro forma earnings per share of 5.51p. The flotation involves a placing of 13.9m shares, representing 57.6 per cent of the enlarged share capital. As a result of thorough marketing by Panmure Gordon, the sponsor, the shares are being placed with about 130 institutions. Some 7.64m shares are being sold by existing shareholders. This includes the management, which has sold one third of its collective stake and is left with 20 per cent, and 3i and NatWest Ventures, the institutions which backed the management in its buy-out from BPB Industries in April 1990. They have sold half their stakes and are also left with 20 per cent. The shares sold will raise about Pounds 8.25m of the Pounds 15m raised. The remaining 6.25m placed shares are new and will repay debt, redeem the preference shares and A ordinary shares, and provide about Pounds 1m to fund working capital requirements. COMMENT If the price looks high, Metrotect's growth should bring the p/e down. With such a wide placing, there is likely to be a flurry of activity after the flotation, before the normal core of 10-15 institutions emerges. On prospects, the company is keeping its cards close to its chest: analysts are expecting pre-tax profits for the year to March 1994 to be 15-20 per cent higher than 1992-93's Pounds 2.28m, itself a surge up from Pounds 679,000 previously. Metrotect is expanding its market share in an expanding pipeline market and will prosper as long as its market does as well. Keep an eye on its trading statements.</p>

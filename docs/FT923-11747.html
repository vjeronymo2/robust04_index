			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Menvier-Swain rises to Pounds 6m and cuts debt Menvier-Swain Group, the emergency lighting and fire alarms company, yesterday reported a 20 per cent profit rise despite continuing recession in its markets. Pre-tax profits in the year to end-April rose from Pounds 5.02m to Pounds 6.02m on sales down 11 per cent to Pounds 42.3m. The previous year's figures included businesses now discontinued. Earnings per share increased by 24 per cent to 29.2p and a recommended final dividend of 6.3p gives a total of 9p, up 23 per cent. The group said it had successfully continued its policy of expanding in Europe with the most recent acquisition in Greece. Despite the recession in the UK construction industry the manufacturing companies had nevertheless managed to maintain profit margins and cut costs so that pre-tax profits were close to the previous year's levels. Net debt was reduced from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 2.5m, leading to a 28 per cent fall in the financing charge to Pounds 660,000.</p>

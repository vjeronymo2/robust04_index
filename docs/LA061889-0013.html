			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LIMITS OF MORAL LEADERSHIP  </P> <P> In his review of "The Crosswinds of Freedom" by James MacGregor Burns (Book  Review, April 16), Larry Ceplair says that Burns cited the American Bishops'  1983 and '84 Pastoral Letters as isolated examples of exemplary moral  leadership in a society in dire need of the same. Ceplair then notes that "the  bishops, as a body, have been silent on the Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence  on Salman Rushdie." Is Ceplair implying that the bishops somehow approve of  Khomeini's threats? As far as I know, the bishops have yet to take a stand on,  among other things, the Valdez oil spill, Baby Jessica or the accidental  entrapment of whales in the Arctic ice pack. Are we to conclude by this logic  that the bishops are unconcerned about the environment or, worse yet, don't  like little children or whales?  </P> <P> JOHN CARLUCCI  </P> <P> FONTANA  </P></p>

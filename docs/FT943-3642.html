			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Board forces Shepard to check out of Savoy: Ramon Pajares of Four Seasons approached to become hotel group's managing director and Fergusson likely to succeed Tuke as chairman Mr Giles Shepard yesterday resigned as managing director of the Savoy Hotel group, saying he had been asked to go because he did not agree with proposals for the future management of the company. His resignation was widely expected, after rows last week with Sir Anthony Tuke, the Savoy chairman, and Sir Michael Richardson, a Savoy director. The board meets today to discuss a replacement. Mr Ramon Pajares, general manager of London's Four Seasons hotel, has been approached to take the job. Mr Shepard said yesterday: 'Over the past few months, discussions have taken place between our major shareholders regarding the future of the company, its management and its organisation. I have not found myself able to concur with what is proposed. Accordingly, I have been asked to resign. 'Because of my love for the Savoy company and my immense admiration for the staff, who have supported me so loyally during my 15 years as managing director, and to avoid further damaging speculation in the press, I have decided to follow this course of action.' Mr Shepard has been under pressure for some time, largely because of the poor financial performance of the group, which last year halved its dividend. His position became unsustainable last week when he issued a statement on behalf of the Savoy board criticising a non-executive director for leaking a document to the press. The statement, which was not authorised by the board, was seen as a criticism of Sir Michael, who denied leaking the document. Sir Michael was supported by Sir Anthony. The Savoy board is expected to announce today that Sir Anthony, who wishes to retire, is to be succeeded by Sir Ewen Fergusson, chairman of Coutts, the private bank, and a Savoy director since July last year. Directors caution, however, that Sir Ewen's appointment cannot be taken for granted; previous widely-tipped candidates for the chairmanship have not won board approval. If he is approved, his appointment is unlikely to be temporary. Reports that Sir Ewen will be succeeded by a chairmanship rotating between Savoy loyalists and representatives of the Forte group have been dismissed by board members. The board meeting is expected to give Forte, which has 68 per cent of Savoy's shares but only 42 per cent of the vote, some form of participation in management. However, plans to merge Forte luxury hotels with the Savoy's properties - which include the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught - are believed to have been dropped.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Pension queries show real rise THE PENSIONS ombudsman found in favour of 78 per cent of complainants in cases investigated in 1992-93, compared with only 46 per cent the previous year. The ombudsman was able to resolve only 59 out of 2,166 complaints received because most either fell outside his jurisdiction or were not appropriate for investigation. Mr Michael Platt was delivering the second annual report since the office was established early in 1991. 'It is interesting that I found in favour of such a high proportion of cases but I cannot say whether this is a trend or a one-year blip,' he said. He found wholly in favour of the complainant in 27 cases, and in part in another 19 cases. In the previous year he upheld 22 cases wholly or in part in favour of the complainant, out of the 47 cases investigated by his office. The number of complaints received in the year showed only a small drop on the 2,186 received the previous year. Mr Platt said that this probably represented a real increase given the pent-up demand in the first year. Some 27 per cent of complaints received last year fell outside his jurisdiction. In 28 per cent, investigation was not thought appropriate because of lack of evidence of injustice due to maladministration or because transfer values, while low, had been calculated correctly along actuarial guidelines. Some complaints fell outside the three-year time limit set by the ombudsman's scheme. Mr Platt referred almost 40 per cent of the complaints to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, a quasi-governmental body which provides free advice to those with pension problems. Complainants are expected first to exhaust the complaints procedure of their scheme and then to go to the advisory service which refers complaints it cannot resolve to the ombudsman. The majority of complaints were about maladministration. Others regarded transfer values, where operators of the pension scheme delayed giving a transfer quotation or making the transfer payment. Mr Platt's advice to operators was: 'Get it right and get it right quickly.' Scheme members, for their part, should be vigilant and not be fobbed off with explanations that they did not understand, he said. The highest compensation payout instructed by the ombudsman was Pounds 2,800 last year but most were between Pounds 100 and Pounds 250. Mr Platt also referred to the increasing complexity of cases, which slowed down investigations. The average probe took 10 months, compared with seven months the previous year. Mr Platt said he was unhappy with this and had instituted a screening procedure to let people know within weeks whether their case would be taken up.

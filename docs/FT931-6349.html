			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: A Welsh perspective on the freight transport debate Sir, In his article 'Little Engine Who Can't' (February 15th), Richard Tomkins makes a valuable contribution to the debate on road and rail as regards freight traffic. His analysis of the issues is certainly borne out in south Wales, where there has been a dramatic decline in rail freight traffic consequent upon the collapse of the coal industry and the rundown in the steel industry, both of which were virtually captive markets for the railways. It is of course true that the government and various other agencies have had considerable success in diversifying the economy of the area through inward investment and indigenous growth of manufacturing. But for the reasons given in Mr Tomkins' article, this has done little or nothing to halt the decline in the amount of freight carried by rail. I believe that a fresh approach is needed. The government is now more committed than for a long time to promoting transport infrastructure developments. In these circumstances I suggest that it should commission a detailed study into the viability of establishing between a dozen or 20 railway-motorway interchanges with the most modern handling equipment, so that anything from a parcel to a full container load could easily be switched from one form of transport to the other. I am convinced that if all the important industries within, say, a 20-mile radius of such an interchange were satisfied that freight deposited there between 4pm and 8pm one day would be available for collection at the nearest destination interchange between 6am and 10am the next morning, a good deal of long-haul traffic would be switched. The truth of the matter is that most of our transport infrastructure is related to an economic structure which no longer exists or which has been transformed beyond recognition and over the years has 'grown like Topsy' with little or no regard to an overall strategic plan. The time has come for a fresh start. While we cannot wipe the slate clean, we should at least take steps to ensure that future infrastructure developments are coherent and meet the needs of the next century and not continue to be related to those of an earlier one. A study along the lines I suggest would be an important step in the right direction. A J Gooding, chairman, Gooding Group, 27 Park Place, Cardiff, CF1 3BA</p>

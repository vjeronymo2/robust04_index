			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> FOOTHILL LEAGUE  </P> <P> Burbank  </P> <P> COACH: Dave Johnson, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 10-12-1; 4th in league at 6-9  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Bulldogs need a pair of pitchers' arms to heal in a  hurry. Senior right-hander Jeremy Sparks, a returning starter who batted .500  last season, is raring to go. But senior left-hander Brian Gordon (6-2, 190)  and junior right-hander Joon Kwon are nursing injuries. Gordon suffered a  shoulder injury during football season and will be the designated-hitter until  he is able to throw. Kwon, a potentially overpowering submariner, is recovering  from a sprained back. Left-hander Jason Chandler and right-hander Shawn  Williams throw hard, Johnson said, but are rough around the edges. "At this  point, I don't want to say we're going to be strong in pitching," Johnson said.  He might be wise to reserve judgment on his fielders too. Players are battling  for positions throughout: Chandler and junior Jeff Kadis at first base; juniors  Teddy Gonzalez and Steve Rutkoske, both up from the junior varsity, at second;  Sparks, Williams and junior Andy Salazar, at third. Senior catcher Steve Kelley  (6-0, 200), who batted .330 last season, is a returning starter. Senior center  fielder Brian Miclette is a first-year starter, and juniors Ozzie Areu, Ryan  Woodburn and Jason Miller are vying for outfield positions.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Johnson inherited a program that he claims was in disarray.  Consequently, he is aiming for long-range goals. "We're looking to turn things  around, but the emphasis is going to be on doing things right," he said. "We'll  field the ground ball, hit the cut-off man and pick off people. . . . It's a  big mistake to set goals that are unrealistic, but we're going to be  competitive."  </P> <P> Burroughs  </P> <P> COACH: Coach Terry Scott, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 15-12; 3rd in league at 9-6.  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The team's top six batters graduated, and most of the current  Indians spent last season on the junior varsity. Only three varsity players  return and all were sophomores last season. Second baseman Mike Medina and  shortstop Eddie Gavilan, both 5-foot-8, form a tiny but tight double-play  tandem. "People will be amazed at what they do," Scott said. "They're good and  they're very tough at the plate." Catcher Bobby Sherwood (5-10, 185) was a  backup last year. Lanky right-handers Mike Rossiter (6-5, 185), a junior, and  Mike Ewalt (6-4, 160), a side-arm senior, were the junior varsity's top  pitchers last season. Junior third baseman Alex Megas (5-7, 145) pitched and  played shortstop for the junior varsity. Junior first baseman Mike Campbell  (6-1, 160), a potential power threat, moves up from the sophomore team. Junior  Andy Young (5-10, 160), a right-handed reliever, batted .400 on the junior  varsity last season. Senior outfielder Steve Bowler (5-10, 165) led the junior  varsity with four home runs.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "I've got a certain amount of optimism this year, but we could be real  tough next year," Scott said. The Indians are inexperienced, but their pitching  might surprise. "I'm being a little prejudiced," Scott said, "but I think Mike  Rossiter will be one of the best juniors in the Valley." Defense will make or  break Burroughs.  </P> <P> Hart  </P> <P> COACH: Bud Murray, 4th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 23-7; tied for 1st in league at 10-5.  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Indians arguably have the Valley's best starting rotation  in senior left-hander Andrew Lorraine and junior right-hander Keith Halcovich,  both returning starters. Murray called Lorraine (9-5, 2.18 ERA), who combines  an 80-plus m.p.h. fastball and a good curve, the best left-hander he has  coached. Halcovich (9-2, 1.28) might be even better. Senior right-hander Kevin  Foderaro, who registered a late-season shutout and a save after moving up from  the junior varsity, is the relief ace. Six starters graduated, but the Indians  have talent where they need it. Line-drive hitting Lance Migita (.447, 13  doubles, three triples, 31 RBIs) moves from outfield to second base. Shortstop  Rob Davis (.426, 30 RBIs), like Migita, enters his fourth varsity season.  Senior third baseman Chad Miyata and junior first baseman R. J. Simone, who  missed last season because of a broken leg, round out the infield. Junior  catcher Tom Wolff, who started on the junior varsity last season, replaces the  departed Casey Burrill. The outfield is new and untested, featuring seniors  Garrett Emeterio and Sean Buck, both up from the junior varsity, and senior Les  Holmes, a varsity reserve last season. Sophomore Doug Distaso, the quickest of  the crew, is the likely starter in center field. Juniors Damon Mori and Joey  Freitas, as well as Halcovich, also will play the outfield.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Murray is amazed at prognostications favoring Hart. Despite the loss  of several key players, however, the Indians look a heap better than their  league foes. "I don't know how they figure that," Murray said. "But I think the  longer we play, the better we're going to get."  </P></p>

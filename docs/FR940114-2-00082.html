Formation of pentachloroanisole in the environment may result from the degradation of structurally related, commercially important, ubiquitous chlorinated aromatic compounds such as pentachlorophenol and pentachloronitrobenzene which are known rodent toxins or carcinogens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering pentachloroanisole in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week for up to 2 years to groups of 70 male and 70 female rats and mice of each sex. Male rats received doses of 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg of pentachloroanisole; female rats and mice received doses of 0, 20, and 40 mg/kg pentachloroanisole. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  of pentachloroanisole in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachloroanisole in female F344/N rats based on marginally increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachloroanisole in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidence of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla and hemangiosarcomas of the liver. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachloroanisole in female B6C3F1 mice given doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NTP uses five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in each animal study: Two categories for positive results (``clear evidence'' and ``some evidence''), one category for uncertain findings (``equivocal evidence''), one category for no observable effect (``no evidence''), and one category for studies that cannot be evaluated because of major flaws (``inadequate study''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pentachloroanisole administration was associated with increased incidences of adrenal medulla hyperplasia in female rats and increased incidences of pigmentation in the renal tubule epithelium, olfactory epithelium, and hepatocytes of male and female rats. In addition, decreased incidences of pancreatic adenomas and focal hyperplasia in male rats and decreased incidences of mammary gland fibroadenomas and uterine stromal polyps and sarcomas (combined) in female rats were observed. Hyperthermia-related lesions in male rats receiving 20 or 40 mg/kg were considered indirectly related to pentachloroanisole administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pentachloroanisole administration was associated with increased incidences of adrenal medulla hyperplasia and hypertrophy and hepatocellular mixed cell foci in male mice. In male and female mice, nonneoplastic liver lesions associated with pentachloranisole administration included hepatocellular cytologic alteration, Kupffer cell pigmentation, biliary tract hyperplasia, and subacute inflammation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be directed to Central Data Management at P.O.

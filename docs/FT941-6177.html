			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Algerian creditors face long delays Algeria's foreign creditors are becoming increasingly frustrated with growing delays in repayments of the country's debt. This is likely to complicate the country's attempt to reschedule its Dollars 13.5bn (Pounds 9.2bn) official debt with the Paris Club of creditor governments. Such a rescheduling is expected to follow after it has agreed a letter of intent with the IMF. This would lead to a standby loan of Dollars 500m and an oil compensation facility of Dollars 300m, and would pave the way for France to seek from its European Union partners a loan of around Dollars 1bn to help support Algeria's balance of payments. Algeria looms large in the lending of many western government credit agencies. It is the largest debtor of Belgium's export credit organisation OND Ducroire. For Italy's Sace it represents 24 per cent of total exposure. It is the third most important debtor of France's Coface after China and Egypt, with a medium and long-term debt of FFr30bn (Pounds 3.43bn). It is the third largest for Spain's Compania Espanola de Seguros de Creditos a la Exportacion after Mexico and Morocco and it has the fourth largest exposure with the US Eximbank after Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. Bankers are increasingly sceptical of the explanation offered by the prime minister's office one month ago and reiterated ever since by the central bank and the Ministry of Economy that delays were of a 'technical nature'. International bankers fear the delays point to a deepening conflict between the central bank, the Banque d'Algerie and the Ministry of Economy. The ministry has, for the past two and a half years, sought to reclaim powers it lost to the central bank when the latter was granted an autonomous status in 1989. Algeria's total foreign debt, including official debt of Dollars 13.5bn, is Dollars 26bn.</p>

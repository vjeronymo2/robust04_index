			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Iraqi Kurdish Sources Confirm </F> Capture of Revolutionary Guard Members"]    [Excerpt] London -- Iraqi Kurdish sources have stated that  Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces attacked three towns inside  Iraqi Kurdistan over the past few days, which also witnessed  clashes between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led by  Jalal Talabani and the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] led by  Mas'ud Barzani.    PUK officials contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday said  that joint forces of the Revolutionary Guard and the Islamic  Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan [IMIK] (a fundamentalist movement  suspected of receiving aid from Iran) last Tuesday attacked the  towns of Halabjah and Khurmal near the Iraqi-Iranian border and  tried to control them "but PUK forces confronted and killed,  wounded, and captured some members of these forces," according  to the sources, which added that the day before yesterday the  village of Biyarah [as transliterated] near Halabjah was the  target of "another attack by the forces of the Revolutionary  Guard and the IMIK" and that the attack was repulsed by PUK  forces. The sources added that the attacking forces "suffered  150 dead, some of whom carried Revolutionary Guard  identification cards," and the the prisoners taken by PUK forces  included "three Iranian Revolutionary Guard members." They  further said that the PUK forces also seized arms and equipment  from the attackers.    Fierce battles had taken place in December last year between  the PUK and the IMIK, as a result of which the latter lost its  influence in the areas close to the Iranian borders.    Meanwhile, sources in the parties of Barzani and Talabani  have confirmed that calm continued for the second day yesterday  in the Iraqi Kurdish areas where armed clashes occurred last  week between fighters of the two parties, but independent  sources say that the situation is still tense in some areas.  Joint committees from both parties are visiting these areas and  trying to normalize the situation there.    It should be noted that the Central Committee of the Iraqi  Communist Party had sent a message to Barzani, Talabani, and the  political bureaus of their two parties urging "an end to the  fighting and a restoration of the situation which existed before  2 May." In a bulletin, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT, it said that the Central Committee held an emergency  meeting last Saturday during which it discussed the recent  clashes and issued a statement urging that "the blood of the  Kurdish people be spared" and that "the region of Kurdistan  should not fall into the trap which Saddam Husayn's clique is  trying hard to push it into."

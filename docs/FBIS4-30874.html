			<p>BFN     [Text] Podgorica, May 31 (TANJUG) -- It has been officially  estimated that the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro has sustained  a loss of over five billion dollars over the past two years of  the international blockade. Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo  Djukanovic has said that this is the rough estimate of both  direct and indirect losses caused by the sanctions. He added,  however, that there were also losses which cannot be measured by  statistical figures.    According to the federal government, the international  blockade has over the past two years inflicted on the Yugoslav  economy a direct loss of 35 billion dollars, which, together  with those caused indirectly, amount to 100 billion dollars. On  May 30, 1992, the U.N. Security Council introduced draconic  economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) because of its alleged involvement in the  civil war among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in neighbouring  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most Montenegrin firms are operating at  intervals and below their rated capacities. It is estimated  that one-third of the total 130,000-strong workforce has been  laid off with token pay due to the slashed production rate.    Montenegro's most vital and profitable industries, such as  tourism, maritime economy, iron and steel industry and  non-ferrous metal industry, have been severely crippled by the  international blockade. Montenegro's fleet, which formerly  accounted for about 20 per cent of the annual foreign currency  revenues and for about five per cent of the total revenues, has  found itself on the verge of collapse. The fleet's 37 ships,  with 977,000-tonne cargo capacity, is blocked in harbours  throughout the world, for which Yugoslavia has to pay a lay-over  tax amounting to over 50 million dollars a year.    The sanctions have especially aggravated the humanitarian  situation in the republic, as the impoverished economy bears the  brunt of providing not only for its 615,000 citizens but also  for more than 50,000 refugees in Montenegro. Over the past two  years, Montenegro has on several occasions urged the U.N.  Sanctions Committee to approve exports of alumina, which would  enable the purchase of necessary foodstuffs and medicines, but  none of the requests have so far been approved.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOLEDAD;  </P> <P> SIRHAN DENIED 13TH PAROLE BID  </P> <P> Sirhan B. Sirhan, who shot Sen. Robert F. Kennedy to death 22 years ago, was  denied freedom for the 13th time by a parole board that disregarded a Middle  Eastern petition pleading for his release. After a hearing of more than five  hours at Soledad State Prison, Sirhan was told his next parole hearing would be  in 1992.  </P> <P> Commissioner David Brown, one of the three members of the Board of Prison Terms  who sat in judgment of Sirhan, said parole was denied "because the prisoner  committed a political assassination, which is unique in American history."  Sirhan, now 46, was convicted of gunning down Kennedy on June 5, 1968, in Los  Angeles' Ambassador Hotel. Government officials and educators in the Middle  East had asked the parole board to release Sirhan, whose lawyer said the  officials suggested that Sirhan's release could speed peace in that region of  the world.  </P></p>

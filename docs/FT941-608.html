			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Oerlikon-Buhrle jumps 69% despite sales drop Oerlikon-Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and retailing group, has reported a 69 per cent jump in net income to SFr63m (Dollars 43.4m), continuing its recovery from six years of losses to 1991. The recovery was achieved in spite of a 16 per cent drop in consolidated sales and a 37 per cent slide in operating profit to Sfr147m. These declines were mainly due to delays in deliveries of Contraves anti-aircraft missiles and Pilatus trainer aircraft. Oerlikon said it reduced its debt during the year by SFr258m to SFr1.18bn, and net financing costs were halved to SFr64m. The directors said the finances of the holding company had been restored so it should be able to secure formal approval for dividend payments to be resumed next year. The last year for which the group paid dividends was 1985. Forbo, the leading European floor and wall coverings maker, said consolidated net income rose 20 per cent last year to SFr55.4m in spite of a 5 per cent slide in sales to SFr1.7bn. Sales were down in all European countries except Germany, where they were flat, and Belgium, where they were up 4 per cent. Concentration on higher margin products, cost-cutting, stable raw material prices and falling interest rates all contributed to the growth in profits. Forbo said prospects for 1994 were 'promising' and it continued to seek further geographic expansion of its core activities.</p>

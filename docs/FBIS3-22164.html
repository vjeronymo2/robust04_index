The committee is aimed at activating environmental  protection  steps in all aspects of society on a civilian level.    A ceremony observing the formation of the committee was held  at the Press Center, central Seoul, Tuesday afternoon and the  president of Songgyunkwan University, Chang Ul-pyong, was  elected chairman of the panel.    ``We, as a civilian-level committee, plan to cope with the  Green Round negotiations, which may serve as the largest trade  barrier to South Korea after the Uruguay Round talks,'' the  committee said.    The committee plans to work out a comprehensive  environmental  protection plan and present it to the government, cooperate with  foreign environmental organizations, and attend a civilian-level  environment congress in Manchester, England, in June.    Nearly 40 environmental scholars are participating in the  committee, which will study the process of negotiations in  specific areas under the Green Round talks.</p>

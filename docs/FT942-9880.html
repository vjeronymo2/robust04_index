			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / People: Liverpool Victoria - new head Roy Hurley, a former managing director of AA Insurance and Financial services, is to become chief executive of Liverpool Victoria, the UK's biggest friendly society. A formal announcement will be made on Monday. The move departs from tradition at Liverpool Victoria, where the top job has previously always gone to an insider during the society's 151 year history. Hurley takes over in July, after the retirement of the current chief executive John Lambeth, who leaves after 45 years with the society. Hurley, below, is 52 and has worked in the insurance industry for more than 30 years. He was managing director of AA Insurance and Financial services for 8 years until July 1993, whereupon he became chairman of the Service Managing Agencies, a Lloyd's managing agent. Liverpool Victoria, with funds under management in excess of Pounds 3.2bn, has been regarded as something of a sleeping giant in the financial services sector. The appointment of a new head of marketing in 1993 led to an image and profile re-think, with this month the launch of the group's new corporate image. This year has also seen the incorporation of the society, allowing it to expand the range of its products to include unit trusts, peps, mortgages and general insurance. Hurley hopes to continue the work of raising the public profile of the society: 'What is important is that the industry recognises the social values and benefits of services we provide, given that many of the people we deal with are not catered for by other financial service providers.'</p>

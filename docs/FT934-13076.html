			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Coup leaders in Burundi set up new committee ARMY coup leaders who ended Burundi's fledgling democracy have set up a National Salvation Committee headed by a former interior minister and declared a state of emergency, Reuter reports. State-run radio Burundi, monitored by Reuters in neighbouring Rwanda on Friday, said the committee had elected civilian Francois Ngeze as head of state. The committee would draw its membership from the armed forces, political parties, human rights groups and clerics. Mr Ngeze, from the majority Hutu tribe, was interior minister in the government of military ruler Pierre Buyoya, defeated by President Melchior Ndadaye in Burundi's first multi-party elections in June. Paratroopers ousted Mr Ndadaye on Thursday, raising fears of a new ethnic bloodbath in the central African state of 5.6m people where the Tutsi minority have ruled the majority Hutu for centuries. 'There is a big danger of the Hutu rising up against the army and against civilian Tutsis. This could lead to unprecedented levels of violence, turmoil in the country,' a western diplomat in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, said. State radio in Rwanda, where an internationally-brokered peace deal offers hope of easing hostility between the two tribes, said Mr Ndadaye may have been killed. Radio Burundi returned to the air at 8pm on Thursday and said said all borders, the airport and port were closed.</p>

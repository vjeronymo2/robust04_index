			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: FNN's fate in balance after bidding war THE FATE of FNN, the business news media group put up for sale in November and entered into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year, hangs in the balance after a bidding war erupted between the two groups vying for it, writes Karen Zagor in New York. A joint venture between Dow Jones and Westinghouse Broadcasting increased its bid from an all-cash offer of Dollars 115m to Dollars 167.1m, made up of Dollars 125m in cash, Dollars 32.8m in future revenues and Dollars 9.3m of assumed liabilities. CNBC, a cable television subsidiary of General Electric, has also submitted a revised bid, of Dollars 146.1m, including Dollars 140m in cash and Dollars 6.1m in assumed liabilities. Dow Jones/Westinghouse has filed an anti-trust suit in an attempt to prevent an acquisition by CNBC, which operates the main competitor to FNN's business channel. The Federal Trade Commission has already said it would not block a CNBC acquisition on anti-trust grounds.</p>

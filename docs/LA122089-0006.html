			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: HIGH PRICE, LOW-KEY  </P> <P> The Series: "Christine Cromwell," an "ABC Saturday Mystery" movie airing  monthly. Next installment, Jan. 27.  </P> <P> The Look: Rich-girl financial adviser Christine Cromwell (Jaclyn Smith,  pictured here) attains her well-heeled image with demure white blouses,  designer suits and classic leather pumps. But, in the midst of so much  understated, expensive dressing there are a few zingers. The blouses in  particular get top billing for the way they frame the face, enhance the  complexion and do all the other flattering things designers always say white  blouses do. The fresh-cut flowers Cromwell wears on her suit lapels are another  nice touch, and just might start a run on gardenia and rosebud boutonnieres. In  contrast to Cromwell's understated approach, her Auntie Mame-ish mother  (Celeste Holm) is an older-woman fashion plate, with a flamboyant wardrobe of  boldly patterned outfits.  </P> <P> The Labels: No budget specials here. The sportswear Smith promotes for K mart  stores doesn't cut it on this show. Costume designer Marjorie Bowers explains  that she built Cromwell's wardrobe from a single point of view: "We tried to  establish her as having money from way back." Donna Karan and Gianni Versace,  along with Chanel and Armani, help support the image. As for Cromwell's flashy  mother, a lot of her clothes carry the Escada label.  </P> <P> The Stores: Most of the clothes come from designer boutiques in Los Angeles.  Some are from specialty stores including Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and  I. Magnin. And a few items come from Smith's own closet. One, a black sequined  evening dress with a cut-out back, which made its first appearance on the  show's first episode in November, was a knockout. It and others are likely to  turn up again on future episodes. "She's a working woman, she doesn't have an  unlimited wardrobe," Bowers says of the stylish sleuth.  </P> <P> The Costumer: A former ready-to-wear designer, Bowers plucked the fashion plum  of the season when she signed onto this project. The lavish budget allowed for  16 designer outfits in the first episode, priced from about $1,500 up,  establishing Cromwell as a clotheshorse before the show's credits ever started  to roll.  </P> <P> The Script: A pretty, younger partner at one of San Francisco's high-powered  investment management firms, our heroine gets entangled with the powerful  clients her boss (Ralph Bellamy) has to untangle from white-collar crimes. She  can handle it -- she's more than just another stylish dresser. She's got an  MBA, a law degree, and experience as a public defender.  </P> <P> The Conflict: Since Smith has had so many professional images, from "Charlie's  Angel" to miniseries leading lady to makeup-and-perfume spokeswoman, it was up  to Bowers to create something new. More than that, "there had to be a hook that  separates Cromwell from other professional women on TV," Bowers explains. That  led to the character's pristine fashion approach, with skirts just above the  knee, necklines high, backs low. Bowers says that the young executive dresses  very similarly to the off-camera Smith. "We went through Jaclyn's closet to see  her life-style choices, then struck a balance between the role and the  actress," Bowers says.  </P> <P> The Payoff: Simplicity can be seductive. And it doesn't always have to be  expensive. Of all her swanky designer-label selections, Cromwell never looks  better than when she drips out of the shower and pops on a plush white  terry-cloth robe. She ought to put that one in her recycler bin. Jaclyn Smith  </P></p>

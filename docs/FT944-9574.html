			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: UAP to pay up to Pounds 265m for Provincial Union des Assurances de Paris, the French insurance company, is expected to have to pay between Pounds 255m and Pounds 265m for Provincial, the UK insurance group it has acquired in a deal completed yesterday. UAP announced in September that it expected to pay less than Pounds 300m for privately-held Provincial. Documents sent to Provincial's shareholders are understood to suggest that the actual consideration is Pounds 235m plus a further sum, dependant on the UK company's performance since the summer, expected to be between about Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m. UAP bought Provincial as part of its plans to expand into the UK non-life sector of the insurance industry. Of particular interest was Prospero, Provincial's direct selling operation. Provincial reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.8m last year.</p>

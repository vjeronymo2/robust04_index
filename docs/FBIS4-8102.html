			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus to the First </F> Congress of the Bohemian-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions in the  Palace of Culture in Prague--live]    [Excerpts] The government does not have the slightest doubt  about the mission of the trade unions, and it would be a mistake  to accuse it of this. At this moment, I would like to talk  about our--and I repeat our--view on the role of trade unions on  a large-scale level between trade union leadership and  government. I have repeatedly spoken in favor of a relationship  of consultations, in favor of informing each other, in favor of  listening to each other, and, thanks to it all, in favor of  mutual enrichment.    The government does not have a monopoly on knowledge, and  therefore it listens carefully, and I can assure you that also  in the future it will listen to trade unions' objections and  suggestions regarding legislation as well as our country's  economic and social policy.    The government is searching for a basic consensus of the  population regarding the main issues of our current as well as  our future situation and is aware of the exceptionally important  role of the trade unions in this. We therefore respect the  existence of the Council of Economic and Social Accord and will  make every effort to continue negotiations within its framework,  even though the privatization is radically changing the role of  the government and the state as an employer.    We will continue submitting proposals for partial changes in  tripartite negotiations, but I would like to stress here, in  front of you, that we do not call for any revolution or for  radical changes. I therefore believe that there is no need to  dramatize the partial differences of opinion that exist on these  issues. [passge omitted]    I believe everyone is aware that both our rate of inflation  and the unemployment level are the lowest of all the  postcommunist countries, and, in most cases, they are  significantly lower.    I also believe that, in the recent period, there were no  developments in our labor legislation that would really  aggravate an employee's situation. I believe the recent, rather  sharp controversy between the government and the trade unions on  this matter is nothing more and nothing less than different  opinions on one and the very same matter, and that this  difference of opinion is common and one that exists legitimately  in every democratic society.    I cannot agree with the opinion that the trade unions have  to  face insensitive politicians and deputies, as voiced at your  recent rally. I can say, with full responsibility, that a  number of requests by trade unions concerning the most varied  issues have been accepted by the government recently. I cannot  accept the accusations that we are not able, I quote, to listen  to people, and that we retreat into office chambers, foreign  limousines, and empty sentences because this simply is not true.    We, but not only we, may not succeed in everything. It is  not true, though, that we are not trying to achieve the maximum  possible contact with the citizens of our country, to listen to  what they have to say.    I also disagree with the statement that we do not show  social  feeling because we have taken and continue to take on an  everyday basis dozens of social measures. [passage omitted]    I am convinced and believe that many of you have the same  view that we are implementing the profound and very much needed  social change as quickly as we can and with the lowest possible  costs for us all. Therefore, I cannot agree either with a  statement pronounced at your recent protest rally that, as  citizens, we had democratically voted for belt-tightening. I  would like to say that we have voted for nothing of the sort.  [passage omitted]    When I hear that this belt is getting rather dangerously  tight for rather too many people, I cannot agree with that,  either. [passage omitted] I am convinced that, in 1994, we will  witness general economic growth in the form of a  several-percentage-point increase in the gross domestic product,  and that this will enable a further increase in real wages. I  do not see any reasons the increase in real wages should not  continue in the coming years. When I say this, I also say at the  same time, with the same breath, that we are well aware of the  imbalance in the economic and wage development in our country as  well as some remaining social problems that some of our fellow  citizens have to struggle with. For that reason, we are trying  in every possible way--and I believe that in the majority of  cases our views are not different from those of the trade  unions--to improve our social policy. Not at the cost of our  future but on the basis of our current possibilities and our  active work.    I know that the trade unions do not like the introduction of  wage regulation, but, after the excesses of a too rapid increase  in wages in some enterprises in the past two years, this measure  was unfortunately necessary. I believe that the selected very  careful degree of regulation enables two main things. It  enables the growth of real wages and the necessary wage  differentiation between successful and less successful  enterprises and between more and less efficient employees. This  is the most important thing for all of us today becaquse a  sensible level of wages is the most important prerequisite for  the preservatin of the current low unemployment rate and for the  overall success of our postcommunist era.    I believe that our views on these and many other issues do  not differ too much from those of the trade unionists. I  believe that what was said at your recent protest rally, to the  effect that, in the next elections, we will make a better  choice, was meant as rhetorical hyperbole and not as an  expression of a responsible overall assessment of the situation  in our country.

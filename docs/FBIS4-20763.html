			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Umar Idris in Jeddah: "Demand for Water in the </F> Arabian Peninsula To Be 35 Billion Cubic Meters in the Year  2010, 85% of That for Agriculture Sector"]    [Text] Dr. Muhammad Jalil 'Abd-al-Razzaq, head of the  Science Department and Water Resources Administration in the  College of Observation, Environmental Protection, and Dry Region  Agriculture in King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University, has said that the  agricultural sector in the Arabian peninsula is the largest  consumer of water, with agriculture consuming 85 percent of the  water. If people are educated and save water at a rate between  10 and 20 percent, this would provide a large quantity of water  to fill current and future water needs. He explained, in his  lecture entitled "Water in the Arabian Peninsula: Opportunities  and Challenges," which he delivered this month at the College of  Engineering at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University in Jeddah, that  rising consumption in the period 1980-1990 led to the depletion  of groundwater in the shallow and deep strata. It caused a  constant decline of the water level in valley sediments in most  provinces of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates [UAE], Oman,  and Yemen. The agricultural renaissance, especially in Saudi  Arabia, the UAE, and Oman also led to the use of large  quantities of groundwater, mostly from the deep strata. It is  noteworthy that the quantities extracted from the deep strata,  layered one over the other, and which cover vast areas of the  Arabian peninsula, exceed many-times-over the quantities of  (potable) water substituted for it. The extracted water was more  than 10 times the amount of drinking water, which will lead to  the large-scale depletion of water, if the small available  quantity of surface water, ground water, desalinated water, and  treated water is compared to the demand for water for various  uses in all the countries of the Arabian peninsula. [sentence as  published] This demand has increased from 6 billion cubic meters  in 1980 to 22.5 billion cubic meters in 1990. It appears that  the shortfall between available water and the demand for water  was met with groundwater, especially from the deep strata.  Additionally, in the same way, with the growth of agricultural  activity in the countries of the Arabian peninsula, the improved  standard of living and the increased population will lead to an  increased demand for water, expected to reach 31.5 billion cubic  meters in the year 2000, and 35.5 billion cubic meters by 2010,  compared with the amount estimated for 1980, about 6 billion  cubic meters. The agricultural sector's share of this water will  be 26.5 billion cubic meters by the year 2000 and 29 billion  cubic meters by 2010. In order to satisfy future water demand,  additional desalination plants will have to be built and, to a  large extent, groundwater will have to be depleted in all these  countries, especially in the deep strata. Groundwater will reach  25 billion cubic meters in the year 2000 and 28 billion cubic  meters by the year 2010.    'Abd-al-Razzaq explained that there is a need to study  alternative options for water sources in the Arabian peninsula,  while taking social and economic factors into consideration.  These alternatives may include a large degree of reliance on  increasing use of high-quality groundwater for drinking, even if  this water is located far from large population centers, instead  of its present use for agricultural purposes. There should be  work on increasing substitute (potable) quantities from the flow  of floodwater and rain to the water-bearing strata close to the  surface by using various substitute means and increasing use of  treated water (healthy runoff) in agriculture, tree planting,  and industry, as well as work on increasing quantities of  surface water by "emulsifying" and "seeding" the clouds. This  can be done in the southwest provinces of Saudi Arabia, and most  parts of Yemen and southeastern Oman, while enacting awareness  and educational programs for agricultural, household, and  industrial consumption. These programs would be one of the  permanent and ongoing programs for affected institutions in the  water sector.    He pointed out that demand for desalinated water has grown  by  large degrees in the last 10 years, due to population growth,  especially in the cities, and the improved standard of living  for individuals. Production of desalinated water in 1990 was  nearly 1.6 billion cubic meters from the stations located on the  Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts, and is expected to reach 2.9  billion cubic meters by the year 2000. This expensive water,  without awareness, will serve to meet the water needs of the  coastal cities, especially those on the Arabian Gulf coast, as  the groundwater in this area is highly saline.    The lecturer shed light on the role of dams in developing  water resources, indicating that 227 dams exist, most of them  small, in the Arabian peninsula, of which 190 are in Saudi  Arabia. He said that a large number of these dams are in western  and southwestern Saudi Arabia, and that there are future plans  to construct 77 dams in various parts of the Arabian peninsula  in the near future. He said that the implementation of a program  of integrated maintenance includes the elimination of alluvial  sediment behind dams, or getting rid of it with appropriate  engineering designs. It is also necessary to have advanced  operating plans on sound scientific bases for the stock of  surface water in the valleys' sedimentary strata, for use as  needed. This would be an alternative to storing it behind the  dams for long periods and losing it to evaporation. He added  that the development of dams must be emphasized, and, in  particular, study of the use of expandable dams to solve  sedimentary problems by detouring runoff to agricultural lands  located near valley streams. 'Abd-al-Razzaq mentioned that the  deep strata that extend below a large part of the Arabian  peninsula contain large amounts of water, but not to the degree  that some think, that it cannot be depleted. The water collected  in these strata over long periods of time, between 20-40,000  years. He said that there was a big difference in the concept of  water stock between these figures, which appeared in a study  from the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, and  statistics from the previous five year plan, which illustrated  studies carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water.  The figures of the University of Petroleum and Minerals relies  on an estimate of stored quantities in a total volume of strata  at about 32 trillion cubic meters used a major factor in  storage, which is open to doubt. This is apart from the variety  of the water, while the quantities of stored water referred to  in the previous plan were estimated at about 1.5 trillion cubic  meters. This quantity can be pumped from these strata using  available pumping technology. It would reduce the water level or  water pressure to 300 meters below ground surface. It is  difficult to pump water from great depths, given that some of  the deep strata are located at depths of more than 1,500 meters  below the ground surface; this water generally needs to be  chilled and its quality improved.    He said that he estimates the stock of technically  recoverable deep-strata groundwater at about 2.5 billion cubic  meters, and that this stock should be conserved for future  generations, for the use of groundwater in agricultural activity  for food self-sufficiency, and especially the production of  wheat for all the countries of the region, which encouraged  agricultural development. Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq added that there  are scientific and technical factors playing a significant role  in the pumping of groundwater from the bowels of the earth,  especially from the deep strata layered one over the other in  the eastern Arabian peninsula. Constant, ongoing pumping leads  to disturbances in the balance of water pressure in the confined  strata, and the water leaks from stratum to stratum through  cracks in them. Good-quality water mixes with non-potable water.  The pumping process is extremely sensitive in areas located near  the sea, as ongoing pumping may lead to the mingling of saline  seawater with sweet groundwater, especially in the eastern  Arabian peninsula. He said that it is important to create a  program to educate and make people aware of water consumption in  order to deal with the primary bases of building foundations, to  monitor the assembly of equipment systems that provide large  quantities of water, and the system of irrigation.    Specialized agencies dealing with standards and  specifications have an important role to play, with standards  for imported goods focused solely on water-supply appliances,  and clarifying quantities supplied through these appliances and  equipment. There was also the question of energy used to heat  water. This was at a time when real estate loan funds, plentiful  in most of the GCC states, could play an important role in this  field. They could do this by giving financial incentives to  borrowers who use water supply appliances in their homes.    Dr. Muhammad Jamil 'Abd-al-Razzaq said that all the  countries  of the region should prepare and update their short- and  long-term water plans. There is a need for water legislation for  various uses, to delimit demand for water and available sources  until the year 2030; and there was a need for ongoing training  at all levels, from the laborer to the director-general.    He spoke of the doubts that still exist about treated water  and the possible presence of viruses. He said the possibility of  using this water in agriculture and industry requires specific  laws regarding the chemical and biological varieties of the  water, in addition to specific laws for use, and ongoing  monitoring to put an end to pollution of groundwater. He said  that future water studies will require parallel studies on  environmental impact and economic cost, as the wisest use of  water in the future will require further detailed studies of  groundwater, especially in the deep strata, to discover their  hydraulic properties and the water type. Increased knowledge  could aid in the development of an appropriate and comprehensive  plan for the best use of water, especially in light of future  growth.    For his part, Mr. Mustafa Nuri 'Uthman, Director of the  Western Province Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and  Water, said, commenting on Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq's lecture, "There  is natural water leakage between strata, and leakage that is the  result of poor drilling. I would like to question the researcher  about the figures he mentioned in his lecture. Are they  estimates? On another front, we must choose between water  security and food security. We want to drink, and we want to  eat. Why are we thinking of the geologic aspects only, and  ignoring society, which needs food, and the factories that  require operation? Why doesn't he make a connection between soil  and water and agriculture? As far as making people aware of  consumption, why are we speaking of theoretical solutions? I am  a practical man, and I want to listen to practical solutions  that enable a man in his home or on his farm to use an awareness  program spontaneously and quickly. The concept of awareness  should be part of the school curriculum. We have a desert  climate, and we must adapt ourselves and our children to the  needs of this environment. I also find that trainers in the  geological field join training programs only to get a promotion,  and not to raise his scientific level."    Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Razzaq said, in response to Mr. Mustafa  Nuri's question, that the lack of water usage statistics  illustrating consumption in every city is the thing that has  prevented any researcher from obtaining accurate information.  "For that reason," he said, "we find that information on  individual consumption is contradictory. Monitoring of  inter-strata leakage resulting from the random drilling of wells  requires a great deal of manpower so one can implement present  codes in order to seize wells that violate them. Many of the  wells can be dug in one night."    He explained that regarding the number he had mentioned for  the consumption of treated water in 1992, 217 million cubic  meters had been consumed in Saudi Arabia, and the rest in the  other countries. On the awareness of consumption in line with a  cultural program, he said that he supports that, just as he  supports the need to consider food security by emphasizing  agriculture in the water-rich provinces, or conserving this  water for future generations.    On another front, Dr. 'Abd-al-Ghaffar Ba-Zuhayr, as  submitted  Dean of Graduate Study and Scientific Research in the College of  Earth Science at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University said, commenting  on the lecture, said that treated water in Saudi Arabia has not  been given a chance; nor have factories and hospitals been  required to use it for their needs other than human consumption.    Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Razzaq confirmed that there is a need  for a detailed study of some of the strata that extend over  large areas. In addition, all the wells that have been dug  should be recorded. There is, he said, a suitable opportunity to  obtain physical information from oil companies.

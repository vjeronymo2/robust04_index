			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Letter: The Japanese have never forgotten Keynes Sir, In his interesting piece, 'International Capital Markets: Europe stays out of step' (September 7), Anthony Harris says that the Japanese have rediscovered Keynes. When we made a detailed study of the Japanese domestic construction market in 1990 (still the only one of its kind, the report on which the Japanese requested permission to translate), it was obvious that they had never forgotten him. When we said so to the president of the Research Institute for the Construction Industry, he was very amused. In construction any shortfall in private investment is made up by public investment and vice versa. The Japanese also understand that you create a supply-side economy by ensuring there is a supply of what the economy needs (educated and trained people, research and development, investment in plant, product design and marketing) rather than hoping it will be induced by macro-economic magic. And a successful economy can be solidly based on investment and exports, not domestic consumption. Finally, the Japanese understand the power of the tribe (see Michael Prowse's piece on Hayek, September 7). In their successful days there were British and American tribes which had the same power, but no longer. Peter McGregor, Dacre Cottage, Longworth, Oxfordshire 0X13 5HH</p>

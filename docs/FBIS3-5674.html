The world is watching  with growing concern the escalating trade confrontation between  the United States and Japan.    Last Thursday President Bill Clinton dropped a bombshell  when  he announced that his administration was reviving the Super 301  Trade Sanctions Authority in an effort to force Japan to buy  more U.S. goods. The U.S. move follows the failure of Clinton  and Japanese Premier Hosokawa at the Washington summit exactly a  month ago to resolve the two country's long-standing economic  differences. Though it is true that the revival of the Super 301  law does not automatically lead to sanctions, tensions are  running high among economic circle that the likelihood of a U.S.  imposition of sanctions, however remote it may be, cannot be  precluded. And if the Japanese decide to retaliate, there is a  possibility of a trade war between the world's two biggest  economies. Of course both sides have said that they want to  prevent such a war but the way they have been accusing and  criticizing each other over trade issues places an element of  doubt in the minds of economic analysts around the globe.    The key point of dispute between the U.S. and Japan is the  latest huge trade surplus of more than 130 billion U.S. dollars.  Washington is determined to force a cut in this figure. It has  demanded that Tokyo states numerical target in opening up the  Japanese markets to more imports. Hosokawa has refused to bow  to this demand which he says (?amounts to many strings) and  increased U.S. protectionism. While the confrontation between  the economic giants continues, there is increasing anxiety among  the member nations of GATT over the effect the present squabble  will have or prospect for an easing of world trade problem.    It took GATT seven long years to conclude the Uruguay Round  of trade negotiations last December. But the new outbreak of  bilateral trade tension is putting the achievements of the  Uruguay Round to detach even before they are fully operational.  The round's final accord liberalizing trade in goods and  services among 118 countries is due to be formerly signed at the  meeting of foreign and trade ministers in Morocco in the middle  of next month. The meeting will also discuss the agenda for  further efforts to broaden world trade and endorse the  conversion on the 45-year-old GATT into a new and more powerful  World Trade Organization, WTO. This body is scheduled to be  created in the first half of 1995.    Under the above scenario, if big powers seek to resolve  issues outside the multilateral system by trying to steer  straight and not leave market forces to operate, everyone, both  developed and developing nations, is bound to suffer. A trade  war must be averted at all costs. It is up to the U.S. and  Japan to resume negotiations to sort out their differences and  arrive at sensible solution.</p>

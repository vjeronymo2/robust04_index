			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali </F> on 18 March, place not given -- recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Citizens, men and women. Following the conclusion of the  presidential and legislative elections campaign, polling begins  on 20 March, the anniversary of Independence Day. In the  context of my own following up of the electoral campaign and  preparations for polling day, I noticed two things:    First, some political parties have designated only a few  monitors in polling stations despite the fact that we extended  the official deadline by 24 hours for them. What is regrettable  is that they have not remedied the situation.    As for the second matter, for which municipalities and  sub-municipalities are responsible, it concerns the distribution  of voting cards. I gave firm instructions that citizens be  informed of the need to register their names in the electoral  lists, and to enable them to ascertain this registration in the  reviewing period so as to avoid any mistake, overlooking or  omission. I also ordered that they be given enough time beyond  the registration deadline to register and remedy the situation.  Furthermore, I instructed the relevant authorities on the  municipal and sub-municipal level to be careful to prepare the  voter registration cards properly, so as to avoid all types of  mistakes with names and addresses, and to make sure that it is  sent or handed to them within the deadline, before voting  starts. It has come to my attention that some voters have not  received their cards either because their names are not on the  lists -- in spite of their assurance that they had registered  their names previously -- or because of a mistake with the names  and addresses, or merely because of a failure in distribution.    Cases like this contradict our desire to enable everyone who  has the right to take part in the elections to carry out that  right, which is guaranteed in the constitution and the law. It  also does not give a positive image of the work of the  municipalities -- which I have always reaffirmed are the first  school for democracy, and for the development of the civic  spirit, and for the kindling of the sense of citizenship in the  nation -- in addition to it hurting the image of the  administration in the mind of the citizen.    I place full responsibility for any failure, if this is  proved to be the case, on the municipal leaders and their  general secretaries. To avoid such a situation, I have given  instructions to the Interior Ministry to take note of this  matter in the time remaining before the beginning of voting by  taking the necessary measures to enable all voters to receive  their cards.    Fellow citizens, to vote is not a mere formality nor is it  an  obligation, but it is a patriotic duty and a civil right  represented by the casting your vote in favor of whoever you see  as eligible to represent you at the House of Deputies. It is  also a right and a duty to underline the involvement in and  positive response to the national cultural project -- a large  part of which we have accomplished -- and a great deal is  expected from it due to the legitimate aspirations and the  challenges which we should overcome with God's help.    The joined daily effort to which we adhered as a principle  and a value, begins from the voting process itself. To let our  people practice this responsibility, having reached a high  degree of maturity, rationality, and eligibility for an  organized and developed political life, the administrative  bodies should facilitate the performance of this duty and the  practice of this right to everyone by providing them with the  legal means namely the electoral card.    It is, at the same time, the main precondition for the  involvement of everyone with renewable impetus, sincere resolve,  and a high spirit of responsibility in the new take-off with  which we are preparing our country to occupy the highest status  in continuation of what we started on 7 November [1987].    Peace and God's mercy and blessings be upon you.</p>

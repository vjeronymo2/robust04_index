			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIRD PICTURE  </P> <P> Regarding your article on Cecil Hicks, Orange County district attorney (Aug.  13), I take exception to your picturing former California Chief Justice Rose  Elizabeth Bird along with known convicts. We may not all agree with her legal  and political opinions, but she doesn't rank with these offenders. You owe her  an apology.  </P> <P> E. T. STEARNS  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

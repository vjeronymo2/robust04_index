			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic this evening again received Vitaliy Churkin,  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, who arrived in  Belgrade following talks in Sarajevo and Pale.    As the Serbian president's office has announced, the talks  focused on the current situation, while particular attention was  paid to the initiative for reaching a general agreement on the  cessation of all hostilities on the territory of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Serbian president stressed in talks that abandoning the  practice of discriminating between the warring sides in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina represents an unavoidable precondition for  reaching a final peace.</p>

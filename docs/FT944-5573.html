			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rebound ahead of employment report After posting declines earlier in the session, US Treasury prices rebounded to opening levels late yesterday as market participants awaited today's key employment report. At 4pm the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 94 9/32 , yielding 8.000 per cent, and the two-year note was  1/16 lower at 99 21/32 , yielding 7.421 per cent. Afternoon trading was light as investors held their positions in advance of today's announcement of November non-farm payroll and employment rates. Earlier in the day, strong economic signals pushed prices down moderately. The National Association of Purchasing Managers reported its index up 61.2 per cent for November from 59.7 per cent in October, the highest increase in more than 10 years. Still, the number was not strikingly out of line with expectations. The sub-index of prices paid for manufacturing materials fell slightly in November, but the decrease was largely attributed to seasonal factors. The decrease, however, bolstered the dollar, which rallied against both the Japanese yen and the D-Mark. A stronger dollar helps bonds by encouraging foreign investors to maintain their holdings. The market paid little attention to economic data released earlier showing a larger than expected increase in personal income and a moderate rise in construction expenditure. UK gilts drifted slightly lower as investors searched in vain for a strong lead from the US. Analysts said the market was waiting for the US non-farm payroll figure today. The December long gilt future moved down  1/16 to trade around 103 1/32 . The yield spread over bunds was around 129. Mr Nigel Richardson at Yamaichi said gilts were positioned to rise. He said the issue of tap stock by the Bank of England on Monday had been interpreted as a signal that the Budget would be good for gilts. In the event, the Budget had been interpreted cynically by the market, and investors were worried about future tax cuts, inaccurate growth forecasts and that the Labour party would be in power during the period covered by current forecasts of government spending. However, Mr Richardson thought that even if taxes were cut next year, that would be unlikely to upset gilts too much. Even if forecasts were incorrect, the public sector borrowing requirement was likely to remain below 3 per cent of GDP and a Labour government would be unlikely to take spending above that level. German bunds drifted in slow trading. The December bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 91.23, up 0.01. Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank council member, said the bank remained concerned at the rise in producer prices. Ms Jane Berryman at Technical Data said: 'Evidence continues to mount that German authorities have little if no scope to loosen monetary policy any further.' The Italian market out-performed others yesterday as investors took cheer from agreement on pensions reform. The December bond futures contract on Liffe ended at 101.87, up 0.27. But Mr Pio de Gregorio at NatWest Markets said: 'The watering down of the (pensions) reform . . . increases the likelihood that the government will have to resort to a supplementary package sometime next year if the deficit target is to be met.'</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Arts (Openings): Paris The Opera Bastille opens its 1994-5 season tonight with Verdi's 'Simon Boccanegra'. It will be Myung-Whun Chung's swan-song as music director. Ten days ago, the production appeared to be doomed by an acrimonious legal battle over the management's decision to sack the Korean conductor. Rehearsals finally went ahead after the Opera agreed to give Chung one last production and pay him compensation for the remaining six years of his contract.</p>

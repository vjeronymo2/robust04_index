For the third day running  Tuesday aid convoys headed from the Adriatic to central Bosnia  had to be called off because roads were blocked by demonstrating  civilians in Moslem-held areas, UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski said here.    On Monday, some 300 people held up a food convoy between  Zenica and Kakanj, central Bosnia, and police had to fire into  the air to disperse them, he said. Last week, three UNHCR  convoys were attacked in Moslem-held areas, notably between  Gornji Vakuf and Novi Travnik, and a British armoured vehicle  had to fire into the air to disperse civilians, the spokesman  also said. UNHCR representatives suggested civilians were angry  at the way food was distributed by the Bosnian authorities.  [passage omitted]</p>

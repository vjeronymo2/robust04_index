			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The working party on  China of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) began  its 16th meeting here today to continue deliberation on resuming  China's signatory status of the GATT.    The four-day meeting is being attended by a Chinese  delegation led by Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, Gu Yongjiang, and Deputy Minister in Charge of the  State Commission for Economy and Trade, Yu Xiaosong.    Establishing a world trade organization was one of the  important achievements at GATT's Uruguay Round of talks, which  concluded last December and in which China participated.    Deputy Minister Gu said the meeting of the working party,  held after the Uruguay Round, has lent new meaning to China's  reentry into GATT, which would make the country one of the  founding members of the future trade organization.    Under the Uruguay Round agreement, the new organization is  to  be established by July, 1995.    However, many countries are now asking that this date be  moved up to next January.    Gu said that conditions for Chinese membership in the world  trade organization have now matured after 15 years of efforts in  the reform towards a market economy, and the standardization of  China's foreign trade system in accordance with GATT  requirements.    Delaying China's return to GATT will mean delays in carrying  out China's commitments made in the Uruguay round, and will not  help the contracting parties to make use of the opportunities  offered by China's economic growth, said Gu.    He added that any delay would also take away the confidence  that the Chinese business circle has in GATT.    In his speech, Gu gave a detailed report on China's reform  measures taken since late last year, especially those on the  regulation system for foreign exchange.    Meanwhile, Yu Xiaosong briefed the representatives in detail  on the measures adopted or soon to be adopted by China in  reforming its import regulation system, lowering tariffs, and  reducing non-tariff obstructions.    At the meeting this morning, representatives from countries  including the United States, Japan, and the European Union (EU)  welcomed China's reform in foreign exchange regulation.    The EU representative, praising the reform as "encouraging,"  said that the EU hoped to conclude the working party on China  with a decision to allow it to soon reenter GATT.    Japan, Uruguay and the Nordic countries all expressed the  same hopes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viet An: "The Army in Economic Construction: The </F> Urgent Need To Renovate Organization and Management"]    [Text] During the past 3 years, the national defense  production and economic construction forces of the armed forces  have developed quantitatively and increased their  production-commercial effectiveness.    Three kinds of economic construction by the armed forces  are:  national defense enterprises; enterprises based on the economic  accounting mechanism that produce or repair equipment and  weapons, primarily for national defense, and use surplus  capacity for economic production; and the specialized economic  units, businesses that are based on the different sectors and  trades. Another force are the regular units participating in  production. A management system at all levels--from the Ministry  of National Defense down to the basic level--has been formed.  After the enterprises were reorganized in accordance with Decree  388, a total of 299 enterprises have been strengthened and  reorganized, and have gradually entered into operation.    Therefore, during the past 3 years the economic construction  activities of the armed forces have continually attained new  results. Thanks to that, the cadres and the national defense  production and economic capabilities have been maintained and  developed. They have contributed more and more to developing the  national economy.    However, a number of units have not yet attained high  economic effectiveness. Profit margins, amounts paid into the  budget, and labor productivity are low; and their marketing is  still weak, which greatly affects their ability to compete and  their reputation on the market. The amounts turned over to the  state and the army do not yet correspond to the existing  potential. The reasons for that include factors of organization  and management.    Enterprises reorganization has allowed us to see more  clearly  the structure and a worrisome situation. Of the total of 299  enterprises, with regard to their principal activity 68 are in  the construction sector, 163 are industrial enterprises, 20 are  agricultural, forestry, or fishing enterprises, and 48 are  transportation, service, or commercial enterprises. Half are  scattered out in localities nationwide. About two-thirds have  fewer than 200 workers, and nearly half have less than 1 billion  dong of capital. That shows their dispersion and small scale,  and the heavily fragmented nature of their production and  business. That has restricted in-depth investment to renovate  the enterprises' equipment and technology, so it is difficult  for them to improve quality and their competitiveness has been  restricted. In order to have new equipment and technology by  means of cooperation with foreign countries, small enterprises  are in a weak position, are not up to the task with regard to  capital, experience, management, and the means to engage in  international trade, so they may have to suffer business losses.    The activities of the units and enterprises demonstrate that  many enterprises and corporations with one level of management  operate stably and have a developing scale of production will be  regulated with regard to organization and management, and do not  need to ally with other enterprises in a new organization. But  there are many with two levels of management which, after  re-registering for business, have only administrative  relationships with the lower echelon. On the other hand, there  are corporations in which the lower-level enterprises still must  cooperate with one another because of their products and  technology, and can assist one another with regard to technology  and capability to mobilize the sources of funds. But there are  also many general corporations with two or three levels of  management the role of which has become vague. On the other  hand, some operate in the economic collective style. That  situation is posing the requirement of studying specific  organization and management matters.    Many new problems are being posed in the payment of taxes.  Nearly all units have paid commercial income, agricultural, and  export-import taxes to local tax offices. Many units want to pay  taxes to a single place: the Ministry of National Defense.  Because of Circular 08, some problems have arisen, so the  payment of income taxes, land taxes, etc., is not uniform. With  regard to paying profits directly to the upper echelon, many  units think there is an inequality with the other state  enterprises.    With regard to depreciation and the payment of capital  depreciation taxes, many units think that the present  depreciation rate is rigid and, in general, is still too low. In  the production-commercial units of the National Defense Industry  and Economy General Department, the collection of depreciation  taxes is not calculated accurately and fully. If calculated  correctly, five to seven percent of the original value of fixed  assets should be paid, but now only 1.45 percent is paid. Some  units recommended that they be allowed to select a depreciation  rate appropriate for the fixed assets borrowed by the unit, or  use internal capital to purchase them. The form of fixed assets  supplied from the budget should be readjusted or the  depreciation rate should be based appropriately on each sector.    In assigning capital, difficulties are still being  experienced in settlement and processing. Many difficulties are  also encountered in determining how much capital to assign  because assets are not uniform and come from many different  sources.    New problems have arisen in implementing the system of  reporting accounting statistics and applying the system of  national accounts. Many units have not grasped the contents and  the necessary knowledge to apply that system. In 1993 the state  issued a decision to apply the system of national accounts  nationwide. More than a year has passed but there has been no  specific guidance on implementing it.    One problem receiving much attention is that there are still  many problems in establishing and implementing the mechanism of  the party leading, the directors managing, and the workers and  staff serving as the masters in the military enterprises. Some  party committees and chapters have been slow in renovating the  activity contents and guidelines, and have not yet tied in  party work with specialized work, and are still confused about  the new mechanism.    Much progress has been made in the army's economic  construction organization and management. But a new requirement  that has been posed is continuing to renovate, overcome  difficulties, stabilize organization, and develop the leadership  role in production and business. The army enterprises are also  state enterprises, but they have special characteristics with  regard to their responsibilities, organization, and management.  The labor structure includes many components, which causes the  payment of salaries according to labor to be difficult to  implement. The type of structure and the nature of fixed assets  and capital brought into production have many different  characteristics, so the renovation process also differs. It is  difficult to force them into the same mold, but it is also  necessary to observe the spirit of the state regulations.    Therefore, it is necessary to study and apply the policy of  renovating the state's economic management organization and  mechanism, gradually separate state management from the  management of production and business, resolve the relationship  between the management of property ownership and the management  of property use, form stock companies, and organize the forms of  cooperation, alliance, and federation. At the same time, we must  guarantee that the armed forces have a system of enterprises  that is capable of meeting the most important needs in the  process of building a conventional army that is combat-ready and  plays a worthy role in strengthening the national defense  potential and the national economy.    Renovating the organization and management of national  defense production activities and building the military economy  are urgent concerns, but also have a basic, long-range  significance in guaranteeing the absolute, all-round leadership  of the party and the army. It must be carried out carefully and  in correct accordance with the law, and there must be certain  solutions and an appropriate course.</p>

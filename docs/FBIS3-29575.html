The socialist cause is the cause that the scientific leading  ideology can only guide. Today's reality in which socialism has  collapsed in many countries and in which it temporarily suffers  vicissitudes clearly proves that the socialist cause can be  consummated only if the great leading ideology exists. To  safeguard, adhere to, and glorify the socialist cause, it is  imperative to strongly make the popular masses arm themselves  with the socialist ideology.

With the new principles and contents, the dear leader  Comrade  Kim Chong-il has further enriched the chuche idea and fully  deepened and developed it in conformity with the demands of the  present times and the developing revolution. Ranging from the  chuche philosophical principle and the social historical  principle to the theory of the chuche of revolution, the theory  of the sociopolitical organism, and the principle of the chuche  view of revolution, all of these theories of the chuche idea,  which have been deepened and developed by the dear comrade  leader, are constituted by the profound contents, principles,  and theses.

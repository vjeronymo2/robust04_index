			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian Minister of  Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov said here today that  trade between Russia and China would grow healthier, despite the  current decline.    In an exclusive interview with XINHUA on the eve of Russian  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to China, Davydov  said that since 1992, trade between Russia and China had been  growing rapidly thanks to the economic reforms and encouraging  policies being pursued by both nations.    He said that the volume of two-way trade reached 7.68  billion  U.S. dollars in 1993, a 30.9 percent increase over 1992.    He noted that China had become Russia's second largest  trading partner and that Russia ranked seventh on China's list  of international trading partners.    In the first quarter of this year, however, trade between  the  two nations for various reasons saw a decline, he said.    But the minister went on to say that he was confident that  there were bright prospects for a growth in trade and that the  trade relations in general would continue to improve.    He stressed that the two sides should take steps to solve  the  problems affecting the development of trade between them.    He suggested that Russia and China amend their trade  agreements to suit the different situation and that the central  banks play a greater role in trade between the two nations.</p>

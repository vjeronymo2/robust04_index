			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: Time to make the water polluters pay (1) Sir, Your editorial, 'The value of clean water' (July 14), concludes that the case of Ofwat, the water regulator, 'demands a political response'. Quite so. Ofwat's argument is based on the false premise that the costs of cleaner water must be borne by consumers. This need not be so. The government should be regulating industries and agriculture more stringently in order to reduce the amount of pollution discharged into water courses. Prevention is better - and cheaper - than cure. Instead of this, the government is deregulating. When pollution cannot be prevented, the polluter and not the consumer should pay to remove it from water. This is a principle to which the government pays lip-service, but fails to implement. It should do so. The water companies will, of course, have to pay to clean up sewage out of general revenue. But even this does not necessarily mean that the consumer needs to be hit hard in the short term in the way that Ofwat predicts. The current financial regime created at the time of privatisation discourages water companies from borrowing money for long-term investment. Yet water and sewerage companies ought to find it easy to borrow for investment at reasonable rates - their business could hardly be described as high risk. On a more symbolic level water company executives should perhaps consider whether it is wise to bleat about the cost of environmental improvements while continuing to award themselves pay increases of more than 40 per cent every year. It is a false dichotomy to posit a choice between clean water and affordable water. We can and must have both. What is needed is a sensible, non-dogmatic approach which combines a range of options and instruments, and a demonstration of firm political will. As you imply, it is now up to the government to provide this. Chris Smith, shadow secretary of state for environmental protection, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

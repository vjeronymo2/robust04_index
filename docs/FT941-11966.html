			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME zinc stocks surge highlights need for cuts The urgent need for zinc production cuts was emphasised yesterday when the London Metal Exchange reported that stocks of the metal in its warehouses had for the first time moved above 1m tonnes. Prices responded in early LME trading by dropping below the psychologically important Dollars 1,000-a-tonne level to touch Dollars 993. But hopes that relief might soon be on the way spurred a strong recovery and metal for delivery in three months closed last night at Dollars 1,015.50 up Dollars 8. European producers are at present considering a so-called smelter shut-down agreement, worked out at recent meetings. They are widely expected to give their approval before the end of this month. The arrangement would involve one or two European smelters being closed and the expense being shared by the industry as a whole. The producers argue that there has been structural overcapacity in the European zinc industry for 20 years, stemming from over-optimistic predictions about demand growth made in the 1970s. For some years pressure for closures was eased by demand from the former Soviet Union, which was taking 100,000 tonnes a year. Now that region is exporting 100,000 tonnes a year. Mr Jacques Spaas, secretary-general of Eurometaux, the Brussels-based organisation that has provided a forum for the shut-down talks, said yesterday there was no need for further meetings because a formula had been worked out and producers now only had to agree to support it. At that point the European Commission's approval would be sought and, if obtained, the cuts could begin. Some analysts anticipated that the financial problems of two big European groups - Metallgesellschaft of Germany, which owns the Rhurzink smelter, and the Spanish banking combine Banesto, which controls 58 per cent of Asturiana de Zinc - would prolong negotiations. But Mr Spaas said this turmoil had caused no undue delay. The producers are giving no hints about which smelters may close but analysts suggest four have recently been removed from the list of candidates. Avonmouth in the UK and Berzelius in Germany were both recently acquired by MIM of Australia. Both use ISP (Imperial Smelting Process) technology capable of treating the complex lead-zinc concentrate (intermediate material) MIM will be producing at its McArthur River project in Australia's Northern Territory, due on stream in 1995. The Budel smelter in the Netherlands, jointly owned by Pasminco, the Australian resources company, and Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, recently satisfactorily ended negotiations with the Dutch authorities about the storage of the toxic waste it produces. And Union Miniere's Balan smelter in Belgium is also thought to be secure because UM took a big financial charge when it closed capacity at nearby Overpelt. On the other hand Metaleurop has said it will probably temporarily close its zinc plant at Noyelles-Godault in France while it investigates an explosion  -the second in a few weeks - which destroyed part of its refining capacity there. The other big zinc smelters within the EU are Pertusola's Crotone plant (100,000 tonnes capacity) and Nuova Samim' Porto Vesme plants (160,000 tonnes) in Italy; and Metaleurop's Nordenham smelter (130,000 tonnes) in Germany. Analysts suggest the zinc market can expect no help on the demand side until at least the second half of 1994 when the world's general economic health might improve. Without capacity cuts, they say, zinc stocks are likely to remain high and prices low.  --------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  --------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium         +16,275  to  2,518,600 Aluminium alloy      +120  to     47,300 Copper             -3,250  to    597,525 Lead               +2,300  to    323,450 Nickel                +36  to    128,862 Zinc               +6,050  to  1,004,375 Tin                  -110  to     20,785  ---------------------------------------</p>

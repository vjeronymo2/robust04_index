			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> MAN IS CONVICTED IN RACIAL SHOOTING  </P> <P> A San Bernardino County man was convicted in Santa Ana on Friday on federal  charges stemming from his racially motivated shooting attack on a black  neighbor.  </P> <P> Jurors who heard the 3-day trial in U.S. District Court convicted Gary D.  McInnis of one count of using intimidation to interfere with housing rights on  the basis of race and one count of using a gun to commit a felony.  </P> <P> McInnis, 39, of Hesperia faces sentencing by U.S. District Judge J. Spencer  Letts on Oct. 11.  </P> <P> McInnis opened fire with a rifle on the Hesperia home of Oleatha Keller on Jan.  26, striking her at least once. She has since recovered. Bullet fragments  removed from her abdomen matched those taken from McInnis' rifle, officials  said.  </P> <P> San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies who searched McInnis' garage found  several rifles and shotguns and ammunition. They also found items that  suggested race-related hostility, including swastikas, insignia of a  white-supremacist group and figures of blacks and a monkey hanging by their  necks from nooses.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Andrey Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, left for  former Yugoslavia late on 16 April. Before his departure, he  gave an interview to INTERFAX. According to Kozyrev, if NATO  had consulted Russia prior to carrying out air strikes against  the Bosnian Serbs, another way could possibly have been found to  warn the hotheads among the Bosnian Serbs to halt the shelling  of Gorazde. At the same time, together with our partners we  could, perhaps, have found a possibility to warn the other side,  the Bosnian Muslims, who are clearly provoking the Serbs, the  minister said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 14 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, Standing  Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee and chairman of the National People's Congress [NPC]  Standing Committee, said recently: The establishment of a  socialist economic structure is a great pioneering undertaking,  and the establishment and development of a socialist market  economic structure requires standardization and perfect legal  guarantees.    In an interview with this year's No. 2 issue of the  fortnightly magazine ZHONGHUA YINGCAI [CHINA'S TALENTS], Qiao  Shi said: There is no precedent in the world for a smooth  transition from a planned to a market economy, no ready formula  for establishing the legal system of a socialist market economy.  Therefore, China has to explore this on its own. Since the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was  convened, the NPC and its Standing Committee have adopted more  than 200 sets of laws and decisions concerning the law.  Following the First Session of the Eighth NPC, 13 sets of laws  and 11 decisions concerning the law have been adopted. A number  of important laws will be enacted this year. The enactment and  enforcement of these laws have guided, standardized, guaranteed,  and regulated the creation of a socialist market economic  structure. However, because the legislation for the socialist  market economy covers extensive areas, there are numerous laws  that need to be enacted. We must pay close attention to  planning in our legislation. Judging from the present  situation, the NPC and its Standing Committee must act promptly  to formulate laws designed to standardize norms for the market,  keep the market orderly, perfect macroeconomic control and  regulation, and improve social security. The enactment of laws  in these areas is essential to the establishment and perfection  of a socialist market economy, which requires standardization  and perfect legal guarantees. We should accelerate the pace of  economic legislation and update the backward legal system in the  spirit of reform so that people can be aware of legal and  illegal behavior under the conditions of a market economy, and  can use laws to guide, promote, and guarantee the smooth  progress of reform and to provide a legal basis for the growth  of the market economy. Meanwhile, we should revise or abolish  in time laws and regulations which are incompatible with the  establishment of the socialist market economic structure so as  to ensure the consistency and coordination of the legal system  of the market economy.    In discussing outstanding problems in the current  legislative  work, Qiao Shi said: In formulating laws concerning the  socialist market economy, it is imperative to follow the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to act in  the spirit of the party's 14th National Congress and in  accordance with China's Constitution. We must be bold in  exploration and practice, and we must imbue ourselves with the  spirit of reform in handling and resolving problems and  difficulties in the course of legislation. First of all, we must  maintain legislation in pace with the progress of reform and  opening up. In accelerating the pace of economic legislation,  we must have a thorough grasp of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  guideline that it is better to have than not to have laws and to  expedite than to proceed slowly with the enactment of laws. To  avoid legislation lagging behind reform, it is necessary to  promptly formulate laws concerning matters that should be  promoted or abolished. Second, we must subordinate local  interests to the overall interests of the state. The growth of  a market economy will inevitably break the traditional pattern  of separating administrative powers. Therefore, in drafting  laws, it is necessary to bear in mind the overall situation of  safeguarding the fundamental interests of the state and its  people, and to avoid undue emphasis on local interests and  powers. Third, we must proceed from the reality in China and  boldly study and draw on the experience of other countries.  Fourth, we must improve the legislation of local people's  congresses and promptly formulate local laws and regulations  concerning the market economy. Fifth, experts should play a  more important role in lawmaking. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said  long ago that we must have more experts specializing in various  fields to take part in making laws. This idea is important.  From now on, whenever any department wants to draft a law, it  must seek the support of experts in related fields to do the  job. When we do so, not only can we pool the views of all  quarters, broaden our vision with collective wisdom, and  accelerate the legislative process, but we can also speed up the  process of training legislative, judicial, and law enforcement  personnel. Sixth, while speeding up the legislative process, we  must also pay attention to improving the quality of laws. When  a law is being made, we must thoroughly study the legal  principles and repeatedly assess the feasibility of their  application. While the articles are being drafted, every effort  must be made to make them clear, specific, and applicable. We  must also pay attention to the compatibility between laws and  draw up supporting regulations. After laws have been enacted,  some laws need guidelines for implementation, and others must be  interpreted. Meanwhile, the inspection and supervision over the  implementation of those laws must be intensified so that they  can effectively safeguard and promote the development of our  socialist market economy.    Qiao Shi pointed out: Drawing up laws concerning the  socialist market economy is something new for us. While we must  consider China's actual situation when we draw up laws and  regulations, we must also broadly study and borrow other  countries' legislative experiences and learn about those that  are useful to China. All the laws must be conducive to  developing the economy and safeguarding China's stability and  unity. While we must consider China's actual situation when we  make a law, this does not mean that we can ignore foreign  experiences. We must dare to assimilate that in foreign laws  which is good and useful to us. We should also learn from their  mistakes. We may directly transplant those articles that we can  use, and then reinforce [chong shi 0339 1395] and improve them  during their application. Because the market economy is an  open, worldwide economy, our laws relevant to the market economy  must be compatible with certain foreign laws. This  compatibility not only can speed up our process of creating  market economic laws but can also link our economy with the  world economy and enable us to compete in the world.    Stressing that laws must be strictly enforced in order to  fight corruption, Qiao Shi pointed out: The problem of fighting  corruption must be solved comprehensively. The problem cannot  be effectively solved unless it is tackled with educational,  administrative, legal, and various other measures. Over the  years, the NPC and its Standing Committee have drawn up many  laws specifying how corruption, bribery, smuggling,  prostitution, patronizing prostitutes, drug trafficking, and  other types of lawless behavior should be censured, and these  laws are the legal basis for cracking down on economic crimes  and punishing the corrupt elements. The problem now is that  these laws have not been effectively enforced. Because laws are  not obeyed -- or not strictly obeyed -- lawless conduct is not  punished, and in certain places laws are replaced by verbal  rulings or are repressed by wielders of power and crimes are  even committed by law enforcement elements, certain lawless  elements are not censured and acts of corruption have not been  curbed effectively. Such phenomena must be corrected. To  intensify legislation, law enforcement, and to censure  corruption according to the law, the laws and regulations that  have been drawn up must be firmly followed, everybody must be  treated equally before the law, and no organizations or  individuals may have the special privilege of placing themselves  above the law. The NPC and its Standing Committee must intensify  their inspection and supervision of the implementation of laws  and must make every effort to correct the situation in which  laws are not effectively enforced. Meanwhile, we must also  seriously study the characteristics and the ways of fighting  corruption when the country is adopting a socialist market  economy, and we must continue to formulate or improve our laws  and regulations relevant to administrative ethics so that there  will be legal basis for censuring corruption more effectively.    Qiao Shi stressed: To intensify the anticorrutpion struggle,  the party and the state must also improve their supervisory  functions. Socialist market economic operations certainly will  give rise to readjustments of administrative authority over the  economy between central and local authorities and among various  departments, and we must devise effective mechanisms for  controlling and supervising this authority. While establishing  our socialist market economic system, we must have effective  control and supervision over authority. Uncontrolled power is  apt to generate corruption. During the course of the building of  our socialist market economic system, we must also intensify our  control and supervision over authority. We must set up a  powerful supervisory system by organically combining the  supervision by the party, state organs, organs of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, and the masses as  well as by the media. The establishment and the perfection of  the legal system governing our socialist market economy  certainly will be fundamental measures helpful for guarding  against the generation of corrupt phenomena.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: Entertaining road to hell - Martin Hoyle enjoys 'Don Giovanni' and 'Eugene Onegin' in Belfast Nature, or rather town planning, has done Belfast's Grand Opera House no favours. Next to the headquarters of the Ulster Unionists and across the street from the Europa Hotel, the charming theatre has been the innocent bystander in more than one bomb incident aimed at its neighbours. Last Friday opera returned to the theatre after postponement through bomb damage. Two Johns visited Belfast that day: Major, full of good intentions, and Mozart's lascivious Sevillian who took the less well-paved but more entertaining road to hell. Don Giovanni was played out in the unusually intimate splendour of a fin-de-siecle interior, at first glance a conventional Frank Matcham froth of gilt, cream and red, but with intriguing eastern decorative motifs: Moslem sages jostle trumpet-playing cherubs on the ceiling, cartouches frame Hindu gods, and elephant-heads form the capitals of pillars. This production is the result of co-operation between Opera Northern Ireland and Bath and Wessex Opera. There were reportedly some technical hitches at the first night in the west of England, and in Belfast the odd off-stage crash and on-stage flash bespoke the occasional gremlin. But Roman Terleckyj's production is as lithe and swift as its young cast. David Myerscough-Jones' set is dominated by a huge grille that parts, ringing changes on the basic theme of a closed-in society, with visual allusions ranging from Piranesi-like nightmare prisons to the Marat-Sade spectacle of panicky peasants clambering up the bars in an effort to escape the avengers in the ball scene. To judge by both Giovanni and the following night's Eugene Onegin, there is no shortage of good baritones today. The Danish Johannes Mannov was a plausible philanderer and a stylish Mozartian: his honeyed opening of 'La ci darem la mano' with the sweet-voiced Zerlina of Yvonne Barclay turned it into a real seduction. Eric Ashcraft's Ottavio was much less wimpish than usual, Christopher Purves' light-voiced baritonal Leporello had the stage communicativeness expected from an ex-Wallbanger (as in Harvey and the ditto), John Hall's Commendatore was young and vigorous. Musically Roy Goodman directed a fleet performance from the Ulster Orchestra. Most stylish of all was the Elvira of Elizabeth Gale, once a memorable Zerlina. There have been fuller voices in the role, but she knows what the character and Mozart are about. If Don Giovanni was conventionally enjoyable, Onegin had much in it that reminded the English visitor of Pountneyesque ideas from ENO's glory days. A little girl, Alice-like, wanders through the action: the child Tatyana was? The innocence that never quite died? Invisible, all-seeing, she firmly shuts a book over the grieving Onegin, as if the characters' destiny had been already decided in the past. Between scenes a wind whistles across the stage, dominated by the autumnal crimson of virginia creeper. There may be a tendency to think of Pushkin's 'lyric scenes' as anticipating Chekhov. However, only 48 hours after seeing a stage adaptation of Emma I was struck how much Tatyana and her circle had in common with Jane Austen's small, intensely-felt world of emotional ripening and developing moral awareness. The later romanticism is all Tchaikovsky's own, and the Romanian production team (director Ion Caramitru, designer Maria Miu) play up the element of regretted opportunities, vanished hopes, unrecapturable youth. The St Petersburg ballroom is full of ghosts - the tired nurse, Olga, Madame Larina, the dead Lensky, his pistol raised as in that fatal duel - pass like wraiths through the elegant dancers. As a way of dramatising an opera that can unfold slowly on stage, whose conflicts are internal and psychological, the production strikes a happy and tactful balance between theatricality and the introspective beauties of the score. The American Kimm Julian is a mature Onegin, a stiff avuncular figure, perhaps a foretaste of one of Henry James's more icy creations, finely sung, intelligently acted. Melanie Armitstead's dignified bearing and veiled vocal quality were better with the grande dame than the impulsive girl. Mark Beudert, another American, provided Lensky with Italianate tone, after initially uncertain intonation, and made a handsome young poet. Kate McCarney, a glamorous Olga, Colette McGahon's loving Larina and Enid Hartle's experienced Nurse filled the lesser roles from strength. Robust playing for Kenneth Montgomery was seconded by the splendid ONI chorus, amazingly an amateur body. This recalls Welsh National Opera, originally built around an amateur chorus, but WNO was able to grow through the backup of English besides Welsh touring. Dreams of one central organisation providing opera for Belfast, Dublin and Cork are still 'a political hot potato'. Meanwhile ONI prepares a touring version of Don Pasquale, looks forward to Elisir and aspires to next year's double of Boheme and Cunning Little Vixen. As the company admits, Janacek is a box-office risk, but 'it's the sort of opera that people can come to and fall in love with'.</p>

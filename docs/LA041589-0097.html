			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival continues  at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas this weekend. Highlights from  today's and Sunday's program follow.  </P> <P> TODAY  </P> <P> 'My Uncle's Legacy'  </P> <P> Yugoslavia, 1988, 107 minutes  </P> <P>  6:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  Krsto Papic's scathing memory-film of life in a teacher's school in the 1950s,  and of the symbiotic relationship between a rebellious young student and his  uncle, a charismatic Party leader, gets high marks for political audacity and  independence, medium ones on dramatic execution and psychological edge. Papic  keeps building toward an explosion of outrage. But, since this isn't an  American vigilante thriller the combustion never quite arrives. MICHAEL  WILMINGTON  </P></p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter From Rozay-En-Brie: US pressure is the final straw The family of Jean-Philippe Garnot has been growing cereals on the wide plains of Brie east of Paris for generations. Yet never before has the region been so much under threat, says Mr Garnot. The threat comes from US pressure to cut European subsidised farm exports. The European Community, to which farmers such as Mr Garnot have always turned for protection, has caved in to American demands, he says. Today Mr Garnot, 35, feels abandoned by Brussels. 'Why should American farmers have the right to produce and European farmers not have the right to produce?' asks Mr Garnot, who like many fellow farmers is a loyal right-wing Gaullist. 'The Americans are just defending their corner. More than half our fight is against the European Commission,' he adds. 'We are not really understood by the Commission . . . A few commissioners have signed something that is in the general interest, but when you take the special case of France, it is catastrophic.' Mr Garnot, a pillar of the local branch of the FNSEA, France's main farm union, manned the barricades in last week's farmers' demonstrations in Paris and will do again at a rally with other European farmers in Strasbourg tomorrow. He believes he is defending his region and his job. Many people believe Mr Garnot and his colleagues are wrong, that French farmers have lived for too long under the cosy protection of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (Cap). French farmers, critics say, should have faced up to the realities of international competition years ago. Yet the problem does not look that simple from the vantage point of the 14th century keep that dominates Mr Garnot's farmhouse. The tower looks out over a tapestry of pale green shades, the first shoots of a crop sown six weeks ago, which stretches away towards the medieval market town of Rozay-en-Brie. The view has not changed very much for hundreds of years, during which time Brie supplied the famous cheese of the same name and wheat for Parisians' bread. Yet the view is about to change, and with it the region's fortunes, farmers fear. Next year ugly brown squares will appear in the tapestry, fields to be left fallow under Cap reforms designed to take land out of production - the so-called set-aside scheme. The local economy, still firmly wedded to its rural roots, cannot generate new jobs to replace the more than 1,000 farmworkers that Mr Garnot estimates will lose their jobs in his departement of Seine-et-Marne over the next three years. The movement of jobs and people away from the country - desertification - has just started to blight the fertile cereal plains of Brie. Desertification in Brie is nothing like as bad as in the poorer central and south-western France. Yet the first signs are there, with the closure of a butcher's shop and a bakery in a village near Mr Garnot's last year. As elsewhere in France, local people are looking for someone to blame for their economic plight. Some have turned against the EC, in line with other rural communities which nearly succeeded in persuading the nation to vote down the Maastricht treaty in September's referendum. A faded poster on a wall bordering the track to Mr Garnot's tower declares: 'Maastricht, unemployment, taxes.' Mr Garnot will survive the Cap reform better than most because his farm is relatively large - more than 200 hectares - and on prime land. But he will not entirely escape the impact of the Cap reforms and he fears the EC-US trade accord will hit him even harder. Under the Cap reforms, Mr Garnot, like other large cereal farms, is obliged to take 15 per cent of his land out of production. Next year he will plough over the least productive fields. His annual turnover will fall by 7 per cent. Some fields, like his own, will be left as bare earth if their owners follow good farming practice and sterilise the soil. Poorer farmers will allow their set-aside fields to fall prey to weeds. By 1995, Mr Garnot estimates that cuts in production and in cereal prices will reduce his annual income by 45 per cent to FFr145,000 (Pounds 17,618). That will just enable him to cover his running costs, assuming he stops all investment in machinery and equipment, currently FFr150,000 a year. The rest of the farm's FFr450,000 annual operating income will be swallowed up by debt repayments and buying fertiliser and other materials. His one full-time farm hand might have to go. As a director of the local branch of Credit Agricole bank, Mr Garnot knows how badly his neighbours will be hit because he keeps an eye on their bank accounts. Some farmers have already reached the stage where it will take them 30 years to repay debts from their farms' operating income. 'Who will want to buy a farm in that state?' he asks. Mr Garnot denies that French farmers are using the US-EC trade row to try to regain ground lost under the Cap reforms. He taps away at a calculator to produce unconvincing figures to support his claims that the transatlantic accord will hurt more than the Brussels reforms. The drift of the argument is clear. If Mr Garnot can only just accept Cap reforms, he certainly cannot tolerate being pushed around by Washington. Paris must therefore use its veto, 'to say stop, to let things calm down,' he says.</p>

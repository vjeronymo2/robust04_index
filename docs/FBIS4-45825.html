			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769)] </F>   [Excerpt] Beijing, 5 Jun (XINHUA) -- The first meeting on  Chinese women and the environment was held today at the Great  Hall of the People in Beijing in conjunction with a meeting to  mark the "June 5th" World Environment Day." Addressing the  meeting, State Councillor Song Jian called for increasing  society's awareness of the environment, stepping up propaganda  and education, and fostering environmental ethics. He urged  every woman to enthusiastically take part in the great cause of  developing the economy and protecting the environment and to  create a better tomorrow with concerted efforts.    The meeting was jointly sponsored by the State Environmental  Protection Bureau and the All-China Women's Federation with a  view to enhancing, among the broad ranks of women, the  understanding of environmental problems, increasing their  environmental awareness and enlisting their participation in the  environmental cause and in advancing China's environmental  undertakings. Song Jian said: Women play an irreplaceable role  in the modernization drive. Mothers exercise the most direct  influence on the youngsters and children -- the future of  society. We must build such a consensus in society; that is,  polluting the environment is a behavior that runs counter to  social ethics and the standards of the law and infringes upon  the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people and  future generations. Participation of tens upon millions of  women in the cause of economic development and environmental  protection will have a major impact on the family, society, and,  in particular, the youngsters and children.    Cheng Siyuan, National People's Congress Standing Committee  vice chairman, and Qian Zhengying, National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice  chairman, were present at the meeting and spoke.

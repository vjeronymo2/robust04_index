			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ATTORNEY HELD ON SUSPICION OF HELPING CLIENT TO HIDE  </P> <P> A San Diego defense lawyer is being held on $500,000 bail after he allegedly  helped a client who is charged with operating a high-class prostitution ring  elude authorities, a spokesman for the district attorney's office said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Buford B. Wiley Jr. was arrested Monday after authorities developed information  indicating that Wiley helped the client, Karen Wilkening, go into hiding almost  20 months ago, said the spokesman, Steve Casey.  </P> <P> Wilkening failed to appear for the second day of her preliminary hearing in  Superior Court in September, 1987, on charges that she ran a prostitution ring  out of her Linda Vista condominium. Wilkening, who has been charged with 28  counts of pimping and pandering, has since been taken into custody, Casey said,  but he would give no details about the arrest or where she was being detained.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arraignment Rescheduled  </P> <P> Wiley was being held in the County Jail downtown. His arraignment was postponed  Tuesday afternoon by Municipal Judge Lillian Lim Quon because the district  attorney's office had not filed formal charges. The arraignment was rescheduled  for today.  </P> <P> Casey said he expects that Wiley will be charged with conspiracy to obstruct  justice, impersonation and accessory to a felony.  </P> <P> Michael L. Lipman, a San Diego lawyer who was present at Municipal Court on  Tuesday and said he might represent Wiley, said he could not respond to the  allegations until charges were filed.  </P> <P> Casey said Wiley was arrested by officers from the San Diego Metropolitan  Homicide Task Force after the group received information that Wiley allegedly  helped in Wilkening's flight. The task force has been investigating a series of  murders involving suspected prostitutes in the San Diego area. But Casey said  Wiley is not under investigation in connection with any of the murders.  </P> <P> As part of its investigation of Wiley, Casey said, the task force conducted  searches Monday and Tuesday of his home and office and the offices of car  dealer Tony McCune in National City, among other sites. Casey would not say why  McCune's offices were searched. A woman who answered the telephone at McCune's  office Tuesday afternoon said McCune was not available for comment.  </P> <P> Wiley has been involved in other publicized cases, such as the successful  defense of Ray Ortiz, former registrar of voters in San Diego County. Wiley  represented a co-defendant of Ortiz, Lance Gough, an Escondido elections  consultant who was acquitted on a theft charge.  </P></p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong tune for the unskilled Sir, Professor Adrian Wood (Personal View, March 10) proposes stimulating the employment of unskilled workers by increasing the cost of employing skilled workers. As the oldest piano maker in the world, we very much hope that this imaginative idea is adopted in mainland Europe, where the professor believes that there will be applause for his suggestion. The Wood plan should be of great benefit to our export trade there since it would put up European costs and prices and thus be disastrous for our local competitors. However, given the risk that the Wood plan would simply add to the level of unemployment in Europe by the collapse of the businesses which employ the expensive skilled workers, perhaps that would not be to our benefit. With growing unemployment, maybe the Europeans would not be able to afford our pianos after all. I suggest that the professor is encouraged to study the problem of unskilled unemployment again and to ask himself whether a better answer is to increase the demand for skilled workers and thus provide an incentive for the unskilled to be trained. Or is that too American for him to tolerate? G M Simon, John Broadwood &amp; Sons, 45a High Street, Stony Stratford, Milton Keynes MK11 1AA</p>

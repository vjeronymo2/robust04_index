			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Panama's economic developments monitored through 1  March.    Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas has  reported that commercial banks have finally realized that Panama  does not have the money needed to pay its foreign debt, which  amounts to approximately $3 billion. A Panamanian delegation  met in the United States 17-18 February with the committee of  creditor banks to negotiate on the debt. Cardenas refused to  give details of Panama's proposal. (Panama City LA PRENSA in  Spanish 23 Feb 94 p 3A)    Planning and Economic Policy Minister Delia Cardenas, when  discussing the alleged imbalance in public financial figures,  said: "What has happened is that fiscal 1993 closed with a  surplus which, according to the comptroller general, amounted to  $16 million versus $40 million, according to our figures. These  differences always take place and can be worked out during  1994." She added that the difference is due to the fact that  her ministry works with estimates. (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 25 Feb 94)    The Association of Panamanian Industrialists (SIP) reported  a  drop in the export of Panamanian manufactured products to the  United States from $102.8 million in 1992 to $58.3 million in  1993. The SIP report adds that these exports continue to  decline, but it gives no reason. There are, however, cases  where the actual amounts of exports have increased, while the  amount of income has diminished. In terms of chemical products,  quantities sold increased 69 percent, but income from sales of  these products declined 9 percent. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE  PANAMA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 24)    Alvaro Aleman, the Finance Ministry's director general for  revenues, has reported that during 1994 his office expects to  collect $898 million in taxes and $415 million from other  sources, $65 million more than last year.

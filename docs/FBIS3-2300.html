As a result the company's main board will this  week discuss plans to delist its six companies from the Hong  Kong stock exchange, a move that would deprive the market of  nearly 7 per cent of its capitalisation.    Despite intensive lobbying at Government House, Jardine has  failed in its attempt to persuade the watchdog Securities and  Futures Commission to allow it to be exempt from Hong Kong's  takeovers code. The company has waged a five-year battle to  free itself from the conditions that regulate the behaviour of  other public companies.    Having led the exodus of public companies to a Bermudian  domicile in 1984, Jardine dropped another bombshell in 1992 by  shifting the group's primary listings to the London Stock  Exchange. Since then it has been arguing for the right to be  governed by Bermuda's takeover code. Sources close to the  company say that the directors are fearful of China's intentions  for Jardine, and worry that the Keswick family's less than 10  per cent shareholding, which has hitherto secured control over  the group, will prove inadequate for the historic owners to  retain their hold.    Last night Neil MacNamara, a Jardine Matheson spokesman,  declined to comment. Robert Nottle, chairman of the Securities  and Futures Exchange, said he could not disclose discussions  with listed firms.    Jardine has mobilised its biggest guns in the fight to  maintain overseas control over its affairs. The Governor, Chris  Patten, has been drawn into the controversy following intensive  lobbying by Sir Charles Powell, a special adviser to the former  British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Powell now serves as  a trouble-shooter for Jardine.    From the start of the controversy Jardine has threatened to  walk away from the Hong Kong stock exchange it helped to create.    It is still possible that the company might be bluffing, as  regulators believe it has more to lose than gain. As a result  Jardine has been firmly told that it has reached the end of the  road as far as concessions from the Securities and Futures  Commission are concerned. It is also reliably understood that  the stock exchange has taken a similarly robust attitude towards  the group.    The authorities have already made a number of concessions to  the powerful hong in the past few years. Jardine escaped  penalty despite being found guilty of breaching listing rules in  1991, when it bought back 3.4 per cent of its own shares through  an affiliate.    The exchange excused the group on the grounds that the ban  on  share repurchasing was about to be removed.    The exchange also set a precedent when it granted Jardine  companies secondary listings despite the fact that 80 per cent  of the group's shares traded in Hong Kong rather than London.    The Jardine stable of public firms consists of Jardine  Matheson, Jardine Strategic, Hongkong Land, Dairy Farm, Mandarin  Oriental and Jardine International Motors, all of which are  chaired by either Simon or Henry Keswick. When the group moved  its primary listings to London after local authorities refused  to grant it a special trade-only listing status in Hong Kong,  the group accounted for around 10 per cent of the market's total  capitalisation. This has shrunk to about 6.7 per cent.    With a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the group is  regulated  by the territory's listing and takeover rules although when  there is a conflict between local and London rules, the latter  prevail. If it wants to delist from Hong Kong, it has to give a  90-day notice to the exchange.    One of the group's key concerns has been maintaining control  and fortifying itself against hostile takeover bids. In 1985,  the group sold its controlling stake in Hong Kong Electric to Li  Ka-shing after Hongkong Land ran up a mountain of debts.    In May 1988, Li and three other tycoons made a hostile bid  for Hongkong Land, forcing the company to later buy back the 8  per cent stake the tycoons acquired, on condition that Li's  group agreed not to take major stakes in any Jardine firm for  seven years. This agreement expires in 13 months, fuelling  speculation that Jardine has plans to raise its 33 per cent  stake in Hong Kong Land. But under local takeover rules,  Jardine will have to make a general offer once its holding  reaches 35 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The press secretary to  the Russian president today issued a statement from the Russian  president, which says:    "I am filled with indignation at the news of the villainous  murder of State Duma deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis. I share the  grief of the murdered man's near and dear. I join my voice to  the expressions of protest from deputies. The murder of a  deputy is an encroachment not just on human life, but also on  the institution of state authority. I have issued instructions  for urgent measures to be taken to find the criminals. They  will be tracked down and will get the punishment they deserve.    "Sharing our common grief in this dramatic hour, I would  like  to express my hope that the State Duma and its deputies will  find the right response to this heinous act. Let this tragedy  be our warning against violence, let our common grief unite us  on our road in search for accord and peace for Russia and its  people."</p>

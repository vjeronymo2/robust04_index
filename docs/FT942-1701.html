			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Economic case for equality Companies have to be convinced there is a good business case for them providing equal opportunities in the workplace, Ms Kamlesh Bahl, who chairs the Equal Opportunities Commission, said yesterday. She added: 'Employers must understand the economic arguments for equal opportunities. Our aim is to ensure we make the most of human potential and individual choice and that such strategies are cost-efficient.' The commission has established an advisory group with the Department of Employment, the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors and the Trades Union Congress to look at the economic case for equal opportunities in the workplace. Its annual report published yesterday reported a 58 per cent increase in complaints of sexual harassment to 793 last year compared with 502 in the previous year. There was a 40 per cent drop in the number of cases concerning maternity leave and related issues to 1,184 from 2,903.</p>

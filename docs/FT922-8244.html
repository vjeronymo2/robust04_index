			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Letter: UK needs high value added activities to stimulate economy Sir, While the pledge by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to 'help British industry to win' is commendable (May 6) I wonder what exactly he means by 'British industry'. Would he include: multinational companies, such as ICI, that are headquartered in the UK yet have significant sales and share ownership outside the country; foreign-owned companies, like Nissan, that are sizeable employers in the UK; UK-owned companies, such as Amstrad, which sub-contract significant manufacturing and assembly operations to foreign countries. Any dialogue that seeks to stimulate economic growth by 'picking winners' - the main focus of industrial policy in France - fails to address the key issue. A more urgent priority is the development of those skills and capabilities necessary to attract high value added activities into the UK, no matter what the companies' national origin.

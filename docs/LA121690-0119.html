			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPEAN REVERIE  </P> <P> The rich patina of age glows from the rooms of designer Linda Chase's home.  Wrought-iron Gothic-revival torchiers stand in front of terra-cotta-colored  silk draperies bound with 19th-Century gold cords.  </P> <P> An Old Master painting hovers over three clay putti standing atop a  18th-Century hand-painted Italian desk. It's an environment so steeped in the  textures of the past that a colleague of Chase, seeing a photo of one of the  rooms, asked which European country the house was in. He was startled to learn  that he was looking at Chase's recently restored 1927 home in the Hollywood  Hills.  </P> <P> Purchased a year-and-a-half ago, the house once belonged to a Canadian opera  singer. "There was an existing fairy-tale quality to the house with its  medieval weather vane, turreted roof line and small-paned windows: I just  enhanced that magical quality," Chase explains. Letting the bones of the house  guide her, she left it as undisturbed as possible. The woodwork remained  untouched except for a lone living-room beam that was beyond repair: She  painted it parchment and then embellished it with hand-painted cartouches. The  major face lift for the house came in the multilayered paint scheme: It's the  layers of paint that give the walls depth and opalescence. The living room, for  example, takes its color from a parchment base diluted with an Italianate blue  then tinted with three additional ochre glazes.  </P> <P> Against that backdrop, she's arranged an inspired collection of genuine  antiques and reproductions. "I mix all kinds of things if I feel the effect is  right," explains Chase, who works with clients worldwide and wrote the recently  released book "In the Romantic Style." Armfuls of cut flowers and candles  create a peaceful reverie -- "a world," Chase says, "that's in a different  point in time." BARBARA THORNBURG  </P></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour faces tough cash choices LABOUR'S national executive must today grasp the nettle of falling membership and income by voting on the deepest organisational cutbacks in the party's 93-year history. The retrenchment involves plans to curb expenditure and manpower by about a third, leading to some 30 job losses out of its 120-strong Walworth Road headquarters staff and the closure of up to five of the 11 regional offices. Under plans submitted by Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, the executive must attempt to find savings of some Pounds 4m a year from a general fund budget of Pounds 12m. Some NEC members are fighting hard to ensure that the regional cuts are limited while others have battled to keep enough critical mass in the Walworth Road policy research department to maintain a viable service to local government, constituencies and unions. Lobbying is believed to have ensured that some cuts in the policy department have been reversed in a revised plan for Walworth Road due to be formally submitted for debate by the general secretary today. However, the overall impact of the proposed reforms will serve to bolster Mr John Smith's efforts to integrate more closely the activities of the party's headquarters with those of his own leader's office at Westminster. That process has been continuing apace under Mr Smith's seven-month tenure of the party leadership. It is further confirmed by his decision to redesignate Mr David Hill, the campaigns and communications' chief, as overall party spokesman. The change will release Mr Hill to oversee an integrated media management operation which encompasses servicing the interests of the leader, the shadow cabinet, the parliamentary party and the NEC. That move is expected to receive formal approval at today's meeting. Similarly, with the squeeze on manpower now taking hold, more work is expected to be handled by integrated NEC/shadow cabinet working groups, thereby avoiding duplication of effort. Some senior party figures and unions have expressed misgivings that the traditional division of power between the NEC, representing the national party, and the parliamentary party is being eroded. Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary and an NEC member, underlined at a meeting in December that it was imperative local parties maintained access to a source of data and research. Furthermore, as a former leader of Sheffield council, Mr Blunkett has argued strongly for Labour's local government conference to be exempt from a plan to save money by putting most annual conferences on a biennial basis.</p>

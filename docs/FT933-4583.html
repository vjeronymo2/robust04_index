			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Boddington doubles after Pounds 15m Devenish stake sale HALF YEAR profits at Boddington, the pubs and wholesale drinks group, more than doubled as the company booked a net Pounds 14.7m gain on the sale of its near 20 per cent stake in Devenish, a legacy of its failed bid for the West Country pubs group. The group was cautious about the outlook, however. 'There really are no reliable signs that the recession's grip on consumer expenditure has slackened,' Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman said. July and August had not shown the usual seasonal uplift. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 9.7m) in the six months to July 4 on the disposal of the stake in Devenish, which was taken over by the Greenalls pubs and hotel company in June. Stripping out property and exceptional items, the company increased underlying pre-tax profits by 13.9 per cent to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 10.7m). Turnover rose to Pounds 113.2m (Pounds 111.3m), excluding the new year period because the trading year began on January 3. Pubs, the most profitable sector, moved ahead to Pounds 50.3m (Pounds 47.7m), hotels to Pounds 7.18m (Pounds 4.37m), nursing homes to Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 5.73m) with only drinks wholesaling falling back to Pounds 49.2m (Pounds 53.3m) against fierce discounting in free trade. Operating profits rose to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 14.1m), with pubs contributing an improved Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 10.1m), hotels Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 430,000), health care Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.5m) and drinks wholesaling sagging to Pounds 2.87m (Pounds 3.1m). Interest charges fell to Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 4.05m) while borrowings rose to Pounds 101.7m (Pounds 93.7m), as the company converted a final Pounds 5.65m tranche of outstanding unsecured convertible loan stock. Borrowings have since fallen with the proceeds from the Devenish sale. Gearing, excluding the Devenish proceeds, at the half-way stage was 47.1 per cent compared with 48.6 per cent at the year end. The interim is 2.86p (2.6p) and earnings 18.1p (5.9p).</p>

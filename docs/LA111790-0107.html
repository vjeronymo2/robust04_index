			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT, WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> GOLIC EAGER TO FACE DOLPHINS' MARINO  </P> <P> Raider nose guard Bob Golic, who has been sacking quarterbacks on a regular  basis lately, is looking forward to facing the Miami Dolphins' Dan Marino  Monday night at Joe Robbie Stadium.  </P> <P> The fifth-rated passer in the AFC, Marino has thrown for 1,787 yards and 10  touchdowns this season.  </P> <P> "Now that I've had 2 1/2 sacks in the last two games, I've become a  sackmaster," Golic said with a laugh. "And a guy like Marino is really a  challenge. He's only been sacked six times this year. He's got a quick release  and he doesn't let too many people knock him down."  </P> <P> In past seasons, opponents could concentrate on Marino because the Dolphins  lacked a running game. But Miami, averaging 118.6 yards on the ground, has  rebuilt its attack and ranks sixth in the AFC in rushing.  </P> <P> Which is the greatest team in professional sports? Well, it depends on where  you draw the line. The Dolphins, using the 1970 merger between the American  Football League and the National Football League as the starting point, have  posted a .672 winning record since then to edge the Lakers, .667; the Montreal  Canadiens, .665; the Boston Celtics, .663, and the Raiders, .649.  </P> <P> The Rams are eighth with a .628 mark.  </P> <P> The Raiders, of course, boast of having the best winning record in professional  sports since 1963, when Al Davis assumed command as coach and general manager.

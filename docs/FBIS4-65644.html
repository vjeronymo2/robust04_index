			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller to answer </F> written questions from journalists following her introduction of  the government democratization and restructuring plan in Ankara  -- live; passages in italics spoken in English]    [Excerpts] Honorable friends: I will respond to the  issues and the questions one by one. I will try not to overlook  any of them. A journalist friend says: We see that the issues  cited in the package are not bound by a schedule. Does this not  create the impression that the package is nothing but an  intention?    I cannot agree with this, because after a long study we  analyzed about 60 laws, one by one. We agreed on the amendments  that are necessary, starting from the Constitution. We are  thinking of having these amendments passed in a very short time  -- in fact, before the Assembly goes into recess. We are  getting ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure that.  Consequently, you can see that in the first stage, in their  most basic lines, these issues have indeed been tied to a  schedule. Second, we have determined the first 20 laws to be  debated within this package. We did not name the date when the  laws will be passed by the Assembly. We were not able to do  that in the economic package either. As you see, the Assembly  worked with great dedication and passed all the laws of the  economic package. What is important is to start this working  process. Sometimes, the Assembly needs more time to debate  certain issues. Therefore, it is impossible to mortgage the  behavior of the Assembly and tie it to a schedule. Our deputy  friends worked with great dedication until late last night to  pass all the laws to which we gave priority in the economic  package. The important thing is to be determined and to convey  to the Assembly the priority issues. The coalition government  will stand behind these issues, and the True Path Party [TPP]  and Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] deputies will work  on these issues with great enthusiasm. We have determined the  priorities, we have shown our determination, and we will  continue to do whatever we can in connection with the Assembly  debates on the issues, just as we did in connection with the  economic package.    Another question asks if the issue of eight-year compulsory  education was eliminated last night. No, we eliminated an  article from the law, but the issue is not one of ending  eight-year compulsory education. Our colleagues want us to  debate the contents of the law. The TPP and SDPP deputies agree  that there should be eight-year basic education. There is no  question about that. They want us to study the legislation.  That is what we will do. We have not given up on eight-year  basic education. We consider it essential.    Will this package mean that in the future fewer writers  and journalists will be persecuted for expressing their views?  Well, I would feel that whatever the laws have dictated in  Turkey, we have adhered to them -- and we had to -- but the  basic thing is to limit all those prohibitions and lift the  various prohibitions that exist in the laws. If there is a law,  you implement the law. So what you need to do is to change the  law to change the implementation, and that is what we are after.    At what stage, if any, will the coalition consider the  idea of allowing Kurdish-language broadcasts and teaching in  Kurdish?    As I have specified in our democratization program,  reform program, we are not going to segregate or separate any  ethnic group. Whatever will be done needs to be done for the  whole country and for all our citizens. We are not going to  separate or segregate the Kurdish people, the people in my  country of Kurdish-origin. The needed steps that will be taken  in the future will be comprehensive. It will include all of my  citizens and will not segregate a certain area geographically or  a certain group. It will be for the whole country, for all the  people.    Another question is whether the state of emergency and the  village guards system will be lifted, and if so, when.    The state of emergency is in force because it is necessary.  For it to be lifted, first the necessary conditions must be  secured, security must be ensured, and the law on provincial  administrations must be passed. We approach this process stage  by stage. Conditions of security have emerged in the southeast  and in our provinces in the east. The state and the regional  people have become united. Our government is continuing to  implement every necessary measure with determination to ensure  that this goes on.    Furthermore, the provincial administrations law is one of  the  first 20 laws to be debated. After the law is passed, it will  be easier to lift the state of emergency. We will ensure that  the necessary developments take place.    Another question is whether we are considering turning the  compulsory religion class in school into an elective course.    The National Education Ministry will conduct a study on this  issue. At the end of the study, the issue will be debated by  the councils concerned and by our party assembly groups, and a  conclusion will be reached. Before the study is completed, I  cannot say that any decision has been reached.    Another question asks if we are working on a second  democratization package.    Democratization is not a static matter; it is dynamic. It  must continuously be changed and fed by the needs of the  society. It is impossible for us to say that this is all there  is to democracy in Turkey, that nothing else can be done, that  nothing more or nothing less can be done, or that it is static.  If there are any more needs in line with the development of the  society and with the developments in general, then they will be  discussed in line with the needs of the society. Today, that is  what we foresee. [passage omitted]    Another question says: The agreements you reached with Mr.  Karayalcin are undone by certain other alliances. Are you aware  of this, or do you not have any control over your party's  assembly group?    Let me say clearly that our friends in the TPP have been  working very responsibly on all the issues we have announced,  including the economic package and other matters. Naturally, a  coalition means consensus, means conciliation. The two parties  can have different views. We have had a very long series of  conversations and dialogue to bring the two different views  together. We will continue with this process. There is no  other way, my honorable friends, because it was a coalition that  emerged from this parliament. The coalition formed the 49th  government and continues in the 50th government. We see that  the consensus reached by this coalition is far more effective  than the ones reached by previous coalitions. This coalition  arrived at a variety of decisions. It made the most difficult  decisions regarding the most difficult days of the government.  It did so while meeting the needs of the economy on one hand  and the democratization needs of the dynamic society on the  other, while keeping everything under the umbrella of consensus.    I am not saying that we think the same way on every issue or  that we do not disagree on any matter. This has happened in the  past and will happen in the future. We try to achieve consensus  whenever there is no agreement. We start dialogues. You have  seen this. This will continue to be the case. As far as I am  concerned, we are providing a very good example of democracy.  [passage omitted]</p>

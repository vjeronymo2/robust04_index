			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Algerian debt talks take on a surreal aspect: Fears over the country's political stability cloud an encouraging report from the IMF International bankers meeting in Paris today to discuss the restructuring of Algeria's commercial bank debt should be comforted by the results of the first review of the economy conducted by the IMF since it signed an agreement with north Africa's largest country six month ago and extended a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) stand-by credit to back up significant economic reforms. In the six months to the end of June, money supply grew more slowly than had been agreed with the IMF. The value of the dinar, which was devalued by 40 per cent last April, has remained virtually unchanged since then. Officials claim that inflation, running at more than 40 per cent earlier this year, will decline to below 30 per cent by the year end. And the budget deficit has been cut from 9.2 per cent of gross domestic product in 1993 to 3.1 per cent. Less positively, many officials say that 2 per cent GDP growth is the most that can be hoped for, as opposed to earlier IMF forecasts of 3.1 per cent. This is explained by the severe drought, which will force Algeria to import 95 per cent of its cereals consumption against last year's 75 per cent, the sharp drop in purchasing power caused by the devaluation, a reluctance to invest, and the sheer difficulty of running factories at a time of serious civil strife. The IMF agreement, and the rescheduling of part of Algeria's debt to foreign governments which followed last May's Paris Club meeting, have loosened the stranglehold of debt. The debt service ratio, as a percentage of exports of goods and services, will fall this year from 86.4 per cent to 52.9 per cent. Imports of raw materials and capital goods are forecast to increase by Dollars 1.1bn to Dollars 9.15bn, just below the Dollars 9.4bn agreed with the IMF. Hard currency reserves minus gold have increased by Dollars 600m to Dollars 2.1bn since the end of 1993. An estimated 100,000 new jobs are being created this year. However, with 240,000 young Algerians entering the labour market annually, the country is still burdened with an unemployment rate of 27 per cent. Algerian officials accept that a faster rate of economic growth is impossible until restructuring of the myriad loss-making state enterprises is fully under way and a measure of civil peace is established. The first task the bankers must address today is the formation of a steering committee and appointment of a chairman. Two-thirds of Algeria's Dollars 4.7bn commercial debt is owed to Japanese banks and leasing companies. They all agree, however, that Algeria is primarily within the French sphere of influence, and do not relish taking a high profile while the political future is so uncertain. Of the three leading French banks, Credit Lyonnais, which chaired the steering committee three years ago, feels it has shouldered its fair share of responsibility. Societe Generale, which has the largest exposure of the three banks to Algeria, has little experience of this kind of operation, while Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) can argue it has virtually no Algerian paper on its books. The betting in Paris is that the French Finance Ministry will 'instruct' one of the three banks to step forward. Bankers do not as yet know how much of Algeria's remaining Dollars 3.1bn commercial debt (the Dollars 1.6bn refinanced in 1991 will not be affected) they will be asked to restructure. If principal repayments for 1994 alone are considered, the amount would be Dollars 700m, but if repayments for 1994 and 1995 are included, the sum rises to Dollars 1.4bn. Nor do they know whether a 'London Club' rescheduling or some other formula will be agreed. The Japanese banks made provisions for their Algerian loans in July. Whatever the outcome of today's meeting and the imprimatur the IMF is likely to give Algeria, the discussions on the restructuring of Algeria's foreign debt remain, in the words of one senior banker, 'somewhat surrealistic'. All participants at the meeting are well aware that without a political solution to Algeria's 21-month-old crisis, 'figures, however good, are figures and no more'.</p>

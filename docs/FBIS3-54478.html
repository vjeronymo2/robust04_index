The UAE source said that the UAE had agreed to discuss its  dispute with Iran over the three islands under the heading  "pending issues" in order to "persuade Iran to discuss the  question of its occupation of the three islands, but it then  became evident that Iran was trying to use that label to keep  the issue in flux and to dither."    The source said that Iranian Interior Minister Mohammad 'Ali  Besharati's recent statements in Doha were unacceptable and part  of the contradictory statements made by Iranian officials from  time to time. The UAE source added that "the UAE's dispute with  Iran over the three islands is not a dispute over borders but a  dispute over sovereignty." He said the UAE had reservations  about the conclusions reached at the Paris seminar on the  islands held last summer.    The diplomatic source said that Iran's nonacceptance of  direct dialogue on the three islands reflected the weakness of  Iran's legal position on the issue of sovereignty over the  islands. He said that "had Iran had any legal or historical  documents, it would not have hesitated to agree to discuss the  dispute directly or submit it to international legal bodies."    He emphasized that the weakness of the Iranian arguments was  clear in the contacts and talks held on the dispute since the  failed round of negotiations between the two countries in  September 1992 in Abu-Dhabi.    The UAE source said that there are currently no contacts  with  Iran on the islands but added that the UAE has not lost all hope  for the resumption of the negotiations. He noted in this  connection that "the conflicting statements made by Iranian  officials leave the door open for the resumption of the  negotiations." He stressed that the UAE's options for raising  the issue at international circles are still open and that its  determination to fulfill its rights peacefully remains unchanged.    On the possibility of mediation on the dispute, he said that  the UAE does not accept mediations and insists on frank and  direct dialogue on the issue but he emphasized that it would not  object to a delegation going to Tehran if there was a sincere  intention to discuss the dispute over the three islands.</p>

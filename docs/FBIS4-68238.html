			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 2nd Rank Oleksandr Shcherbakov: "The </F> Institute Becomes an Academy"]    [Text] The further reformation of the Sevastopol Naval  Institute into the Naval Academy will occur by supplementing the  already well-worked-out structure with newly created officers'  classes and courses of study, as well as an academic section,  SVMI Cadres Department Chief Captain 2nd Rank reports.    The further training or retraining of specialists, in cases  where they are assigned to higher positions or in a case of  changes in military hardware, will take place in the officers'  classes and courses. The operational-tactical department will  begin training the flag officer specialists so necessary to the  Navy today.    This will provide an opportunity to combine under one roof  the whole process of the selection, training and upbringing of  specialists of all levels not only for the Navy, but for the  Armed Forces of Ukraine and Minatomenergo [Ministry of Nuclear  Power Engineering] as well.    The availability of the material and technical base and  professorial and instructor personnel will make it possible to  achieve this in the shortest possible time periods, and without  substantial financial expenditures.    As concerns the first-year class of the Naval  Institute--which was selected last year, proceeding from the  Yalta agreements between the presidents of Russia and Ukraine on  the Black Sea Fleet, on the basis of which the start of the  creation of fleets of the two great Slavic nations was  proposed--it will be cut back by roughly half. The best youth  will be selected to continue their studies within the walls of  the institute according to their rankings, which are affected by  the level of success, discipline, health and physical training  of the first-year cadets. The rest of the cadets will be offered  studies at other military educational institutions of Ukraine.  If they do not want that, they will finish the first year,  receive academic certificates and be able to continue their  studies at civilian higher educational institutions.    The new academic system is not only a self-contained cycle  for the training of specialists, but will also provide an  opportunity to preserve the material and technical base and the  best personnel among the instructors.</p>

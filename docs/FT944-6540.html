			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort in French move to win more privatisation work Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, is to team up its Paris corporate finance department with French executives and shareholders in an effort to win more privatisation work. Kleinwort will put its existing corporate finance team of five professionals into the venture, capitalised at FFr60m (Pounds 7.15m), in which it will have a 51 per cent stake. 'We can no longer confine ourselves to the UK,' said Mr Michael Martin, head of Kleinwort Benson France. The minority shareholding will be placed with French institutions as is customary for French merchant banks. Four insurance companies have already committed themselves to taking stakes. Another key element in Kleinwort's effort to present its venture as a domestic French merchant bank is the appointment of Mr Christian Giacomotto. Kleinwort has lured Mr Giacomotto, who will chair the board, from Groupe Lagardaire, the diversified conglomerate, where he was chairman of Banque Arjil, its investment banking subsidiary. Kleinwort Benson said it hoped the appointment of a 'well-networked' Frenchman would give it a 'French patina' and contribute to greater success in winning French privatisation mandates. In UK privatisations, Kleinwort has established a name as one of the most active houses but France has proved a difficult market and Kleinwort has only acted in subsidiary roles.</p>

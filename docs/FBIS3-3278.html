The Bank of China Hong Kong  Branch had made strict arrangements for its capital, operation  and management for dealing with any change which would take  place in the territory.    Mr. Huang said that the branch was strengthening its work in  three ways: first, it will strive to developing itself and make  itself stronger; second, it will make all preparations such as  comparatively relaxed conditions for funds arrangement and the  strengthening of capital circulation; and third, it will unite  friends, in a broader way, in industrial, commercial and  financial circles, enhance its cooperation with them and make  joint efforts with them for a smooth transition of the territory.    The branch will, according to the director, issue Hong Kong  currency on schedule with all preparations needed for this  matter being ready. The amount of Hong Kong currency to be  issued from May 2 this year will be HK$3 billion [Hong Kong  dollars] to HK$6 billion according to demand.    Mr. Huang said that since the beginning of the transition  period, the Bank of China Group had seen rapid development in  the territory and Hong Kong people's confidence in the group had  been increasingly enhanced and industrial and commercial  circles, especially big financial groups, in the territory were  willing to become more involved with the bank. The bank now had  over two million customers in Hong Kong.    According to Mr. Huang, the Bank of China Group of Hong Kong  had also seen rapid development of business exchanges with the  Mainland with over 2,400 items there being directly invested for  financed by the group for a total of US$9 billion, involving  items of energy, transport and construction of development  zones. In addition, the group has also helped Mainland  enterprises in listing in Hong Kong for the raising of capital.</p>

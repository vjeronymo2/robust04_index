			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Figures raise fiscal package pressure THE PRESSURE on president-elect Bill Clinton to unveil a fiscal stimulus early next year increased yesterday as disappointing jobs figures indicated the economy was barely growing. The Labor Department said the jobless rate fell marginally last month, to 7.4 per cent from 7.5 per cent in September. Non-agricultural employment, however, grew by only 27,000, not enough to offset sharp falls in preceding months and a derisory figure in an economy with 110m employees. What little job growth there was, moreover, occurred mainly in service sectors such as health care. Manufacturing employment dropped 56,000 last month, raising the number of factory jobs lost since May to about 225,000. The poor figures prompted speculation that the Clinton administration might unveil a double-barrelled fiscal package early next year with immediate measures to stimulate the economy, such as an investment tax credit, balanced by spending curbs in later years to reduce the budget deficit. Such a package would be crafted to cut upward pressure on bond yields, which have risen significantly since polls first indicated a Clinton victory. Mr Clinton, however, has offered few clues to his economic intentions since his election victory, other than pledging to 'focus like a laser beam on the economy' and to avoid measures that would disrupt market forces. There was speculation yesterday that the Federal Reserve might cut short-term interest rates again before the end of the year, if the economy remains sluggish. Economic signals remain mixed. Earlier this week spirits were lifted by a rise in factory orders, an increase in the Purchasing Managers' Index and a fall in weekly claims for unemployment insurance to the lowest level for two years. Recent weeks have also seen tentative signs of higher loan demand. Yesterday's employment report, however, was a reminder that consumer confidence is low because the unusually sluggish recovery is creating only a trickle of new jobs. Monthly employment gains in the 200,000-300,000 range would be expected in a normal recovery.</p>

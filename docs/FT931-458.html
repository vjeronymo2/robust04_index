			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: Miller's 'Maria Stuarda' - Opera For the Opera de Monte-Carlo Jonathan Miller is engaged on a substantial Donizetti enterprise: the so-called 'Tudor trilogy' in annual instalments. Last year it was Roberto Devereux; Maria Stuarda has just opened at the Monte Carlo Opera House; next year Anna Bolena completes the cycle. Every Maria Stuarda revival is inherently interesting - the opera, patchy in inspiration, reaches peaks of fiery excitement the equal of any in Italian Romantic opera. In addition, this latest has developed an unexpected topicality for British opera-goers: it will be presented at this year's Buxton Festival, in part-replacement of the programme devised by Jane Glover and then ditched - at the eleventh hour, and in controversial circumstances  -by the Buxton board. The most positive verdict I could eke out, at the close of Friday's performance, is that with a sustained effort of preliminary re-thinking and (if at all possible) re-casting, the show may just scrape by at Buxton. It affords at least the secure foundation of a handsome, strongly imagined permanent wooden set (designed by the young Israeli Roni Toren), which manages to suggest both 'authentic' 16th-century theatre practice and a modern economy of stage effect. Clare Mitchell's costumes are similarly well executed. The basic production conception - each new scene a kind of vivified picture tableau (Act 1 straight out of Hilliard) - has been supported by the designers with precisely detailed work. Beyond this, however, I spent most of the evening trying to figure out what on earth Miller was up to. In one of the many aggrieved interviews he has recently given to the British press (mainly on the subject of his unwarranted neglect by our own opera houses), he poured out his misery at having to work so much abroad, and particularly in Monte Carlo, whose populace he defined as 'tax-dodging, fur-coated fools'. Could the amazing blankness of the show, the extraordinary inertia that settled on its characters and situation, be a subtle feat of producer's irony - an attempt to 'place' the audience level and criticise it all at one go? The dramatic rationale of the evening, seldom contradicted, was that the principals ambled in to take up their positions and go through their (slow) motions; quick-witted delivery of, or response to, words seemed out of the question. At the opera's climax - Mary shouts 'Vil bastarda]' at Elizabeth, who summons guards to surround her rival - the placid trotting-in of the soldiers was a moment of unintended opera comedy of the purest sort, although for anyone who remembers the lightning-forks of excitement John Copley, Janet Baker, Pauline Tinsley and the ENO chorus let loose at the Coliseum in 1973, it was a moment mixed with puzzlement and even sadness. With a single exception the cast lacked the personality and command of the bel canto arts necessary to penetrate the veil of minimalist direction thus thrown over the opera (and in the routine conducting of Gianfranco Masini there was little countervailing inspiration). Christine Weidinger (Mary), a sympathetic but very uneven soprano, and Mariana Cioromila (Elizabeth), a competent, vocally unyielding mezzo, sustained this rule; Keith Lewis, a Leicester of ardent, elegant vocal style, provided its single exception. Unfortunately, it is the leading ladies, rather than the leading man, who will accompany this production on its transfer to Buxton. Opera de Monte-Carlo: final performance on Thursday</p>

Senior sources in Jerusalem  gave this estimate to Qol Yisra'el correspondent Hayim Hecht.  These sources say the May date has already been transmitted to  Yasir 'Arafat.    On Jordan, the sources said, the talks in Washington are  concentrating on preparing a full and detailed peace.    As far as the Palestinian police force is concerned, Israel  is said to have agreed that it would be 8,500-strong, a  compromise between the positions of both sides. According to  the sources, once the agreement is actually signed, Israel will  release more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.    [A report by On Levi on page 1 of Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew  on  23 February adds that "the IDF had planned to free about 1,000  Palestinian detainees on Sunday, 20 February, but canceled the  move in the wake of the murder of Tzipora Sason near Ari'el on  Friday night."]    Speaking earlier in Madrid, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  said  that when an agreement on Palestinian self-rule is signed  between Israel and the Palestinians, the IDF withdrawal can be  implemented within a few weeks.    [Begin Rabin recording] Since I do not know when we will  reach the agreement, I can't give you any speculation about  dates. But allow me to say: We would like that the  implementation of the agreement will be done in a matter of a  few weeks and not to be prolonged too long. [end recording]    The prime minister made the comment at a joint news  conference yesterday in Madrid with his Spanish counterpart,  Felipe Gonzalez. Rabin, on the third day of his four-day visit,  arrives today in Portugal.    The head of Fatah in the West Bank, Faysal al-Husayni, says  agreement will be reached with Israel on implementing the  Gaza-Jericho-First accord by the April 13th deadline.  Al-Husayni made the statement after meeting with the foreign  minister of Malta, Guido de Marco.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 23 February  adds that "Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo reported  that progress was made in yesterday's talks. Chief PLO delegate  Nabil Sha'th said that it is possible that Prime Minister Rabin  and PLO leader 'Arafat will be able to meet by the end of next  week."]</p>

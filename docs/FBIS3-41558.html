Japan made the offer at the fourth meeting of a working  group  on the environment, one of five working groups operating in the  multilateral track of the current Middle East peace process.    The startup funds would go toward a $9 million  desertification control program proposed by the International  Bank for Reconstruction and Development.    Japan served as the chair country for the meeting, at which  it was decided to hold a meeting next February in Cairo to draft  a set of standardized basic principles or ``codes of conduct''  for regional governments to adhere to when dealing with  environmental issues.    Also considered was the establishment of an environmental  agency by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories set  to be self-administered under the recent accord between Israel  and the Palestine Liberation Organization.    Forty-three countries and two international organizations  participated in the meeting. Syria and Lebanon skipped the  session.</p>

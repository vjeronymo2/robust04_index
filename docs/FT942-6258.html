			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: German banks in talks over Castle Energy The group of banks financing the DM3.4bn (Dollars 2bn) rescue package for Metallgesellschaft yesterday discussed the future of Castle Energy Corporation, the US oil refining group at the centre of the German company's financial difficulties. The future of Castle Energy in which the German company has a 40 per cent stake became the subject of speculation following the announcement last week by Metallgesellschaft that it will have to make provisions for new losses on top of debt totalling DM9.2bn last March. However, Deutsche Bank, which hosted the so-called steering committee, said the meeting with representatives of the German group's board had been relatively short. It was held to inform the banks about a strategy unveiled by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new chief executive drafted in after the group nearly went bankrupt earlier this year, he said. A source close to the talks said links between Castle and MG Corp, a Metallgesellschaft subsidiary in New York, 'were so intensive' that a decision to sell the stake was unthinkable. MG Corp agreed to buy virtually all Castle's refinery output at prices above the existing market, an unusual agreement which triggered the need for further risk provisions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] TISHRIN comments on the peace process and Israel's  unserious approach toward this process. The paper emphasizes  that Syria is serious about the peace process and adds: Syria  presented a document of principles during the sixth round of the  Washington talks, which was hailed by the international  community as a balanced, objective paper that lays the  foundations of firm peace in the region.    The paper speaks about Israel's refusal to discuss the sixth  item of the paper of principles on the exchange of land for  peace and the return of the Golan. Israel inundated the  Washington talks with an endless series of security conditions  and pretexts, as if the Washington talks were held to provide  security for Israel alone.    TISHRIN notes the settlement paper reported by Israel radio,  stressing that the paper does not refer to Israel's willingness  to withdraw fully from the Golan. The Israeli paper revolves  around the achievement of great gains, such as relations,  normalization and security arrangements. This confirms that  there is no change in the Israeli position and that the approach  of procrastination and maneuvering is still the same.    TISHRIN adds: Obviously, the game of the Israeli working  papers -- one for the Army and another for the Foreign Ministry  -- is only a new pretext to escape the obligations of the peace  process, primarily withdrawal from the Golan and the rest of the  occupied territories.    The Washington talks have extensively addressed all items  related to peace, particularly security arrangements. However,  the Israeli side has repeatedly refused to discuss the question  of withdrawal. Had Israel truly wanted peace, the question would  not have taken all these discussions, deliberations, and working  papers. Security Council resolutions, the Madrid conference  foundations, and the U.S. initiative all stem from the exchange  of land for peace.    TISHRIN concludes by reasserting that Syria is not willing  to  relinquish an inch of its territory or any Arab right. Syria is  also not willing to exchange facts for illusions and to replace  the Washington talks and the Madrid conference foundations by  secret talks whose only aim is to circumvent the Security  Council resolutions.    Under the headline "Rejected Call," AL-BA'TH says: News  reports speak once again about an upcoming tour to the region by  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher late this month.  Israel is also talking about what it called two papers on a  settlement with Syria. The head of its government, Rabin,  stressed the need for secret talks that would pave the way for  the settlement.    AL-BA'TH adds: We can draw several conclusions in this  regard, primarily the return of the U.S. Administration to the  Middle East arena in a fresh bid to advance peace efforts by  fixing a date for resuming bilateral talks.    Before moving on to the Israeli position, we must wonder how  far Christopher will go in his upcoming tour. Will he view  Rabin's statements as something new?    AL-BA'TH concludes: It is too early to pass judgment in this  regard, since this depends on the way the U.S. secretary will  deal with the Israeli government.</p>

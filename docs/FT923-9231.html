			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Polls show decline in French support for European union THE FRENCH government announced the dates of the official campaign for next month's referendum on the Maastricht treaty yesterday as the latest poll showed a slightly smaller majority - of 56 per cent - planning to vote yes. The Paris stock market rose by 1 per cent before the poll results were unveiled as speculation that they showed a majority for Maastricht dispelled fears of a negative result. But shares faltered in the afternoon to close only slightly higher on the day, with the CAC 40 index up 0.58 per cent at 1,798. The poll, conducted by the BVA research consultancy for today's edition of Paris-Match magazine, showed that, of those who had decided to take part, 56 per cent would vote for the treaty and 44 per cent against. The result marks a new low in support for European union less than seven weeks before the September 20 referendum, which is seen elsewhere in Europe as a decisive test of public opinion. The poll confirms a steady decline in support, following an IFOP poll in Tuesday's Liberation newspaper which indicated that 57 per cent of the French planned to vote yes and 43 per cent no, compared with 62 per cent in favour little more than a month ago. Most of the French have already taken a final decision as to which way to vote, according to the Paris-Match poll, with 69 per cent claiming to have 'definitely' decided. The French government will continue to run its press and poster advertising campaign in favour of Maastricht until Monday. A number of celebrity socialist sympathisers, including Mr Johnny Hallyday, the veteran pop star, have promised to campaign for in favour of a yes vote. Mr Paul Quiles, minister of the interior, yesterday announced that all commercially funded campaigns must stop at the end of this month. Official political campaigning will run from September 7 to 19 with television and radio airtime allocated to each political party according to their number of deputies and senators.

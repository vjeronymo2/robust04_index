			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Yule Catto rises to Pounds 21.8m YULE CATTO, the ind-ustrial chemicals and building products group, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 21.8m in 1991 in spite of 'the continuing recession which affected many of the markets served by group companies'. Turnover advanced to Pounds 265m (Pounds 254m). Lord Catto, chairman, said the speciality chemicals division contributed record profits through the realisation of marketing and organisational strategies developed in earlier years. Many of the building product companies 'fared surprisingly well' given the present trading conditions. The group was fortunate in having a wide spread of business within the European Community, Lord Catto said, with a number of companies still experiencing reasonable if slower growth in their domestic markets. He was confident that the division had contained the deterioration in order books and that current activity levels were satisfactory. On current trading, operating results were ahead both of internal targets and the corresponding period of 1991. After tax of Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 6.71m) and minorities, earnings per share amounted to 16.1p against 14.2p. The proposed final dividend is lifted to 3.1p for a total of 5.4p (4.7p). There was an extraordinary credit of Pounds 4.25m (Pounds 938,000 debit) resulting from the sale of the Malaysian plantations in January 1991. Net borrowings at the year end were reduced to Pounds 11.5m compared with a high of Pounds 35.2m at the end of 1990 because of the acquisitions made in that year. During 1991 the sale of the plantations realised Pounds 16.5m in total while continuing operations contributed net cash of Pounds 7.2m.</p>

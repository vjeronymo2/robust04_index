			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Motorola surges 64% but warns of growth slowdown Motorola, the US electronics and semiconductor group, reported a 64 per cent rise in net profits from Dollars 224m to Dollars 367m for the second quarter, but said higher interest rates could slow the pace of growth in the US market. In April Motorola's shares lost about 10 per cent of their value when Wall Street took fright at earnings growth that fell short of its expectations. Analysts had ratcheted up their forecasts after being surprised by higher-than-expected earnings in earlier quarters. Turnover in the second quarter rose from Dollars 3.94bn to Dollars 5.44bn. Net margin on sales was 6.7 per cent compared with 5.7 per cent a year earlier and 6.6 per cent in the first quarter. Fully diluted earnings per share, restated for a two-for-one share split in April, rose from 40 cents a year earlier to 63 cents. Half-year earnings rose from Dollars 428m to Dollars 665m. In the general systems sector, sales rose by 75 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn and orders rose 46 per cent. Semiconductor sales rose 23 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn and orders were up 17 per cent, Motorola said. Communications sales rose 26 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn and orders rose 28 per cent. Mr Gary Tooker, vice-chairman and chief executive, said US markets had been doing very well, although interest rates could moderate the rate of growth. European and Japanese markets were strengthening, and the company was experiencing high rates of growth in the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and emerging markets.</p>

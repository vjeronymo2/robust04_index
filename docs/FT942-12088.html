			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / EU uses more unleaded petrol: World News Digest Use of unleaded petrol in the European Union has accelerated past leaded fuel for the first time, the EU's statistics office, Eurostat, said yesterday. Unleaded petrol accounted for 53.3 per cent of all petrol used in the Union last year, up from 47.1 per cent in 1992 and 40.7 per cent in 1991. Eight years ago, unleaded petrol accounted for less than 1 per cent of the total, Eurostat said. The 'greenest' country in the Twelve - at least as far as petrol is concerned - is Germany. It accounted for 48 per cent of EU use of unleaded fuel which took 88.7 per cent of its domestic market. However, in domestic terms, the second greenest country was Denmark where unleaded petrol took 75.6 per cent of the domestic market, followed by the Netherlands where it accounted for 75.1 per cent.</p>

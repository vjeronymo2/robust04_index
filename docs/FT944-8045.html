			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: Grant-maintained schools spending plans exaggerated by 40 per cent The cross-party Commons education select committee yesterday said the Department for Education's spending plans for grant-maintained schools which have opted out of local authority control had been exaggerated by 40 per cent, John Authers writes. It said the figures were 'inconsistent and implausible' and risked undermining education expenditure planning. Early last year the department predicted that by January this year there would be 700,000 pupils in grant-maintained schools, with 1m by April this year. But instead the number of schools opting out has subsided and only 550,000 pupils were taught in the sector by the start of this year, 600,000 in April and 620,000 by October. It meant that by April the number of pupils in grant-maintained schools was 40 per cent below the level planned for by the government. The MPs said the department's spending projections suggested either that growth would have to be reduced or that there was a 'systematic understatement' of what was happening. They dismissed officials' claims that the figures were not predictions but 'working assumptions'. The report said: 'Semantic fine-tuning cannot hide the fact that the department's projections for grant-maintained pupils numbers have proved very inaccurate. 'If it were to turn out that many more of the government's plans were merely working assumptions with no real substance, the whole basis of the public expenditure planning process could be jeopardised.' The committee's comments come as a further blow to ministers who are campaigning to encourage schools to opt out. Labour has said that grant-maintained schools would be returned to some form of 'local democratic accountability' which has further curbed the numbers opting out. It added that the department had to 'improve its quality control'.</p>

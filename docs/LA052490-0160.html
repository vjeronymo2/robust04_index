			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NATIVE PLANTS AND SHRUBS LOWER THE WATER BILL  </P> <P> By using a combination of drought-tolerant native and non-native plants in the  garden, you can conserve water and still enjoy an array of color, texture,  shapes and scents unique to the region.  </P> <P> Summer is the time to plan, not plant.  </P> <P> Fall is the best time to plant native plants; the air is cool and the soil is  still warm. During the first year, more frequent watering is needed, but once  established, these plants are summer teetotalers and thrive year in and year  out.  </P> <P> A starter list of some popular drought-tolerant, flowering native shrubs  well-suited to the San Fernando Valley's semi-arid terrain:  </P> <P> * Manzanita: Attractive for its smooth, shiny elliptic green leaves and  red-brown stems. Grows to 6 feet or more on hilly landscapes. Mid-winter/early  spring yield spectacular small, waxy white flowers.  </P> <P> * California lilac: Large, spreading shrub with stiff, shiny branchlets and  small green leaves covered in early spring with clusters of white to pale-blue  blossoms.  </P> <P> * Buckwheat: Native to chaparral. Grows up to 8 feet in height, depending on  species. Clouds of pale yellow, pink, white or red flowers bloom into summer.  </P> <P> * Nevin's barberry: Saved from extinction in the wilds of the Valley by the  Theodore Payne Foundation. Native dense shrub valuable for distinct bluish  foliage and yellow flowers followed by reddish berries in late summer. Arching  branches that reach to the ground are useful as a hedge and bird sanctuary.  </P> <P> * Currant: Small, pinkish spring flowers. Tolerates drought, but loves oak tree  shade. Currants are edible in syrups and pies if sweetened.FRANN BART  </P></p>

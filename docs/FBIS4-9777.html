			<p>BFN     [Text] Council of Ministers Decree No. 186 establishes a  schedule of fines for violations of the regulations of the  self-employment decree. Fines of up to 1,500 pesos and the  confiscation of supplies and products were established by  articles of Decree No. 186, which went into effect on 22 March.    Under Article 2 of this decree, anyone performing an  activity  not legally authorized will be fined 1,500 pesos, and the  supplies and products involved will be confiscated. Similarly,  anyone who is performing an authorized activity but doing so  without a license, will be fined 1,200 pesos.    Decree No. 186 also establishes other fines: There is a  1,200-peso fine for people using middlemen, and 1,200-peso fines  for the middlemen themselves. Decree No. 186 also lists fines  for, among other violations: rendering services or selling  products in unauthorized locations, abusing market conditions  for profit, and failing to comply with health requirements.    Decree No. 186 complements the September 1993 Decree No. 141  on self-employment. As you will recall, Decree No. 141  authorizes more than 130 self-employment jobs. Certain  self-employment jobs, particularly in Havana, are at present  undergoing review: For example, no new licences to work as taxi  drivers or light meal producers are being issued, and  specifically banned is the job of flower-grower and/or  flower-vendor.    There are 42,600 authorized self-employed workers in Havana  at the present time. The majority of these are in Diez de  Octubre, Arroyo Naranjo, Centro Habana, Plaza de la Revolucion,  and Playa Municipalities. These workers are primarily  concentrated in approximately 70 open-air markets organized  thoroughout the city.</p>

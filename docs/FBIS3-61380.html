			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with S. Topal by S. Fedorova; place and date not </F> given: "The `Gagauz Budget' Could Be Called Regional"]    [Text] The election campaign in the republic has  introduced disagreements to the South, previously united in its  positions. The decision of the Chadyr-Lungskiy District Soviet  to participate in the elections for a new Parliament of Moldova  has evoked an angry response in the administration of the  region. The local soviets were dissolved in connection with this  document. The Supreme Soviet of the region, however, whose  position coincides with the policy of its leadership, has been  preserved.    Nonetheless, there has been movement in the dialogue  between Komrat and Chisinau. It is the economy that is prompting  this primarily. The Bujak steppe, whose main income was and  remains agriculture, under the conditions of isolation has been  condemned to quite a meager existence. It is the understanding  of this that is the basis of the decision of the Chadyr-Lungskiy  deputies.    Our interview with Stepan Topal, chief of the  administration of the region, deals with the new situation in  the southern districts and the progress of the dialogue with  Chisinau.    [Fedorova] If it is no secret, the essence of your last  meeting with Moldovan President M. Snegur. On whose initiative  did it take place, incidentally?    [Topal] It dealt with a settlement of relations concerning  the budget. A year ago we raised the question of the region's  own budget and payments into the republic coffers.  Unfortunately, the Ministry of Finance did not settle this  problem. We then independently voted our own budget in the  Parliament. Payments to Moldova's coffers have been made  punctiliously. We understand that payments for health care and  the defense of the state, since we are a part of it, and so  forth are necessary. A year has passed, we have come to think  differently; there has been some change in this respect in  Chisinau also, and there is hope that we can come to some  arrangement. This, therefore, was followed by the proposal that  the two parties sit down and talk out the current problems. The  response, though, was as follows: Your budget is illegal. But a  fact is fact, and we have been in existence for three years now.  If you do not like the wording "Gagauz budget," you can call it  a regional budget. We want monies for our own needs to stay here  in the region.    [Fedorova] Are you encountering what is being called a  financial blockade of the southern areas?    [Topal] I would speak, rather, about an economic blockade.  What is meant by this? Agreements between the Government of  Moldova and our farms on the supply of agricultural products  (grain, milk, meat, tobacco, sunflower seed, and so forth) were  signed at the start of the year. In exchange the appropriate  departments undertook to supply us with energy resources. We are  fulfilling the government order, but we have received only 50-60  percent of the promised fuel. As a result 10,000 hectares have  gone unplowed.    [Fedorova] Considering the situation in Chadyr-Lunga, can it  be said that the opinion of the Gagauz in respect to the  forthcoming parliamentary elections in Moldova is unequivocal?    [Topal] The leadership's decision is unequivocal. There is  the decision of the Parliament on nonparticipation in the  elections prior to the Moldovan leadership's settlement of the  Gagauz issue. We held rallies in the villages of Chadyr-Lungskiy  District, and they confirmed our decision.    [Fedorova] But the district soviet went on record with a  different decision, nonetheless....    [Topal] Half the deputies of the district soviet are  Bulgarians. Their position is different from ours. But we  believe that they are wrong in deciding for the Gagauz in this  instance. This was the reason for the subsequent edict on the  dissolution of the local soviets.    [Fedorova] In counting on continuing the dialogue with  Chisinau, what will Komrat defend? Can it agree to a culturally  autonomous formation and the relative economic independence of  the region, toward which, generally, current realities are  pushing it?    [Topal] We will talk about a federation for we need some  political guarantees in the future. Life is no worse for  European countries formed according to this principle.    [Fedorova] Nonetheless, some things are changing. The  retransfer of the Bujak battalion to the command of the Moldovan  Ministry of Internal Affairs points to this. Gagauz guardsmen  will now, as far as we know, be called carabinieri....    [Topal] This decision was connected with the need to somehow  legitimize the armed formations, and to socially protect the  officers. The carabinieri will be formed from local inhabitants,  and the candidates for brigade commander will be recommended by  us and approved in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Moldova.  This formation will uphold public order.    [Fedorova] Who will finance it?    [Topal] The local budget.    [Fedorova] The local police operate according to the same  principle: They are composed mainly of Gagauz, but come under  the jurisdiction of the district department of the republic's  Ministry of Internal Affairs.    [Topal] Yes, the principle of dual subordination will  operate.    [Fedorova] You recently returned from Turkey, but were, I  believe, heading for America....    [Topal] The purpose of the trip had, indeed, been the United  States, to which I had been invited to an assembly of Turkic  peoples. Chisinau would not draw up a visa for America so I went  to Istanbul, hoping to get one there. But here I had to change  my plans since it was explained to me that putting together the  requisite papers takes quite some time. After several meetings  with our students in Turkey and members of the Turkish  Parliament and also with the Red Crescent mission, therefore, I  came home.    [Fedorova] Does the Red Crescent mission mean possible  humanitarian assistance?    [Topal] Yes. We received such in the spring. They promise  further assistance.    [Fedorova] Are there any investments of Turkish  entrepreneurs  in the Bujak steppe? We were counting on this here a year ago  even....    [Topal] Not as yet. Unless we count several private bakeries  built in Komrat, Chadyr-Lunga, and Vulkaneshty. But there has  been cultural assistance. Our students are being taught in  Turkey, and their grants are being paid by the Turkish  Government. We are being helped with literature and textbooks.    [Fedorova] Is this assistance being rendered on the basis of  the intergovernmental Moldovan-Turkish agreements?    [Topal] Yes.    [Fedorova] At what level is Komrat in contact with Chisinau?    [Topal] Vice Premier Oliynik and the ministers of internal  affairs and security have been here. Although there are no  planned negotiations, there have been meetings with the top  leadership. Very soon there will be a meeting with M. Snegur, I  believe. We have proposed it.</p>

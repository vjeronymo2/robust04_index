The newspaper EXTRA reported that the self-styled Autonomist  Movement of Guanacaste for Bread, Work, and Dignity [Movimiento  Autonomista de Guanacaste por Pan, Trabajo y Dignidad] has  issued a communique stating that "we are at their disposal to  send combatants."    Jose Antonio Korea, the group's information [divulgacion]  secretary, said that the organization has been present in other  struggles, such as those in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama.    He added that Guanacaste residents identify with those of  Chiapas, where the EZLN has staged a rebellion, because the  Mayas influenced the two cultures.    According to this leader, his group has "people ready" to be  sent to fight in southern Mexico.</p>

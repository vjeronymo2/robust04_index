Informed sources in the Russian gas company Gazprom told  Interfax its management had sent an official telegram to Ukraine  demanding that the latter honor its commitments under a  Russian-Ukrainian March 10 protocol and a contract between  Gazprom and the Ukrainian gas enterprise Ukrgazprom.    In the protocol, Ukraine pledged to give Gazprom shares in  its gas enterprises and pay by April 1 $100 Mn of the total debt  of nearly $900 Mn.    The Gazprom sources said Ukraine had still not made a list  of  enterprises where Gazprom would have interest or determined the  size of the Russian company's shares in them.    To date Ukraine has paid $59 Mn of the $100-Mn sum to be  paid  by the end of this month. According to some sources, Ukraine  also continues siphoning off some of the Russian gas pipelined  to Western Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The deposed leader of the Islamic Party, [IP], Dr.  Abdulah Gamieldien, has announced his resignation from the  party. Dr. Gamieldien, who was ordered by the Cape Town Supreme  Court last week to repay election funds, said he had decided to  hold onto the funds until the IP's leadership problems had been  resolved. He told SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  radio news it was his intention to hand over the funds to a  properly functioning body and not to a party that was in  disarray. Dr. Gamieldien said he would not vote in the coming  election and called on Muslims to think carefully before voting  for a Muslim-oriented party.</p>

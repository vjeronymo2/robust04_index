			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Management: The point is to raise the game - Andrew Campbell argues that detractors of strategic planning should focus on the execution, not the idea The last few months have brought a torrent of bad news for strategic planning. Henry Mintzberg's polemic The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning* has been reinforced by a pamphlet from OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants which concludes that 'the humane thing to do with most strategic planning processes is to kill them off'. More recently, a research report by America's Planning Forum states that only 25 per cent of companies consider their planning processes to be effective. Like Mintzberg, a Canadian professor who for 20 years has been one of the most influential writers about strategy, we could conclude that managers should stop this futile exercise and start doing something more useful with their time. Wrong. Strategic planning is not futile. Research at the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre has shown that some companies - both conglomerates and more focused groups - have strategic planning processes that add real value. They include ABB, BTR, Emerson Electric and General Electric. Large companies consist of a number of business units linked together by a corporate hierarchy. This creates a number of planning tasks. Each business unit needs a strategy of some sort to guide the actions of the business managers. The corporation as a whole also needs some corporate-level strategy to guide the actions of the corporate-level managers. Finally, there should be some connection between the corporate-level strategy and the business unit strategies. No sane manager, not even Mintzberg, would argue that these tasks are irrelevant. What is being debated is the effectiveness of planning processes as a mechanism for executing them. Mintzberg would argue that the nature of strategy development makes it an inappropriate topic for structured planning processes. Strategy should be crafted around insights and discoveries using experiments and learning processes, not planning documents and formal presentations. So why do some companies have great planning processes? The reason is that these processes are not designed to develop corporate-level strategy or to develop the business unit strategies, they are designed to enable the corporate-level managers to influence the strategies that have been developed by business unit managers. Possibly the best documented example is the planning process at Emerson, a US company which is much admired for its management style and techniques. The envy of most planners for its effectiveness and status with management, Emerson's process is described, both by division managers and corporate centre executives, as the heart of the company's management philosophy. It involves large amounts of analysis, hefty documentation (with 70 required charts) and day-long review meetings. Superficially, it appears to have all the hallmarks of a bureaucracy out of control. The process works because corporate managers have discovered that it is possible to raise the performance of certain types of electrical product businesses by influencing the managers in certain ways. For instance, the margins of a newly acquired business can be improved from around 10 per cent to around 15 per cent not only by focusing on more profitable products, but also by benchmarking costs against best practice. Market share can be improved by unusually precise choice of segments. As a result, detailed analyses are required of measures such as profitability by product and market share by segment. The day-long reviews are gruelling, often confrontational, events in which Chuck Knight, Emerson's chief executive, pushes businesses to go for more stretching targets, arguing his case based on the information they have provided, work done by his planning staff and benchmarks from other businesses, both within Emerson and outside. The company's corporate-level strategy is about helping electrical and electronic businesses to raise their game, and its strategic planning process is designed to make it happen. Knight is clear about what he wants to do. The planning process, which has been refined for more than 20 years, is his mechanism for making it happen. Contrast this with the average company. Each year the corporate centre managers look at the business plans with no clear sense of how to react to them. They probe and challenge to test the quality of these plans. They add up the numbers and find a shortage of profit or cash. They then make some arbitrary reduction in capital expenditure or increase in profit targets. They hope each year that the round of discussions will give them greater clarity about the corporate-level strategy, but each year they are disappointed, and present to the board something that is little more than the sum of the business strategies. As one manager commented: 'Each year I go into the review fired up with new enthusiasm. Each year I come out disillusioned.' It is not surprising then that only 25 per cent of companies consider their planning processes to be effective, and that consultants such as OC&amp;C suggest these wheel-spinning processes should be killed off. If your company has an unsatisfactory strategic planning process, it is not because planning is an inappropriate activity. It is because the corporate centre managers do not know what they are doing. The problem will not be solved by tinkering with the forms, formats, timetables or attendance. It will only be solved when the corporate centre develops a value-creating, corporate-level strategy and builds the management processes needed to implement it. *Prentice Hall, Pounds 19.95.

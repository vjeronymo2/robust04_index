He complained about the increase directly to  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in a telephone call  early in the morning. The increase was not released by the  Finance Ministry the previous afternoon, and this has been a  practice in the Itamar Franco government. Newspapers and  television stations learned about the increase through the  distribution companies, while the resolution was not published  by the official gazette until 11 January.    In addition to complaining about the increase granted on the  sly, President Franco ordered that, as of now, all new increases  will be implemented only after advance notice to the public. It  was the president himself who, in the beginning of his  government, adopted this initiative that fuel price  readjustments would be implemented only after notifying  consumers at least 12 hours in advance. "There will be no more  increases in the dead of the night," President Franco said then.    According to Planalto Palace spokesman Francisco Baker,  President Franco was aware of the fuel price increase, but he  complained about the "failure in communication" that prevented  the announcement of new prices to the public. As of 0000 last  night the gasoline price increased to 219 real cruzeiros per  liter, alcohol prices to 172 real cruzeiros, while diesel oil  went up to 136 real cruzeiros per liter.</p>

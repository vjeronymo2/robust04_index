			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> BICYCLE REGISTRATION DRIVE SCHEDULED  </P> <P> Because only about 300 bicycles are registered in this city of 75,000,  officials are holding a bicycle registration day Saturday at the Oso Viejo  Community Center.  </P> <P> "It's real important," said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. George Johnson. "We do  it to get people's bikes back to them when they are stolen."  </P> <P> More than 150 bicycles were reported stolen in Mission Viejo last year, he  said. In areas of the county served by the Sheriff's Department, more than 600  bicycles lacking identification were recovered but couldn't be returned to  their owners.  </P> <P> The registration at the community center, 24932 Oso Viejo Road, will be held  between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. Cost for a three-year permit is $2.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL SNAG POSES A NEW THREAT TO HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER PLAN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: STATE WARNS THE CITY AGAINST BUILDING MORE RESTAURANTS NEAR THE  OCEAN, FURTHER IMPERILING THE CONTROVERSIAL PIERSIDE VILLAGE PROJECT.  </P> <P> State regulators have warned city officials that they cannot legally build more  restaurants on the ocean side of Pacific Coast Highway -- a stand that could  threaten a key piece of the city's multimillion-dollar redevelopment effort.  </P> <P> The powerful State Lands Commission has also hinted that it would go to court  to halt construction of any restaurants in the controversial Pierside Village  project.  </P> <P> "The state, based upon the advice of the office of the attorney general,  continues to assert that the entire area is a dedicated public access and beach  recreational area," said Dwight E. Sanders, chief of the State Lands  Commission's division of research and planning.  </P> <P> Sanders made the comment last month in a blistering letter to city officials in  which he stated that the commission strongly disagreed with the city's  environmental impact report on Pierside Village.  </P> <P> The city's assessment, released in late July, concluded that the restaurant  project would have no major impact on the ocean-bluff land at Main Street and  Pacific Coast Highway. But the State Lands Commission contends that the city is  legally bound to keep public easements near the municipal pier free of further  commercial construction.  </P> <P> Plans for Pierside Village call for at least three major restaurants, including  a new building for the existing Maxwell's restaurant. The project also includes  plazas, promenades, multilevel public parking and small takeout food services  for beach-goers.  </P> <P> Supporters of Pierside Village, including Councilman John Erskine, criticized  the State Lands Commission this week for opposing the project, which they  consider an important part of redevelopment at the pier.  </P> <P> "I think the documentation shows the project is an asset to the city and to the  community," Erskine said. "I see no environmental impact that can't be  mitigated."  </P> <P> The city's environmental report on Pierside Village states that land use was  among issues "not considered to be of significant concern" in the restaurant  project.  </P> <P> But critics of Pierside say that land use is at the heart of their opposition  and that the city should not build any more commercial structures on the ocean  side of Pacific Coast Highway.  </P> <P> Agreeing with the project's critics, the commission said in its letter to the  city that "the (environmental impact report's) indication that there is no  potential impact is seriously flawed."  </P> <P> But Erskine noted that much of the land-use criticism centers on charges of  "visual pollution." He said the environmental report clearly shows that there  would be little loss of ocean view if Pierside Village was built.  </P> <P> "I think the (report) goes into a lengthy review of the visual impact," Erskine  said. "I think the visual impacts are very minimal, and the visual enhancement  is very significant for those people who would be able to stand on the  promenade and view the ocean and the surfing action."  </P> <P> Geri Ortega, chairwoman of the city's Planning Commission and a critic of  Pierside Village, also disputes the project's environmental impact report.  </P> <P> "I agree with the State Lands Commission in their concern about this," Ortega  said. "There is a larger question involved, and that is about the appropriate  use of this public beach. The land is encumbered; it has an easement for public  access."  </P> <P> In 1932, the city of Huntington Beach sued several powerful owners of beach  property near the municipal pier, including Standard Oil, the Southern Pacific  Railway and the Huntington Beach Co. The city eventually won a court order that  granted a public-access easement over the beach land.  </P> <P> The State Lands Commission contends that the city is the permanent custodian of  that public easement and, therefore, cannot allow construction of any  non-recreational buildings on oceanfront land.  </P> <P> Debbie Cook, a spokeswoman for an environmental group called Save Our Parks,  said she is dismayed that the city is trying to build on the public easement.  </P> <P> "I can't, for the life of me, see why the city is still proceeding with this,  staring in the face of opposition from the State Lands Commission and the  attorney general's office," she said.  </P> <P> Cook and her husband, John Fisher, led a move earlier this year to qualify a  ballot measure for the city's Nov. 6 election. That measure, a proposed city  charter amendment, would forbid the city from selling or leasing any beach or  parkland unless specifically directed to by a vote of the people.  </P> <P> Cook said that if that proposal is approved by a majority of city voters, the  Pierside Village project will grind to a halt.  </P></p>

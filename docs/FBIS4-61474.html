			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Trushin] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires 5 May TASS -- Armenian Foreign Minister  Vagan Papazyan announced that "imperial ambitions are alien to  the Russian leadership. Praising Russian-Armenian relations, he  said that they are of principal importance in Armenia's foreign  policy, have historically been "very good," and remain so.    "We hope that the democratic changes which have begun on the  territory of the former Soviet Union will deepen and that, in  that connection, all such suspicions (of Russian imperialism)  will disappear," the foreign minister stated. "We need  partner-like relations, and they have now been established with  Russia," he told ITAR-TASS in Buenos Aires, where he is on an  official visit upon the invitation of the Government of  Argentina.    The Armenian foreign minister called for the unification of  Russian and CSCE efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh  problem. Both Russia and the European body are trying to unlock  the Karabakh conflict, but the existence of two separate  initiatives gives, mostly, Azerbaijan and also, partly,  Nagorno-Karabakh the freedom to tack between the two sides  without accepting either proposal, Papazyan said.    "Russia needs stability in the Caucasus. Therefore, it seems  to us, the Russian leadership is sincere in its approach to the  solution of that conflict," the minister noted. "The most  rational element in Russia's proposals is that it is impossible  to achieve a cease-fire without introducing separating forces.  Nobody except Russia is ready to send their troops into that  region. The Azerbaijan side has doubts about allowing the  introduction of Russian troops. However, if that is done in  cooperation with international institutes such as the CSCE and  UN, then Azerbaijan will have no grounds for concern," Papazyan  stressed.</p>

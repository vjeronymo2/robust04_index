			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Further provisions lead to Pounds 20m loss at MTM MTM, the fine chemicals company that has suffered a collapse in its share price this year, yesterday reported a Pounds 28m interim loss that included further provisions to cover reductions in net asset values. The results followed the removal late on Tuesday of Binder Hamlyn, the company's auditors throughout a sorry period that has seen the departure of Mr Richard Lines, the founder chairman, and the collapse of the shares from a high of 289p in February to 33p yesterday. Price Waterhouse has been appointed as the new auditors. The new provisions of Pounds 18.1m include a Pounds 10m reduction in the value of MTM's assets in addition to downward revaluation already included in MTM's delayed 1991 accounts. As a result the group's net assets are reduced to Pounds 15m against net debt currently standing at Pounds 100.6m. Mr Ken Schofield, the chief executive brought in to replace Mr Lines, said he hoped to have generated about Pounds 20m of cash through disposals before the year-end but that this would still leave the need for substantial injection of new capital. The Pounds 28m pre-tax loss was struck on sales of Pounds 56.5m. Losses per share were 31.4p and there will be neither an interim nor a final dividend. The company said comparison with last year's first half would be misleading because reported profits for that period had been materially overstated. Mr Schofield, who helped turn round Hickson International, said yesterday that he was more used to simply running chemical companies and that he had 'never been in this sort of fairy land before'. He had identified two core businesses in fine and performance chemicals supported by research, and the group would trim away about half its 18 productive sites. 'This year had been hit dramatically worse than I expected,' Mr Lines said, referring to the inflated values of assets in the books. There was however, considerable scope for simple improvements in operating efficiency and increasing capacity utilisation that would sharply improve profitability, he added. COMMENT Institutions which have watched MTM's share price plunge this year may find it mildly cheering that their company was so badly run by the previous management that it now represents a potentially very interesting recovery situation. They may need every ounce of phlegm in the next few months; if a slimmed down MTM with half the number of production sites is to emerge from gearing of more than 500 per cent, investors may have to provide Pounds 35-40m in a 1-for-1 rights issue or worse. Should they decide to throw in the towel, however, it would be a shame. With only a little additional productive capital expenditure, greater efforts to increase load factors and some more focused operational management, MTM could turn around quite quickly. Investors can also now be certain that with the arrival of Price Waterhouse as auditors, the old axis of former management, former advisers and former auditors has finally been broken and there really should be no more surprises like this period's further increase in asset revaluations.</p>

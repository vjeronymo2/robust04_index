			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Grania Langdon-Down, Crime Correspondent, PA News] </F>   [Text] The largest seizure of cocaine in the UK, valued at  250 million pounds sterling, was found in drums of bitumen on  its way from South America to Poland, it was disclosed today.    The 1,300 kilos of particularly high purity cocaine were  discovered in a consignment of 48 drums by officers who searched  a ship when it called in at Birkenhead, Merseyside, on January  24.    Customs officers removed the cocaine and substituted other  drums on board the Polish-American ship the MV Jurata, which was  en route from Venezuela to Poland, and tracked it to Gdynia  hoping to identify the smugglers, chief investigations officer  Douglas Tweddle said today.    One man is being interviewed by Polish police after the  drums  were delivered to a warehouse on the outskirts of Warsaw on  February 3, but customs officers were not able to identify the  Western European figures behind the deal.    Mr. Tweddle said: "This massive seizure confirms  intelligence  reports that the South American `narco barons' are targeting  cocaine shipments on Western Europe and are seeking to use South  American countries as a back door.    "We are delighted to have been able to work with the Polish  authorities to inflict this major blow on these drug  traffickers."    Customs believe some of the cocaine would have filtered on  to  the streets of the UK.    Forty officers were involved in Operation Ayala, named after  a racehorse which ran in the Grand National.    Customs identified the shipping route from South America to  former Soviet states as a likely path for cocaine shipments.    Based on that intelligence they decided to carry out an  intensive search of the MV Jurata's load. The crew of the ship  were not involved and the substitute drums were sent on  unnoticed.    It is the second large seizure of cocaine being routed by  the  South American cartels to Poland. UK customs tipped off Polish  authorities about another consignment which led to 520 kilos of  cocaine being seized in Poland.    Suspicion had fallen on 48 barrels of bitumen found in the  drums. The first one was genuine but the other 47 had inner  containers each packed with up to 30 kilos of cocaine.    They had been insulated to protect the drugs from the heat  of  the bitumen.    Mr. Tweddle said in early January they had been able to  identify a separate consignment travelling direct from South  America to Poland which enabled the authorities there to seize  520 kilos of cocaine.    The two operations meant the authorities had prevented two  tonnes of cocaine with a UK street value of 400 million pounds  sterling flooding on to the western European market.    "There is little doubt some of it would have ended up in  Britain, probably via Germany and Holland. We hope this success  will act as a catalyst for further ones in the future," Mr.  Tweddle said at the Customs House in London.    He said the Jurata was a "tramp steamer" which had stopped  off at Birkenhead to unload some legitimate cargo. It had then  stopped at Hamburg before completing its journey to Poland.    The seizure was the largest, not only in the UK, but also in  central and eastern Europe. There have been bigger hauls in  Spain and Holland.    "With the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the Customs  services in central and eastern Europe are not particularly well  developed and traffickers see places like Poland and Russia as  an easy back door to western Europe," he said.    The previous biggest UK haul -- 907 kilos -- was discovered  two years. [sentence as received]</p>

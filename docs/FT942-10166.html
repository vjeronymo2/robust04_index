			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gatt chief warns over China's status with US US failure to extend China's preferential trade access to the US market would complicate negotiations over Beijing's bid to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Peter Sutherland, the Gatt director general, said yesterday. He said that, although the issues of Gatt and Most Favoured Nation trading status were not 'directly related', the US posture on MFN would be critical to a successful outcome of the negotiations. Mr Sutherland, in Beijing for an international business seminar, told reporters: 'The US attitude is of central importance and that attitude will be signalled in one way or the other by events on the MFN issue.' Since his arrival in Beijing on Tuesday, the Gatt chief has urged a speedy conclusion of China's negotiations to resume Gatt status and prepare itself to be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation when that is formed next year. But the director general also made clear that contracting parties to the WTO would insist that China continue to pursue trade liberalisation and other steps required to facilitate access to its huge domestic market. He said that among particular concerns were the lack of transparency in China's trade rules, haphazard application of the trade regime, an absence of certainty in the treatment of imports (including the imposition of hidden quotas), and the anti-competitive activities of the Chinese monopolistic state trading corporations. 'I believe that China would be well advised to take these concerns seriously,' he said. US President Bill Clinton is due, by early next month, to rule on whether to extend MFN to China for another year. He has indicated in the past week that he favours an extension. US and European negotiators are preparing for bilateral discussions with the Chinese on Gatt issues, in preparation for a meeting of the China 'working party' on Gatt, due for in Geneva late next month. Gatt negotiations can be expected to accelerate after MFN renewal. Mr Sutherland has indicated that he hopes China may be in a position to sign a draft protocol within the next few months.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Coal is called "food"  of industry in Korea.    The history of socialist economic construction in the  country  began with developing coal resources and upgrading coal  industry. The state defined the coal industry as one of the  domains that should be kept ahead of other domains of the  national economy and has all along directed big efforts to it.    In the 1970s when most countries around the world were  depending on oil in industrial development Korea developed the  industrial sectors feeding on the rich domestic coal resources  as its fuel, raw material and power resources, thus building a  powerful independent national economy. The state has increased  the production capacity of the existing coal mines 3.5 times  over the past 30 years by steadily increasing investments in the  coal industry. And it has constructed 40 odd coal mines and  over 50 pits in promising areas.    The coal industry is now turning out in a few days as much  coal as was produced in the whole year of 1946.    Korea produced 27.5 million tons of coal in 1970 to reach  the  level of the developed industrial states in the coal output per  head of the population in those days. The annual output hit  the 85 million ton mark in the 1980s.    The rapid development of industry resulted in the ever  increasing demand for coal. With a view to satisfying the  demand for coal, the state put forward the task to boost the  coal output 30 percent in the adjustment period (1994-1996).  Big efforts are being made nationwide to hit the goal.    New coal deposits have been found in different parts of the  country. With the discovery of promising coal deposits in  Yanggang Province which has been dependent on other areas for  coal, prospects have opened for meeting the local demand by  itself.    The construction of new coal mines and pits is progressing  and undertakings to carry out a comprehensive mechanization of  pit work are gathering momentum.    The laying of a belt conveyor line to increase the transport  capacity in the pits of Yongdung, Changan, Sochang and Sunchon  area coal mines and a project to increase production capacity of  the Kangdong area coal mines have reached the final stage.    Work is making a successful progress to move up the date of  commissioning of the coal mines and pits under construction in  Anju and the northern region and to complete the comprehensive  mechanisation of pit work at the June 13 coal mine, the Hakpo  coal mine, etc.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Sopranos fall flat - Off the Wall The Three Tenors are having a return match. They are getting together in Pasadena just before the start of the World Cup in June hoping to repeat the success of their last venture into popular culture, which took them spinning up the pop charts. The incentive is a Dollars 12m fee. But while Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras are all reasonable men, prepared to drown their rivalries in return for money in the bank, no such good fortune followed an attempt to cash in with The Three Sopranos. Kiri Te Kanawa, Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle were invited to get together in Vienna on another money making spree. The ladies could not even agree on their frocks and the idea was quickly abandoned. It is hard to mention international singers without referring to money. Domingo has been approached to star in the movie version of Phantom of the Opera, a booking which could be worth around Dollars 20m. He is very keen, but wants to test himself in the role first. So plans are afoot to give him a week's trial in the stage version. Its quite possible that anyone with a ticket for Phantom at the Haymarket in the next few months could be sharing the experience with a cuddly Spanish tenor. This week Covent Garden made its pitch for millennium money. In the dear, dead, old days of the late 1980s it hoped to finance the badly needed renovation of the Opera House by renting out offices and shops on the site. It has now re-launched the scheme, substituting as fairy godmother, the Millennium Fund for offices. The cost now will be around Pounds 100m. The Millennium Fund will be one of the five beneficiaries of the Lottery when it comes on stream next year. No one knows how much people will bet: if they are cautious then around Pounds 70m a year will be available for Millennium projects; if they love the idea it could be Pounds 200m. If the higher target is reached then Covent Garden stands a good chance of scooping some of the cash set aside for London. The Lottery Commissioners have made it clear they will spread the largesse around the country, and the London tranche is already being fought over by the new Tate Gallery of Modern Art; a smartened up South Bank; an Albertropolis of museums in Kensington; and a theme park in Greenwich. By getting its bid in early Covent Garden hopes for the best. It should know by early next year whether it has been chosen as a millennium project. It will then launch its public appeal. The ideal financial break down for the project would be around Pounds 15m from commercial rents; Pounds 35m from the Lottery; and the remaining Pounds 50m from rich and loyal friends like Lord Sainsbury, Lord Rothschild, and Mrs Vivien Duffield. If all goes well Covent Garden will close for rebuilding in the autumn of 1997; move temporarily to the Theatre Royal Drury Lane; and return to the Royal Opera House by the autumn of 2000 in time for the millennial celebrations. When asked to name his achievements at the Arts Council, out-going boss Anthony Everitt boldly plumped for Arts 2000. This was Lord Palumbo's wheeze under which a different city or region hosted a different art form each year up to the millennium. It has proved a hit and miss affair, getting off to a good start with Birmingham City of Music in 1992; faltering with East Midlands Region of Dance last year; and certainly helping Manchester City of Drama 1994 to keep open theatres which had been faced with closure because of capping. Swansea City of Literature in 1995 has had terrible management problems but now the council has stepped in to avoid humiliation; and Northern Region is hosting the Visual Arts in 1996. This week, rather surprisingly, East of England beat off bids by Devon &amp; Cornwall and Leeds to become the region of Opera and Musical Theatre in 1997. It is getting Pounds 500,000 from the Council, the largest grant to date, to make good its ambitious policy of new commissions.</p>

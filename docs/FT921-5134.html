			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Late arrival at rail charter ball: BR's delayed compensation system TWO CHEERS were all the Central Transport Consultative Committee, the statutory rail users' watchdog, could muster for the passenger's charter unveiled yesterday. Even that modest praise was all but drowned by criticism from other quarters. On a positive note, the charter is believed to be the first attempt by any railway in the world to introduce a systemised compensation scheme for season-ticket holders. But in spite of attempts to keep the charter simple, the arrangements are complex, potentially confusing and riddled with loopholes. They will in many cases give passengers the same or worse compensation than they receive under BR's existing arrangements. The long delay in producing the charter - originally due last autumn - is indicative of the difficulties which the government and BR have met in trying to live up to the expectations of the Citizen's Charter. At root was the problem of cost. Without government funding, BR could not afford to be more generous with compensation unless it put up fares or cut investment - in both cases this would hit the people it was trying to help. Even so, BR has budgeted for an increase in the compensation fund from Pounds 7m a year to Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m, but the right to automatic refunds and the extension of benefits to commuters means the money will have to be spread among a far higher number of potential claimants. The result is that many are likely to find themselves worse off than they were before. Under the old system, BR could afford to be generous with compensation because so few people knew it was prepared to give any. The biggest strain on resources will come from Network SouthEast commuters. These have been among the worst victims of poor performance because they have lacked the evidence to support their claims of persistently bad timekeeping. Now Network SouthEast will not only keep the records for them but put up posters declaring the results and invite claims if certain performance targets are not met. The targets will be dif-ferent for each of Network SouthEast's main routes. Recently modernised routes such as the Great Northern will be expected to run 99 per cent of scheduled rush-hour trains and get 90 per cent of them to their destinations within five minutes of the scheduled time. If they fall short on punctuality by more than 1 percentage point or reliability by more than 3 percentage points, they will offer a 5 per cent discount on season-ticket renewals. If they fail on both, the discount will be 10 per cent. One loophole is that the worst performing lines will have much softer targets. The unmodernised London, Tilbury and Southend line, for example, will be required to run only 97 per cent of trains and deliver only 80 per cent within five minutes of the scheduled time. The Consumers' Association said: 'Performance standards as low as 80 per cent reveal the truly abysmal expectations BR has of its service. It's like admitting that one-in-five passengers is guaranteed to step off a train angry and late.' BR's defence is that fare increases will be lower on the unmodernised lines. Further, it denies that the targets are too soft - four Network SouthEast lines would have failed on the basis of last year's performance, it says. Asimilar scheme will be introduced for commuters elsewhere on the system. InterCity and Regional Railways will be expected to run 99 per cent of trains and get 90 per cent to their destinations within 10 minutes of the scheduled time (five minutes for short routes). If performance falls short on a route its commuters will get discounts on the same basis as on Network SouthEast. Compensation for people making one-off journeys has become, if anything, less generous. Travel vouchers will become the normal form of recompense, cash refunds being offered only in exceptional circumstances. Delays of an hour or more will earn a voucher for 20 per cent of the ticket price paid - a claim for anything more than this will require special pleading. However, claims for delays of anything less than one hour, say 50 minutes, will be automatically disqualified unless a special case can be made. Commuter services operated by local authorities in all the metropolitan areas outside London are excluded from the compensation arrangements although it is hoped that they may be brought into the scheme later. Some measures are likely to achieve widespread support. Rail staff in contact with the public will be required to wear name badges; performance figures will be monitored by an independent auditor; and trains with buffet cars held up for more than an hour will give out free drinks - though not alcoholic ones.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     THE PASSENGER'S CHARTER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Vouchers worth 20 per cent or more of journey price for passengers delayed over one hour.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Refunds for passengers who decide not to travel because their train is delayed.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Refunds and compensation vouchers for seat and sleeper reservations not honoured.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 90 per cent of InterCity and long distance services to arrive within ten minutes of schedule, short distance 90 per cent within five minutes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Reliabilty target - 99 per cent of services to run.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Network SouthEast punctuality standards to vary from 80 per cent to 90 per cent within five minutes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Season ticket holders: 5 per cent discount on ticket renewal if either punctuality target is missed by up to 3 per cent or reliabilty by 1 per cent on average over a year. 10 per cent discount if targets are are missed by more.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BR to report every four weeks on its performance.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Punctuality    Reliabilty                           target*        target**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Great Northern               90            99 Northampton Line             90            99 Thames Link                  89            99 Chiltern                     88            99 South Western                88            99 Kent Link                    88            98 S.

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY;  </P> <P> LAKERS' DIVAC PROBABLY CAN DELAY ARMY STINT, YUGOSLAV OFFICIAL SAYS  </P> <P> Boris Stankovic of Yugoslavia, secretary general of the Federation of  International Basketball Associations (FIBA), confirmed reports that the  Lakers' first-round draft choice, center Vlade Divac, also has been drafted by  the Yugoslav army.  </P> <P> But he said Tuesday that he believes Divac, 21, will be able to postpone his  induction. According to Yugoslavian law, he must serve one year in the military  before his 27th birthday.  </P> <P> "It is very difficult to have discussions with our army after it has made a  decision, like all the armies in the world," Stankovic said on the first day of  the annual International Olympic Committee session here. He was elected to the  IOC last year.  </P> <P> "But I think our Yugoslavia basketball federation will help solve the problem.  There are some bad feelings on his part because we allowed him to go to the  United States, and now it seems like we are trying to take him back."  </P> <P> Although Stankovic won his campaign within FIBA to give NBA players eligibility  for international competitions, he said that he has lost hope that the U.S.  team in the world championships next summer in Argentina will include  professionals.  </P> <P> As for whether teams such as Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and West Germany will  be allowed to use NBA players from their countries in the world championships,  Stankovic said discussions are continuing between FIBA and the NBA.  </P> <P> En route to Puerto Rico from his office in Munich, Stankovic met with NBA  Commissioner David Stern in New York. "We have many, many, many problems,"  Stankovic said, declining to elaborate. "My feeling is that David Stern wants  the NBA players in our tournaments, including the Olympics, but it might be  after 1992."  </P> <P> On a related subject, Stankovic said that the world championships will be held  in Argentina as planned despite that country's financial problems. He said that  he has received three letters from Argentina's new government assuring FIBA  that the tournament has not been jeopardized by the economy.  </P> <P> Government officials were upset when the first Winter Pan American Games,  scheduled for September, were canceled because of a snow shortage. They feared  that the international sports community would perceive Argentina's cash  shortage as the real villain and become even more reluctant than they are now  to plan events there.  </P> <P> Philadelphia soccer fans turned out in record numbers last Friday for the U.S.  national team's game against the Soviet Union's Dnepr team and were rewarded  with a U.S. victory.  </P> <P> One of the largest crowds ever to watch the national team in the United States,  43,356, saw Erich Eichmann score in the first half on a pass from John  Stollmeyer and the U.S. made that goal stand up for a 1-0 victory at Franklin  Field.  </P> <P> If IOC members are disturbed by the massacre earlier this year at Beijing's  Tian An Men Square, they are not allowing it to affect the ascension of China's  He Zhenliang to one of the four vice-president positions. He is expected to be  elected without opposition this week.  </P> <P> IOC members also appear to be comfortable with plans to hold next year's Asian  Games at Beijing, which, in light of the events at Tian An Men Square, might  seem like an odd place to have a youth festival.  </P> <P> "We have assurances from the Asian Games organizing committee that the Games  will be held," said Kim Un Yong, an IOC executive board member from the city  that staged the 1986 Asian Games, Seoul. "All construction and projects are  going according to plan.  </P> <P> "Seoul had a lot of problems, too, before the Games. I'm not at all worried."  </P> <P> Speculating that because of China's political problems Beijing might have  difficulty mounting a successful bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, several  European cities, including Paris, Munich, Frankfurt and Milan, have expressed  interest.  </P> <P> But Kevan Gosper, an IOC executive board member from Australia, said that he  saw no evidence on his recent trip to Beijing that the city has abandoned its  plans for 2000.  </P> <P> "Everything that has been done for the Asian Games has been planned in such a  way that it can be expanded for a future Olympic bid," he said.  </P> <P> Moscow's drug-testing laboratory, which is trying to regain its status as an  IOC lab after having been decertified earlier this year, was criticized here  this week by the president of the Soviet Union's Olympic Committee, Marat  Gramov.  </P> <P> Responding to the positive drug test of Soviet shotputter Alexander Bagach at  the recent European Cup at Gateshead, England, Gramov said that the excess  testosterone in the athlete's system should have been discovered by the Moscow  laboratory. Bagach was cleared by a Moscow test before departing for England.  </P> <P> As a result of Bagach's disqualification, the Soviet Union will not be allowed  to send its entire men's team to next week's World Cup at Barcelona.  </P> <P> The Soviets were second to Great Britain in the men's team standings but  dropped to third behind East Germany after losing the points that Bagach scored  for his third-place finish. Only the top two teams advance.  </P> <P> There were suspicions about Bagach after he improved from 11th in the Soviet  Union last year to fifth in the world this year.  </P> <P> A perestroika note: Gramov recently presided over a Soviet Olympic Committee  meeting to select a bid city for the 1998 Winter Olympics. There were three  candidates, which reportedly confused the delegates because, for the first  time, no one told them which one to support. They selected Sochi, which is  located on the Black Sea.  </P> <P> The IOC executive board did not act on Anita DeFrantz's proposal to ban all  athletes who test positive for drugs at the Olympics from participating in  future Games. If passed, the rule would not affect sprinter Ben Johnson because  it would not be retroactive.  </P> <P> The proposal will be discussed by the full session this week, then passed on to  the executive board for consideration next year.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's just me, but I don't understand how someone could be opposed to  this," said DeFrantz, an IOC member from Los Angeles. "If we're serious about  solving the drug problem, we say, 'That's it; you're not invited back,' to  athletes who are caught."  </P> <P> She said the rule also would cover coaches, trainers and anyone else who  assists athletes in the acquisition and use of banned drugs.  </P></p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Accountancy Column: First, last and the more things change - Worrying trends in the profession in the 1990s The contents of the first article and the first column I wrote on becoming accountancy correspondent could hardly have been more appropriate. They have set the tone well for the period up to my departure nearly three years later. The article concerned a change to professional ethical rules dictating who could call themselves 'chartered accountants'. Firms would be able to retain the title even if only three-quarters of their partners were in fact members of one of the chartered institutes. The column dealt with Chancery Bank, one of the more ambitious attempts to effect a corporate rescue using administration, the procedure created by the 1986 insolvency act. These two broad themes - the commercialisation of the profession and the varied and painful effects of the prolonged recession - came to dominate accountancy in the early 1990s. Within the next few days, Price Waterhouse laid off 150 staff in its management consultancy division, financial salaries dipped to their lowest levels in eight years, and one of the leading professional indemnity insurance underwriters warned of a sharp growth in litigation against accountants. The firms continued to create new and ever more bizarre specialist units offering services with barely a passing resemblance to accountancy. Other ethical rule changes (often meekly following in the wake of practices already under way) permitted practices such as cold-calling and contingency fees. Changes to the law requiring disclosure of the non-audit income generated from audit clients to any company revealed the enormous extent of consulting work carried out. On other issues, the accountancy firms have steadfastly refused to provide meaningful financial information about themselves. Nowhere was the intersection of insolvency and commercialism more powerfully illustrated than with the emergence of 'low-balling', with firms eagerly slashing their fees to retain clients or win them from competitors. It helped delay redundancies, but at what cost to the longer-term quality of the audit or the reputation of the firms? In short, nothing changes in the trends. Or where it does, it has generally been for the worse: whether for the profession, the accountancy firms, or for the preparers and the users of companies' accounts. While insolvency may have caused more obvious and immediate pain, growing commercialism arguably threatens to inflict greater long-term damage to any attempt by accountants to continue to call themselves members of a profession rather than simply another business. Yet, as an analyst listening to the tales of the disturbed accountant sitting on the consulting couch might put it, the profession went into heavy denial. Expectation gaps, calls for proof to justify the slightest criticism (when the firms refuse to reveal the data on which any analysis could be based), and the introduction of some tokenistic new rules all seemed easier ripostes than facing up to the real problems. It is easy for auditors to cry foul: to say that they are only sued because they have 'deep pockets', that the public is ignorant of their role and limitations, that company directors are the ones responsible for preparing accounts. Yet by law shareholders appoint the auditors with the single purpose of providing a reasonable assurance that the accounts show a true and fair view. The firms' staple product of the audit report has been understandably discredited by the experience of the last few years. A quick glance around the morgue of corporate carcasses shows that many companies collapsed with no warning signs from auditors examining their health just a few months before. An examination of the working papers after the event shows that the auditor was very often aware of many of the signs of impending doom - but said nothing publicly. By treating the symptoms, accountants have been able to demonstrate some apparent progress of late. The Accounting Standards Board has got off to a good start by introducing tough new rules which appear to close many of the more malleable ones of old. The Financial Reporting Review Panel has begun flexing its muscles, generating a climate of reform - through fear among finance directors, and probably at least as importantly among auditors, a number of whom have soon after ceased acting for reprimanded clients. But all this activity does nothing to affect the underlying cause of the financial reporting malaise. The climate may have temporarily swung against the mood of the late 1980s, and the absence of economic growth may have militated until now against aggressive financial transactions. However, the relationship between auditors and their clients remains unchanged. If the mood changes again, there is little that either the review panel or the accounting standards board can do to influence the private discussions that are only partially reflected in published accounts. The fundamental tension is how can an auditor, effectively hired, fired, paid by and reporting to executive management, act objectively and sometimes against its interests? As one senior accountant put it recently: 'It's like leaving the rabbits in charge of the lettuce'. This argument does not simply apply to audit fees. Accountants know few bounds when it comes to the range of work they are willing to undertake for companies. Conflicts of interest seem rarely to feature. Show a conflict to lawyers and they normally quickly withdraw. Accountants, by contrast, sweep aside objections by blithely claiming in the same breath both the importance of 'synergy' from existing experience, and yet simultaneously an easy ability to 'manage' any such tensions and prevent conflicts arising. These tensions are rarely acknowledged within the profession. When I suggested over a lunch a few months ago to a senior partner of a 'Big Six' firm that they might present problems, he gave a single-word reply  - unprintable but unmistakeably negative. There has at least now been some progress, with the recognition of the issue in both the discussions of the Auditing Practices Board and a document from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland within the last two years. Yet there has been little sign of any recommendations to develop the points. If the accountancy profession has generally been complacent, it has been aided in its apathy by a lack of interest by others who should be paying it greater attention: not least government and users of accounts. Yet they have remained conspicuously silent on most issues, content to let accountants get on with their lives without much interference. I can point to some stimulating debates and some delightful friendships developed with accountants over the last three years. On the future of their profession and the degree to which it has recognised its problems and attempted improvements, I am rather less able to be positive.

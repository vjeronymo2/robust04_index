			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Sport: Taylor makes a rod for his back - Soccer WHEN THE Football Association's appoints a successor to Graham Taylor as manager of the England team the first question they should ask is: 'Do you go fishing?' While Taylor occupies the weeks between internationals fretting about his opponents' strengths, Jack Charlton, the manager of the Republic of Ireland, goes fishing. While Taylor's team are performing in US soccer's rehearsal for the World Cup like understudies for a pantomime horse, the Irish are galloping like thoroughbreds towards a starring role in the show. As Don Revie, Jack Charlton's old mentor, showed when he managed England in the 1970s, the obsessiveness which can be an asset for a club manager can be disastrous for a national one who has little time with his players. Revie overmanaged. Taylor has similar faults. Taylor complains that the English league's fixture load damages his players. But Charlton and Terry Yorath of Wales, who must pick from a far smaller pool of players in the same league, have overcome this problem, while Taylor's selection policies have exacerbated it. Last summer, Taylor deprived Ian Wright of experience by leaving him out of the European championship. Taylor set out this summer with three goalscorers: Wright, who had just eight caps, Les Ferdinand (two) and Teddy Sheringham (none). In three games each has played a half alone and a half with each of the others. The only untried permutation is all three at once. Even if Taylor does not know what his best attack is, common sense suggests he should stick with one combination. Taylor often allows his opponent's to pick his teams. Against Norway, to combat an attack no better than most in the Premier League, he made four changes from the side that had drawn against Poland three days earlier and altered formation. He brought back Gary Pallister after more than a year to partner Tony Adams for the first time, moved Des Walker to a position he dislikes and paired Sheringham and Ferdinand for the first time. He also asked winger Lee Sharpe, in his first full England game, to play in a defensive role. Time and again Taylor picks players out of position in the hope that they will do a bit of both jobs. It never works. The job of an international manager is to find a formation in which the players he picks are comfortable. Against Norway Taylor created a situation in which they were uncomfortable and uncertain. During Taylor's three years in charge the high morale built up in England's run to the World Cup semi-final in Italy in 1992 has gradually collapsed. There have been good performances, but recently only at Wembley inspired by Paul Gascoigne. Taylor discarded Peter Beardsley and Chris Waddle and drove away Gary Lineker. In their place he has a collection of players he has called 'headless chickens'. This recent habit of deflecting criticism by blaming the players only damages morale further. On Wednesday against the US in Foxboro the England team gave Taylor a vote of no confidence. This was not the poorest performance of his three years as manager but it was the most depressing. Taylor reverted to a familiar English formation. Each player was in a familiar position. The match started well. But when the US took the lead, England unravelled. Most kept trying. But the players self-belief ebbed. Four times Wright, a particular victim of Taylor's vacillation in selection, found chances which he would have converted for his club. Three times he missed, once he even tried to pass - avoiding a responsibility he rarely shirks. By the end England were no longer a team. They had voted with their feet. A quick way to restore morale is to replace the manager. Taylor should buy a rod, he may soon have a lot of time to go fishing.</p>

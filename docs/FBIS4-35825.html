			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian leaders in the territories are focusing  efforts on East Jerusalem, mainly in a bid to lift the closure  which has separated the city from the rest of the territories.  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has distributed a leaflet  in the territories calling for an exacerbation of the battle  until Jerusalem is liberated. Our correspondent Moti Amir  reports:    [Begin Amir recording] A senior Palestinian source stressed  yesterday that PLO supporters will focus their political  activity on the issue of East Jerusalem. The source stressed  that the Palestinians will not remain silent in the face of  demonstrations by the Israeli right wing, such as that organized  by the Likud yesterday outside the Old City's walls. Faysal  al-Husayni will hold a discussion on Jerusalem this afternoon at  the Orient House building and report on the latest steps taken  by the Israeli Government against Palestinian institutions in  the eastern part of the city.    Hamas has also exhorted its followers to put an emphasis on  the struggle over Jerusalem. In a special leaflet distributed  in the territories yesterday, 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam members were  called upon to step up activities against Israel until what the  leaflet described as the liberation of all of the homeland,  including Jerusalem.    The Palestinian source explained that the PLO will now  concentrate its efforts on lifting the closure on East  Jerusalem, which has severed the city from the territories.    In discussions held yesterday by Palestinian self-government  officials in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, the police commanders  in both areas expressed praise for the rapid organization of the  Palestinian forces and noted that they believe the police are  operating smoothly and satisfactorily despite all the  difficulties.    General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, who was head of the  Palestinian delegation on security affairs in the peace  negotiations, crossed through the Rafah border terminal into the  Gaza Strip yesterday. Gen. al-Yahya will be in charge of public  security in the autonomous areas, together with Police Commander  Nasr Yusuf.    An advance force of 36 Palestinian intelligence officers has  arrived in Jericho. The men received training in intelligence  work in Egypt, Algeria, and Tunis. They will mainly be in  charge of the PLO's military intelligence. [end recording]</p>

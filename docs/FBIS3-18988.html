			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F> Ruth Berschens; place and date not given: "Increase in  Value-Added Tax"]    [Text] [Berschens] Mr. Paye, the economics and finance  ministers of the seven most important industrialized states will  meet in Detroit next weekend to discuss what can be done against  unemployment. Do you expect the special summit to be more than  just a big media spectacle?    [Paye] I think it is very good that President Clinton has  convened this conference. The special summit is useful just  because it directs public attention to a problem, for which the  alarm bells have been ringing here in Europe for years. The  governments increasingly now are trying to find recipes against  unemployment.    [Berschens] So far, they, particularly in Europe, have not  had a lot of ideas.    [Paye] We in Europe are paying the bill now for the fact  that politicians and partners to the wage negotiations believed  in growth far too long. Until the end of the 1980's, it was  assumed that the high growth rates of the 1950's and 1960's  could be reached again. As a result, one continued to be  generous with wage raises, with pensions, and with the services  of health insurance. The expansion of the social net has made  the European economies increasingly inflexible, even though they  should be more flexible than ever -- in view of the racing  technological progress and the rising pressure of international  competition.    [Berschens] What do the Europeans have to do?    [Paye] They must abolish negative developments in the tax  system and in social security. In some countries, excessive  ancillary wage costs prevent the employers from hiring people.  It also happens that an unemployed person earns more in net  terms than if we were working. Why should he then look for a  new job? In addition, there is the abuse of social services.  The labor exchange office, for instance, would have to cancel  unemployment benefits if the recipient refused to accept an  appropriate job.    [Berschens] Your proposals harbor the danger that the poor  will get even poorer.    [Paye] There is no doubt that the necessary structural  reforms require great sacrifices from parts of the population.  Certainly, those affected must not be simply dropped. If these  people get the feeling they are hopeless losers, then we will be  facing a social explosion sooner or later. Therefore, state and  society must help the people to react flexibly to new  requirements on the labor market, above all through improved  training and retraining.    [Berschens] You want the state to pursue a more active labor  market policy, to reduce payroll tax, and to take over part of  the ancillary wage costs. At the same time, however, you demand  a reduction of the budget deficits. How is this going to work?    [Paye] If the state wants to get the money back from another  source, it would be conceivable to raise value-added tax or the  energy taxes. As a third alternative in our report, we suggest  an increase in capital-yield tax....    [Berschens] ...which would immediately provoke capital  flight, as in Germany after the introduction of the withholding  tax.    [Paye] Any tax increase harbors risks. By the way, the  danger of capital flight would be clearly lower if all 24 OECD  states could decide to take such a step together.    [Berschens] The unemployment rate in the United States is  clearly lower than in the European states. Do the Europeans  have to imitate the U.S. hire-and-fire system?    [Paye] The direction is correct, but the Europeans cannot go  as far as the Americans. In times of an upswing, the U.S.  system works like a machine that produces jobs. This is also  due to the enormous mobility of the Americans regarding jobs and  distances. In Europe, however, there will always be a denser  social net than in the United States.    [Berschens] Really? The French have just introduced minimum  wages for adolescents, which is almost as much as social welfare  in Germany.    [Paye] I have four children. For them, it would still be  better to work for a low salary than to be unemployed. In the  long run, one cannot pay the people above the level of their  productivity, unless society expresses sufficient solidarity.    [Berschens] Unemployment in Germany will continue to  increase more strongly and for a longer period than in other  European states, according to the OECD forecast. Have the  Germans in particular committed many mistakes?    [Paye] The influx of hundreds of thousands of immigrants and  ethnic Germans from abroad has put a great strain on the German  labor market. In addition, the country has not yet overcome the  shock of reunification. The economy is suffering under the high  state debts and the pressure of inflation. Here I think the  other Europeans have to share responsibility.    [Berschens] Are you saying that the British and the French  should have contributed to paying the costs of unification?    [Paye] Of course, something like that is easier said than  done. The French may have understood this more easily than the  poorer Irish, Spanish, or Greeks. Nevertheless, it was a  mistake to leave the country with the strongest economy and with  Europe's key currency alone with the shock of reunification, in  particular since everyone had to suffer from the German policy  of high interest rates. The Europeans would have been better off  if the burden had been shared right from the beginning.</p>

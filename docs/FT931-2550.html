			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK may lose valuable Chinese markets 'SO FAR, the row over Hong Kong is nothing much more than a nuisance,' said Mr Paul Hudson, business development adviser for the Essex-based polymer chemicals group Yule Catto, from his hotel room in Guangzhou yesterday. 'But it would be a shame if it were to decline into a battle, because the British are thin on the ground in China, and the few of us putting in investment need the best of political relations, not the worst,' said Mr Hudson, who has spent the past two weeks travelling China seeking joint venture partners for a manufacturing plant in the country. Mr Li Lanqing, China's minister for foreign economic relations and trade, warned the democracy plans of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten 'will inevitably affect economic relations and trade relations between China and Britain'. If the threat were to become a reality, it could hardly come at a worse time. British economic planners have targeted exports as central to the non-inflationary growth strategy intended to lift the economy out of recession. The government's aim is to boost Britain's share of world trade from 5.3 per cent today to 6.3 per cent by the year 2000 - adding Pounds 10bn to exports at current prices, and eliminating the visible trade deficit. Fast-growing markets such as China are at the heart of this strategy. Indeed, Mr Richard Needham, UK minister of trade, has visited the country three times in the past year. Targeted sectors include transport, telecommunications, power generation, agriculture and food processing. The Chinese action would affect future opportunities far more than present business, since Britain has lagged behind European competitors in China over the past decade. Britain's exports to China have been stagnant over the past seven years (see chart). According to the department of trade, UK exporters 'have performed less well, both in value and in share of the market, when compared to exports by our European competitors'. France's exports rose Dollars 742m in 1986 to Dollars 1.59bn in 1991, while exports from Italy rose from Dollars 1.14bn to Dollars 1.47bn. The US has boosted exports over the same period from Dollars 4.7bn to Dollars 8.0bn. But it would be premature to predict serious dangers for UK exporters. France and the US attracted the wrath of the Chinese government last year because of military sales to Taiwan. Both were warned that trade relations would suffer. The Chinese government forced the closure of France's consulate in Guangzhou, and banned French companies from bidding for a Dollars 1bn subway contract in the city. There are few clear subsequent signs that exporters in these countries have suffered, and it is questionable whether China can afford to discriminate on anything but a token basis against so many potential sources of foreign technology and investment. Perhaps most at risk if relations deteriorate would be high-profile contracts. But dangers are not confined to Britain's corporate giants. In Birmingham, Mr Robin Hornby at Curdworth International Machine Tools, sells more than half of its re-manufactured machine tools to China, after entering the market in 1988. He sees rapid growth in demand as pressure grows to upgrade the technology in Chinese factories: 'Our output is growing, we are taking on new staff, and are bucking the recession. It would be terrible if, after the time and money we have spent developing the Chinese market, we were thrown out through no fault of our own. The government would have a lot to answer for.'

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Bill aims for media watchdog LABOUR MP Mr Clive Soley yesterday proposed a new media watchdog, the Independent Press Authority, to deal with standards of newspaper reporting. Under his private member's bill, Freedom and Responsibility of the Press, readers would have a statutory right to take legal action if editors refused to publish corrections. At a Westminster press conference, Mr Soley, the MP for Hammersmith, said readers should be given the right to have factual inaccuracies corrected. He explained: 'If an editor and a complainant cannot agree a correction between themselves, an IPA complaints adviser will be able to intervene and all sides will be invited to make their case. 'If the IPA finds in favour of the complainant and an editor refuses to publish a correction, the IPA may refer the case to the High Court. Any newspaper that still refuses to publish a correction would be in contempt of court.' Mr Soley said the bill was designed to enhance freedom of the press and protect the public from the hazards of inaccurate reporting. 'I believe the press has nothing to fear from my bill, and much to gain. The circulation war between national newspapers has sent journalistic standards tumbling, and further damaged public attitudes to the press.' Mr Soley came fourth in the ballot for private members' bills and his measure requires broad cross-party support if it is to stand any chance of reaching the statute book. Yesterday, Tory MP Sir Teddy Taylor and Liberal Democrat Sir David Steel indicated their backing for the bill. Sir Teddy, MP for Southend East, expressed worries about 'anonymous attribution' while Sir David, the former Liberal leader, attacked newspapers which paid money for 'tittle-tattle' about public figures. Supporters of the bill have arranged a series of public hearings in December for individuals, organisations and editors to air their views. MPs will debate the bill in the Commons on January 29.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Fashion: Real women wear the trousers - Micro-skirts are fine for waifs but should otherwise be avoided Sharon Stone's legs did it. Until she stomped down Valentino's catwalk in Paris wearing a mini wedding dress and lace tights, all the impossibly short, floaty skirts wafting round the international collections had created only a vague sense of unease. To be sure, they were hardly practical for normal life but, on unnaturally etiolated catwalk waifs, they looked innocent and charming. It was easy to be blinded by their beauty. It took only one real woman - and a very fortunately built one at that - to reveal the awful truth. The kindest word I heard about poor Sharon in 'those' tights and 'that' skirt was 'sturdy.' Far less kind words will be applied to the great chunky-legged majority if they try to follow fashion next spring. The question is: why should the abiding image of high fashion for next season be a garment that is neither quite a petticoat nor an outgrown gymslip and looks good only on immature-looking waifs? Partly, it is because of this very self-selecting elitism - you have to be one of a special band to join in. Partly, too, it is because of the snobbism that lies behind its impeccable designer provenance. After Karl Lagerfeld put pelmet skirts - always a good publicity gambit - into his autumn couture collection for Chanel, the house's telephone was red-hot with orders. Chanel's ideal customer - and, in this case, her daughter - may be impossibly rich and thin (rich women, whatever their figures, always seem to have good legs) but, in reality, Chanel may be responsible for some sorry sights. Whether it be in the interests of a good joke or of press coverage (sometimes the same thing), 'Kaiser' Karl has never been above over-stepping the limits of good taste. He is also promoting the return of white stilettos. But, no matter how crazy or unwearable his ideas, he will have the last laugh because he is so influential that - and here is the crux - his ideas are followed slavishly by the ever-younger band of stylists and fashion editors who are the image-makers for magazines and advertising. They are so mired in the fashion world that, like a drug, ideas need to be ever more sensational to excite them. The seriously short A-line skirt - new, provocative, even shocking - is their biggest buzz for years. They are ordering micro-skirts for themselves already; and although their readers or customers may not like it, that is what they will get. At this very moment, some junior fashion editor, years younger than most of her readers, is preparing a feature which suggests 'the' look for spring is a micro-mini skirt worn with ankle socks. Indeed, when Daks launched a new range of children's wear recently, the pink and white striped A-line skirt intended for 10-year-olds was snapped up by a fashion-forward magazine to photograph on a 6 ft super-waif. The bug has even attacked entirely sensible people. When Benny Ong, a highly experienced and successful designer, showed a capsule spring collection to favoured press people and customers recently, nearly everything was very pretty, very flared and very short. 'Isn't there anything longer?' wailed women used to relying on Benny's graceful, long-line skirts. There were indeed, explained the designer, but he wanted to promote a new, younger look. This is the real problem for real women. Every collection contains trousers and long skirts which make sales rather than headlines and which are kept out of sight, like dark secrets, when the press are about. But why should women, who prefer not to look like old mutton dressed as spring lamb, be bereft of an image to which they can aspire? Some designers, such as Armani and Ralph Lauren, recognise this and are full of instantly usable ideas. There is the beige trouser suit, which will be everyone's working life-line. There is the quiet but insistent return of that thrice-blessed garment, the drawstring trouser. There is Whistles, where owner Lucille Lewin is five feet nothing, always looks immensely stylish, and is undecided about wearing a mini. She has bought a smattering of tiny skirts (most already earmarked by 15-year-old fashion editors) for her shops, and says: 'There are no rules in fashion now. Women are more confident with their own style, be it long, short or trousers.' Now that women are independent and assertive, the waif-in-a-mini might have advertising appeal because this is the last female image left that allows men to feel masterful. It also goes down well with stylists, not long past their dormitory years, who feel more at home with it than with grown-up sophistication. In other words, next spring's fashion will sort the women from the girls. And real women will be wearing the trousers.</p>

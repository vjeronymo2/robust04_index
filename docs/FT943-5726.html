			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Arts: Record for Edinburgh - Sponsorship Arts sponsorship was late into the recession, but seems to be coming out of it quite smartly - at least in Edinburgh. The 1994 festival, which closes tomorrow, attracted 15 per cent more corporate support than last year, with a record total of Pounds 1m. The money is vital - it accounts for 20 per cent of festival revenue. Only half the aid goes in straightforward arts sponsorship. The remainder is donations from trusts and individuals and from the corporate membership scheme, where companies are tempted to form a festival connection for as little as Pounds 2,500. Edinburgh hopes to sign up more London-based companies, Whitbread and Bats are recent additions. The increase in sponsorship owes something to renewed business confidence and more to the fact that the festival is enjoying an artistic revival under director Brian MacMaster. This does not mean that his ambitious presentations, like a seven and a half hour Oresteia in Russian, are enthusiastically embraced by sponsors - this year's challenging foreign drama productions failed to get backers. But they did receive a good critical response and this raised the prestige of Edinburgh. Predictably, sponsors at the festival are motivated mainly by the corporate hospitality opportunities - IBM flew in 200 top executives from Europe for its sponsored concert of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony - but the festival's development director, John Godfrey, is trying hard to broaden their horizons. He made some progress this year when one longterm sponsor, the Royal Bank of Scotland, added advertising of its connection and competitions for tickets, to his traditional format. Another leading sponsor, Hertz, which sponsored Miami City Ballet, invested some of its money in an educational project, with dancers visiting local schools. The Royal Bank of Scotland was quick to exploit the festival's newest attraction, the Festival Theatre, and put Pounds 60,000 behind the opening production there, Beethoven's Fidelio. In contrast, events at the other main festival venue, the Usher Hall, commanded a sponsorship tag of Pounds 30,000. The festival, like every other arts organisation these days, is open to offers on the size of a sponsor's commitment. This flexibility brings in the newer, more experimental companies, like Beck's Beer, which was willing to put some money behind one of the most elitist festival events, the Canadian director Robert Lepage's new work, The Seven Streams of the River Ota. Even so the festival still relies on local banks, utilities and breweries for most of its sponsorship income. Like other arts organisations, the Edinburgh Festival is alive to the opportunities in payment in kind. But Godfrey is not soft-headed - there is no airline tie-in this year because he was not prepared to give Pounds 30,000 worth of sponsorship privileges to an airline in return for the equivalent in full price tickets. It is better to do a deal elsewhere - with InterCity, for example - and buy air tickets for artists when needed from discount sources. Hertz gives some of its support in kind as well as cash, and in return for inclusion in the Corporate Membership Scheme Strathmore Spring Water is supplying 8,000 litres of the stuff. Famous Grouse ensures that every performer at the festival receives a bottle of whisky. Godfrey is adept at persuading major arts supporters to at least do something in Edinburgh. British Gas is currently re-examining its sponsorship programme but has agreed to pay for the video that will promote sponsorship of next year's festival, when the target is Pounds 1.2m. The habit of using festival events to entertain means that most companies double their expenditure by the end of the day, when the costs of parties, accommodation etc, are added in. Godfrey hopes that the example of Beck's will persuade sponsors to go for more avant-garde happenings in 1995 and that the lead from the Royal Bank of Scotland will encourage them to exploit the link more imaginatively. But one thing stays inviolate - Brian MacMaster plans his festivals with sponsors firmly out of mind. Only when the programme is fixed are they invited to pick it over.</p>

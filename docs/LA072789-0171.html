			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE STUDIES LAND-USE IN EFFORT TO CAP POPULATION  </P> <P> In a new attempt to resolve how to limit Glendale's population to no more than  220,000 as recommended in the General Plan, the Glendale City Council on  Tuesday earmarked $40,000 to hire a private company to conduct a land use  survey.  </P> <P> The survey would identify areas of the city now zoned for apartments but  predominantly occupied by single homes where residents could voluntarily agree  to have their neighborhoods reclassified for single-family homes.  </P> <P> The survey will also determine the average number of people per household, and  provide a clearer picture of how many housing units the city can tolerate  before exceeding its desired population ceiling.  </P> <P> The council has been divided over what zoning restrictions should be adopted to  keep the city's population from skyrocketing.  </P> <P> Mayor Jerold Milner and council members Carl Raggio and Ginger Bremberg  proposed cutting the potential for apartment construction by half.  </P> <P> But Councilmen Dick Jutras and Larry Zarian have opposed this solution,  contending that it is too drastic and would drive property prices beyond the  reach of all but a few.  </P> <P> Zarian and Jutras said Tuesday that the land-use survey will help them identify  alternative ways of complying with the population limits without imposing  severe zoning restrictions on apartment and condominium owners.  </P></p>

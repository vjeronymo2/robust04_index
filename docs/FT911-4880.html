			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Soviet Union in similar crisis to Poland prior to martial law The Soviet Union is in a crisis similar to that which led to martial law in Poland in 1981, Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, Polish prime minister, warned yesterday, writes Anthony Robinson. It faces social unrest and strikes, a futile attempt to find a 'third way' between socialism and capitalism, and is trying to balance supply and demand by centrally controlled prices and wages, he told the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. This would inevitably lead to a price-wage spiral and hyper-inflation followed either by an authoritarian, 'Byzantine' solution or the slow process of installing democracy. But it took 10 years of political activity by Solidarity to convince Poles there was an alternative to communism while the Soviet Union had centuries of authoritarian traditions to overcome, he added.</p>

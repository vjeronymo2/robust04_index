			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / CBI chief hails broader family credit The government's interest in extending family credit, the in-work benefit for low-paid people, was both welcomed and criticised at the conference. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, supported the idea - floated by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor - of extending the benefit to single people. Mr Davies said it was the most effective way of encouraging job creation by keeping down the price of labour to the employer while ensuring that income to the employee does not sink too low. He said: 'The rapid growth in earnings dispersion is emerging as a more serious social and economic problem than is yet appreciated by most politicians.' Lord Lawson recently expressed the same view. Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, expressed doubts about family credit. He said it required an intrusive means test. Mr Britton said: 'A relationship of dependency is unavoidable between the recipients and the state as the donor. This may be right and proper as a temporary relationship for individuals or households in times of particular adversity, but it is not so appropriate as a permanent relationship between the state and perhaps millions of skilled workers.' He said that family credit could act as a disincentive to seeking promotion or better paid work as the benefit was phased out as incomes rose, leaving the individual no better off. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, said the TUC was interested in the idea of in-work pay supplements but warned that 'the government must guard against subsidising employers' lousy pay and conditions, and taking advantage of both their employees and the state'.</p>

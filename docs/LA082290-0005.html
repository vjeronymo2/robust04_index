			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CERULLO WANTS BUYOUT DONATED  </P> <P> Evangelist Morris Cerullo has asked his supporters to help him raise $52  million to buy Jim Bakker's old PTL empire and "take back what Satan tried to  steal," a newspaper reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> Cerullo's organization is mailing to 1.5 million households nationwide a slick,  16-page color magazine that proclaims, "It's time to take back what Satan tried  to steal."  </P> <P> Cerullo, based in San Diego, is asking supporters of his ministry to donate $52  million in cash before Oct. 23, the closing date set for the sale of the PTL by  federal bankruptcy authorities.  </P> <P> "We are starting to communicate to them and bring them along so that they are a  real part" of what's happening at New Heritage, Cerullo told the Charlotte  Observer in Tuesday's edition.  </P> <P> "And, of course, they are going to be a real part financially because they are  going to give very strongly, very substantively to help us take it back," he  said.  </P> <P> His efforts also include a 10-part television series detailing his plans for  the New Heritage USA, Cerullo's name for the 2,200-acre retreat at Ft. Mill,  S.C., that was built -- and bankrupted -- by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. The  series is being broadcast on the Inspirational Satellite Network. In addition,  WCCB-TV in Charlotte is expected to pick up the series beginning Sept. 17.  </P> <P> The ministry also is developing marketing techniques to attract larger donors,  Cerullo said.  </P> <P> One concept is a "gold card" for ministry partners who give at least $300, he  said. That would entitle the bearers to 50% off regular hotel room rates and  admission fees at New Heritage, which combines a theme park and hotel complex.  </P> <P> Also under discussion is a "platinum card" for donors of at least $1,000 that  would entitle them to one free, three-day, two-night conference, including  lodging and meals.  </P> <P> A similar plan, for so-called PTL lifetime partners, resulted in Bakker's  conviction on federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Government prosecutors  contended that Bakker grossly oversold the partnerships. He is serving a  45-year prison term in a Minnesota federal prison and is appealing his  conviction.  </P> <P> Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, is conducting a ministry in a converted warehouse in  Florida.  </P> <P> Cerullo, 58, is a Pentecostal preacher whose 30-year-old ministry focuses on  overseas crusades and training. He was affiliated with the Assemblies of God  ministry -- the same denomination as Bakker -- but dropped out in 1963.  </P></p>

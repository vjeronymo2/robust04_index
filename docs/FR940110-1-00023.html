			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27 (b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would suspend for the months of February 1994 through December 1995 the 45 percent delivery requirement for a cooperative association plant that is located in the New Orleans-Mississippi marketing area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gulf Dairy Association, Inc., which operates a manufacturing plant at Kentwood, Louisiana, that is regulated under Order 94 submitted the suspension request. The cooperative stated that because of the present 45 percent delivery requirement applicable to a cooperative association that wishes to qualify a manufacturing plant for pooling, it has had to shift some of its producers to neighboring Greater Louisiana (Order 96) pool plants to keep its Kentwood plant qualified as a pool plant under Order 94. It indicated that Order 96 requires that six days' production of a producer must be received at pool plants each month in order to qualify the milk for pooling by diversion to a nonpool plant. Accordingly, it has had to move the milk of selected producers to Order 96 pool plants six days per month. Since this milk is not actually needed by these pool plants, the cooperative has then had to back-haul the milk to its Kentwood manufacturing plant for processing. The problem is now particularly acute, according to the cooperative, because two Order 94 pool plants have notified Gulf Dairy Association that they will no longer purchase milk from them after February 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gulf Dairy Association noted that the problem it is experiencing will be resolved through the proposed merger of milk orders that is now under consideration by the Department. It urged that the proposed suspension be effective pending the completion of that proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1094  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Milk marketing orders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Secs. 1&hyph;19, 48 Stat. 31, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lon Hatamiya,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;427 Filed 1&hyph;7&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

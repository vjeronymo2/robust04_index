			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Brussels critical of UStrade barriers record THE US has failed to improve its record on trade barriers over the last year, the Brussels Commission told members of the European parliament yesterday, adding fuel to the EC-US row over discrimination in the public procurement sector, writes Andrew Hill from Strasbourg. The Commission is to publish its annual report on US trade barriers within a month. 'The list of discriminatory provisions in the US is just as long as last year,' said Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the energy commissioner. The US recently attacked alleged discriminatory clauses in the Community's public contracts directive. Mr Cardoso e Cunha repeated yesterday the EC would not negotiate on public procurement under Gatt on the basis of unilateral threats of sanctions by the US. In their turn, MEPs criticised the US for discriminating against non-EC suppliers at state and national level. Mr Tom Spencer, a British Conservative MEP, said putting heavy pressure on US citizens to buy American was 'not the position of a mature member of the international trading community'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin and Arkadiy </F> Sidoruk]    [Text] Washington, 15 Mar -- The development of cooperation  with the United States of America in the energy sphere is the  main preoccupation of Viktor Mikhaylov, Russia's minister of  atomic energy, who is paying a working visit to the United  States.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS, V. Mikhaylov disclosed that  one of the main objectives of the visit and the business  meetings which began at the Department of Energy on Monday is to  get the U.S. side to make a decision on ways to help Russia to  end production of enriched uranium-239. On the American side  the meetings are being chaired by Secretary of Energy Hazel  O'Leary.    The visit is taking place in the context of the work done by  the bilateral intergovermental commission chaired by U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, the Russian minister said. The members of this  commission have already agreed that Russia will be given U.S.  financial assistance to build a store for weapons-grade  materials, which could subsequently be used as fuel for nuclear  power stations. Washington has already allocated the first $75  million for the purchase of equipment for this project,  Mikhaylov noted. We now intend to ask the Americans to speed up  the handover of another $75 million for actual construction of  the store. In return we are prepared to speed up a decision on  halting production of weapons-grade plutonium -- which,  incidentally, is our objective anyway. However, it has to be  remembered that the capacities which produce plutonium also  generate electricity and heat. Therefore, the replacement of  these capacities with alternative forms of energy production is  a pressing matter. We also intend to discuss this question  during the visit to Washington. Concluding the interview,  Mikhaylov noted that Russian experts have developed a good  working relationship with their U.S. colleagues, and this fact  gives grounds for hoping that the results of the present visit  will be useful.    Our joint aim is to assist with the practical implementation  of the agreement reached in Moscow last December by Albert Gore  and Viktor Chernomyrdin on the closure of Russia's three  remaining plutonium reactors -- two at Krasnoyarsk and one in  Tomsk -- and their replacement with alternative sources of  energy production, Birls, special assistant to the U.S. energy  secretary on Russia and other CIS countries, told ITAR-TASS.  Birls, who is also attending the working meetings, says he is  sure that a detailed report, including all the technical  details, will be prepared in time for the third session of the  intergovernmental commission, chaired by the U.S. vice president  and the Russian prime minister. This will be held at the end of  May.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Should the lyric in "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" be changed to: "Buy me some  salads and granola bars?"  </P> <P> Encino attorney Harold Fleischman might not mind.  </P> <P> Fleischman recently wrote to Peter O'Malley, the Dodgers' Big Enchilada, asking  that the club give fans the "opportunity of purchasing healthy, non-cholesterol  foods in addition to your standard menu items."  </P> <P> He pointed out that San Francisco's Candlestick Park began offering such  delicacies as meatless dogs, salads, yogurt and mineral water this year.  </P> <P> "Since I started the Pritikin diet, I have to pack my own lunch when I go to a  game," Fleischman said. "It's a little irritating. And I'm sure there are  thousands of other fans in L.A. who would agree with me."  </P> <P> One of those might be the Dodgers' corpulent Tom Lasorda, who is reputed to be  on a low-cholesterol diet.  </P> <P> O'Malley wrote back to Fleischman, saying, "We are studying this carefully."  But, he added, somewhat ominously, "I hope the idea is practical."  </P> <P> From the Queen Mary to Mother Russia:  </P> <P> Rolling Hills City Councilman Tom Heinsheimer, who helped revive the  long-dormant Gordon Bennett International balloon race a decade ago in Long  Beach, is going to sail in a Soviet edition of the competition in July.  </P> <P> "They are interested in developing the sport of ballooning, as well as doing  more research into various procedures for their planned balloon exploration of  Mars in 1994," said Heinsheimer, an atmospheric scientist.  </P> <P> The Gordon Bennett, whose domestic version will lift off from Palm Springs this  weekend, seems to be the latest beneficiary of glasnost. The event has come  full circle since the Cold War days, when a Polish team showed up unscheduled  in Long Beach for one race.  </P> <P> Suspicions that the Poles were more interested in surveillance of Southern  California by car than in racing through the air surfaced when their balloon  was unpacked and found to contain about 75 holes.  </P> <P> What ground data they collected may never be known. But, in the air, the  patched-up Poles finished last in that Gordon Bennett, setting off from the  parking lot of the Queen Mary and plopping down a few hours later near a dump  in Orange County.  </P> <P> Only 249 shopping days until . . . Pagan Day!  </P> <P> A group called Truth Missions, angered at the Christmas tree and menorah on  display at Los Angeles City Hall each December, is petitioning the city for the  right to set up an atheist/pagan exhibit.  </P> <P> Dueling chauffeurs:  </P> <P> The two limousine drivers were vying for the same prized possession, a parking  space at a Lucky supermarket in Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> During the standoff, one jockey brandished a BB gun that had been customized to  look like an old-fashioned .45-caliber revolver, witnesses told Police Sgt.  John Berry.  </P> <P> The other driver responded, "I'll show you a real weapon," and flashed a loaded  shotgun, Berry said.  </P> <P> The BB gunman fled. The shotgun chauffeur should have done the same. Witnesses  called police, who arrested him.  </P> <P> Those Good Samaritans may get commendations from city officials, but a Wells  Fargo bank customer has received more rewarding recognition.  </P> <P> The customer, who was instrumental in the capture of two alleged robbers, has  been awarded 25 shares of the company's stock, a bank spokesman said.  </P> <P> The do-gooder, who wished to remain anonymous, observed the crime, followed the  alleged robbers at a safe distance and then signaled police.  </P> <P> The Journal of the Senses, a publication of Topanga's Elysium Institute,  reports what may be the first nudist pen-pal club. Its headquarters are in  daring Canoga Park.  </P> <P> And no, photos needn't accompany the letters.  </P></p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Bankers revise bund yield forecasts - Capital &amp; Credit The Bundesbank obviously did not like what it saw when it came back refreshed from its four-week summer vacation - a rise of some 40 basis points in 10-year bund yields to more than 7.2 per cent and a market teetering on the brink of a nervous breakdown at the prospect of a sudden rise in German interest rates. By leaving leading interest rates alone and extending its fixed rate of 4.85 per cent for the next two repurchase agreements (repos), the central bank administered the equivalent of a heavy dose of valium. It also hoped to free the market from its fixation with the very short end of the yield curve with its public put-down of money-market funds which accompanied its decision to halt regular issues of its 'Buli' liquidity paper. However, it remains to be seen whether the Bundesbank's tactics will convince its deeply sceptical audience that there is value in longer-dated bunds. Investors clearly believe that German interest rates are close to or even at the trough of their current cycle and after being hopelessly wrong-footed in other markets for much of this year, they want to be positioned correctly for this turnround. To be on the safe side, brokers are continuing to urge their clients to shorten the duration of their portfolios to less than five years, from where they will stand to benefit the most if German short-term rates turn upwards. They are also revisiting their yield forecasts, which are once again looking over-optimistic. In the past week, both Deutsche Bank and Swiss Bank Corporation have revised up their 12-month forecasts on 10-year bund yields, by 30 basis points to 7 per cent and by 50 basis points to 6.25 per cent respectively. Union Bank of Switzerland is also believed to be in the process of nudging its forecasts higher. Fund managers are coming up with similar views. In its latest economic and investment commentary, Legal &amp; General Investment Management says it will remain underweight in global bonds because it believes that the global bond yield will continue to rise over the medium term. It predicts that it will reach 8 per cent in 12 months' time, compared with around 7 per cent currently and a trough level of 5.4 per cent in January. There have also been reports that fund managers are using any price rebound in European government bond markets to reduce drastically their fixed-income allocations, in some cases by as much as half, and switch the proceeds into equities instead. Their actions may well be justified on fundamental grounds. Although analysts applauded the Bundesbank last week for postponing any decisions on interest rates until the market's nerves were less frayed, at the same time they noted that it had no compelling reason to lower interest rates. 'The Bundesbank was not under pressure to act, in view of the stronger economic growth in Germany and the rate hikes in Sweden and Italy,' said Mr Helmut Kaiser, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. 'There will be a chance for a further rate cut if there is better news on inflation or if pan-European currency tension increases.' Even the release last week of pleasing M3 money supply data for July did not justify a rate cut since they showed that bank lending growth was at its highest level for eight months. The Bundesbank may also have been reluctant to move on interest rates ahead of the cost of living number for August which could disappoint. Although the consensus forecast is for no change month-on-month, which would leave the yearly rate at 2.9 per cent, the price rise in oil and petrol and in other commodities, notably coffee, could push the rate back to 3 per cent. The cautious stance towards bond markets comes at a difficult time for the Bundesbank in view of the heavy issuance programme which lies ahead. But three things may yet turn the situation to its advantage. Firstly, despite its solid performance against the dollar and other leading currencies this year, the safe-haven quality of the D-Mark could well encourage investors to increase their holdings of D-Mark assets in the near term. 'The D-Mark is at the top of the heap,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, adding that it would appreciate further if the ruling CDU party remains in power after the federal elections. Secondly, there is evidence that in the second quarter, domestic non-bank investors increased their purchases of bunds, attracted by their current yields of more than 7 per cent. Analysts believe this trend will to continue. Thirdly, a minority-held view that yields will stabilise at current levels could triumph over the more bearish forecasts, in which case fund managers who took refuge in cash and shorter-dated paper will have to dash back to the long end in order to avoid underperforming their benchmark indices. 'Fund managers have a big problem now that yield curves are so steep,' says one fund manager. 'You can't get the same return on cash as you can on longer-dated bonds unless short-term rates rise quickly.'</p>

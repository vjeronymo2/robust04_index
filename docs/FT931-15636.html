			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Credit where it is due - The plight of small and medium-sized companies which need export finance is raising increasing concern Mike Smith expects to sell about Pounds 500,000 worth of second-hand plastic production machinery this year, 90 per cent of it overseas. Smith says he has never had a default from a foreign customer but, because much of his equipment goes to 'risky' countries, he cannot obtain export credit insurance and nor, therefore, export finance from his bank. Fortunately for Smith, who sells to Egypt, Sri Lanka, Poland, India and Yemen, the owner of the company which ships his machinery has been willing to finance these export deals. The shipper, who does a lot of business with the safer US market, has export credit cover from NCM Credit Insurance, one of the main providers of this form of insurance and so is able to extend cover to Smith's riskier destinations. 'This means I get export credit cover indirectly but I pay a higher premium for the funds than I would for a bank overdraft,' says Smith. He is also concerned that as his business grows he may no longer be able to call on all the funds he needs from this source. In recent months the British government has given signs of wanting to make conditions easier for UK exporters. Richard Needham, junior trade minister, told the Institute of Exports last month that the government wanted to ensure there was adequate insurance cover at competitive premiums while an extra Pounds 700m of export credit guarantees were announced in the November autumn financial statement. But industrialists and organisations which advise exporters remain deeply concerned at the poor level of support for exports. Most attention has been focused on the plight of large manufacturers of capital goods but the position of small and medium-sized businesses is, if anything, even worse. 'The current scenario is not remotely user-friendly,' says Campbell Dunford, chairman of the London Chamber of Commerce's export finance committee. 'Export support has been allowed to wither away on the grounds that we must get rid of subsidies.' Ian Campbell, director general of the Institute of Export, says: 'We are very concerned about the level of finance available to small firms.' While smaller companies in France and the Netherlands have increased their share of visible exports during the 1980s there is no evidence of a similar increase in the UK, according to the latest NatWest Review of Small Business Trends. Detailed data on small firms' export performance is lacking but there is no evidence that a campaign launched by the British Overseas Trade Board in 1987 to encourage small companies to export more has had any impact. The creation of the Single European Market has produced a wave of government publicity about the need for British companies to increase exports but practical difficulties abound. 'It is not enough to make exporters aware of the opportunities of the single market without helping them to do something about it,' says Arthur White of Capital Financial Services, a Chislehurst, Kent consultancy. Recent changes in government policy may even have damaged the ability of British firms to export. The privatisation of the Export Credits Guarantee Department's short-term business - providing credit for up to two years - by means of a sale to NCM, the Dutch private credit insurer, has raised fears that rates will rise and some areas become uninsurable. But Colin Foxall, chief executive, denies that NCM has become 'ruthlessly commercial' and says 80 per cent of NCM's 6,000 customers export less than Pounds 1m a year. In addition, a decision to relate premiums for ECGD medium-term cover more closely to risk has pushed up premiums. But equally damaging have been sharp and unpublicised cut-backs in the commitment of the banks to providing export finance for smaller companies, revealed in a survey* today in the magazine Export Today. The survey shows that five of the leading UK banks have withdrawn their small exporter schemes over the last two years while Exfinco, a specialist in this field, shut down. 'There has been a huge unacknowledged reduction in the ability of the banks to provide support for exporters,' comments Dunford. The banks have run down the departments providing export help for smaller companies, leaving customers to the mercy of branch managers, many of whom lack specialist expertise. Some banks have begun referring export customers to their factoring subsidiaries. National Westminster Bank withdrew its smaller exporters scheme in mid-1992 after suffering losses, though the scheme had signally failed to appeal to customers with only nine signed up over the five years it was operating. NatWest is now working on a new initiative, says Andy Nemes, regional executive responsible for international trade. It wants an off-the-shelf scheme with low administrative costs and a standardised method of assessing credit risk. But it has learned that providing export credit insurance is not enough to guarantee against losses. Most insurance schemes cover only 90 per cent of the risk while there are many reasons why cover may be rendered invalid: customers may forget to provide details of transactions to the insurer; exceed their credit limits; make deliveries outside the agreed dates; or fail to report payment delays. The bank must then try to recoup losses from its customer. The only one of the big clearing banks to have maintained its smaller exporters scheme is Barclays. It has nearly 500 customers in the scheme, designed for companies exporting up to Pounds 2m. It provides export finance, normally at rates below standard overdraft rates, and 100 per cent credit cover for a 2 1/2 per cent fee, reducing for volumes above Pounds 200,000. Barclays, like many of the other banks which still run special schemes for small exporters, takes out block cover with NCM, effectively retailing this on to its own customers. NCM itself reinsures 98 per cent of its risks in the commercial market. The government still guarantees cover in certain high-risk markets regarded as being in the national interest but it does not provide the blanket guarantee previously available to ECGD's short-term operations. This has reduced the value of NCM cover in the eyes of some of the banks. But the recession and a growing volume of losses - up 170 per cent over the past five years - has reduced the willingness of the reinsurance market to provide cover. NCM acknowledges that the market is tighter than it has been though it says it has had no problems gaining reinsurance cover. Others are not so sure. 'The government believes the private sector will provide reinsurance cover but there is not enough,' says Campbell. The difficulties involved in raising export finance mean that many small and medium-sized companies finance their exports from their overdraft and without insurance cover. This does not appear to be a sound basis for an export-led recovery. *Export Today, Tel 071 253 2545  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              HOW SPECIAL EXPORT FINANCE SCHEMES FOR SMALL                    BUSINESS HAVE FARED SINCE 1990  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Financier                    Still on offer  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays                          Yes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bishopsgate Export Finance        Yes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Clydesdale                        Yes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Co-operative                      Yes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Extinco                            No*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Girobank                           No  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lloyds                             No  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Midland                            No  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- National Westminster               No  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern                          Yes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal Bank of Scotland            Yes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank of Scotland                  Yes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TSB                                No  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Export Today                                          *Wound up  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

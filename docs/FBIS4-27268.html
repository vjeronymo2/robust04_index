			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Defense Agency is trying  to quickly verify reports that North Korea has laid sea mines  off its coast, defense officials said Wednesday. "At the moment  we cannot confirm the mine-laying," an official said. "But if  the reports prove true, we might say this is a move indicating  the North Korean side is hardening its stance in the direction  of military confrontation," he said.    The information was received just after North Korea, under  international scrutiny for its suspected nuclear weapons  program, was reported to have test fired a "Silkworm" antiship  missile into the Sea of Japan on Tuesday.    North Korean sea mines would also constitute "a big, direct  safety threat" to maritime transport in the region, the  officials said.    With mined coastal waters, North Korea hopes to ward off the  landing of enemy troops, sources well-versed in defense issues  said.    The move is apparently modeled after Iraq's mining of the  Persian Gulf off Kuwait to counter the U.S.-led allied forces in  the 1991 Gulf war, they said.    Should North Korea have actually mined its coastal waters,  it  could suggest that the Pyongyang leadership believes the nuclear  standoff has been pushed to the brink and is ready to risk an  attack from the United States and its allies, the sources said.    Floating sea mines, laid off North Korea's coasts during the  1950-53 Korean war to cut off reinforcements and provisions for  UN troops fighting on the South Korean side, have endangered sea  traffic around Japan. More than 300 mines that came loose in  rough seas have submerged in the past. "A similar situation  might arise. And traffic in the Sea of Japan, for instance, is  incomparably higher than in those (Korean war) times," the  sources said.    They said the antimining capacity of the U.S. Navy stationed  in the Asia-Pacific region comes close to "zero." Therefore,  Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force, which has helped clear the  Persian Gulf from Iraqi mines, could be forced to dispatch  minesweepers if it came to the worst, they said.    The agency will have to closely watch North Korea's  development and testing of ballistic missiles and mines issue,  the sources suggested.</p>

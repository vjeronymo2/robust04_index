			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE MASSACRE  </P> <P> In "A Letter From China" (Op-Ed Page, June 7), an official of a Chinese  corporation near Hong Kong lamented that the Chinese government had become a  "Fascist government" and China's People's Liberation Army had become a "Fascist  army." He makes the same error as many Westerners unable to see the true  totalitarian face of communism.  </P> <P> The Chinese government and its "Liberation" army remain what they have always  been, a Communist government and a Communist army and they behave like  Communist institutions invariably behave, zealous of power and harsh on those  who dare to challenge it.  </P> <P> S.

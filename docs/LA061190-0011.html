			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : THE 'PUS AT THE PALACE: FEROCIOUS, CONFUSED  </P> <P> Psychefunkapus is not the title of a new Red Hot Chili Peppers album, but the  name of the San Francisco quintet that played a heavy mixture of funk,  speed-metal and hard rock -- just like the Red Hot Chili Peppers -- at the  Palace on Friday. The band hit even more genres than the Peppers, throwing  everything from a rush of progressive stadium-rock to a strange brew of Cream-y  acid-flash into the mix.  </P> <P> But there's one area where the 'Pus can't compare to the Peps: charisma.  Psychefunkapus features two frontmen, Manny Martinez (black, hard-working,  punky-gruff) and Gene Genie (white, with a smooth voice better suited to a  folk-art band than a skate-rock jam). Their ferocious energy couldn't disguise  a confused lyric stance that one moment advocated affirmative youth power ("We  Are the Young"), then disparaged a woman as a "Slut Child" the next. For now,  Psychefunkapus is a concept riffing in search of a hook, rocking loud yet  saying nothing. CRAIG LEE  </P></p>

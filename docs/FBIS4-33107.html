			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga said  yesterday in Sucre that the agreements between Bolivia and the  United States are vital for the progress of the nation. He also  promised that the new extradition treaty being negotiated with  that country will be based on international law and sovereignty.    He said: "An extradition agreement with the United States is  essential, because a country like ours cannot escape from  international juridical cooperation at a time when  interdependency is the signal in all fields." He explained that  the new extradition treaty will be based on "mutual interests."    Aranibar was asked if during his administration there had  been U.S. Embassy interference in the country's internal  affairs. His answer was: "You (reporters) have as many elements  for judgment as I do in order to evaluate that." [passage  omitted]</p>

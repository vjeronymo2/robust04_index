			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Betacom finance plan could leave Amstrad with 72% stake AMSTRAD, which has interests in computers and satellite dishes, is poised to take up to 72 per cent of Betacom, the telecommunications equipment distributor. Betacom, which is currently trading at a loss, is raising Pounds 8.4m by way of a share subscription by Amstrad and a rights issue aimed at strengthening its equity base. Amstrad is subscribing for 23.95m new ordinary shares in Betacom at 18p per share. In addition, the rights issue of 23.37m new ordinary shares on a 3 for 4 basis at 18p per share is fully underwritten by Amstrad. Betacom's shares closed  1/2 p higher yesterday at 18 1/2 p. Betacom has recently experienced deteriorating trading conditions, lower sales and higher customer returns. Last year it reported a reduced loss of Pounds 515,000 (Pounds 2.44m) on sales of Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 18.3m). Under its current financial circumstances its bank has refused to continue its support without a significant equity injection. Amstrad has recently been moving into the telecommunications equipment business and has announced its intention to market videophones. It took at 29.5 per cent stake in Betacom in February. It said that rather than see its investment in Betacom acquired for Pounds 1.6m, it had decided to support Betacom's capital increase. Depending on the outcome of the rights issue, Amstrad could end up with 72 per cent of Betacom's enlarged capital. Its total investment in the company would amount to Pounds 10.1m. Furthermore, if the rights issue flops Amstrad, the directors and other shareholders currently holding over 5 per cent of the company could end up with in excess of 75 per cent of Betacom, which would lead it to be in breach of the Stock Exchange's listing requirement that a minimum of 25 per cent of a company's share capital should be in public hands.</p>

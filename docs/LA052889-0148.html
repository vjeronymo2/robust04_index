			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> YANKEES BLANKED AGAIN BY ATHLETICS, 3-0  </P> <P> When the pitchers dominated last season, baseball people were sure they knew  the reason why. They said there was a switch to a dead ball, one that wouldn't  carry a distance.  </P> <P> This season, runs are even tougher to come by. Are the pitchers really that  good?  </P> <P> If the last two games in New York are an example, the hitters are in trouble.  The Yankees, with a batting order that figures to score, have been humbled  twice in a row by lesser members of the Oakland Athletics' staff.  </P> <P> In the vernacular of the hitter, left-hander Curt Young doesn't throw hard  enough to break a pane of glass. But Young and three relievers held the Yankees  to six hits in the Athletics' 3-0 victory Saturday at Yankee Stadium.  </P> <P> Contrasted with Friday night, that was solid hitting. Todd Burns, in his first  start of the season, and two relievers held the Yankees to one hit as the A's  won, 4-0. The Yankees sent only 27 batters to the plate.  </P> <P> The back-to-back shutouts mark the first time the Yankees were blanked in  consecutive games in more than five years.  </P> <P> The Yankees' first three hitters -- Rickey Henderson, Steve Sax and Don  Mattingly -- figure to at least manufacture a run. And the middle three of  Jesse Barfield, Steve Balboni and Ken Phelps all have power.  </P> <P> These batters were at the mercy of Burns, Young, Gene Nelson, Rick Honeycutt  and Eric Plunk.  </P> <P> Yankee Manager Dallas Green said he was at a loss for an explanation why the  Yankees stopped hitting. "I've tried everything," he said, "and nothing works."  </P> <P> It may have been a costly victory for the leaders of the West. Dennis  Eckersley, as good a reliever as there is, faced two batters to start the  ninth, then left abruptly, grabbing his right shoulder in pain.  </P> <P> Eckersley, who had 45 saves last year, was two outs from his 15th of this  season when he departed. A's Manager Tony La Russa blamed the difference  between the bullpen mound and the mound on the field at Yankee Stadium.  </P> <P> "I hope this is something that will be corrected," La Russa said. "I'll ask  Sandy Alderson (Oakland's general manager) to talk to the Yankees about fixing  it."  </P> <P> Although Eckersley said he was free of pain after the game, La Russa said the  reliever would probably see a doctor.  </P> <P> Chicago 5, Toronto 3 -- It was the next-to-last game played in Exhibition  Stadium, opened 12 years ago. White Sox rookie Carlos Martinez is not likely to  forget it.  </P> <P> The 6-foot 5-inch Venezuelan third baseman hit his first major league home run  in the sixth inning to break a 3-3 tie and lead the White Sox to victory. The  home run, a bit wind-aided, came in his 55th at-bat.  </P> <P> "It's exciting," Martinez said. "I got a good piece of the ball. I wasn't  trying to hit it out. It kept going and I think the wind blew it out."  </P> <P> Today's game will end the Blue Jays' use of the stadium. They will begin play  in the Skydome June 5.  </P> <P> Kansas City 5, Detroit 1 -- Mark Gubicza (4-4) got his first victory in four  decisions at Kansas City with a complete-game seven-hitter. Kevin Seitzer and  Bo Jackson drove in runs early to give the right-hander a lead.  </P> <P> "I was beginning to wonder where home was," Gubicza said. "It was nice to win  at home against a team that is trouble for me."  </P> <P> Texas 5, Minnesota 3 -- Tempers flared in the second inning at Minneapolis, but  the Rangers remained cool and won for the fourth time in their last five games.  </P> <P> Both benches emptied in the second inning when Twin catcher Brian Harper  accused the Rangers' Steve Buechele, who was at second base, of stealing his  signs. After Buechele, who had one of the Rangers' seven doubles, crossed the  plate, the two had words and got into a wrestling match. Play was held up 10  minutes, but apparently nobody was hurt.  </P> <P> Kevin Brown (4-1) pitched a six-hitter for his third complete game. He struck  out seven.  </P> <P> Baltimore 5, Cleveland 1 -- Mickey Tettleton provided the offense and Mark  Huisman came to the rescue of ailing Dave Schmidt at Cleveland, leading the  Orioles to their fifth victory in a row.  </P> <P> Tettleton hit a two-run home run, his 11th homer of the season and sixth in the  last 12 games.  </P> <P> When Schmidt (4-4) had to leave because of a rib-cage injury after five  innings, Huisman gave up only one hit in the last four innings for his first  save since July 6, 1987.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 3, Seattle 2 -- Teddy Higuera indicated his arm troubles are behind  him, then suffered a sprained ankle.  </P> <P> Higuera, bothered by injuries for most of the last two seasons, held the  Mariners to one hit in 4 2/3 innings before being injured.  </P> <P> The Brewers won when shortstop Gary Sheffield, who on Friday asked to be  traded, singled in the winning run with two out in the ninth at Milwaukee.

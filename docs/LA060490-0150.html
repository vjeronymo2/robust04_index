			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELLINGER, FOUNDER OF FREDERICK'S OF HOLLYWOOD, DIES  </P> <P> Frederick Mellinger, whose fascination with a World War II pinup picture  eventually became the provocatively popular and profitable Frederick's of  Hollywood, died Saturday night at his Brentwood home.  </P> <P> Morton Field, attorney for the nationally known purveyor of naughty nightwear  and women's undergarments, said Sunday that Mellinger, who had retired in 1984,  was 76.  </P> <P> He died of the complications of pneumonia and had also been suffering from  Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> Until his retirement, Mellinger ran his retail chain of 160 stores and a  multimillion-dollar mail-order business from a garish two-story building on  Hollywood Boulevard that was as colorful as the push-up bras, crotchless  panties and derriere-enhancing lingerie it contained.  </P> <P> The dapper, mustachioed Mellinger, who said he was successful because "I never  listen to Paris designers . . . they don't dress women for men," had the  exterior of his headquarters building painted purple and the interior cranberry  and peach.  </P> <P> From there his passion fashion grew to a multimillion-dollar concern thanks in  no small part to Mellinger himself.  </P> <P> He was a tireless promoter on TV talk shows, including Johnny Carson, and his  annual report to stockholders included summaries of the media attention the  founder of the padded or paste-on empire had generated in the last year.  </P> <P> The genesis of what was then considered Mellinger's scandalous enterprise came  in World War II when he was a GI stationed in the Midwest. Like millions of  other soldiers, he had pinned a picture on a wall of Betty Grable displaying  her famous legs. Unlike his fellow soldiers, he asked his buddies what they  found attractive in women's dress.  </P> <P> Equipped with this less than scientific survey, he opened a 4-by-4-foot office  in New York City, calling it Frederick's of Fifth Avenue. There he designed  women's clothes from a man's point of view.  </P> <P> He nearly went broke and in 1947 moved to Los Angeles, where he sold lingerie  from a small shop in Chinatown. A movie fan since childhood, (many of the early  Frederick's catalogues contained drawings suggestive of the starlets of the  1930s and '40s), Mellinger next moved to Hollywood.  </P> <P> For years all the American public knew of Frederick's came from those  catalogues, but in the 1960s Mellinger began to open outlets in malls. They  proved an immediate success for, as Mellinger liked to observe, "sex never goes  out of fashion."  </P> <P> Despite the daring designs and the cost, most of his customers came not from  the fleshpots of large cities but from Middle America.  </P> <P> Women shopped for his wares while pushing baby strollers and men could be seen  on their lunch hours buying nighties for the mothers of their children.  </P> <P> In what some saw as a ploy to obviate charges of sexism, Mellinger in 1979  introduced a line of briefs for men, though the business remained oriented  toward women.  </P> <P> Yet styles do change, and some of Frederick's stock-in-trade came to be seen as  routine rather than risque. The firm suffered its first yearly loss in 1984.  </P> <P> Mellinger stepped down as chairman and chief executive, replaced by George W.  Townson, who set about changing Frederick's image.  </P> <P> Frederick's catalogues no longer push sexual aids, bondage devices and X-rated  videos. Tasteful clothing and underwear are worn by wholesome-looking models.  </P> <P> And last fall, the purple Hollywood headquarters was painted gray.  </P> <P> Mellinger himself, unlike his building and inventory, presented a conservative  facade, seated in an office filled with family photos.  </P> <P> "Many people," he said in a 1981 Times interview, "expect me to be a dirty, old  lecherous man. I think they're kind of disappointed when I'm not."  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, Harriett, a son, daughter and five grandchildren.  Services will be private and contributions are asked to the John Douglas French  Foundation for Alzheimer's Research, 11620 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, 90025.  </P></p>

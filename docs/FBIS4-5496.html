			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister and Japan  New Party (JNP) leader Morihiro Hosokawa indicated Tuesday there  will be a recombination of parties in the eight-month-old ruling  coalition, party officials said. Hosokawa, in a meeting with  several JNP legislators, was quoted as saying, "the coalition  needs to accept a new group."    The seven party coalition has shown signs of a split over  the  choice of a successor to Hosokawa who announced the resignation  last Friday.    Three of the coalition parties -- Shinseito, Komeito and the  JNP -- have strengthened solidarity, while the Social Democratic  Party, new party Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party are  forming a bloc against them.    There have [been] emerging signs of a split also in the main  opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Former  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP has indicated  willingness to join hands with the Shinseito-led group to run  for the premiership.</p>

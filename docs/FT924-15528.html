			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Treasury to alter insider dealing law THE TREASURY has conceded after strong criticism from the City that its proposed new insider dealing law needs changing. A draft of the proposed law, circulated to a small number of City institutions in August, prompted complaints that legitimate activities would be outlawed. There were also claims that the new law would make insider dealing - dealing on unpublished, price-sensitive information - more difficult to prosecute in some instances. Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury economic secretary, said in a speech to the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, on Thursday: 'We are in the process of considering the valuable comments we have received. I am confident that the revised proposals which we are now preparing will substantially address the legitimate points which people have put to us about the draft legislation.' He gave no indications of the planned changes. Mr Dorrell said the new law 'will not render the legitimate work of analysts illegal, erect barriers to the normal conduct of investment business or stop underwriting. However, I also want to make clear to you today that the government is not in the business of leaving loopholes for the unscrupulous.' Mr Dorrell's comments were given a cautious welcome in the City. 'We certainly take some comfort from them,' the British Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association said. The proposal that has drawn the most complaints would extend the definition of 'inside information' to cover anything that could affect a company's share price, regardless of whether the information was about the company. That could include, for instance, information about the company's rivals, or about a large block of its shares that had been put up for sale in the stock market. The activities of analysts, marketmakers and underwriters could all be caught as a result.</p>

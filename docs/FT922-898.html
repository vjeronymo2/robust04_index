			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses show signs of responding to economic news THERE was a suggestion yesterday that bourses will respond to good economic news, when it comes, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw movement in derivatives after equity hours, DAX index futures dropping on a steep fall in US durable goods orders, then recovering on positive German inflation data. At the official close, the DAX was 2.65 lower at 1,768.49 after a 2.68 fall to 702.19 in the FAZ at midsession, turnover easing from DM4.7bn to DM4.6bn. Daimler fell DM5.90 to DM795.50 in market hours and, going ex a DM13 dividend, lost another net DM6 to DM776.70 in the afternoon. Dealers said that investors been buying Daimler put options heavily to hedge the downside as they waited for a final ruling on Germany's participation in the European jet fighter project. Among second liners VEW, the power utility group, rose another DM6.50 to DM228 for a two-day gain of DM13.80. After hours, VEW said that it had bought control of Harpener, the holding company which, before it was swallowed by the ill-fated Swiss Omni group in the late 1980s, had half of its sales in power generation. PARIS opened the the first day of the new trading account firmer, helped by a May trade surplus of FFr4.5bn. The CAC 40 index closed up 3.84 at 1,899.64, after reaching an intraday high of 1,913.97. Peugeot slipped FFr10 to FFr738 after Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman, warned that the European car market could contract by 1 per cent in 1992. He said that he expected a further decline in Germany, while Spain, Portugal and Belgium were likely to improve. Total finished up 80 centimes at FFr232.90 after reports that US and international offers in the government's sale of a 12.4 per cent stake had been oversubscribed two-fold. Elsewhere Michelin extended Tuesday's gains, up FFr6.00 at FFr202.70. MILAN dropped to a fraction above its 1992 low as hopes faded that the new premier Mr Giulio Amato, will assemble an effective government. The Comit index ended 3.70 lower at 468.99. Olivetti saw more speculation about alliances in the computer industry, edging up L20 to L3,233; Fiat dropped L70 to L5,410 but recovered to L5,445 on the kerb. ZURICH fell as banks and insurers came under selling pressure, the SMI index of leading shares ending 8.8 easier at 1,838.3. UBS came under pressure from rumours, later denied, that Moody's Investors Service planned to downgrade the bank's triple-A rating; the bearers topped the active list as they closed SFr70 lower at SFr3,570, after SFr3,520. MADRID, plagued by bad economic news, saw the general index down another 3.71 at 239.99. The construction sector was badly affected following a meeting on Tuesday between the dindsutry and government. Tabacalera fell to an intraday low of Pta5,450 on news of a US ruling which may open manufacturers there to lawsuits, before recovering slightly to close down Pta120 at Pta5,590. OSLO took little comfort from Tuesday's rise and the market returned to negative territory. The all-share index fell 3.53 to 413.32 in turnover of NKr222m. Dealers were disappointed with the pricing of Hafslund Nycomed's offering of its B shares in the US at Dollars 22.50 per share. The B closed NKr3 weaker at NKr164. ISTANBUL gained 3.7 per cent on expectations of parliamentary discussions this week on tax reform. The 75-share index closed up 142.16 at 3,982.53, its highest close since April 16. The reform proposals would provide tax relief for mutual funds which invest 25 per cent of their portfolios in stocks. TEL AVIV hit a new record in high turnover following the Labour party's general election victory, the blue chip share index soared 8.93, or 6.5 per cent to 146.15.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1147.24  1147.47  1147.35  1147.18  1146.73  1145.74  1145.72  1145.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1148.02    Day's Low  1144.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         Jun 23     Jun 22     Jun 19     Jun 18     Jun 17         1148.49    1149.77    1154.66    1145.88*   1158.46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). * Partial.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

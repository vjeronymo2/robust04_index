			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Germany shoots itself in the foot: The political demise of Gerhard Stoltenberg, defence minister THE UNTIMELY demise of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, who resigned yesterday as German defence minister, provides a graphic demonstration of the extraordinary capacity of the German government to shoot itself in the foot. It also reveals the terrible perils of coalition government at a time of regional elections, the intimate relationship between domestic and foreign policy in the federal republic, and the degree to which German foreign policy is driven by a crusading moral fervour, regardless of the international consequences. If any reminder was needed, it underlines the reputation of the German Defence Ministry as a political graveyard, from which at least four predecessors have been forced prematurely. Ten days ago, all was quiet in the corridors of power in Bonn. To be sure, there was tension in the air, thanks to the imminence of two state elections, in Baden-Wurttemberg in the south, and Schleswig-Holstein in the north. Most of the ministers were out on the stump to whip up support either for Mr Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, or for the minority Free Democratic Party (FDP) of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister. But there was little cause for alarm, with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in greater disarray. That was before Turkish troops, using German-supplied armoured cars, launched a new operation against Kurdish guerrillas inside the country. Mr Genscher instantly moved to occupy the moral high ground, condemning the action as unworthy of a Nato partner and member of the CSCE. He was backed by Chancellor Kohl, fearful of losing electoral advantage. Turkey responded by accusing Germany of harbouring Kurdish terrorists; Bonn retaliated by suspending its arms supplies; President Turgut Ozal accused Bonn of tactics reminiscent of Hitler's Germany; Chancellor Kohl responded with a furious denial - and the whole affair was out of hand. What happened in the meantime was that it leaked out that last year 15 Leopard tanks had been delivered to Turkey as part of a long-running contract - after the Bundestag had ordered an embargo because of earlier the Turkish actions against the Kurds. That is the offence for which Mr Stoltenberg has now paid with his head. So instead of having a useful bit of moral propaganda to woo voters in the local polls, the government is left with a damaging deterioration in relations with a Nato ally, and the most senior member of the cabinet has been forced to resign in shoddy circumstances. Not only that, but the US, to mention but one other Nato ally, is furious with Bonn for stirring up relations with Turkey just when that country is seen as a crucial stabilising factor in the tempestuous situation in the southern republics of the former Soviet Union. As for Chancellor Kohl, his CDU is left reeling because of the enforced resignation of the one man who was expected to deliver votes in the poll in Schleswig-Holstein - for Mr Stoltenberg is the honorary chairman and father figure of the CDU in that state. What slim hopes the party had to make inroads on the SPD majority there must have evaporated. It is a pretty good tally for a small piece of moralistic diplomacy, and a row over 15 Leopard tanks. Mr Stoltenberg's departure removes from the German government its most senior member, whose career in 1965 as research minister under Mr Ludwig Erhard, and who then was successively finance minister and defence minister in the present coalition. In between, he was prime minister in Schleswig-Holstein. The irony is that he was expected to quit next September, in a mid-term reshuffle, but certainly not before the Schleswig-Holstein poll. He was the senior Protestant in the government, representing an important constituency in a predominantly Roman Catholic party. He is also a staunch supporter of the Atlantic alliance, and enjoys respect second only to Chancellor Kohl in the US. Yet he was a lacklustre figure with a poor press. 'He does not make public relations politics,' says Mr Jochen Thies, editor of Europa Archiv, the foreign policy magazine. 'He is a cool north German. In this affair he is almost helpless. He has not made bad policies, but he never sold himself well.'</p>

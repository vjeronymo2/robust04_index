			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Letter: Reality left on the platform Sir, In taxing ministers for parting company with reality in considering the privatisation of British Rail, David Sawers (Personal View, February 5) himself leaves reality forlornly on the platform in two important respects. He expresses a fear that potential entrants may be put off by the high cost of entering the business and 'be unwilling to pay the full cost of the tracks they would use'. Any attempt to recoup the full cost of the track from any private sector source is destined to fail, no matter how it is structured, just as any attempt to recoup the full cost of roads directly from road users would also fail, and for the same reasons. Railway tracks, like roads, can only be financed from general taxation if one wishes to retain anything approaching the current network size. As for the difficulties Mr Sawers sees in franchising provincial services, of course a potential buyer would want a commercial return. The point is that, through franchising, unglamorous, mundane services previously done by the public sector can provide commercial returns if properly managed. Mr Sawers emphasises BR's weak management, yet advises keeping it intact. Privatising British Rail as one unit would be tantamount to privatising an east German Kombinat by leaving it to the former Communist Party officials to manage.

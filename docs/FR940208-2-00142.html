The cross-reference to subrule 75(2)(a) was added because only one copy of a supplementary remand record must be filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 23  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 23 has been amended to clarify the responsibilities of the responsible Secretary for the service of documents.

Now, subrule 24(1) provides that participants must serve their own Disclosure Orders and Protective Orders, any amendments or modifications thereto, and notices of revocation thereof. Subrule 23(d) also has been amended to require that the responsible Secretary serve participants with Notices of Final Panel Action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrule 24(1) has been amended to add supplementary remand records to the list of documents exempt from the service requirements of subrule (1). Subrule (5) has been added to provide that a complainant, and not the responsible Secretary, is required to serve a Complaint on the investigating authority and on all persons listed on the service list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 33  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subrule 33(1)(a) has been amended to conform with the statutory requirement that a party provide timely notice of its intent to commence judicial review in cases involving Canadian merchandise. 19 U.S.C. 1516a(g)(3)(B).

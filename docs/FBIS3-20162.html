			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jin Ho Yun, North Korean representative to </F> the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, by  unidentified correspondent; place and date not given:  "`Everything Has Collapsed'"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Why did your country deny IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors the right to  remove dust samples from the radiochemical laboratory at the  Yongbyon reprocessing plant?    [Yun] The removal of such samples from glove compartments in  September 1992 led to results that differed from our data. We  want all these old technical questions to be settled first.    [DER SPIEGEL] The IAEA accuses you of possessing more  plutonium than you have reported to the organization.    [Yun] This technical problem should be resolved by technical  experts. We have proposed an international seminar and want to  invite experts from all over the world, including Germany, to  conduct a joint experiment. That will allow the truth to be  established. Instead of taking up this proposal, the inspectors  are using satellite photographs provided by a hostile power in  their work to prove something to us. That is not permitted.    [DER SPIEGEL] The IAEA is using the photographs as a basis  for checking two undeclared storage points for nuclear waste.    [Yun] They were shown to the inspectors once, and they were  able to see with their own eyes that these are military  installations.    [DER SPIEGEL] That is irrelevant for inspections. Can one  find proof there that your country is capable of building a bomb?    [Yun] The CIA can say whatever it wants to. It is not true.  We have a clear conscience. Our country has neither the  intention of building a nuclear weapon nor does it has the  capability to do so. We do not need such a weapon. The entire  dispute with the IAEA is over 58 grams of plutonium.    [DER SPIEGEL] If only such a small quantity is missing, then  why do you not simply agree to the inspections that have been  called for?    [Yun] It is not part of our treaty with the IAEA, and it  would be an infringement of our country's sovereignty. We find  that totally unacceptable.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you risking war over a few grams of  plutonium?    [Yun] The United States has been very hostile toward us for  a long time. We fear that it wants to destroy our country.  They are gradually making preparations for a new war. During  the Korean War in the 1950's, they killed everyone. Many of my  relatives died then, although they were only children.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is there no more possibility of reaching a  compromise with the IAEA?    [Yun] Everything has collapsed now. The matter has gotten  out of control. Now, a solution can only be found through  direct contacts between the United States and our country.    [DER SPIEGEL] Under what circumstances would your government  go to war?    [Yun] If the United States tried to destroy us.    [DER SPIEGEL] Whom do you mean by "us?" The inhabitants of  your country?    [Yun] And the political system.    [DER SPIEGEL] What consequences would an economic boycott  have?    [Yun] It would be a measure aimed at destroying the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>

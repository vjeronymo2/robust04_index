			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO INCIDENT RESULTS IN ARREST OF NUNN FOR PREVIOUS TRAFFIC TICKET  </P> <P> Michael Nunn, the International Boxing Federation's middleweight champion, was  arrested and released late Saturday night on a traffic warrant that was  discovered after Nunn chased down a motorist who had rear-ended his car, Van  Nuys police said Monday.  </P> <P> Nunn told police that the motorist threatened him with a knife after the chase.  </P> <P> The motorist, Nicholas Munoz, 57, of Van Nuys was also arrested.  </P> <P> Nunn was arrested because a computer check showed an unpaid speeding ticket  that he had received in December. He was held briefly in the Van Nuys jail and  then released when Dan Goossen, his manager, posted $3,000 bail. A judge will  determine the fine that Nunn could face for the traffic warrant, police said. A  court date has not been set.  </P> <P> Goossen said the boxer had aggravated a back injury in the crash and would be  examined by doctors later this week.  </P> <P> Police said the incident began when Nunn's 1989 Mercedes-Benz was struck by a  car driven by Munoz. According to police, Munoz then drove away, with Nunn in  pursuit. The boxer eventually forced Munoz's car to the side of the road, and  both drivers got out of their cars, police said.  </P> <P> Nunn told police that Munoz then pulled a knife. When officers arrived, Munoz  had a bloody nose. Police said they did not know whether Nunn had punched him  or whether the injury had occurred in the collision.  </P> <P> Munoz was charged with felony hit-and-run driving, assault with a deadly weapon  and suspicion of drunk driving.

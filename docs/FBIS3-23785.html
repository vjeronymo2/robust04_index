			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valdis Zakis under the rubric "Problem": </F> "Weapons with a Latvian Trademark. Is It Reality?"]    [Text] The defense and security of the country has been  defined by the government of Latvia as one of the priorities of  state policy. In any case the incident with the arrest of the  Russian generals, which threatened to develop into an interstate  armed conflict, aggravated this problem. This was reflected in  the draft state budget for 1994 in which additional capital was  appropriated for defense needs.    This money was also supposed to be used to buy weapons.  DIYENA has information that the representatives of the  appropriate military structures are holding such negotiations  with weapons dealers of Israel and the Czech Republic. However,  the production of weapons, including automatic combat weapons,  can be set up in our country in a month, but it has become clear  that such an expert evaluation and the basic financial  calculation have not been made in the highest echelons of power.    The situation is complicated by the fact that as yet there  is  no definite plan for arming the military structures in the  state, although they are receiving weapons. Plans to buy weapons  abroad apparently arose from the lack of knowledge on our own  potential or from the incompetence of certain state officials.  Buying weapons abroad is not simply more expensive, it is much  more expensive. And it is not only the automatic rifles and  pistols themselves but the high price of the ammunition for them.    There is no sense in proposing Russian weapons to state  structures now; that requires preliminary negotiations, the  consent of Russia's government (which is very problematical),  and so forth.    In Russia the price of an AK-74 automatic rifle fluctuates  from 220 to 190 dollars. While the firm EFA is already operating  on the Latvian market on a legal basis with a license from the  Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Latvia (the only  one so far) and can supply essentially the same rifle (5.45,  5.56, or 5.65 caliber, for NATO ammunition) at 140 dollars  apiece.    The same can be said for pistols. Even now hunting guns such  as the Sayga and Tigr carbines are offered to wholesale clients  at prices lower than Russian ones.    According to preliminary evaluations, it is more prestigious  and profitable to reorient this firm to producing domestic  weapons stamped "Made in Latvia."    It is no problem for the firm to launch production in  cooperation with Russian weapons makers. Especially since around  40 percent of the components can be produced locally. The EFA  firm, according to official information, is already the owner of  a packet of documents on several types of weapons. So creating a  Latvian military-industrial complex is completely realistic,  given the good will of the government and the Sejm.    As for the quality of future output, the world renown of the  Russian weapon can serve as its guarantee. For the fact is well  known that an absolute majority of special units of the armies  of NATO member countries were indeed armed with the Russian  weapon.    As for the need to create our own military-industrial  complex, there can be no two opinions about it--the export of  weapons has always been a profitable state business.    In an interview on this topic, the responsible leaders of  the  military structures evaluated the situation which has taken  shape in contradictory ways.    The deputy commander of the Defense Forces of Latvia,  Yevgeniy Bogdan, on the one hand, is certain that the important  thing is to obtain a state order for arming the Latvian army,  but such an order cannot be placed with EFA, in particular,  since there is no money. It is a vicious circle.    The minister of internal affairs, Girt Kristovskis, does not  reject the possibility of placing a state order. Moreover, he  assures us that if a private firm's weapon is competitive,  including the price range, weapons for the Defense Forces and  the police could be entrusted to it. But even so, from the  state's standpoint, the minister does not see any savings here.    So just who is ultimately able to provide an expert analysis  of what is beneficial for the state? Should we obtain those  weapons needed to arm the army and the police at a higher price  abroad or from Latvian producers--at a lower one? Should we buy  them, spending millions of dollars, or receive these same  millions by selling them?</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: Headless chickens and dead cats strain island loyalties IT sounds more like the first ritualistic warning from the Sicilian Mafia - headless chickens left pinned to the door, and a dead cat flung through the window. Such have been the threats against both the lawyer acting for Polly Peck's administrators and the former head of Mr Asil Nadir's privately owned bank on the island, as the Pounds 1bn UK financial scandal strains the loyalties of this tiny Mediterranean community. Whether or not Mr Nadir was involved in the attempt to frighten off both the respected advocate Mr Orhan Bilgehan and Mr Kemal Birgen, the former boss of Kibris Endustrii Bankasi, the incidents point to a darker side of the Polly Peck story. 'Such things are common in a Mediterranean mentality. I've had threats myself,' says Mr Mentes Aziz, Mr Nadir's personal lawyer and a former policeman under the British rule. Everyone from the northern Cyprus president Rauf Denktash to the underworld bosses is watching anxiously for Mr Nadir's next move as, like Napoleon on Elba, he contemplates his future from his island exile. In such a tiny community, no one dares break ranks and tell what may have really happened - least of all the government which has benefited from Mr Nadir's, or rather PPI's, generous financial support. It may conceivably benefit again if, as many Cypriots believe, Mr Nadir does have some money squirrelled away. The local mood is best summed up by one local casino owner. 'Whatever he has he brought to Cyprus. That counts for all us lot here when the rest of the world has turned its back on us,' he said. The Nadir affair will no doubt reinforce the international isolation of the self-proclaimed north Cyprus republic, declared in the wake of Turkey's invasion in 1974 which ended intercommunal violence but left the island divided. The UK authorities have lost all hope of any co-operation from Mr Denktash. The administrators appointed in October 1990 have had a frustrating 32 months in pursuit of PPI's Cyprus assets - the fruit business Sunzest, Unipac, the Famagusta packing operation, and the three hotels. Mr Aziz, acting for the local companies, has issued 23 separate injunctions to block access to their accounts - including his own claim for Pounds 250,000 owed him by the administrators. Little has been forthcoming from Mr Huseyin Erdal, head of the local accountants who audited the PPI Cyprus books. Contacted at his Nicosia office this week, Mr Erdal declined to discuss the case. Mr Erdal is understood to be wanted for questioning by the UK's Serious Fraud Office. The island operations, which are still under Mr Nadir's control, appear not to have been cash-rich, as was at one time assumed by stock analysts in London. The idea that the banks in Cyprus held cash deposits of Pounds 200m, as stated in the PPI accounts, is dismissed by local officials who point out that this is more than the total foreign exchange reserves of the entire banking system. Why, local bankers ask, did Mr Nadir not settle the 60bn of Turkish lira (Pounds 3.7m) owed to the social security authorities? Why is Ms Elizabeth Forsyth, a close associate of Mr Nadir who worked in London at South Audley Management, a company with links to the Nadir family, driving around the island in an old Mercedes once owned by Mr Nadir's father? Furthermore, why has her telephone been cut off for non-payment of her bill? One group which clearly believes Mr Nadir can salvage the situation is the financial advisers, former partners and girlfriends, and of course the pilots who facilitated his escape. They can all be found at the Jasmine Court Hotel, one of the PPI assets over which the UK court-appointed administrators have still not gained access. They might like to learn of Mr Iskender Tarsuslugil, the Turkish businessman now under investigation by the SFO for lending money to Mr Nadir in breach of the terms of his bankruptcy. He was given short shrift during a visit to Cyprus two weeks ago. Company officials say Mr Nadir refused to see him. The money he lent to Mr Nadir was borrowed from a Turkish bank against a house in Glebe Place, Chelsea, in the name of Mrs Leslie Ellwood, Mr Nadir's former girlfriend and mother of two of his children. She stands to lose the house if the loan is not paid in July. Mrs Ellwood is also currently on the island. Meanwhile President Denktash has tried to distance himself from the man he once famously described as his economic commander. Foreign minister Mr Kenan Atakol referred to Mr Nadir as a liability, but asked not to be quoted. But severing those ties will not be easy. Hasan Ercakica, editor of the opposition Yeniduzen newspaper, points out that the ruling National (UBP) party only secured victory at the last election in May 1990 as a result of PPI, through its newspapers, Kibris, Bozkurt and YeniGun and through cash and in-kind payments to villages who voted for the UBP. Even Turkey, which avows non-interference in the island's internal politics, openly canvassed through TRT, the Turkish state television, the Turkish ambassador, and parliamentary deputies who visited the island. Much will depend on Turkey's attitude to the Nadir affair. The SFO has made some progress persuading the Turks to provide banking records related to PPI. Some say Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has been hurt by the uncomfortable parallels between between Mr Nadir and his own playboy nephew, Mr Yahya Demirel, who for many months took refuge in Cyprus, and has been charged in Turkey with fraudulently obtaining money from a Turkish state bank.</p>

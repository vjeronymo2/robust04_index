			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Hanson in gold swap to expand coal interests HANSON, the UK conglomerate, is understood to have arranged to swap its gold mining operations in the US for the coal business of Santa Fe Pacific, the railroads and minerals group. The deaI, estimated to involve assets worth Dollars 500m (Pounds 324m) on each side, would consolidate Hanson's position as the world's second-largest privately-owned coal producer and place Santa Fe among the top 10 North American gold producers. The companies' proposals are being studied by the US Internal Revenue Service, because of the swap's tax-free status, the Securities and Exchange Commission and possibly the anti-trust authorities. Hanson hopes to acquire Santa Fe's 720m tonnes of coal reserves and the Lee Ranch mine in New Mexico which produces about 4m tonnes a year and supplies two big electricity producers in the south-west US. In return, Santa Fe, best known for its 132-year-old Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroad, would take Gold Fields Mining Corporation. One of GFMC's two mines, Chimney Creek in Nevada, adjoins Santa Fe's Rabbit Creek mine and together they would lend themselves to a 'superpit' development. In the year to end-September, Chimney Creek and GFMC's Mesquite mine in California, together produced a record 431,000 troy ounces of gold and have proven reserves of 7.5m ounces. Cash production costs at the GFMC mines are among the lowest in the industry at Dollars 108m an ounce. Santa Fe owns three gold mines in Nevada, producing more than 300,000 ounces annually, and recently indicated it would consider spinning off its minerals business. In 1990 the group spun off its energy and property interests. Hanson acquired GFMC in August 1989 when it took over Consolidated Gold Fields, the UK-based group, for Dollars 3.5bn and the gold company has been up for sale since then. During the Gold Fields bid battle GFMC was valued at more than Dollars 1.1bn. Industry sources suggest GFMC is now being valued at Dollars 500m. Hanson's foray into US coal began with the Gold Fields acquisition. This also brought with it a 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining which partly owned Peabody Coal, the second-largest US producer. Hanson took full control of Peabody for Dollars 715m early in 1990 and at the time Lord White, chairman of the group's US operations, suggested coal would continue to be an important long-term source of energy in the US and that new technologies would increase its efficiency as a low-cost fuel. Coal is now Hanson's fastest-growing business and accounts for more than 30 per cent of the group's capital employed.</p>

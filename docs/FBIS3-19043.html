			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 10 (AFP) -- More than 12,000  banner-waving students marched here on Thursday [10 March]  demanding that the government drop plans to cut the minimum  legal wage for young people.    The university and high school students paraded through the  city's Left Bank carrying banners reading "Equal pay for equal  work."    The demonstration was mainly peaceful but between 500 and  1,000 youths, some of them masked and armed with clubs, broke  away from the main march near the Montparnasse Tower and smashed  shop windows, cars and telephone booths.    They tried to break into a shopping complex, but the doors  had been locked. Police said they were trying to surround and  arrest the violent protestors.    Hundreds of other demonstrators staged a sit-in on a main  boulevard.    The marchers demanded that the conservative government of  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur withdraw its measures  completely, although Balladur has watered them down  considerably.    Several thousand students also staged demonstrations in the  French provinces, at Dunkerque in the north,  Charleville-Mezieres, Besancon, Belfort, Vesoul and Montbeliard  in the east and at Bayonne in the south-west.    One of the march organisers, Philippe Campinchi, president  of  the socialist student union UNEF-ID, called on all Parisians to  join in. "Workers, youths, jobless, come and join us," he said,  and called for a strike Friday in all high schools.    Campinchi met with Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy earlier  on  Thursday. "The minister did a lot of explaining, but he did not  give way on the essential which is abrogation of the decrees"  announcing the new measures, Campinchi said.    Initially the government planned to allow firms to recruit  youths at less than the minimum take-home pay of 880 dollars a  month whatever their qualifications, in an attempt to cut  unemployment.    But it backed down in negotiations with the trade unions,  saying holders of university degrees or certain diplomas would  be paid 80 percent of the going rate set by collective agreement  in the various sectors of industry, provided arrangements were  made for training of the youths.    No one with a diploma would in any case get less than the  minimum wage, the government conceded.    The communist-led CGT [General Confederation of Labor] trade  union is planning its own demonstrations here and in the  provinces next Saturday.    With French unemployment standing at a record 3.3 million or  12.2 percent, employers and conservatives say the minimum wage  is excessive and a major structural impediment to job creation.    Students and unions had charged that the Balladur proposals  would allow employers to simply replace existing workers with  more educated youths at lower wages.</p>

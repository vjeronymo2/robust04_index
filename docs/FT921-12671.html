			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Tough Russian budget presented MR Yegor Gaidar, the embattled Russian deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, yesterday laid before parliament a 'tough and conservative' budget in a desperate attempt to cut the country's huge deficit to a Rbs11.5bn (about Pounds 55m at the present Central Bank rate) in the first quarter of this year, and stabilise the rouble. Last year, the Russian budget deficit was reported to stand at Rbs108.4bn. The legislators reluctantly passed the budget, which would slash spending on defence and construction, though the head of their budget committee, Mr Alexander Pochinok, warned that hyperinflation was less of a danger than the social explosion which it would be likely to trigger. The warning was reinforced by Mr Fyodor Prokopov, chairman of the parliamentary employment committee, who said unemployment would rise from a present official level of 60,000 to 6m over the next 18 months. At the same time, an analysis prepared for President Boris Yeltsin by a research group, RF-Politics, says that former and present officials are opposing reforms and are set to overturn them; that underground Communist party committees are exercising control over regional governments and many newspapers; and that a wave of strikes organised by the former Communist trade unions could paralyse the country from next month. Mr Gaidar said: 'Every measure to cut the budget deficit would be justified.' He expected the new 28 per cent value added tax to raise Rbs140bn, and the profit tax of 32 per cent to raise Rbs67bn. But the government is under intense pressure from Russian and foreign businesses to cut tax rates. Many are expected to under-report profits and sales, and those which earn hard currency are demanding payment to foreign bank accounts to avoid tax, despite the illegality of such a move.</p>

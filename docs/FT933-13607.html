			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Risk and Reward: How money purchase schemes could be made more attractive In a classic final salary-defined benefit scheme, the employer underwrites the investment risk. But in a money purchase scheme, where the value of the final benefit depends on how markets behave, the individual bears the risk. However, if there were a technique to limit the risks the individual has to bear, might money purchase schemes appear more attractive? Most techniques on the market involve the gradual shift out of high-yielding but risky equities into lower risk, lower yielding fixed-interest investments as an individual approaches retirement. But investment managers, sensing the commercial opportunities to be exploited, have been hard at work looking for ways to offer money purchase schemes with the rewards of equity investment combined with some guarantee of the final level of benefit to be delivered. Mercury Asset Management says it has found a way to address the problem with a new product designed for group money purchase schemes with a minimum of Pounds 500,000 to invest. MAM concedes that its guarantee is incapable of ensuring that individuals will earn a benefit which bears any relationship to salary.  After all, even if a lump sum could be guaranteed, individuals will remain dependent on the vagaries of the annuities market for the kind of benefit stream they can purchase with their lump sum. But what it will do, the firm says, is to offer some guarantees against stock market collapse. The guarantee consists of a promise that individuals will earn at least 90 per cent of the average daily market value of the units in the pool in each year they participate. When they retire, they surrender their units at the full value on that day. The guarantee means that if equity prices tumble one year, individuals do not have to surrender the gains they made in prior years. Consulting actuaries who help companies choose pension fund investment managers are studying the product closely. Mr Martin Kemp, associate partner with consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said it bears some similarity to a product launched by several insurance companies in the 1970s but abandoned. 'We are looking at it to see if the guarantee offered is worth the price,' Mr Kemp said. Mr Graham Dixon of MAM, who designed the product, said the reason it is now workable and affordable has to do with the advent of a sophisticated market in over-the-counter derivatives. Individuals who select the guarantee fund purchase units in a pool. For every Pounds 100 invested, Pounds 99 goes into the pool while Pounds 1 will go into a special reserve fund. MAM has left itself an 'out' clause by retaining the ability both to raise the 0.9 per cent management fee charged on the pool and to increase the proportion of pension contribution which goes into the reserve. What makes the product interesting is the way the reserve pool is invested. As pension contributions are made, managers need to calculate the liabilities - the benefits of those set to retire - for the next five years. Roughly 10 per cent of the reserve pool will be used to buy over-the-counter put options on the FTSE which are 10 per cent 'out of the money'. There is an element of risk because the guarantee the investor receives is against the broader market rather than against the top 100 stocks. Mr Dixon concedes that the reserve fund could be vulnerable if the entire market fell precipitously but the top 100 stocks outperformed the broad market. However, in pre-market research going back to 1919 this situation never arose. Another 80 per cent will be invested in the equity pool itself, so the returns to the reserve will mimic the sums it is guaranteeing. A further 10 per cent will be used to purchase options to cover the 'out of the money' portion of the initial put options. Mr Dixon calculates that the cost to MAM of providing the protection is roughly 3 per cent to 4 per cent of the total invested, although he is more vague about the cost to the individual. The cost will reflect, to some extent, the amount of income effectively surrendered by agreeing to accept only 90 per cent of the average market value of equities in any given year.</p>

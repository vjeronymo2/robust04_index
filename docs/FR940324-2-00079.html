			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grants must be administered in accordance with the PHS Grants Policy Statement (Rev. April 1, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interim progress reports, a final report, and Financial Status Reports (FSRs) will be required and specified to awardees in accord with PHS Grants Policy Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Healthy People 2000:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This Announcement, ``Substance Abuse Prevention Demonstration Grants for High Risk Youth Populations,'' is related to the priority areas of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drugs (ATOD), HIV Infection, and Violent and Abusive Behaviors. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Full Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0) or Summary Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325 (Telephone 202&hyph;783&hyph;3238).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Non-Use of Tobacco: The medical dangers and high risk of addiction associated with first-hand use of tobacco products have been thoroughly documented (for example, see Boyle, 1993). Moreover, data presented in leading medical journals (for example, New England Journal of Medicine, June 10, 1993) and reported widely in the press, associate environmental exposure to tobacco smoke (passive smoking) with increased rates of cancer and other pulmonary diseases among people of all ages and with increased rates of asthma among children. Further, scientific evidence supports the connection between the use of smokeless tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, and cancer of the mouth, jaw and throat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical questions now facing public health experts concern the most effective methods for preventing youth from using tobacco products in the first place and for preventing and/or reducing infants' and children's exposure to smoke in both public and private environments. A combined approach involving public policy, media awareness, and prevention education strategies appears to be a promising way to address this serious problem; however, careful development, implementation, and evaluation of specific tobacco use prevention strategies is required to establish their efficacy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention recognizes that its target populations are vulnerable to a variety of preventable health and social problems, including substance abuse. Therefore, CSAP believes that preventative education concerning use of tobacco products must be a priority for grantees. Further, CSAP encourages all grantees to provide smoke-free programs and work environments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Care Reform: The Public Health Service is committed to furthering the aims of Health Care Reform. By preventing and/or reducing the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs among youth, prevention programs can enhance the overall health status of participants. As a consequence, ATOD prevention programs can contribute to a reduction in health care costs related to the medical illnesses, disorders, and conditions associated with ATOD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretarial Themes for the Fiscal Year 1995 Legislative Program: In a Special Message For All Health and Human Service (HHS) Employees, the HHS Secretary articulated three key priorities to support a Department-wide continuous improvement process. These priorities are: fostering independence through empowering the people served, preventing future problems, and improving services to customers through modern management approaches. Each of the four demonstration programs proposed in this Announcement supports the Secretary's priorities. By addressing alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and related health and social problems among high risk youth, these programs hold substantial promise for reducing future public health problems among the target population. In addition, the programs seek to empower communities, including youth, to identify particular ATOD problems facing their communities and to design interventions to address them. Further, these proposed programs encourage applicants to consider enhancements to service delivery systems, such as increasing access and coordination of programs, thereby supporting the Secretary's emphasis on improving service to customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

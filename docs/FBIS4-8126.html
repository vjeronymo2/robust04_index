			<p>BFN     [Text] The Czech Foreign Ministry reacted to Sunday's [10  April] NATO air strike on Serbian positions near the eastern  Bosnian town of Gorazde. Czech Radio received the ministry's  statement from ministry's press spokesman Vit Kurfuerst.    The Czech Foreign ministry supports yesterday's decision by  the UN and NATO on the air strike in the vicinity of Gorazde,  which was done in full accordance with the relevant resolutions  of the UN Security Council. The Foreign Ministry is concerned  about the continuing escalation of fighting in the eastern  Bosnian enclave of Gorazde, which has been declared a security  zone by Security Council Resolution 824. Of special concern are  the intensifying artillery attacks against Gorazde, which lead  not only to civilian suffering but also to the immediate threat  on the UN military observers.    The Foreign Ministry considers the NATO air strike  coordinated by the United Nations as another warning signal to  the initiators of this conflict and appeals to Bosnian Serb  leaders not to reject a return to the negotiating table. The  Foreign Ministry considers yesterday's action as further  confirmation of the credibility of UN attempts to settle the  situation in former Yugoslavia peacefully. Further extension of  war acts could thwart the results of international attempts for  the peaceful settlement achieved so far and bring the situation  in the whole crisis area to a head.</p>

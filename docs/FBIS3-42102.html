This was disclosed by the chairman Pakistan Atomic Energy  Commission (PAEC), Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad, while speaking at a  discussion on Pakistan Television Monday evening.    Former chairman of the commission, Munir Ahmed Khan, was the  other participant, while Farhatullah Babar, press secretary to  prime minister, was the moderator.    "In fact, a successful experiment in this regard had already  been made," informed Dr. Ishfaq.    He reiterated the government's resolve to continue its  peaceful nuclear programme.    "It is an issue on which there is complete national  consensus," Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed said. He was of the view that in  the wake of scarce energy resources, it was an imperative for  Pakistan to concentrate on its peaceful nuclear programme.    "Pakistan's nuclear programme was totally peaceful and its  sole objective was the social uplift of the people," remarked  Dr. Ishfaq.    Pakistan, fortunately, had a number of highly professional  and qualified scientists, who were busy undertaking research  work in a variety of fields relating to nuclear science, said  the chairman PAEC.    "Research and development (R&amp;D) programme, which is  working  for past 25 years, had been further strengthened, and Pinstech  was leading the programme," told Dr. Ishfaq.    He also informed that at the Kanupp, scientists have  prepared  spare-parts and a full-fledged computer programme, which speaks  volumes of their capability in the field.    Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed told the viewers that the 300-megawatt  Chashma nuclear power plant, being setup with the assistance of  China, will be operative within the next two years.    The usage of nuclear technology in agriculture, industry,  and  health sectors was also dilated upon by Dr Ishfaq who told that,  so far, 180,000 patients had benefited from the techniques  introduced at centres where nuclear technology was being used.    Munir Ahmed Khan, former chairman of the PAEC, said in the  wake of atomic blast by India in 1974, Pakistan intensified his  efforts to expand its nuclear capability. Initially, he  recalled, the emphasis was on increasing our scientific  manpower, which stood at 300 then, and to provide them the  latest scientific education.    "Unfortunately, all the advanced countries stopped fufilling  their commitments to Pakistan in the aftermath of atomic blast  by India," observed Munir Ahmed Khan.    In this context, he referred to the Pak-French agreement for  reprocessing plant and stoppage of spare-parts for Kanupp by  Canada.    Consequently, he said, centres of nuclear studies were set  up.    "That was the period when the Pakistan scientists were  compelled to depend on self-reliance which has paid dividends  over the years," reflected the former chairman PAEC. He termed  the commission as one of the best institutions and a centre of  excellence in the muslim world.    Farhatullah Babar said that the government of Benazir Bhutto  was determined to pursue peaceful nuclear programme to meet the  energy shortage that the country was facing.    He referred to the recent visit to PAEC by the prime  minister. In her address to the council's annual meeting, told  the moderator, the prime minister had categorically stated that  her Islamic, awami and democratic government was determined to  fulfil the dream of late Z. A. Bhutto who, with the cooperation  of the United States, had laid the foundation of Pinstech and  other scientic organizations.</p>

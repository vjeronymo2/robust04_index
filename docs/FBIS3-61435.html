A model is made of optically active epoxy materials  heated in a thermostatted chamber until they become highly  elastic and then set into rotation. During the rotation process,  the model cools slowly to room temperature. After the model has  cooled, the deformations and optical anisotropy induced in it by  centrifugal forces are fixed (in other words ``frozen''). The  model is cut into thin plates (sections) that are in turn  illuminated with polarized light in a polariscope. The stresses  and strains in the sections are then determined on the basis of  the patterns of the interference bands. The stresses and strains  measured in the model are then recalculated for a full-scale  structure based on dimensionality and similarity methods. The  use of three-dimensional models has several advantages: They are  easily machined and glued, and they make it possible to measure  stresses in internal areas of rotors that cannot be measured by  stress gauges or brittle coatings. In cases of stresses induced  by a combination of centrifugal forces and the pressure of  liquid on the rotor's wall, the model is filled with glycerin or  silicon, and the calculations are based on two sets of  measurements -- one when the model is filled with liquid and one  when the model is empty. A series of formulas for measuring the  stresses and strains on and in rotors is presented, and use of  the proposed method and formulas is illustrated by way of the  example of a model of the impeller of a high-speed pump.

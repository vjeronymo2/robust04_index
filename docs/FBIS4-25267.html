			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report from the "Regional News Hookup" </F> program]    [Text] Since the promulgation of the PRC Law on Regional  National Autonomy a decade ago, Tibet has attached importance to  training nationality cadres in the scientific and technological  [S&amp;T] field. Of the entire region's 28,000 scientific and  technological cadres, over 17,000, or 62 percent, are Tibetans  and other minority nationalities. Currently, Tibet has built up  a S&amp;T force that consists of mainly Tibetans, the region's  new  force in economic and educational development.    In the past decade, the Tibetan party and government at  various levels, as well as organization and personnel  departments, have shown earnest concern about the growth and  progress of nationality cadres in the S&amp;T field. By  conducting  educational activities through various means and channels, they  actively created conditions to upgrade the professional quality  of S&amp;T personnel of Tibetan and other minority nationalities.  First, short training classes were held. In accordance with  the educational standards of S&amp;T personnel as well as  development in modern science and technology, experts and  professors of S&amp;T departments and institutes of higher  learning  were employed to conduct training classes or special lectures in  Tibet. Second, personnel were sent out of the region for further  study. In the past few years, a group of S&amp;T personnel was  selected for further study in institutes of higher learning or  for inspection and study tours in other countries and regions.  Third, nationality S&amp;T personnel were given responsibilities  in  key S&amp;T research projects, and exchanges and cooperation in  academic studies were frequently held to upgrade their research  and academic standards in application.    In the past few years, the regional party committee and  government at various levels, as well as organization and  personnel departments, have done practical work for Tibet's  nationality cadres in the S&amp;T field despite a severe fund  shortage. Funds for S&amp;T cadres were utilized to support  scientific research, thereby creating conditions for submission  of reports and appraisals of S&amp;T achievements. Constructions  of  offices and housing were quickened and efforts were made to  improve the personnel's working and living conditions. The  region certified the qualifications of 324 veteran Tibetan  intellectuals that were obtained before 1959. Currently, our  region's S&amp;T force is stable and young, with 44 Tibetans and  other minority nationalities aged below 40 holding high-ranking  positions, mainly in medical, animal husbandry, and social  science departments. They are proficient in the Chinese  language and possess fairly high professional standards.    In the past decade, the number of Tibet's nationality  S&amp;T  personnel has grown by 20 percent annually. Tibet has trained a  national S&amp;T force that possesses specific strength and is  full  of dedicated spirit and patriotic enthusiasm.</p>

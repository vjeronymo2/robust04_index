			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Banda resumes power in bid to restore order President Hastings Banda resumed executive power in Malawi yesterday, in an apparent move to restore order after an army crackdown on Malawi Young Pioneers, the armed wing of the ruling Congress party. Government and party premises were attacked during the crackdown, believed to have been instigated by middle-ranking army officers, in which about 30 people died. Opposition leaders doubt Dr Banda's ability to govern after a brain operation and a two-month convalescence, during which power passed to a Congress party triumvirate. An opposition-dominated National Consultative Council has urged the triumvirate's resignation and the sacking of Maj Gen Isaac Yohane, army chief of staff. Dr Banda's return meets these demands halfway, but the opposition wants an interim president appointed, pending elections.</p>

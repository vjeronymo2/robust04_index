			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Xmas retail trade below estimates A LATE boost to retail trade in the last few days before Christmas failed to lift December sales above levels of a year ago, the Confederation of British Industry reports today. The CBI distributive trades survey contradicts anecdotal evidence of a pick-up to shop sales last month, showing instead that many retailers had a disappointing Christmas. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said, however, that the results were an improvement on recent months. Sales this month were expected to be up on a year ago. Sales are reported to have fallen on a year-on-year basis for three successive months. In December the balance between retailers reporting an increase in sales and those reporting a decrease was minus 4, compared with plus 5 in December 1991. In November the balance was minus 9. The CBI noted a marked discrepancy between the performance of big retailers, which indicated that their sales were up, and small retailers - employing fewer than 200 people - which did badly. It also believes that consumers have become more discerning and may have been waiting for the January sales before making significant purchases. Specialist food shops, off-licences, bookshops, stationers and DIY retailers were among those which suffered a particularly dismal month. Off-licences said sales had declined significantly year-on-year for five successive months. Business was better for confectioners, tobacconists, newsagents, chemists and clothing retailers, whose sales were higher than in December 1991. The survey was conducted between December 16 and January 6. The CBI says its findings suggest it is too early to talk of a sustained recovery in consumer spending. Mr Whittaker said: 'Consumers are cautious . . . The cuts in interest rates in the autumn have not yet had their full impact on consumer spending.' Economists expect official figures due tomorrow to show a small increase on the month, but a more substantial rise - about 2 per cent - on the year. The CBI reported that motor trades had the best month in December, with sales increasing against expectations. Although sales for the time of year continued to be poor, they improved on November, with sales of vehicles increasing and sales of parts and accessories falling. Wholesalers reported a year-on-year decline in sales for the third successive month. The survey said they were able to reduce stocks in December following cuts in orders placed with suppliers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   ANNUAL REPORTED GROWTH IN SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 BALANCE IN:            DEC 91        DEC 92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Grocers                                  +43           +34 Specialist food                           -6           -67 Off-licences                             -34           -40 Clothing                                  -9            +2 Footwear and leather                     -44           -11 Durable houshold goods                   -23           -18 Furniture and carpets                    +56            -3 Hardware, china and DIY                  -13           -33 Confectionery                            -15           +21 Booksellers and stationers               -48           -39 Chemists                                 +26            +6 Other retail                             -24           +20 Motor trades                             -47            +3 Total volume                              +5            -4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance = per cent reporting an increase minus per cent reporting a decrease in sales compared with a year before  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

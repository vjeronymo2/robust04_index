			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Beer myth does not hold water Sir, Tony Jackson ('A bitter twist to the bar-room tale', April 6) perpetuates long-standing myths about UK beer prices, constructing explanations that do not hold water. The article makes an assertion about 'the inefficiency of the pub network' and then explains this by 'beer prices in pubs (being) set by big integrated operators which need to cover the costs of their pubs as well as their breweries'. Before 1986, UK pubs offered among the cheapest on-sale beer prices in the developed world. The integrated system was indeed implicated in this. Lost retail volume hit brewers' retail and production profits, so pubs linked to up-stream interests would generally, as economists have long known, opt for a higher-volume/lower retail price balance than would retailers with no up-stream margin to consider. UK consumers enjoyed widespread provision of pubs selling low-priced beer. Incidental benefits included low-cost brand development - hence the wide variety of products on offer, including a plethora of foreign brands exploiting the low-cost pubs channel via licensing. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission's 1989 message was clear - brewers must stop including up-stream profits in retail pub decisions. Shedding 10,000 tied pubs into the free market was the means chosen to enforce this split. These now un-tied pubs have no choice but to raise prices to earn a return on their capital value. This is the process that has pushed beer prices ahead of retail prices index since 1990. The outcome is higher prices that put off consumers, so volumes fall. Many small pubs cannot find a price/volume position that works, and close. The shake-out occurs when prices push against consumer resistance and some retailers try price promotion to escape the trap. Some may succeed, but don't mistake this tactical phase for a new golden age of low pub prices. Meanwhile the wholesale market begins to look like that in many other countries. With no tied channel, only the biggest brands with the biggest advertising prosper, so a share war ensues and weaker suppliers exit. Nearly all developed beer markets are dominated by one or two big suppliers. On one point Mr Jackson is certainly right. Pubs will close, and they will be the smaller ones that formerly contributed to tied beer volumes. Shame no-one bothered to ask consumers how they felt about the losing their 'inefficient' pub.

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Croatian attacks threaten Bosnian peace negotiations NEGOTIATIONS on a peace settlement for Bosnia-Hercegovina came to a virtual standstill in Geneva yesterday in the face of the weekend's fighting in Krajina, a Serb-populated enclave of neighbouring Croatia. Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump federation of Yugoslavia, said before leaving for Belgrade that no further progress in the talks was possible until Croatia ended its 'aggression' against Krajina. The offensive, launched on Friday on the eve of the resumption of the Geneva talks, 'seriously undermines and compromises the peace effort here'. He called on the co-chairmen of the Geneva conference, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, to ask for a special session of the United Nations Security Council 'to strongly condemn' the Croatian action and to put an end to what he described as 'a veritable war' in the Krajina region. Mr Cosic's statement followed strenuous efforts by the two international mediators at the weekend to persuade the leaders of the parties involved in the Krajina conflict to stop the fighting. The co-chairmen said yesterday that they had expressed their 'grave concern' about the flare-up to President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. Mr Vance said that Mr Tudjman had given them an assurance that he was immediately going to order local commanders to stop the fighting. Last night Mr Tudjman appeared on Croatian television to say his army had ended its offensive after seizing a main route linking the south and north of the country. However, Yugoslav deputy prime minister Radoje Kontic said that instead of withdrawing, the Croats were continuing their attacks. More than 500 Serbian civilians and 150 fighters had been killed. The mediators had also received an undertaking from Mr Cosic and the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, that they did not intend to become involved in the renewed fighting between Croats and Serbs, but that they would leave it to the UN to find a solution. The offensive was launched by the Croats in a 65-mile-long zone. This has been under the protection of UN troops since Mr Vance negotiated an end to a war between Croatia and the federal Yugoslav army a year ago, following Croatia's declaration of independence. Croat forces launched a powerful armoured assault on Zemunik airport near Zadar and an attack towards the Serb-held towns of Benkovac and Obrovac, according to Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency. The Croatian government said 120 Serbs and 10 Croats had been killed in three days of fighting around the Maslenica bridge and Zemunik airport, near the Adriatic port of Zadar. General Zivota Panic, the Yugoslav army chief of staff, warned that his forces may intervene in Croatia, raising fears of an all-out Serbo-Croat war. 'In the upcoming period the army will undertake measures to defend the endangered Serbian people (in Croatia) and extend humanitarian and all other help,' Gen Panic said in a letter to Indian General Satish Nambiar, the UN force commander. He warned that the Yugoslav army would fulfil its pledge to defend Croatia's Serbs, who comprise 13 per cent of the 4.7m population. George Graham adds from Washington: President Bill Clinton is expected to hold a National Security Council meeting early this week to evaluate his administration's policy on former Yugoslavia. Mr Clinton has made clear that he believes something more must be done in Bosnia, and that 'ethnic cleansing' in particular cannot be allowed to stand unchallenged by the international community. He is, however, reluctant to commit US ground troops to the region. Worner warns on no-fly zone, Page 2</p>

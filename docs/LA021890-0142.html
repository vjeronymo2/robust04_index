			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEXT TIME, THE TRAIN  </P> <P> In writing of the delights of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley (Jan. 28), Beverly  Beyer and Ed Rabey once again neglect the train as a means of arriving at a  delightful destination in a delightful way. Amtrak's Cardinal provides several  access points to the Shenandoah Valley. Those who avail themselves of the  Cardinal will witness the most beautiful U.S. scenery east of the Rockies.  </P> <P> TOM BROWN  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (5): New opportunities on a bigger stage - Germany / The move down the table basically reflects the downturn in the stock market after the euphoria which greeted unification IN SPITE OF their industrial weight and solid finances, Germany's top companies have slipped down the rankings of the FT500 and now have one place fewer in the top 10. Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance group, Siemens, the electrical and electronics concern, and Daimler-Benz, the diversified motor manufacturer, all lost ground, while Deutsche Bank was edged right out of the top ten. Yet all of these companies did more business and employed more people. Daimler and Siemens again led the job rankings, both with labour forces of well over 350,000 people. Moreover, unification has increased the size of the stage on which German companies operate and given them new business opportunities. The move down the table basically reflects the downturn in the German stock market after the euphoria which greeted the ending of the division between east and west. Between June 1990 and end-September 1991 (the cut-off date for the FT500 rankings), the DAX share index in Frankfurt fell by around 15 per cent to 1607. Germany's stock markets had an impressive run in 1990 as domestic and international investors, notably from Japan, piled into shares which they thought could benefit from unification. Since the whole east German economy was in need of repair, it seemed there was almost no sector of west German industry which would not benefit. East Germans' appetite for goods which had previously been denied them gave retailers a golden opportunity. Car makers did their utmost to try and satisfy the pent-up demand for western automobiles. The reconstruction needs in both the private and public sectors prompted west German building companies to move eastwards in a big way. Banks and insurance companies, too, invested heavily in new branch and sales networks in east. But there was another side to the reunification coin - the cost of bringing together two countries which had diverged so sharply over the past four decades, politically, economically, and socially. As it emerged that little of East German industry was in a fit state to survive the coming of the D-Mark, the introduction of the free market, and the collapse of Comecon, estimates of the size of financial support needed from west Germany rose sharply. For electoral reasons, the ruling conservative-liberal coalition in Bonn understated the likely costs of unity last year - though, no-one could say what these were for certain - and gave the impression that east German citizens would be no worse off after unity. Since then, taxes have risen and the state of the east German economy has been cause for grave concern, although latest statistics indicate that the worst point has been passed. Because of the western German largesse towards the five new states in the east, as well as high wage settlements across the country, inflation has passed 4 per cent. The Bundesbank has grown concerned and told Germans to grit their teeth for a continued tight monetary policy; this means high interest rates are here to stay for a while. Moreover, the west German economy is weakening. The stock markets like none of this. Hence the continued weakness in share prices and the drop in German companies' FT500 rankings. Some of the most prominent German companies do not appear in the rankings at all. This is not because they are owned by the state. Both Bertelsmann, the country's biggest media concern with interests in publishing, records, and television, and Robert Bosch, the world's biggest motor components manufacturer, are owned by foundations. Of those German companies which are quoted, many still retain control in family or other hands by making only preference shares available to the public or a minority of voting stock. The takeover is not a common feature of German corporate life. Certainly, there are friendly mergers or acquisitions like that of the Salzgitter steel company by Preussag, the energy and metals company. But the hostile bid remains foreign to Germany. There have been attempts to change this, though recent predators have insisted that their intentions are amicable. Pirelli of Italy failed miserably in its efforts, first to take control of the Continental tyre company and then, when this would clearly not work, to engineer a co-operation agreement. One obstacle was the German company's voting restrictions, a hurdle which other German companies have also erected. These are not insurmountable, but hardly represent an encouragement to outsiders. The Pirelli-Continental saga lasted more than a year. Continental, which has suffered from the harsh conditions of the tyre industry but expects to return to profit in 1992, fell 76 places in the FT500 list to 377. More recently, the Krupp steel and industrial group bought a quarter of the shares in Hoesch, which operates in similar areas, and said it wanted to merge. Hoesch, taken by surprise, said it would talk, but made clear that it would much rather stay independent. Krupp is also owned by a foundation, but its steel subsidiary is quoted. One reason that Krupp was able, with the help of its banks, to acquire its holding in Hoesch, which dropped in the FT500 to number 367, was that the latter's share price was so low in relation to its size. 'We were surprised at how easy it was,' says Mr Gerhard Cromme, Krupp's chief executive. What may be less easy is obtaining the agreement of Hoesch's management and workforce to any amalgamation, especially if significant job losses are involved. Germany's tight labour laws and its system of co-determination give trade unions more influence on corporate policy than in many other countries. Labour representatives sit on the non-executive supervisory boards, which make key management appointments and approve other important decisions such as new investments or plant closures. Companies also have to keep local works councils informed about policy and progress. Sometimes, companies get into such deep water that no amount of arguing and influence-wielding can save them. One of the saddest of recent cases is that of Nixdorf, the computer company which once could do no wrong in the eyes of investors and then suffered grievously from management over-confidence and the ravages of the industry. Having slid down the previous rankings to 435, it disappeared altogether last year after Siemens rescued it from possible oblivion.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        EUROPE'S BIGGEST EMPLOYERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Top 500 Company                     Country     Sector      Rank      Employees 1 Daimler Benz                  Ger        401        10        376,785 2 Siemens                       Ger        541         9        373,000 3 Fiat                          Ita        401        53        303,238 4 Unilever plc/NV               Nuk        451         5        301,000 5 Philips                       Net        541        86        272,800 6 Volkswagen                    Ger        401        78        261,038 7 BT                             Uk        223         2        237,400 8 BAT Industries                 Uk        171        15        217,373 9 ABB Asea Brown Boveri       Swe/i        541        31        215,154 10 Alcatel Alsthom              Fra        533        23        205,500 11 Nestle                       Swi        451         8        199,021 12 Generale des Eaux            Fra        221        43        173,105 13 Hoechst                      Ger        622        45        172,890 14 Bayer                        Ger        622        28        169,406 15 Peugeot                      Fra        401        83        159,100 16 Thyssen                      Ger        633       113        152,078 17 Electrolux                   Swe        402       155        150,892 18 Michelin                     Fra        574       210        140,826 19 Grand Metropolitan            Uk        421        19        138,149 20 Royal Dutch/Shell            Nuk        212         1        137,000 21 BASF                         Ger        622        46        134,647 22 Imperial Chemical Industries  Uk        622        16        132,100 23 British Aerospace             Uk        523       266        127,900 24 STET                         Ita        171        96        125,958 25 Mannesmann                   Ger        563        91        125,418  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

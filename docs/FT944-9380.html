			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Housing group raises cash from US markets A housing association has broken new ground by borrowing long-term funds in the US capital markets. Sanctuary Housing Association, the fifth-biggest in the country, has raised Dollars 75m (Pounds 47.3m) by placing bonds privately with a group of four US insurance companies and pension funds. The deal, the first overseas borrowing by a housing association, was organised by Hambros, the merchant bank. Mr David Bennett, managing director of Hertford-based Sanctuary, said: 'We are delighted to bring this major new funding option forward to the US housing sector.' Sanctuary owns more than 19,000 houses and flats. Housing associations, which provide low-cost rented accommodation or home-ownership schemes, control about 4 per cent of the housing stock. The government reduced its support in 1988 - grants now account for only about 50 per cent of annual capital funding - and housing associations have been active borrowers in the UK markets. Funding has sometimes been both expensive and difficult in the UK, prompting associations to look elsewhere. Mr David Knowlton, director of finance at Sanctuary, said: 'A number of associations have been waiting for somebody to dip their toe in the water. This opens up the market for other associations.' Mr Charles Arbuthnot of Hambros said the funds, repayable over 17 years, were obtained at a cost of 120 basis points - a basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point - over the equivalent US treasury bond rate. Mr Arbuthnot said the proceeds were swapped into sterling, with the overall cost secured at a 'competitive rate'. Exact terms were not disclosed. The funds, in common with other loans, will be repaid from Sanctuary's rental income of about Pounds 30m a year. The Housing Corporation, which funds and monitors the work of housing associations, said: 'There has been nothing like this in the housing association sector before. It is innovative and unique.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] In connection with today's criminal chetnik  massacre of Sarajevo children, Haris Silajdzic, the prime  minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has sent a letter of protest to  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, which says:    At the moment when the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  commanders for Bosnia-Herzegovina were changing over at Sarajevo  airport, and on a day said here to be relatively quiet, shells  were fired from Serb aggressor positions at flats in Alipasino  Polje [western Sarajevo] where six children were killed, and  doctors are fighting for the lives of another five. The oldest  casualty was born in 1981. At the time of this massacre General  Briquemont was handing over to General Michael Rose. [passage  omitted]    The children who were killed, Mr. Butrus-Ghali, were playing  in a protected zone, in Klara Cetkin Street, just 200 meters  from the main UNPROFOR headquarters in Sarajevo. The Serb  aggressor welcomed the changeover of UNPROFOR commanders for  Bosnia-Herzegovina in a most serious way today -- by killing  children. What else should happen in Sarajevo before you set in  motion mechanisms that would lead to the realization of UN  resolutions? We request that, in keeping with the relevant UN  resolutions and NATO conclusions, you request that the  aggressor's positions around Sarajevo be bombarded, the letter  from Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic says.    A letter with the same content was also sent to Karolos  Papoulias, the president of the European Union Council of  Ministers, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, and Lord  David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the cochairmen of the  Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.</p>

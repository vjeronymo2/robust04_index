			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 CZECH YOUTHS HIJACK JETLINER TO WEST GERMANY  </P> <P> Two Czechoslovak teen-agers armed with shotguns and grenades hijacked a  Hungarian airliner in Prague on Wednesday and flew with 15 hostages to  Frankfurt, where they surrendered without incident, airport officials and  police said.  </P> <P> The Tupolev 154, a Soviet-made plane similar to a Boeing 727, landed at  Frankfurt airport shortly after noon, and the boys, aged 15 and 16, gave  themselves up 40 minutes later. No one was hurt.  </P> <P> The boys took control of Malev Hungarian Airlines Flight 640 at the airport in  Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, at about 9:30 a.m. Witnesses at Ruzyne  Airport said the teen-agers took a woman hostage, crashed through a glass wall  of the VIP lounge, fired several shots and threatened a stewardess.  </P> <P> The Hungarian news agency MTI reported that the aircraft was on a scheduled  flight from Budapest, Hungary, to Amsterdam.  </P> <P> MTI said that Lajos Taba, Hungarian consul general in Prague, boarded the  aircraft and negotiated the release of 82 passengers, including all women and  children, by trading himself for them. Taba was among the 11 passengers when  the plane landed in Frankfurt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wanted to Go to U.S.  </P> <P> "They wanted to go to America," MTI London spokesman Tibor Koves said of the  hijackers. "They probably just wanted to get out."  </P> <P> Hans Neitzel, chief spokesman for the Frankfurt police, said he could not  confirm the hijackers' motives.  </P> <P> "They said they wanted to go to America, but why they wanted to go, whether  they have relatives there or what, we don't know," he said. "Maybe it was just  youthful adventure."  </P> <P> He said they were being held for hijacking, but "whether they will be  extradited will be decided through diplomatic channels."  </P> <P> West German television reported that the two had asked to stay in West Germany.  </P> <P> Neitzel said the passengers still aboard the plane when it landed in Frankfurt  were three Hungarians, four Czechoslovaks, a Dutch citizen, two Canadians and a  Romanian, as well as the crew of four.  </P> <P> Hungary's news agency and CTK, the official Czechoslovak agency, said the  flight crew convinced the young hijackers that the plane could not cross the  ocean and that they then demanded to be taken to Barcelona, Spain.  </P> <P> After entering West German airspace, however, the youths told the pilot to land  at Frankfurt because they wanted to deal with the Americans at nearby military  facilities, said Hans-Ulrich Ohl, head of the federal flight safety office in  Frankfurt.  </P> <P> U.S. military authorities refused to allow the Hungarian jet onto Rhein-Main  Air Base.  </P> <P> It was the first hijacking of a Hungarian aircraft. There was a hijack attempt  in Warsaw in 1982, but the plane did not take off and the suspects were  captured.  </P></p>

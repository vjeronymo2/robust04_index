			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Minister rapped on Pounds 6m coal subsidy A coal subsidy scheme which helped ministers suppress a backbench revolt over pit closures has so far cost the government only Pounds 6m of the several hundreds of millions it indicated were available. The disclosure, in a written answer by Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, to Mr Paddy Tipping, Labour MP for Sherwood, yesterday prompted a dismissive response from Labour. Mr Brian Wilson, a frontbench trade and industry spokesman, said the figure was 'another reminder of how cheaply Tory rebellions are bought off with promises which are never significantly delivered on'. If the figure of Pounds 6m had been quoted at the time, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, would have been 'submerged in ridicule', he said. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, said the figure proved the subsidy was 'a cosmetic exercise'. He said: 'There were so many hoops that companies had to go through to achieve the subsidy that it became impossible.' Mr Eggar told Mr Tipping that the government had so far made seven offers of subsidy. The Pounds 6.11m paid out covered the sale of 'almost 600,000 tonnes of additional coal'. The promise of subsidies was a cornerstone of a government strategy outlined in March 1993 in which ministers 'reprieved' 12 pits from closure while British Coal looked for markets for their coal. In its coal white paper, the government said it was prepared to 'embrace the range of figures' on subsidies put forward by the trade and industry committee. The committee had sought a subsidy until 1998, saying the total cost would be unlikely to exceed Pounds 500m. Most of the reprieved pits have since closed, along with several others which then looked safe. However, the strategy enabled the government to defeat an opposition motion over its coal policy.</p>

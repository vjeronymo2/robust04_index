			<p>BFN     [Text] Wiesbaden (DDP/ADN) -- Industry in the former GDR  only contributed 2 percent to total German exports last year.  At 12 billion marks, exports only reached 30 percent of 1989's  level, the Federal Statistical Office announced in Wiesbaden  today.    The office said the political and economic changes in the  former Eastern Bloc states were responsible for the fall in  exports. Exports to these countries had dropped to 20 percent of  the level of 1989 but still made up 52 percent of eastern German  exports.</p>

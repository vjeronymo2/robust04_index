			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 8 Jun (TANJUG) -- "The remaining  disputed issues concern western and eastern Herzegovina, Posanje  (the Sana river valley), the towns of Krupa na Uni, Prijedor,  Sanski Most, Podrinje, the towns of Gorazde, Visegrad, and the  wider Srebrenica area -- territories they wish to take away from  the Serbs." This was stated by Momcilo Krajisnik, president of  the republic of Srpska's national assembly, in a statement for  today's edition of GLAS SRPSKI of Banja Luka. He said that the  republic of Srpska delegation pointed to the shortcomings of  their demand to cede 51 percent of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina  to the Muslim-Croat federation if the quality and quantity of  the territory is not taken into account.    "We explained that the tendency to expand Muslim and  Croatian  territories at the expense of the Serbs is unacceptable and in  poor taste," Krajisnik said, adding that the Serbs cannot  possibly renounce lands that represent a vital interest of the  Serbian nation, as is the case with Posavina.    "They envisage only a narrow corridor for the republic of  Srpska, although this territory is the only link the western  Serb lands have with Serbia proper," Krajisnik said in his  statement for "GLAS SRPSKI." "In any case, this territory is of  much greater importance to the Serbs than it could be to the  Croats or Muslims."</p>

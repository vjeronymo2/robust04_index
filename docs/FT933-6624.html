			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Earnings hit ADollars 67.2m at John Fairfax JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper group, reports a net profit for the year to June of ADollars 67.2m, (USDollars 45.4m), its first as a stock market listed entity. The company, which has operated in its current form since coming out of receivership in late 1991, lifted revenue by 5.6 per cent to ADollars 770.1m and has declared a maiden dividend of 4.5 cents a share. Net earnings, as stated under Australian stock exchange rules, more than quadrupled from ADollars 15.4m, but the directors warn the comparison is not meaningful because of the high level of debt carried in the previous period. That debt was restructured when the present company was created, substantially reducing interest expense. The directors say earnings before interest and tax - up 30.4 per cent to ADollars 168.0m - make a better comparison. They say the revenue increase was achieved despite low advertising volumes for the company's major newspapers. The higher revenue was derived from a ADollars 28.1m advertising increase and a ADollars 14.6m circulation rise. The company has entered the 1993-94 financial year with classified and display advertising volumes showing growth. 'This bodes well for the current year,' say directors. Management has focused on improvements in efficiency to counter unfavourable trading conditions. This is reflected in a rise in operating costs, up 0.5 per cent to ADollars 580.6m. 'In particular, the company has addressed its major costs, namely wages and newsprint. Since June 1992, through early retirements and redundancies, the equivalent full-time number of employees has been reduced by around 5 per cent.' Fairfax, in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger group has a 25 per cent stake, publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne's The Age newspaper and the national Australian Financial Review.</p>

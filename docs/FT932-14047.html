			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Trade News: EC pessimistic about Japan's trade surplus THE EC Commission yesterday expressed doubts about the impact of Japan's economic stimulus package in correcting its huge trade surplus with the west. It also said that the EC would keep a close eye on the public procurement programme of the package to ensure that European companies get their fair share of orders. Mr Horst Krenzler, director general for external economic relations at the Commission said it was 'doubtful' whether Japan's Y13,200bn (Pounds 76.7bn) economic package would increase imports substantially as it did not call for tax cuts and was therefore unlikely to stimulate consumption. Mr Krenzler's remarks come at the end of a two-day high-level meeting with Japanese officials on the EC's Dollars 31.2bn trade deficit with Japan His comments reflect the growing frustration within the EC about Japan's seemingly intractable trade surplus as well as a more concerted effort on the part of the EC to try to get Japan to open its markets further to European products. The two sides had agreed to monitor the impact of the package on imports and the EC would pay particular attention to whether Japanese public procurement was fair and transparent. In addition, the EC expects the joint exercise with Japan to analyse the causes behind the trade imbalance - which it calls the Trade Assessment Mechanism - to show substantial progress by the time of the summit in July between Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president and Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. The exercise, agreed between the two sides in January, aims to compare the performance of specific EC products in the Japanese market with their performance elsewhere and with that of other competitors. The summit will be 'an important political deadline,' when discussions will move on to policy measures designed to remedy the situation, Mr Krenzler said. On specific issues Mr Krenzler said that if progress is not made in harmonising Japan's discriminatory liquor taxes the EC would apply to Gatt for a solution. Japan reformed its liquor taxes in 1979, in line with Gatt recommendations, but has kept taxes on certain imported liquor much higher than those on comparable domestic liquors. The EC is also unhappy with the Japanese offer regarding the Gatt talks, which Mr Krenzler said was 'totally insufficient'.</p>

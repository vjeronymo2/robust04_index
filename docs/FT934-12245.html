			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Confidence data hit US dollar THE US dollar fell briefly against a generally weaker D-Mark yesterday as the latest consumer survey showed that confidence in the economy had dropped, writes Peter John. The correction marked the end of a one-week run which saw the US currency record a gain of some 7 pfennigs against the D-Mark. Profit-taking in Tokyo on Monday night had already brought the dollar back from its highs against the D-Mark. Then, the latest consumer confidence index showed a fall to 59.4 per cent in October from 62.6 per cent in September against expectations of a rise. The dollar slid a pfennig against the D-Mark but rallied later to close at DM1.6810, up from DM1.6735 previously. By contrast, the Canadian dollar was down more than two cents against the US currency at one stage. Dealers said the Bank of Canada was intervening to dampen volatility in the Canadian currency as it was announced that the Conservative party had been trounced by the Liberals in the country's general elections. News that the Bloc Quebecois had become the leading opposition party revived concern of a resurgence of separatism. There were also misgivings about the Liberal Party's economic programme. The Canadian dollar fell to CDollars 1.3260 to the US dollar at one stage and closed a cent lower at CDollars 1.32. The pound retreated from a Monday night gain against the D-Mark as investors took early profits. It fell further as the latest Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial trends survey showed manufacturers' orders and output were flat in the past four months and export orders had fallen back. Sterling closed unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.4875 while it fell against the dollar to Dollars 1.4795 from Dollars 1.4860. The D-Mark continued easier against rival European currencies as provisional west German consumer price inflation data for October came in much as expected and no signals were anticipated from today's Bundesbank repo. It slipped a centime to FFr3.48 against the French franc and fell against the Greek drachma and Norwegian krone in spite of interest rate cuts in Greece and Norway. Greece cut its discount rate by half a point to 21.5 per cent and its Lombard rate by a percentage point to 25.5 per cent. Foreign investors had sold drachmas on worries over the new socialist administration but the weekend policy statement was mild and investors decided to readjust their positions. The drachma closed at Dr143.55 to the D-Mark against Dr145.54 previously. Norway's central bank cut its rate for overnight deposits to 5 per cent from 5.5 per cent and the krone rose to NKr4.351 to the D-MArk from NKr4.352. Portugal cut its nine-day repo rate by half a point to 10.375 per cent and the escudo eased to Es103.62 to the D-Mark from Es103.2.</p>

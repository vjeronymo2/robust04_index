			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin, Feb. 3 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) on Thursday denied the press reports that  North Korea had informed the IAEA of its rejection of any  nuclear inspection. IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said his agency  had received no official notification from North Korea on  Pyongyang's reported rejection of IAEA inspection of their  nuclear facilities. Some press reports indicated that North  Korea formally informed the IAEA on Feb. 2 that they were  rejecting IAEA inspection.    Meyer said that the North Korean Embassy in Vienna  fascimiled  to the IAEA on Feb. 2 a copy of their Foreign Ministry  statement of Feb. 1 on the issue of nuclear talks with the  United States. But, this was part of their routine information  activities, not any formal message to the IAEA on their  rejection of nuclear inspection, he said.    The facsimiled item did not contain anything other than the  three-page full text of Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry statement  as reported by the North KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, Meyer added.</p>

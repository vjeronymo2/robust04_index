			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUSTRALIA TAKES 7-SHOT LEAD IN WORLD CUP GOLF  </P> <P> Australians Peter Fowler and Wayne Grady both eagled the 12th hole today to  combine for a 10-under-par 134 total to give Australia a 7-shot lead after the  opening round of the World Cup golf tournament.  </P> <P> Fowler shot a 6-under 66, Grady a 68. Both three-putted the 18th green for  bogeys, costing Fowler a chance at matching the course record of 65 first set  by American Johnny Miller in this tournament in 1973.  </P> <P> Spain, with Jose Maria Olazabal shooting a 70 and Jose Maria Canizares a 71,  was in second place at 141.  </P> <P> Mats Lanner birdied four of the last five holes for a 69 to combine with Ove  Sellbers (73) for a 142 and third place for Sweden.  </P> <P> The defending champion United States was fourth at 143 as Paul Azinger (70)  four-putted from just off the 18th green for a double bogey and Mark McCumber  shot a 73 in a round marred by slow play.  </P> <P> "We were concentrating well," said Grady, who with Fowler had survived a  72-hour trip from Australia marred by bad weather conditions in London and  Malaga. The trip ended with the two sleeping in a rental car Tuesday night on a  back road from Seville to Marbella.  </P> <P> At Mizayaki, Japan,, Tom Watson used a chip-in birdie to finish one shot off  the lead after the first round of the Dunlop Phoenix tournament.  </P> <P> Naomichi Ozaki fired a 6-under-66 today to take a one stroke lead over Watson.  </P></p>

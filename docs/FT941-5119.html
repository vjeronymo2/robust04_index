			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Perkins Foods down sharply Oversupply in the pizza market, a move to a new factory and losses in canned mushrooms contributed to a Pounds 2.5m fall in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 19.6m at Perkins Foods before exceptional costs of Pounds 3.9m. As promised, the final dividend is being held at 2.7p to give a 4.45p (4.4p) total. The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 76 1/2 p. Perkins grew rapidly through acquisition in the late 1980s. Mr Howard Phillips, chief executive, said the emphasis now was on cost reduction and productivity. The group had won some significant new supermarket customers. Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said the group was protected from the competition between UK supermarket groups as only about a quarter of its sales were in the UK, with the Netherlands accounting for more than half. Group turnover rose 8 per cent to Pounds 382.1m, with volume growth of 6 per cent in the group's manufacturing activities. Operating margins fell from 7.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent. In the frozen food division, which now includes mushrooms, operating profits fell from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 13.6m. The division suffered the problems in the pizza market, but also had the benefit of a Pounds 1.2m insurance gain in 1992 from a fire at a pizza plant. Perkins has closed Sunbird, its lossmaking frozen vegetable business, treated as a discontinued business. Chilled foods profits fell from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 3.4m, largely because of extra costs, of up to Pounds 1m, at Baxter meat products when production was moved. Fresh produce recovered ground lost in 1992 when bumper crops hit prices. Profits there were up from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 7.8m. Interest charges took Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.7m). Earnings per share were 4.9p (9.5p) after exceptionals. COMMENT If 1992 was billed as a year of consolidation for Perkins, 1993 was one of rationalisation. The acquisition record is now shown up to be mixed at best, with companies bought now being closed. With earn-outs coming to an end some vendors are heading for the door, not that Perkins is sorry to see them go as new management is being brought in. Another Pounds 1.7m of deferred consideration could be due in 1994, of which perhaps half will be taken in shares. Then in 1997 redemption of the first D-Mark convertibles loom, although Perkins now has the facilities in place to cope. Interest cover may look good at 9 times, but that ignores preference dividends of around Pounds 3.7m after tax. After two down years, a yield of 7 1/4 per cent says more about the shares than a prospective p/e of 9 1/2 on tentative forecasts of Pounds 20m for 1994.</p>

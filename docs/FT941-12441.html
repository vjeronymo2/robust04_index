			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Arts: Man who laid the golden egg - The Faberge exhibition There is more to Karl Faberge than Imperial Easter Eggs - those absurd gem-encrusted confections concealing miniature 'surprises' that might be mechanical strutting peacocks or working models of the Trans-Siberian Express in gold and platinum. The House of Faberge also produced silver vessels, clocks, carved hardstone animals and flowers, icons, jewels and any number of exquisitely enamelled petits riens. The tragedy is that all of it is, to some extent, rather vulgar. Consummate craftsmanship cannot redeem most Faberge from being simply ostentatiously expensive trinkets designed to amuse the jaded palates of Europe. Most offensive of all are those objects that masquerade as functional items. A tour-de-force is the salt cellar that takes the form of a miniature Louis XVI bidet crafted in gold and enamel and studded with seed pearls. A hardstone head of an Indian Brave turns neatly into a vodka cup. There can be few more eloquent witnesses to their age than Kaiser Wilhelm II's silver helmet that so conveniently doubles as a cigar box. What remained of the Faberge business in 1918 was closed by the Bolsheviks. Last year, the Russian people have had their first opportunity since 1902 to appraise the Imperial jewellers. The exhibition at the Hermitage in St Petersburg, which travelled on to Paris and is currently at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, was the brainchild of the Faberge Arts Foundation, an international group of scholars committed to restoring the Faberge house at 24 Bolshaya Morshaka and establishing within a museum and jewellery workshops. No doubt the documentation and designs only recently uncovered in various Russian archives - the academic underpinning of the show - will be a draw to Faberge buffs. So, too, will the 150 or so objects on loan from Russian museums, including a group of fakes or Fauxberge. But the truth is that any show of Faberge will pull the crowds. This is one art that is truly popular. Faberge represents an opulence beyond the dreams of most men. Moreover, the history of so many pieces is the stuff of romantic fiction - all those gifts to and from beloved royal wives and mistresses. It is impossible not to marvel at the craftsmanship, ingenuity and technical innovation invested in these artefacts. The lustrous enamels, for which Faberge was world famous, are a case in point. Faberge offered some 144 different hues; the most their competitors could manage was 30 or 40. They used six or seven different coloured golds; the 18th century had known only four. The various Faberge workmasters reveal themselves adept at adapting and transforming a range of historical styles, from Renaissance to Mughal and the cloisonne enamel objects in Old Russian style favoured by the Boyars and rich bourgeois clients of the Moscow workshops. In contrast to all this historicism is the Art Nouveau of which Faberge was a leading exponent. A disappointment of the show is that captions make scant reference to the striking semi-precious and exotic materials employed. The exhibition also belies the myth that Faberge only worked on minute scale. Almost the first object we see is a monumental silver-gilt kovsh or traditional Russian drinking cup used by the Danish kings as a wine cooler. At the other extreme is the quintessential superior Christmas-cracker novelty: a miniature replica of the Russian Imperial regalia mounted on tiny velvet cushions and glittering with over 3,500 diamonds. The regalia drew vast crowds at the Exposition Universelle in Paris 1900. Almost a century on, the public is still drawn. Faberge: Imperial Jeweller, sponsored by Elida Gibbs, continues at the V&amp;A until April 10. Admission Pounds 4.75</p>

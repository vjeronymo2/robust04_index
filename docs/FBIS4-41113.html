			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich </F> by Olga Yegorova in Minsk; date not given: "New Trio in Store  for Forest?"]    [Text] The first presidential election in the history of  the Belorussian [Belarusian] state should take place there 23  June. Six candidates have been registered for this post  including the republic's Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich. Here  is our correspondent's conversation with him.    [Yegorova] Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, when the people come to  the polling places 23 June and vote for a president, they should  make a serious choice: Which path should sovereign Belorussia  [Belarus] take -- should it accompany Russia or go it alone,  that is orient itself toward the West....    [Kebich] The union with Russia is my life, my policy.  Chernomyrdin and I succeeded in agreeing on Belorussia's joining  a single ruble zone with Russia and on close economic  cooperation between our countries. The treaty was met with  applause in the Russian State Duma. Indeed, it would be strange  if Slavs were unable to come to an agreement among themselves.    There is no problem with the Russian-speaking population in  Belorussia. What is more, it would not enter anybody's head in  Russia to oppress the Belorussians. Almost 70 percent of our  people came out in favor of a military and political and  economic union with Russia in a public opinion poll.    But the way out of the crisis definitely lies first and  foremost in the economic integration of our two countries. We  cannot rely on Baltic-Black Sea utopias and assistance from the  West. This is why our economic and intellectual potential is  oriented on Russia. Can the Belorussian economy survive even for  a single day without oil and gas? No. Through our treaty with  Russia, we save 30 ECU's on each ton of petroleum and thousands  of cubic meters of gas cost us much less than at world prices....    Having seen these future prospects, business circles have  supported me. Incidentally, one of the structures which  proposed me as a presidential candidate was a  scientific-industrial association.    [Yegorova] But, on the other hand, it was actually the  directors of major Belorussian enterprises who just recently  came out strongly against your policy....    [Kebich] That's right. But the shock has passed. The  leaders, together with the government, have started to search  for a way out of the situation. Many enterprises have been  restructuring themselves as they go along. It is precisely here  that Belorussia's professional potential has showed through.  Labor collectives, which were successfully preserved by hook or  by crook, even when the enterprises were at a standstill, have  gotten a second wind.    On the subject of our treaty with Russia, as yet only its  first 10 points are "working." But results have already been  achieved. In particular the abolition of customs duties gave us  the opportunity to lower by 15-20 percent the prices of the  CIS's best refrigerators and televisions which are from  Belorussia. We immediately entered the market.    [Yegorova] You quite often hear that the bilateral treaty  with Russia profits Belorussia alone.    [Kebich] This is, of course, untrue. For our part, we do  not take any payment, even in "hares" [Belarusian monetary  coupons], from the Russians for the lease of land, the transit  of oil, gas, and cargoes, and the upkeep of military units....    [Yegorova] What is to be done about the second part of the  treaty with Russia, concerning the union of the monetary systems  themselves, which, as we know, goes against the Republic's  Constitution?    [Kebich] The Supreme Soviet should decide whether or not  there is to be a ruble zone. The government has carried out its  work. Well, if the deputies fail to support this idea, the  people can be asked. For example, a referendum can be held.    [Yegorova] Do you believe in a referendum?    [Kebich] I believe in the people. I rely on our people's  character, their industriousness, patience, and kindness. Also,  I will not, of course, permit the rural areas, the kolkhozes to  become ruined. If I become president, I will support those who  feed us. You tell me what private farmer will think about the  elderly peasant woman who has damaged her hands working on the  farm, in the fields, and has now grown old. I myself am from a  rural area, my mother is now approaching 90 years of age, and  she simply cannot leave her land and cottage.    [Yegorova] Can we expect another historical meeting --  between Kebich, Chernomyrdin, and Kuchma?    [Kebich] Yes, and it will happen very soon.    [Yegorova] But when?    [Kebich] After the presidential elections....</p>

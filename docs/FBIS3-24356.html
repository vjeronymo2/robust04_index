			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Bednyakov, mayor of Nizhniy </F> Novgorod, conducted by NOVOYE VREMYA correspondent: "Revenge  Will Not Pass in Nizhniy Novgorod, City's Mayor Affirms on the  Eve of the Elections"]    [Text] The elections of the oblast and city administrations  are drawing near. One of the co-authors of the law on  privatization, and most importantly--the author of many  practical matters, Dmitriy Bednyakov, is running for the office  of mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod, the third largest city in Russia.  In the elections of 1991, the 39-year old Bednyakov did not get  the majority of votes and was appointed acting mayor by edict of  the president.    The head of administration of Nizhegorod Oblast, Boris  Nemtsov, despite his youth, is one of the most well-known  Russian politicians. However, few pay attention to the fact that  he would hardly have been able to achieve success in  transforming the oblast had he not worked with like-minded  people, among whom we should list primarily the city's mayor,  Dmitriy Bednyakov, and the chairman of the oblast soviet,  Aleksandr Krestyaninov...    And today, Dmitriy Bednyakov answers the questions  posed by NOVOYE VREMYA.    [Correspondent] What are you taking to the elections?    [Bednyakov] I am not a proponent of program statements, but  I  am in my third year of work now and clearly understand that only  he who will be able to manage in the channel of interests of the  common man can expect victory in the elections, regardless of  the level at which these elections are held.    [Correspondent] As far as I know, reforms in Nizhegorod  Oblast have been implemented according to the conception: "First  develop optimal economic mechanisms in the local areas, and then  delegate rights to the center, based on the interests of the  region."    [Bednyakov] We have done many things independently and more  quickly than others. This concerns both privatization and the  support of enterprise. This also concerns the mutual relations  with large industrialists, as well as the policy of social  protection of the population. However, I would like to say that  reforms generally depend on one very important thing--on the  presence of political will.    We may understand the goals of reform differently, perceive  the tactics differently, and act differently. However, in order  to have any kind of results, we must first have the desire for  them. All our actions are subordinate to a dual task. On one  hand, we are striving to reform the economy, and on the other  hand we have combined reforms (and they, as is the case  everywhere, are accompanied both by liberalization of prices and  by demonopolization) with measures on social protection.    For example, on 7 January 1992, seven days after  liberalization of prices, we lifted price controls on milk. But  at the same time we allocated budget funds to support certain  categories of people. Every month these people got 70 rubles (R)  each. Today this is a laughable sum of money. But in January  1992 it would buy one liter of milk a day for an entire month.  And on the whole this measure allowed us to save considerable  budget funds.    On 24 March 1992, we lifted price controls on bread and gave  a subsidy of R260 a month to some categories of people (only  some!)--invalids, families with many children and pensioners. In  May of 1992 we increased the subsidy, and then changed over to  individual subsidies using the so-called application order. As  of 1 October of last year, we introduced a poverty subsidy,  which is paid to those whose level of income is below the  minimum subsistence level.    As of 1 January 1993, we have not had coupons for food  products. The last ones I repealed were coupons for sugar. One  may promise from the "soapbox": "I will never repeal coupons. I  will retain prices at their former level. I guarantee each  person 200 grams of carmel candy, and everything else." Yet all  the while prices will still be increasing, and products will be  disappearing from the shelves. Yet we have said firmly: "Yes,  prices in different stores will be different, and perhaps will  change in the course of the day." At first people could not get  used to this. Yet now even pensioners, even war veterans who  have become accustomed to buying their goods in specialized  stores at fixed prices, ask only that the goods be closer to  home.    Here are some economic indicators. The number of state  enterprises for 1993 is 4.5 percent of their overall number. The  relative share of non-state enterprises in budget revenues for  1992 was 12 percent, while in 1993 it was already 73 percent.  There are no social conflicts.    In 1992 the decline in production in Russia comprised 19.9  percent. In Nizhegorod Oblast, which suffered all the ills of  the Russian regions, it was 7.6 percent, while in Nizhniy  Novgorod it was 2.4 percent.    In 1993 the decline throughout Russia was once again 20  percent, while in Nizhegorod Oblast it was a little over 7  percent and in Nizhniy Novgorod it was around 4 percent.    [Correspondent] Do you have any real competitors in the  elections?    [Bednyakov] There are several competitors with whom there  are  no principle ideological divergences. Those who speak out for  slowing of reforms, I believe, are doomed. The LDPR  [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia], for example, is submitting  a candidate named Buslayev. A man by that name has already put  all of Russia on its ear once. The communists are presenting  their own man. But, it seems, they will not even be able to  gather enough signatures. I have not yet seen or heard any  distinct programs.    [Correspondent] Will you be able to win the region in the  case of some cardinal changes in the political course of the  country?    [Bednyakov] I am sure of that. There were R70 billion which  settled in the Savings Bank for last year alone. The level of  consumption has remained practically unchanged in two years. New  stores have opened--around 700 of them. No efforts to resurrect  state regulation will pass here.</p>

Russia's retired and reserve military  personnel living in Estonia should organize into units to defend  their honor and dignity, thinks Pyotr Rozhok, representative of  Russia's Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia.    "If some Estonian official should try to send out a Russian  officer, he better look out for himself. Should there be a  police check or some other inspection by some kind of officials,  they should just be removed by force, and that's that," said  Pyotr Rozhok, in his interview with SILLAMYAESKI VESTNIK  [Russian language local newspaper in Estonia].    Rozhok thinks that Estonia is `an ancient Russian region'.    "Nobody has nullified the Nystad peace treaty or the 1975  Helsinki accord. This is why retired and reserve members of the  Russian military living here should know that they live in  ancient Russian territory," asserts Zhirinovskiy's  representative in Estonia.    Rozhok also thinks that all Russians living in Estonia  should  take out Russian citizenship `so as to benefit from the  protection and support of great Russia'.    Rozhok says that he convinced Zhirinovski not to toss around  such expressions as `let's bring in the tanks', but to threaten  Estonia only with economic sanctions.    Commenting on the statement that, should economic sanctions  be applied, the first to be hit would be the Russian industrial  workers, Rozhok replied: "Russians have nothing left to lose,  anyhow."    Referring to organizations for Estonia's Russian-speaking  population, Rozhok spoke highly of the activities of Yuri  Mishin, leader of the Narva Russian Citizens' League. The  Representative Assembly, however, was termed by him as the  'academy for dismantling all Russian movements, parties and  organizations, under the baton of Estonia's government.'</p>

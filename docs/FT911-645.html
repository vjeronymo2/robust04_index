			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Spastics chiefs asked to go THE SPASTICS Society yesterday announced the immediate resignation of its chief executive and finance director. Mr Ken Young and Mr Martyn Dunleavy were asked to resign after a 10-day inquiry by the society's audit committee. The society's chairman, Mr Derek Ashcroft, said in a statement that the investigation showed that the two men had 'solicited business in the field of community care for a private concern with which they were connected. 'This was without the knowledge or consent of the society and a clear breach of their duties to the society and their service contracts.' Mr Ashcroft said the resignations were 'all the more regrettable' because the society had been through an 'unprecedented period of success' under Mr Young.</p>

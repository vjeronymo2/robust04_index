			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Pension thief gets two years The former chief executive of the collapsed Farr Group construction company was jailed for two years yesterday for stealing Pounds 2m from the company's pension fund - in spite of promising to repay the missing money within three years. Mr Gerald Smith had been repaying the missing funds from a loan and his earnings as a business consultant, Southwark Crown Court was told. His jail sentence means he will not be able to make any further repayments, leaving the pension fund severely depleted, the court heard. Passing sentence, Judge Laurie said he had to balance the individual interests of pension fund members against the public interest in ensuring dishonest company directors who stole pension fund assets were properly punished. He had decided 'with a heavy heart' that the public interest was more important in this case. Mr Smith had deceived trustees of the pension fund 'right, left and centre' when he removed assets in a failed attempt to prop up the ailing company, the judge said. Mr Smith started repaying the missing money soon after the collapse of the Westbury-based company in December 1990. By the time of his conviction last month he owed a further Pounds 1m. He had agreed to repay this at Pounds 30,000 a month. Mr Cedric Clapp, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young and an independent trustee of the Farr Group pension plan, had told the judge that a prison sentence would effectively wipe out the prospects of Mr Smith making any further payments. Of the 150 fund members, the 12 who have retired will have their benefits paid in full, Mr Clapp said afterwards.</p>

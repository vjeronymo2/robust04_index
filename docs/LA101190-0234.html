			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> STANFORD GIVES 'PARTNERS' RIGHTS  </P> <P> A new policy at Stanford University gives homosexual and unmarried couples the  same rights as legally married students, entitling "domestic partners" to  housing and university services such as library and athletic facilities.  </P> <P> Norm Robinson, the school's acting dean of student affairs, said the policy,  announced Tuesday by the university Board of Trustees, will keep students from  having to choose between Stanford and their love interest.  </P> <P> "The change also affirms Stanford's policy of not discriminating against  students on a variety of factors, including sexual orientation," Robinson said.  </P></p>

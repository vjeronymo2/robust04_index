			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> ALPHA MICROSYSTEMS RECEIVES GRANT FROM STATE FOR EMPLOYEE TRAINING  </P> <P> For the past three years, computer maker Alpha Microsystems' financial  performance has been, well, unspectacular.  </P> <P> Because of that, the Santa Ana company had virtually eliminated its budget for  training programs intended to sharpen employees' job skills or teach them new  ones.  </P> <P> Now, thanks to a $232,000 grant from the state Employment Training Panel, Alpha  Micro is providing training to 132 employees in a 58-week program that began in  April.  </P> <P> "Most of this type of training usually has to be done by outside firms," said  William Mitchell, director of human resources. "A company this size doesn't  have the money to do that. It's very difficult to justify spending thousands of  dollars on that type of training."  </P> <P> Under the state program, Alpha Micro employees are receiving training in  management techniques, basic skills improvement, customer service, and English  as a second language, among others.  </P> <P> Alpha Micro earned $3.3 million on revenue of $51.6 million for the year ended  Feb. 26.  </P></p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Concealing the 'odd' liability: Andrew Jack on the moves to tackle off-balance sheet finance IN 1984 Mr David Tweedie, then technical partner with accountants Peat Marwick Mitchell, identified 'an odd scheme' by which a client company was attempting to prevent a substantial liability appearing on its balance sheet. Nearly a decade later, he has finally been able to respond to the problem of off-balance-sheet finance in his role as chairman of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB). In the intervening years, a growing number of companies have taken advantage of an expanding range of obscure, rule-bending devices which allow them to conceal their full liabilities from readers of their accounts. 'It's impossible to generalise,' says Mr Tweedie. 'Every scheme I have looked at is different.' The old Accounting Standards Committee, the ASB's predecessor, initially refused to act. It was cajoled into action by pressure - partly from the Bank of England - after the collapse of Burnett &amp; Hallamshire, which used off-balance sheet financing on US property activities. Even after the ASC released ED 49, one of its final exposure drafts on the subject during the organisation's death throes in 1988, long delays followed before the ASB was ready to go public. Part of the delay reflects fierce resistance by companies to the proposals. Banks in particular were concerned that they would breach the EC's capital adequacy requirements if they were forced to include securitised assets such as mortgages on their balance sheets. The ASB backed down with an elegant compromise last year - banks should disclose the gross assets and liabilities incurred by securitisations, and then show a net figure after deducting the amount which is genuinely non-recourse. But that still requires companies to be able to calculate the full extent of the risk retained by them. The banks argue that this will be impossible for credit card receivables - an item which several are presently considering securitising. They say that their computer systems are not sufficiently sophisticated to assess fully the outstanding risk on credit cards. If so, the ADB proposals would require them to show these risks on the balance sheet. Fred 4, the new draft, draws heavily on the ASB's statement of principles - where companies enjoy the principal benefits or are exposed to the principal risks of transaction, and it can be measured, it should be put on the balance sheet. Fred 4 will affect many off-balance sheet devices presently in use by a wide range of companies. These include sale-and-repurchase agreements, factoring and loan transfers. One classic example is shown in the 1990 accounts of Queens Moat Hotels - not on the balance sheet but buried in note 22 - in a series of sale and leaseback transactions for five hotels and two office properties. 'As soon as this standard comes out, there will be people in the banks with wet towels around their heads working all night to find ways round it,' says Mr Tweedie. His response has been to weave examples into the draft standard, which is more likely to ensure the general principles in the text could be defended against legal attack.</p>

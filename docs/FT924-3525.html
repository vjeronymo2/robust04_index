			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Common health approach EUROPEAN countries are adopting similar market-based health care reforms to contain costs and improve efficiency, according to a report published today by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD says that its 24 member countries continue to face persistent problems in the financing and delivery of their health services. These include rapid increases in health spending and concerns over inefficiency and poor performance. Analysis of reforms introduced in seven European countries during the 1980s, however, shows convergence in the solutions devised to deal with these problems, despite considerable differ-ences between health care systems. Public finance - through taxation or compulsory insurance - continues to fund access to basic health care for most people in these countries, the OECD says. But health care is increasingly provided under contract by doctors and hospitals competing in managed markets. In some countries, the government is devolving responsibility for purchasing health care down to the local level, moving away from centralised administration. However, this is matched by increasing efforts to cap the overall health care budget, so that local purchasers in effect ration funds. The reforms have been successful in reducing or even halting the rate of growth of health expenditure as a share of GDP, the OECD says. They have also succeeded in improving consumer choice and introducing competition between doctors and hospitals. In the new health markets which are created, money follows the patients and rewards efficient and innovative doctors and hospitals. The findings will be discussed at a two-day conference of OECD social policy ministers in Paris which begins today. The Reform of Health Care. OECD. Pounds 30.</p>

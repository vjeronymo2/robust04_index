			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Gyrations for US dollar The US currency was bounced around in choppy trading conditions yesterday as bearish sentiment tested its technical lows against the D-Mark and growing tensions concerning North Korea helped the dollar off its floors against the yen, writes Motoko Rich. A fall in the US bond market dragged the dollar down, but intervention by the Bank of Japan in support of the US currency and better than expected US economic data gave the dollar a boost. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6319 from DM1.6354 and at Y103.335 from Y102.750. It finished the New York session at DM1.6321 and Y103.335. The safe haven Swiss franc benefited from war talk about North Korea and gained from views that the Swiss economy is the healthiest in Europe. In early sessions, the market tried to break through DM1.6280 to the dollar, a level seen as significant by technical analysts. The US currency dropped below DM1.63 for the first time since October. 'The dollar has had a sluggish performance because the factors that have been hurting it in the long term are still there,' said Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank. 'There is uncertainty on the US-Japan trade front, and the market maintains a very positive outlook on the European recovery, which has particularly benefited the D-Mark.' While tough talking from North Korea and a rumour that a US helicopter had been downed in South Korea buoyed the dollar against the yen, escalating tensions in the region provoked a fall in the US bond market, which is having a knock-on effect on the dollar. 'Developments in North Korea have been upsetting commodity prices, especially oil, and have been interpreted as adding inflationary pressures to the US,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America. He further commented that concerns about rising inflation in the US have prompted nervous investors, fearing interest rate increases, to retreat from US Treasuries, a move reflec-ted in the US currency market. A decent batch of US statistics pushed the dollar up in afternoon trading. US May housing starts were well above forecasts, rising 2.6 per cent after a 3.1 per cent decline in April. Analysts had expected the May figure to fall. Housing permits dropped 1.6 per cent in May, however, indicating a future slowdown. Initial jobless claims fell more than expected to 348,000, from 359,000 in the previous week. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve index rose to 16.1 in June from 14.8 in May. While these figures lent support to the US currency, the market remained gloomy on the dollar. 'The mood in the market is that if it cannot rally against all the news that has been thrown at it, then it must be going down,' said Mr Nick Parsons, economist at CIBC. The Canadian dollar followed the US currency down and plummeted to CDollars 1.393 against the US dollar from CDollars 1.386. 'If the US dollar has a bad day, then the Canadian dollar has an even worse day,' said Mr Parsons. It is thought that the Canadian authorities have intervened to stem the tide against the Canadian dollar. The Swiss franc fell back from highs against the dollar and the D-Mark but maintained a strong upward bias as investors flooded towards the Swiss currency in search of a safe haven in the light of developments in North Korea. Some analysts believed North Korea was a small factor in the Swiss franc's strength. 'I think the view that Swiss interest rates have reached bottom and that the Swiss economy is slightly better than the German economy has helped the franc,' said Mr Peter Luxton, economic adviser at Barclays Bank. He also said the collapse in the European bond market helped the Swiss franc, but also the D-Mark. Mr Luxton added that the D-Mark was further strengthened by remarks the Bundesbank made in its June monthly report. 'The recessionary tendencies in the west German economy appear to have been overcome,' the central bank said. The D-Mark finished at FFr3.413 from FFr3.410 and at L981.0 from L973.5. German call money was quoted in a range of 5.00/10 per cent and the market was well supplied with liquidity. Sterling lost overnight gains made after the UK chancellor's Mansion House speech and comments by Bank of England Governor Mr Eddie George, in which he signalled a future interest rate rise. The pound was unaffected by slightly weaker than forecast retail sales figures and an improved public sector borrowing rate. Sterling closed in London at DM2.4805 from DM2.4862 and virtually unchanged at Dollars 1.5201 from Dollars 1.5203. The Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds 339m at the established rate after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 400m. The overnight lending rate traded between 5 3/8 and 2 per cent. In the futures market, the short sterling contract for December finished at 93.76 from 93.94. The December Euromark contract ended at 94.81 from 94.85.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard firmly opposed to independent bank move MR MICHAEL Howard, the right-wing Home Secretary, yesterday made clear his opposition to an independent central bank in Britain - as proposed by Mr Norman Lamont in his resignation speech. Mr Howard went out of his way to make clear that a central bank without parliamentary accountability would be unacceptable to many on the Tory right wing - particularly if such proposals were set as part of any moves towards European economic and monetary union. Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Howard said there was no requirement in the Maastricht treaty for Britain to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism and the government had negotiated an opt-out on Emu. 'We are not obliged to follow that route. It remains to be see when the crunch comes whether many of our European partners want to follow that route,' Mr Howard said. Downing Street said Mr John Major believed an independent central bank would have advantages in the battle against inflation and he had discussed such a possibility when Mr Lamont was chancellor. But officials said Mr Major was also worried about the lack of parliamentary accountability and they suggested that the extra advantages of independence would quickly dilute as any measure of accountability was injected. Downing Street said no proposals for an independent central bank were being actively considered in Whitehall. Lord (formerly Mr Nigel) Lawson, former chancellor, and many senior Tory backbenchers have called for the Bank of England to be made independent. Mr Howard said: 'There seems to be something about the Treasury that if ministers spend a long time there, as Nigel Lawson and Norman Lamont did, they appear to come to the conclusion that the best solution to our problems is to hand them over to someone else, to an independent central bank not democratically elected.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This is Radio Ukraine World Service. Poland's  Defense Minister Mr. Kolodziejczyk is on an official visit to  Kiev. He met Ukraine's defense minister, Army General Vitaliy  Radetskyy. After the conversation, held in a businesslike  manner, journalist Marat Pohorelov invited both leaders to the  microphone.    [Begin recording] [Pohorelov] Mr. Minister, if this is not a  secret, what issues have you discussed with the Ukrainian  defense minister, and what is your vision of the prospects for  cooperation between Ukraine and Poland in the military sphere?    [Kolodziejczyk in Polish with superimposed Ukrainian  translation] Very serious issues were considered. We met to  discuss bilateral cooperation between our neighboring states and  our armies. We were discussing Partnership for Peace and  exchange of experience between Poland and Ukraine in the field  of the armed forces. Other issues were discussed during our  meeting; for example, the political situation in Europe,  security both on the continent and in our region. We also  touched upon other issues that our experts will deal with in  greater detail. This refers to joint exercises in the border  areas, the antiaircraft defense system, relations between our  general staffs, and many other issues.    [Radetskyy] The meeting with the Polish defense minister was  planned according to a preliminary agreement; the more so that  the Polish defense minister has just been appointed. He is a  (?former) militaryman; an admiral, he graduated from the Academy  in Leningrad and the Academy of the General Staff. It is very  easy to talk with him about the problems facing both the Polish  Army and the Ukrainian Army today. Actually, they are similar.    We agreed that our expert groups will work out issues of  technical, logistical support, [words indistinct] in the  military industrial complex.    I briefed Poland's defense minister on the current state of  affairs in Crimea and on how this problem is being tackled  there. The problems facing Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet today  are complicated. But they need to be solved, to be solved  consistently. We favor this, but [words indistinct] on the side  of Russia.    [Pohorelov] On the same day, Mr. Kolodziejczyk laid flowers  at the grave of the Unknown Soldier, met the leaders of  Ukraine's military-industrial complex, and visited the museum of  the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945.

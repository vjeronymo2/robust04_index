			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 29, BNS -- A crowd of 200 gathered in  front of the Cabinet building in Riga Tuesday [29 March] to  protest the Latvian-Russian tentative agreement on troop  withdrawal.    The meeting was organized by the Tevzeme (Fatherland)  national association which dislikes the initialed agreement  because it stipulates temporary functioning of a  Russian-operated radar facility and guarantees rights of Russian  war pensioners in the Baltic country.    The picket held slogans "The Oppressors Should Not Stay on  the Land of the Oppressed," "Latvia No Resort for Russian  Officers," chanting "Down with Government that Sells the Latvian  Nation" and "Occupants -- Get Out."    The demonstrators demanded Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs or  Special Tasks Minister Edvins Inkens to come out and speak on  their record in front of the rally. But the officials did not  appear.    Latvian National Independence Movement leader Aristids  Lembergs was present in the meeting. Lembergs said that the  agreements have not been ratified in the Saeima (parliament) yet  and they bear no signature of the Latvian president.  Consequently, the picket may help to form the opinion of  deputies, he added.    The Cabinet is discussing the withdrawal agreement today.</p>

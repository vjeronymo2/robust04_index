			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Lamont shares dip sharply after 44% profits shortfall SHARES IN Lamont Holdings, the Northern Ireland-based carpets and textiles group, fell yesterday by 65p to 238p after the group reported a 44 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits accompanied by a somewhat gloomy assessment of the market from Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 dropped from Pounds 3.92m to Pounds 2.18m as turnover in the main carpet division declined by 13 per cent and margins came under severe pressure. Earnings fell to 5.61p (10.55p) per share, but the interim dividend is being maintained at 3.5p on capital increased by the June rights issue, costing Pounds 1.05m (Pounds 830,000). Mr Richard Milliken, chief executive, expressed surprise about the share price drop which he said appeared to be a market 'over-reaction.' He said most of the decline in profits stemmed from the difficult conditions faced by the Shaw Carpets subsidiary which had suffered 'quite significant' trading losses. In his comments Sir Desmond said there had been 'no improvement in trading conditions,' noting that the recession had continued 'bringing with it an increasing lack of confidence on the part of the consumer, particularly in the UK domestic market.' As a result turnover dropped by 6 per cent to Pounds 52.6m (Pounds 56.1m) and trading profits fell by 42 per cent to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 3.86m). Sir Desmond said 'the absence of any buoyancy in consumer spending impacted very harshly on our carpet manufacturing activities.' Turnover in that division dropped to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 25m) and margins, particularly in the extremely competitive middle market range, were 'very badly affected.' Overall the division made a modest Pounds 81,000 (Pounds 1.51m) trading profit. The impact of the recession was felt most severely at Shaw Carpets, while Northern Ireland Carpets managed to return a reasonable profit in difficult circumstances. Sir Desmond warned that the continuance of trading losses at Shaw 'will not be tolerated by management who are vigorously looking at ways of dealing with these current trading difficulties.'</p>

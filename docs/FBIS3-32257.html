			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 3 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Guatemalan  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio announced that the heavy truck  drivers strike, which lasted nearly three days, ended after an  agreement was reached with the strike leaders.    De Leon said that last night after midnight the National  Transport Coordinating Board [CNT] accepted the new rates  proposed by the president for the transportation of fuel and  cement. On 2 February, De Leon announced the Council of  Ministers adjusted the current fuel transportation rates by 10  percent, and it ordered every carrier to have an insurance  policy based on the number of gallons of gasoline or diesel  transported.    The president did not rule out the possibility of  eliminating  control over these rates, but the Energy and Mines Ministry is  the institution in charge of setting wholesale prices. The CNT  is in session and its leaders are expected to confirm or deny  the suspension of the strike sometime day.    The fuel truck drivers' strike caused a fuel shortage at  city  gas stations. Consequently, intercity and city buses could not  circulate and street disturbances occurred.    Hundreds of Guatemalans could not return to their  communities, while others were forced to travel in trucks or  privately-owned vehicles in uncomfortable and unsafe conditions.</p>

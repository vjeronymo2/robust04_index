			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Plamen Enchev: "Officer Putsch?"] </F>   [Text] Judging the recent statement by Minister Valentin  Aleksandrov, one could say that the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer  Legion has crossed all limits of democracy in the Army. The  reason for the statement was the notorious petition signed by  the officers of the Khaskovo Garrison, which demanded that the  military budget be increased. People started to talk about a  rebellion of the officers and even an army putsch. Some people  even suspected that behind the petition, there was the long hand  of General Lyutskanov, who was forced to retire.    Members of the legion claim that they have not violated the  Constitution and described the minister's thesis as absurd. It  is not easy to determine which side is correct. Visits by  high-ranking officers to the headquarters of the three Bulgarian  armies were intended to smooth over the scandal under the cover  of seeking measures aimed at providing more means than those  envisaged by the republican budget, which has already been  adopted.    Precisely one year ago, the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer  Legion  warned the politicians and the mass media that they would not  allow vagabonds to mock our national symbols. What prompted the  warning was the fact that the government and the national flag  were booed at the 3 March 1993 celebrations. No one in the  leadership of the Defense Ministry or the Chief Prosecutor's  Office thought that the warning violated the Constitution or the  Armed Forces' regulations.    It appears that the situation has changed today.  High-ranking officers panicked when they realized that their  subordinate officers want precisely what they themselves want --  more money for the country's defense and security. Despite the  fact that they wear uniforms and carry shoulder straps, the  military are also citizens of our republic and enjoy the same  rights as every other citizen.    On 1 March, the legion's initiative to convene a roundtable  on the Army's problems was supported by the National Police  Trade Union. Solidarity actions were promised. Policemen said  that political neutrality and the one-man-command principle  should not prevent the officers and sergeants from discussing  the country's vitally important problems. One could hardly  object to that argument.    It is excessive to fan tension around the officers'  initiative. It will only escalate tension in other areas at a  time when a consensus exists among society about defense and  security. The high-ranking officers should have more confidence  in the lower-ranking officers, because they all serve a common  cause.</p>

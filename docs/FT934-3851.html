			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: B&amp;C creditors can expect at least 21p in the pound Creditors to British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial services conglomerate that collapsed in 1990, will receive at least 21p in the pound, according to a report of the administrators to the company. If the outcome of several outstanding legal actions is successful, unsecured creditors may receive more than twice that figure, administrators from accountants Ernst &amp; Young believe. Total payments to creditors to date have totalled 15p in the pound, including a fourth dividend of 2p paid out last month. The administrators' costs are Pounds 14.7m, with a further Pounds 26m in legal fees. Realisations to date now total nearly Pounds 1bn including investment income of Pounds 100m, against distributions of Pounds 702m, split between B&amp;C, and its finance (BCFG), merchant banking (BCMB) and property arms. The current projected returns are 21p to creditors of B&amp;C, 29p to BCFG and 100p in the pound to BCMB. The bankers to the group will receive 50p in the pound because they are all creditors to both B&amp;C and BCFG. These could be increased substantially by possible litigation against the directors and professional advisers to Atlantic Computers, the leasing company acquired by B&amp;C. In a letter to creditors at the end of last month, the joint administrators say their investigations are nearly complete and they expect advice on whether to proceed from leading counsel and solicitors 'during the next few months'. Any decision may be influenced by the conclusions of a report by inspectors appointed by the Department of Trade and Industry to examine Atlantic, which is now believed to have been completed. Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the joint administrators, said yesterday: 'We are invest-igating the position. No decision has been taken.' B&amp;C won a Pounds 172m award against Samuel Montagu and Quadrex, following the latter's failure to complete the purchase of the wholesale broking division of Mercantile House, which was acquired by B&amp;C before it collapsed. The money is now being held by the court, pending an appeal on both the liability and size of damages which has been scheduled for January 1995. The House of Lords is due to hear an appeal from the Inland Revenue against a tax refund of Pounds 80m paid by B&amp;C, and which the court of appeal found in the group's favour. The money to be distributed may be increased by a further Pounds 164m if legal action scheduled for January next year finds against preference shareholders in Caledonia Investments, for which banks are suing B&amp;C for breach of covenant. There is also a dispute over Pounds 99m for which B&amp;C is suing its own finance division.</p>

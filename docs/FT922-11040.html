			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (24): Hero's popularity wanes - Profile of Lech Walesa THE Polish presidency sits increasingly uncomfortably on the shoulders of Lech Walesa, the working class hero of the 1980s. As the man who arguably did more than any other individual to spur the collapse of the Soviet empire his place in recent history is assured. But assessment of his role in the post-communist Poland he helped to bring about is likely to be much less flattering. His insistence on holding elections in the autumn of 1990 to replace the communist-era president, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, has proved a mixed blessing. The elections further distanced Poland from its communist past. But in the process he broke what remained of the old Solidarity alliance of workers, intellectuals and church at a time of considerable political stress. The election revealed growing popular disillusion with the new democracy and the economic sacrifices it demanded. It was also difficult to distinguish between political arguments in favour of a democratically elected presidency and the ill-concealed personal ambition of Mr Walesa himself. The electorate's reluctance to give a blank cheque to such a mercurial character of great, if erratic, political intuition but limited formal education, was reflected in a low turnout and unexpectedly strong showing for his dark-horse rival, the populist Polish-Canadian businessman, Mr Stan Tyminski. Mr Walesa's original hopes of being swept into the Belveder presidential palace by a virtual plebiscite were also dashed by growing concern, especially among Solidarity intellectuals, at his growing self-identification with Marshall Joszef Pilsudski, the Polish strongman of the inter-war sanacja period. Once elected, President Walesa embarked on a series of foreign state visits to raise Poland's profile abroad and drum up foreign investment. But his ambivalent attitude towards the economic sacrifices demanded by the IMF-backed economic stabilisation strategy undermined the efforts of his finance minister to push for the radical market reforms which attracted investor interest. His proposal, for example, that all Poles should be lent the equivalent of Dollars 10,000 through the privatisation of state enterprises did much to confuse an already difficult debate and has resurfaced recently to further complicate the privatisation process. But the confusion of roles between parliament, the government and the president really came to a head after the October elections last year which resulted in an atomised parliament of 29 parties and a shaky coalition government headed by a man with a proven track record of non-compliance with presidential wishes. Mr Walesa's awkward relationship with the popularly elected parliament is reflected by the seating arrangements of the Sejm, the lower house. Mr Walesa sits, surrounded by a handful of advisers, on a sort of throne up in the balcony above the chamber. Up to now he has never participated in any debate but alternately glowers or stares in a bored fashion on proceedings. Surrounded by a narrow group of advisers and deprived of the influence he exerted on the previous government, which was essentially chosen by him and made up largely of men from his Gdansk power base, Mr Walesa has appeared increasingly frustrated. He was, for example, kept in the dark about a series of personnel changes among senior military officers. Pending finalisation of a new constitution, however, Mr Walesa still formally retains many of the powers of his communist predecessor, including commander of chief of the armed forces. In this capacity he organised meetings between his advisers and senior military officers. This provoked an angry response from the minister of defence, Mr Jan Parys, who warned publicly of the danger of a coup. In a conciliatory move prime Minister Jan Olszewski packed his defence minister off 'on holiday' but the incident sparked off a wave of press criticism which revealed the strength of opposition to Mr Walesa's efforts to remain a major player in his own right. The coming months will probably see continuing efforts to persuade the president to accept a more limited figurehead role. But it will not be easy. He still has faith in his historic role and is concerned that western Europe is not showing enough foresight in its approach to eastern Europe, economically and militarily. 'I fear we won't always be on time with our preparations but will find ourselves mostly following events,' he says referring to the prospect of strife in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere and the westward emigration that could bring. He proposes the establishment of a UN task force made up 'of a division or two from each country' which could move quickly to stifle conflicts. The establishment of such a force, he says, should be preceded by a solemn pact binding all European countries to abstain from using force and call in these international arbiters should the need arise.</p>

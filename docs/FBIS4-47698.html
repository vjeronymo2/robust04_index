			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa at </F> ANC headquarters in Johannesburg -- live; transmitted in  progress]    [Text] [Ramaphosa]...good in our country. The election has  had the effect of bonding our people together and healing the  wounds of the past, and making sure that South Africans emerge  out of an apartheid past into a democratic future with a great  deal of confidence.    The election itself has been a dynamo and an impetus with  regard to the task of nation building and reconciliation. We  believe that we have achieved a great deal out of this election.  A new mood is beginning to spread throughout our country. Our  people as a whole are beginning to feel postive after the  election. The levels of violence have been reduced very  drastically, there is a new confidence in the business community  in our country, and we also believe that a new confidence has  been infused into the future of our country and all our people  are looking forward to the installation of a new government with  a great deal of confidence.    The political tension between and among political parties  has  been reduced quite a lot, in spite of the fact that we are going  to be challenging each other regarding the election campaign.  The election itself has brought about a very positive and  constructive approach with regard to resolving the problems  which beset our country. Despite all the problems that were  experienced during the election campaign, we believe that the  election itself has been run on a free and fair basis, and we  would like to applaud the Independent Electoral Commission which  was charged with a mission impossible when it was appointed. It  was just impossible for any structure in our country to be able  to run the election in a very outstanding and successful way.  But we believe that what the IEC has achieved is outstanding  and we believe they should be applauded. We also want to voice  pour appreciation to the media in the way they have approached  the whole election process, in the way they have analyzed the  difficulties and interpreted them. They have actually also  infused a lot of confidence amongst our people, to encourage our  people to believe and to know that the election has been  successful.    There are problems that are being experienced in this point  in time with regard to counting. Only a few counting stations  have actually begun the counting process, but we believe that  the IEC is going to execute its tasks properly in the end. And  we call upon all our people to be patient with the IEC, to be  patient with the counters as they are resolving their problem.  And I would like to call on all of us to encourage them in the  difficult task that now lies ahead. The counting process is an  important task, an important aspect of the election process on  the whole, and they now have a very difficult task, and we need  to exercise patience, we need to have understanding, and we also  need to know that they were charged with a virtually impossible  task. But we have confidence that they are going to finalize  the task that they were given despite all the problems that they  are going through. Some results, we are made to believe have  already come through, particularly in the [Orange] Free State,  and they already indicate that the ANC is poised to achieve an  overwhelming victory. We want to wait for the total results to  come out before the ANC finally pronounces its attitude on these  results. We have confidence that results will start coming  through throughout the country later this afternoon, and we call  on everybody to have the understanding that is required in this  difficult situation, even if there is a delay, later into the  night or even tomorrow.    Yesterday we had a discussion with the IEC, and they  appraised us of some of the difficulties that they were bound to  experience, and we had a great deal of understanding and  appreciation, and we encourage them to move with some urgency to  resolve some of the difficulties that they have, but we have no  doubt whatsoever that they are the type who will at the end  execute those functions to deliver a result which will finally  confirm that indeed the elections were free and fair, and we  call upon all our people to look forward to the final result  being announced so that all of us, as South Africans, can  welcome and usher in a new dispensation which will be free of  oppression, free of apartheid, free of racial hatred.</p>

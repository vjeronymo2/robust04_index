			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO STEREOTYPES AND THE DRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE  </P> <P> As I finished reading Sean Mitchell's article on Luis Valdez, a thought flashed  through my mind: Would Valdez have come so far and done so much if he had not  faced the obstacle of the "Latino" tag? (By this I mean "obstacle" from the  Anglo point of view.)  </P> <P> I'm speaking of the extra incentive one feels when he or she strives to do  better than the Anglo kid with the symbolic silver spoon in his mouth.  </P> <P> I feel sorry for those who were not born with a fire inside that, angled just  right, can grow into a unique creative inferno.  </P> <P> I'm so proud of my Latino brothers and sisters who commit themselves to  projects beyond being the toughest one in the gang. Viva to us -- we're much  better than people think we are; but most important, we're much better than  what we ourselves have thought we were!  </P> <P> HELEN M.

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> OTHER AREAS VYING FOR EL SEGUNDO SPACE BASE;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: SOUTH BAY FACILITY MAY BE CLOSED BECAUSE OF MILITARY BUDGET CUTS.  THOUSANDS OF JOBS COULD GO WITH IT.  </P> <P> Business leaders in Southern California's Inland Empire, Albuquerque, N.M., and  Colorado Springs, Colo., are lobbying hard to land two highly prized space  research and development facilities that could be moved from El Segundo if the  federal government decides to close the Air Force base there.  </P> <P> The base is one of five in the country that the Air Force may shut down as part  of a government drive to reduce defense spending and streamline the military.  </P> <P> Closure would mean moving the base's main component, the 3,200-employee Air  Force Space Systems Division, and probably the Aerospace Corp., a private,  nonprofit employer of 4,000 that works closely with the Air Force division from  its headquarters bordering the base.  </P> <P> Local business leaders have only recently begun trying to save the space  facilities, considered key players in the area's aerospace industry. They are  clearly unnerved by the competition from rivals in Riverside, Albuquerque and  Colorado Springs, which have been mentioned as possible relocation sites.  </P> <P> "There is growing alarm about this," said Bill Mason, president-elect of the El  Segundo Chamber of Commerce. "It would have a serious impact on business in the  L.A. Basin and particularly in the South Bay area."  </P> <P> So far, Gov. George Deukmejian has taken a hands-off approach to the  base-closing issue, reluctant to favor one California community over another.  The governors of Colorado and New Mexico, however, are aggressively campaigning  for the space operations, as are business groups in Albuquerque and Colorado  Springs.  </P> <P> "Everyone is competing hard for this," said Albuquerque businessman Kenn  Holzer, head of a panel that New Mexico Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers appointed in  May to woo the Air Force space division. "It's like a football game."  </P> <P> The scramble started Jan. 29 when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Air Force  Secretary Donald Rice unveiled a broad cost-cutting blueprint affecting Air  Force bases worldwide.  </P> <P> Five domestic bases were earmarked for possible closure: Bergstrom AFB in  Texas, Eaker AFB in Arkansas, Myrtle Beach AFB in South Carolina and Los  Angeles AFB at El Segundo Boulevard and Isis Avenue.  </P> <P> Air Force officials say high housing costs and a scarcity of land for expansion  are the main reasons the El Segundo base is included on the list. In December,  Rice will make final recommendations on the proposed closing, which would  require approval by Congress.  </P> <P> At first, the Air Force did not look beyond California for alternative sites  for its Space Systems Division. Its only candidate initially was Vandenberg AFB  near Lompoc. Since then, the service has begun studying others: March AFB near  Riverside, Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, and the Peterson and Falcon bases near  Colorado Springs.  </P> <P> There has been little lobbying so far for Vandenberg, experts say. But business  leaders in Riverside, Albuquerque and Colorado Springs have launched aggressive  campaigns.  </P> <P> "This is our No. 1 priority this year," said Wanda Reeves of Colorado Springs,  a member of a state-appointed task force created to promote Colorado's defense  industry. "I think we have a very good shot."  </P> <P> In the Inland Empire, the lobbying is being led by a coalition of business and  civic organizations from Riverside and San Bernardino counties, called the  Inland Empire Space Systems Division Relocation Group.  </P> <P> 'We're going out to all the cities in the two-county area (to get) resolutions  of support," said Stephen Albright, chairman of the coalition.  </P> <P> The interest is not surprising. Plenty of business and brains come with the  base, which is dominated by the Space Systems Division but also includes  administrative offices, a motor pool, a medical clinic, a day-care center and  other support services.  </P> <P> The Space Systems Division and the Aerospace Corp. oversee research as well as  planning and procurement of military space hardware ranging from heavy-lift  rockets to spy and navigational satellites to space-based weapons for the  Strategic Defense Initiative.  </P> <P> In the process, the two organizations add significantly to the pool of  engineering and scientific talent that underlies Los Angeles' aerospace  industry. The Aerospace Corp. alone employs about 600 doctorate-level  scientists and engineers, according to company spokesperson Robin Friedheim.  </P> <P> The military space work also bolsters the local economy. The combined annual  payroll at Los Angeles AFB -- most of it for the Space Systems Division -- and  the Aerospace Corp. totals $314 million. Their combined spending for Los  Angeles-area goods and services exceeds $360 million a year, with a local  economic impact exceeding $1 billion annually, the Air Force says.  </P> <P> It's a resource Los Angeles business groups are loath to lose. After months of  inaction, they recently began planning a joint lobbying campaign through the  18-member South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce and the Los Angeles Area  Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> The first goal, they say, is to seek support from California's congressional  delegation. But they'll be up against intense competition.  </P> <P> "We think (the space facilities) would give Colorado Springs another important  element of the military space program, and that could mean valuable spin-offs,"  said Thomas Schilling of Colorado Gov. Roy Romer's business development office.  "We could have additional private-sector aerospace business moving into the  area."  </P> <P> In the Inland Empire, business groups say such high-tech growth would provide  good local jobs for a large number of residents currently commuting to the Los  Angeles area.  </P> <P> Said Andrew Moore of the Inland Empire Economic Council, one of the business  groups participating in the drive to move the space division to March AFB:  "This kind of job creation comes once in a decade."  </P> <P> Whether it materializes, however, hinges on the base-closing decision.  </P> <P> Air Force officials say it is by no means certain that the base will be  liquidated. It could be left as is or stripped of only a portion of its space  operations.  </P> <P> The key reasons for considering closure, they say, are the high cost of housing  and land in the South Bay.  </P> <P> The Air Force recently built 170 single-family houses for officers near Ft.  MacArthur in San Pedro, its main housing facility for military families. But  that brings the total number of units to only 575. More than 1,300 of the  base's military personnel contend with the Los Angeles area's inhospitable  housing market.  </P> <P> The higher cost of living in Los Angeles not only costs the Air Force a great  deal of money, officials say, it also repels talented civilian engineers and  scientists who are sought for the Space Systems Division.  </P> <P> "If you've got a technician who can get a job at competitive pay in the  Colorado Springs space command or move the family to Los Angeles, what do you  think they are going to do?" said Capt. Jack Giese of the Air Force's public  affairs office in Washington.  </P> <P> Giese said another consideration is that the cost of land might make future  expansion of the Space Systems Division too expensive.  </P> <P> "You always have to be looking into the future, and space (activity) is always  going to be growing," he said. "We have to have quality people and quality  facilities."  </P> <P> South Bay business leaders acknowledge such drawbacks but argue that, on  balance, a move from El Segundo would be unwise.  </P> <P> They say the transfer could give frustrated private aerospace contractors one  more reason to leave the region. It might also be more expensive than keeping  the facilities in El Segundo, they add, pointing out that new ones would have  to be built elsewhere.  </P> <P> That argument could carry weight if the Air Force is unable to use the money  from the sale of its 100-acre El Segundo base and its 130-acre San Pedro  holdings to offset the cost of new installations.  </P> <P> The Defense Department has said it will not close the base unless Congress  passes a bill authorizing the Air Force to spend the proceeds from such a sale.  </P> <P> As they grapple with these issues, some local businessmen fault Deukmejian for  failing to come to their aid.  </P> <P> "If these facilities leave, it would leave a cavity the size of the Grand  Canyon in this area," said Bob Marsella, president of the Hawthorne Chamber of  Commerce. "And yet Sacramento is not saying anything. I don't understand it.  I've been very frustrated."  </P> <P> Kenneth Gibson, director of the state Department of Commerce, said Deukmejian  is strongly opposed to moving the two space facilities from California. But he  said the governor has not fought to keep the Los Angeles air base open because  it would appear that he was favoring one California community over another.  </P> <P> "The local communities are going to have to marshal their forces as best they  can," Gibson said.  </P> <P> That presents an opening to the out-of-state suitors, who are busily touting  their wider availability of land, cheaper housing and less-congested  environment, among other advantages.  </P> <P> Both Colorado and New Mexico have a track record of hosting military space  facilities. Kirtland AFB has a space weaponry research center, and Colorado  Springs is the headquarters for the Air Force's space command and the  military's joint U.S. command.  </P> <P> Of the two, Colorado appears better positioned politically. Three members of  its congressional delegation hold seats on their respective house's armed  services committees: Democratic Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, Republican Rep. Joel  Hefley and Democratic Rep. Patricia Schroeder, who chairs the House's military  installations and facilities subcommittee.  </P> <P> Holzer declined to say whether New Mexico is offering the Air Force economic  incentives to relocate its El Segundo space unit there. Reeves says Colorado  will offer incentives, but she would not elaborate.  </P> <P> "We can't say what they are until they are completely signed off on," she said.  "That would be letting it out of the bag."  </P></p>

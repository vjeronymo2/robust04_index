			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 21 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic's future  administrative arrangement was discussed between Czech Premier  Vaclav Klaus and the chairmen of the other three government  coalition parties in separate meetings today, a source who  requested anonymity told CTK.    The source said that Klaus, who is chairman of the strongest  government coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS), evidently  believed it would be useful to postpone the issue of creation of  higher self-governing units until a later date.    According to the timetable of legislative steps aimed at  implementing a local government reform, which the government had  submitted to parliament, the government is to present by June 30  a bill on higher self-administrative units. According to the  source, Klaus apparently believes that it would be useful if the  bill was not submitted by this date and the parliament enabled  the government to submit it later, "preferably never."    The source said that Klaus's efforts were motivated by a  fundamental controversy between the latest decision of the ODS  Executive Council and the coalition agreement from autumn 1992.    However, if the bill is not submitted to parliament before  elections there exists clear danger that the government is  incapable of implementing its programme and the constitution,  the source said.    He allowed for the possibility that separate contacts  between  the coalition party chairmen would continue also in the future.    Asked whether a joint meeting of the so-called "Coalition  Four" - the chairmen of all the coalition parties - is expected  the source said that the meeting would not take place on  Wednesday.</p>

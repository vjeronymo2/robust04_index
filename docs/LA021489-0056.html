			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> When Ellen Simon's play "Moonlight and Valentino" opened at Duke University in  Durham, N.C., over the weekend, there was another Simon in the audience who  knows a bit about playwriting, her father Neil. Like many of her father's  works, "Moonlight" has some autobiographical roots -- humor and tragedy in a  woman's life after her husband is killed in a car accident (recalling the death  of Ellen's husband in 1987). One character is based loosely on Ellen's  ex-stepmother, actress Marsha Mason, who was also in the audience. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): Bombs bring white rule to bloody end - The last-minute threat from the far right to South Africa's polling process Car bombs in South African cities; explosions at polling stations; racist attacks on black commuters: it was all depressingly predictable. The white right always said it would disrupt the all-race elections which begin today, and they have done so, quite spectacularly. Television footage of disembodied limbs littering the pavement of white areas such as Germiston, a dormitory town east of Johannesburg, will amply make the point that the far right considers this an illegitimate election. They do not want blacks to vote and thereby end 350 years of white hegemony, and they will try to frighten as many blacks as possible away from the polls. So reports of the demise of the right - which became the conventional wisdom after armed whites were routed from the black 'homeland' Bophuthatswana last month - were premature. But no one knows, even after the events of the past two days, how serious is the right-wing threat, either in the short or the medium term. The most immediate and concrete threat is to the voting itself: figures from the Pretoria-based Human Sciences Research Council show that large numbers of voters will not go to the polls if they expect violence: 19 per cent of whites and mixed-race 'coloureds' and a startling 40 per cent of Indians say they will stay away if there is a perceived threat of injury. Ironically, blacks appear less likely to abstain because of violence: polls show only 12 per cent would stay away, probably because these voters are far more inured to violence in their daily lives than whites. According to Professor Lawrence Schlemmer, the director of the HSRC, the effect on the election result could be 'dramatic'. He believes the right-wing bombings pose a far greater threat to the poll than violence between rival black groups, primarily the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom party. Fighting between those groups tends to be localised, and could prevent voting only in specific areas, whereas the white right wing is distributed throughout South Africa and could disrupt voting at many points. 'The bombings will have a blanket effect on all the people who will have to cast their votes in cosmopolitan areas,' he says. Ironically, he notes, the party most likely to benefit would be the ANC, because its supporters, mainly blacks, are less likely to be frightened away from the polls. The biggest loser would be the National party, whose voters from the minority white, coloured and Indian groups are more timid. Still, there is no question but that the poll will go ahead, and that the violent boycotters are too few to throw any doubt on the legitimacy of the election. Indeed, South African markets seemed to take the whole episode in their stride, rising despite the bomb deaths on the principle that right-wing violence was only to be expected, and was nowhere near the threat to long-term stability posed by, for example, the Inkatha election boycott narrowly averted last week. Inkatha's decision to participate in elections largely put paid to nightmare situations of joint resistance by the white and black right, and no amount of bombs can change that. And even among the white right, the divisions are deep and damaging, undermining the white right's ability to pose a credible long-term threat. For the bombers have found themselves increasingly isolated from the broad mass of South Africans, across the political spectrum, and this deprives them of a supportive political atmosphere in which to operate. Since the decision last month by Gen Constand Viljoen, the right-wing leader of the Freedom Front, to participate in today's poll, the case for violent struggle has been much diminished. Afrikaners now have an electoral outlet for their fears and a constitutional means of demonstrating their demand for a volkstaat or homeland - by voting for Gen Viljoen's Freedom Front. Votes for this party are due to be counted separately to gauge support for a volkstaat. Much will depend on the share of the vote gained by the Freedom Front in the next three days of voting: if Gen Viljoen can score the 700,000-odd votes which he expects, this will further undermine support for violence. Still, no one really knows how many trained military men the white right could count on for further resistance. There are literally hundreds of lunatic cells of right-wingers throughout the country, and they have access to commercial explosives from the mines, where many are employed, and possibly to arms from state armouries (where sympathisers are employed) for further sabotage. Among the various part-time, locally-based forces and reservists, which total up to 450,000 men, right-wing support is unclear. But the top ranks of the South African Defence Force remain committed to the new government, which can be expected to act far more harshly against the right than the present government. And there is no reason to believe that the counter-insurgency tactics of the SADF, which worked so well against Umkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's military wing, would be any less effective against the white right. And in any case, it takes more than a few vicious acts of terrorism - or even many vicious acts of terrorism - to make a civil war. Without the participation in such acts of the black right, in the form of Inkatha, it is almost impossible to predict a conflict in which the integrity of the South African state is seriously affected, and many people die. The real risk would be if Inkatha were also to reject the outcome of the election, and were to team up again with the right wing afterwards. That truly would be a scenario too ghastly to contemplate. With any luck, it will be avoided.</p>

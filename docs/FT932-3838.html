			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (6): Tough but charming architect of change - Profile, Cyril Ramaphosa IT MUST have been a rare moment of pleasure for Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary-general of the African National Congress: the chance to call a South African minister of police on the carpet before him, as though Mr Ramaphosa were prime minister of a new South Africa. That was the scenario two weeks ago, when Hernus Kriel, minister of law and order, was summoned to the multi-party forum in Johannesburg to defend the arrest of 75 leaders of the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress, most of them later released without charge. After three hours of systematic drubbing from almost every speaker in the 26-party forum, Mr Ramaphosa summed up: for the first time in history, a minister of police had been forced to explain his conduct, not just to whites (in the white-dominated parliament), but to the multi-racial South African public as represented at the forum. 'You were summoned here to prove that your actions were legitimate and you have failed to prove your case,' Mr Ramaphosa told an enraged Mr Kriel. 'I want you to remember things are changing.' No one can doubt that Mr Ramaphosa - the most important black leader apart from Nelson Mandela - is one of the chief architects of change. With wit and intelligence, he has done more than anyone else to steer delegates at the multi-party talks towards constitutional solutions. Tough, nay arrogant when he can afford to be - with Mr Kriel, for example, who put up a woefully weak defence of the PAC arrests - charm is Mr Ramaphosa's more frequent weapon. He knows that part of his job as ANC chief negotiator is to help his opponents save face - an especially useful skill when dealing with the proud and irascible Inkatha Freedom Party - and he is never loath to help out, in the interests of constructive compromise. Mr Ramaphosa spoke recently about the key compromises yet to be achieved: on the related issues of how power will be shared within the Cabinet of a new multi-racial coalition government, and how it will be distributed between central and regional governments. The ANC secretary-general rejects outright the demand made above, by President FW de Klerk, for a system of permanently entrenched power-sharing which would effectively give the National Party a veto over decisions in Cabinet for the foreseeable future. Mr Ramaphosa and the ANC are clearly willing to go a long way towards accommodating the National Party's desire to retain substantial power in an elected government of national unity - further, indeed, than many of their supporters would wish - but the coalition must be voluntary, not enforced. 'Naturally an inner cabinet will evolve where deadlocks can be resolved,' says Mr Ramaphosa, in response to Government's proposal that an 'executive council' of the main party leaders (probably the ANC, the NP and Inkatha) should form an inner cabinet which would be forced to take all principal decisions by consensus. 'The key issue is to what extent you give them formal recognition,' he says, reflecting on government's demand that this arrangement be entrenched in the constitution. 'An inner cabinet creates a second centre of power - it goes beyond a government of national unity, making the outer cabinet just a rubber stamp. 'The president will consult, naturally,' he says, stressing the ANC's vision of a voluntary coalition, evolving naturally to respond to the need for racial reconciliation in the new South Africa. 'But he will have executive powers.' (The ANC's position is that the president will seek consensus on only the most crucial decisions. If this cannot be done, he will proceed after a two-thirds Cabinet vote.) Mr Ramaphosa predicts success in resolving this issue, as well as the related problem of how power will be shared between regions and central government. 'The centre must have overriding powers on certain things but in other areas powers must be exclusive to the other levels,' he argues, highlighting a significant ANC concession to those who favour strong regional government (the National Party, Inkatha, and other regionally-based parties): regions must have exclusive powers, entrenched in the constitution. 'The key issue will be to identify those powers,' he says, mentioning 'tree planting, dog licences, casino licences' as areas for regional control. Mr Ramaphosa knows that Inkatha will never settle for menial powers for regions, and he offers this list mostly in jest. But even when serious, he is offering little more than administrative control of areas such as health and education to the regions: the national government must set policy in these areas, he says, adding 'central government must have overriding powers if a region deviates from national policy'. Regionally-based parties, especially Inkatha, continue to demand more power, but the ANC leader nevertheless believes agreement will be reached on this issue soon. Indeed, he is confident of agreement soon on all the constitutional measures needed to ensure the first multi-racial elections can be held by next April. But then, he has little choice but to be optimistic: no ANC leader is more closely identified with negotiations; Mr Ramaphosa has a vital vested interest in success.</p>

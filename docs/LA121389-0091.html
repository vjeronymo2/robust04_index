			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SMALL PUBLISHER MAY TRY TAKEOVER OF GRADCO SYSTEMS  </P> <P> In a challenge to a proposed management-led leveraged buyout of Gradco Systems  Inc., a small New York City publisher said Tuesday it has acquired a 6.3% stake  in the office equipment maker and may try to take over the company.  </P> <P> Plenum Publishing Corp., a publisher of scientific books and journals, revealed  its Gradco holdings in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The disclosure comes less than two weeks after Gradco Chairman Keith B. Stewart  said he was having difficulty coming up with funding for his proposed buyout of  the company.  </P> <P> A group led by Plenum, and including Plenum Chairman Martin E. Tash and other  company officers, began buying Gradco shares on Sept. 29, the day after Stewart  announced that he was trying to put together a buyout of the company.  </P> <P> According to the filing, Plenum said it decided to invest in Gradco in order to  profit from the proposed management buyout. But when Stewart announced Dec. 1  that he was having trouble financing the deal, the group decided it would act  to "maximize shareholder values."  </P> <P> The New York firm paid $6.8 million to acquire the Gradco shares, which were  purchased between Sept. 29 and Dec. 5 at prices ranging from $11.62 per share  to $18.87 per share, the filing said.  </P> <P> In over-the counter trading Tuesday, Gradco's shares closed at $11.625, up 37.5  cents.  </P> <P> Gradco officials could not be reached for comment and Plenum officials declined  to comment beyond the SEC filing.  </P> <P> Jeff Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities Corp., a Costa Mesa investment  firm, said a hostile takeover of Gradco would be difficult because Stewart and  other company insiders own 16% of the firm's stock.  </P> <P> By failing to complete its offer for the company, Kilpatrick said, Gradco  management attracted attention to the company and made itself vulnerable to a  takeover bid from an outside party.  </P> <P> Since it was founded in 1946, Plenum has focused on scientific publications,  particularly the English translations of Russian technical journals. The  company, which has 300 employees, had 1988 sales of about $40 million. A Plenum  spokesman said the company had total assets of $126 million for the period  ended Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Plenum is no neophyte in the corporate takeover game.  </P> <P> In 1987, the publishing company made an unsuccessful bid to take over Arthur D.  Little, a New York consulting company. Plenum abandoned the effort after  Little's board and controlling shareholder rejected the $128-million offer.  </P></p>

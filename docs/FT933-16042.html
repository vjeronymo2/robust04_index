			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: Private funding for pensions Sir, Your analysis of the pitfalls in both common methods of pension provision ('Second best pensions', June 30) hints at the real problem. State pensions will become more costly or benefits must reduce. As the unfunded state system is unsustainable at present levels in the long term, the private sector will be needed to provide the balance. However, it is notoriously ineffective in that role without aid; people will not save sufficiently until too late. Witness the poor take-up of good schemes demanding low employee contributions. Government has already legislated for compulsory pensions via Serps (state earnings-related pension scheme). It should now go further by requiring minimum private contributions in respect of all employees to become over time, say, 10 per cent of pay, while gradually cutting back on unfunded state provision. Transparency would require this element to be defined contribution, leaving any top-up to companies to negotiate for employees direct. This would deliver quality benefits cost effectively without disruption to our cost base. Stephen G Glanfield, HCS Pensions Management, Unity Centre, Unity Street, Bristol BS1 5HH</p>

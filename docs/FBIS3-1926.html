The two draft laws  are: the draft supplementary regulations governing severe  punishment of criminals who organize and transport others across  the border (boundary) illegally; and the draft law on the  protection of investments of Taiwan compatriots.    In the reports, Xiang Chunyi and Wang Shuwen said: Following  the preliminary examination of these two draft laws by the fifth  meeting of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, the Law Committee  and the Legislative Affairs Commission distributed copies of the  draft laws to the relevant provinces and autonomous regions as  well as the central departments concerned, and invited the  central relevant departments and legal experts to forums to  further solicit their views. Based on the views of the Standing  Committee members and relevant NPC special committees after  deliberation, as well as the opinions of local governments,  departments, and experts, the Law Committee examined the draft  laws and deemed it necessary to enact the supplementary  regulations and the law on protection of the investments of  Taiwan compatriots. The committee holds that the draft laws are  basically feasible; and after revisions, the committee proposes  that the NPC Standing Committee deliberate and approve the draft  laws.    On the supplementary regulations, Xiang Chunyi said: Some  members and local governments suggested that in order to  severely punish criminals who organize and transport others  across the border (boundary) illegally, the regulations should  clearly stipulate the death penalty for such criminals who have  committed other serious offenses. Therefore, the Law Committee  proposes that the draft regulations be revised as follows:  "Offenders who also commit the crimes of killing, injuring, or  raping illegal emigrants, or who also commit the crimes of  killing or injuring law enforcement personnel, may be sentenced  to death pursuant to the law." Meanwhile, similar revisions were  suggested regarding the regulations governing penalties for  criminals who transport others across the border (boundary)  illegally.    Some members suggested a harsher penalty for state  functionaries whose violation of the regulations constitutes a  crime. Hence, the Law Committee proposes that the draft  regulations be revised as follows: "State functionaries in  charge of issuing passports, visas, and other entry and exit  documents, who knowingly issue exit or entry documents to  illegal crossings of the border (boundary); and border defense,  customs, and other law enforcement personnel, who knowingly let  illegal emigrants cross the border (boundary), shall be  sentenced to not more than three years of fixed-term  imprisonment, criminal detention, or control; in serious cases,  the sentence shall be not less than three years and not more  than 10 years of fixed-term imprisonment."    On the law on the protection of the investments of Taiwan  compatriots, Wang Shuwen said: Based on the suggestions of some  members, local governments, and departments, the Law Committee  proposes that the law be revised as follows: "This law is  formulated with a view to protecting and encouraging investments  by companies, enterprises, and other economic organizations, as  well as individuals, from the Taiwan region in other provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities, and to promoting the  economic development on both sides of the Taiwan Strait." Some  members and departments suggested that this law should provide a  clear definition of the investments of Taiwan compatriots, and  it should only apply to the investment activities of Taiwan  compatriots. Therefore, the committee proposes that the law  contain the following provisions: "This law applies to the  investments of Taiwan compatriots; in circumstances where the  law does not provide a stipulation, they shall be enforced  according to other relevant state laws and administrative rules  governing the investments of Taiwan compatriots." "The  investments of Taiwan compatriots referred to in this law are  investments by companies, enterprises, and other economic  organizations from the Taiwan region in other provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities."    Wang Shuwen said: Some departments suggested that in  addition to protecting the investments and investment returns of  Taiwan compatriots in the mainland, it is also necessary to  protect the personal safety of the investors. Hence, the  committee proposes that the draft law be revised as the follows:  "The state, by law, protects the personal safety, investments,  investment returns, and other lawful rights and interests of  investors." Some members suggested that we should encourage  Taiwan compatriot-investors to use their investment returns to  make new investments, which should not be limited to convertible  currency. Therefore, the committee proposes that the draft law  be revised as follows: "Taiwan compatriots-investors may use  convertible currency; machinery, equipment, or other material  goods; industrial property rights; and nonpatented technology as  investments." "Taiwan compatriot- investors may use their  investment returns to make new investments.    He added: According to provisions of the draft law,  "enterprises funded and set up by Taiwan compatriot-investors in  the mainland should comply with the state's national economic  and social development plans and industrial policy." At the  suggestion of some members, the committee proposes that the  provisions be revised as follows: "Enterprises set up with the  investments of Taiwan compatriots should comply with the state's  industrial policy and should be beneficial to national economic  development."</p>

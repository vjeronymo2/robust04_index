			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Observer: Faraway faceless How seriously is the government committed to helping Britain's small businesses? Less and less, their proprietors think, especially now the Department of Employment's key policy unit for small firms is being exiled to Sheffield. Since the only member of its 30 staff going with it is a junior clerk, continuity of policy is scarcely guaranteed. The rest, having declined to leave the centre of 'Yes Minister' politics in London, are transferring to other departments around the capital. Small firms minister Eric Forth will also stay there, some 160 miles away from his policy advisers - always assuming, of course, that some are found to replace those who've jumped ship. The official line is that the berths will soon be filled from the 40 staff of the management-training section the small firms unit already has in Sheffield, and others employed there by the former Training Agency now broken up. As trained civil servants, it is said, they'll have no trouble taking over the helm. Moreover video conferencing and fax machines will bridge the gulf between the new advisers and their minister in London. While small-business lobby groups are not so sure, it's clearly a case of time alone will tell. The move, by the way, is due to be completed by the end of the month.</p>

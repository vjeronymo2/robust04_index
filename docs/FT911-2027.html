			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Whittaker sells Ship Canal stake MR JOHN Whittaker, the northern property developer, is selling his family's 68 per cent interest in Manchester Ship Canal to Peel Holdings, the quoted property company in which he already has a 47 per cent stake. The Pounds 79m cash and shares deal will give Mr Whittaker majority control of Peel and bolsters Peel's balance sheet which has been battered by property revaluations. Without the transaction Peel's gearing would have risen to 133 per cent, breaching a bank lending covenant of 125 per cent. Mr Whittaker feared some members of a 20-bank consortium would have wanted unacceptable conditions to renegotiate Peel's debt. Although Peel has cash of Pounds 109m from Pounds 200m of property sales in the past 12 months, it has Pounds 336m of debts. The cash and shares deal for the ship canal, of which Mr Whittaker won control after a bitter three-year takeover battle in 1987, will increase debts to Pounds 390m but lower gearing to 108 per cent. Peel will pay Largs, Mr Whittaker's private group, Pounds 79m, of which Pounds 22.7m will be deferred one year, Pounds 40m will be paid in cash and the balance in 4.5m new Peel ordinary shares and 20m new convertible preference shares. Mr Whittaker's holding in Peel will rise to 50.3 per cent. Mr Peter Scott, Peel's managing director, said yesterday: 'If you are issuing equity these days you have to acquire something with growth potential. The Ship Canal owns more than 6,000 acres of land, including a 304-acre site at Dumplington where a 1m sq ft regional shopping centre is planned.' Dumplington, on the western edge of Trafford Park in Greater Manchester, is at the nexus of five motorways and the A580 East Lancashire road. Following a public inquiry, the government has pronounced in favour of the development but formal planning permission has yet to be granted. Whittaker interests own nearly all the Ship Canal's 4m preferred shares and about 2.5m of its 4m ordinary shares. The balance of the latter are held by Mr Nicholas Berry, who chaired the final stages of the takeover defence, the National Coal Board, Prudential Assurance, the Water Authorities' Pension Fund and 2,000 small shareholders.</p>

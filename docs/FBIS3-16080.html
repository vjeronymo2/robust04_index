Ilyukhin explained this view in a letter to Secretary Oleg  Lobov of the National Security Council.    According to Ilyukhin, the decision to transform the Federal  Counterintelligence Service from a government body into an  agency under the direct supervision of President Yeltsin,  contradicts the state Constitution. It takes the service, as  well as the president's personal protection troops, out of the  prosecutor's reach and makes it uncontrollable from the point of  view of court and other authorities; and this, says Ilyukhin,  may do great damage to the nation, as it already did in the 30s.    On the other hand, the division of what used to be the  service's closely-knit system of regional administrations and  the move to curtail the administrations' legal rights will  reduce the service's effectiveness and hinder efforts to protect  the Russian interests now that special services of other  countries have stepped up action both along the whole length of  the Russian borders and inside this country, believes Ilyukhin.    Ilyukhin opposes the decision to deprive the service of the  right to conduct legal inquiries and have investigation cells.  That decision is sure to make the service helpless and  incapable of exposing spies and turncoats, he believes.    Ilyukhin says that until very recently the security services  and the Ministry of Internal Affairs had been balancing or  counterweighing each other's efforts.    Now, says the chairman of the Duma's Security Committee,  moves have been made to upset that balance. The excessive  authority buildup on the part of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs as well as the repeated moves to increase the numerical  strength of the internal troops and riot police units with the  adoption, by these, of weapons under army tables of  organization, creates dangerous preconditions for the emergence  of a powerful monster capable of defying the mechanisms of  government control and carrying out any kind of anti-  constitutional action. Unfortunately, something of the kind  already happened in Russia.    Ilyukhin hopes the Secretary of the National Security  Council  understands the problem and will take, together with the  parliamentary committee, appropriate concrete actions.</p>

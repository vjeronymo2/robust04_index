			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: A passion for trains that could derail BR policy - Philip Stephens profiles Tory backbencher Robert Adley ONE CABINET minister describes him as 'quite simply barmy'. A colleague on the Tory backbenches says the problem is that he never outgrew a boyhood passion for train sets. But amid growing concern on the Tory backbenches about privatisation of British Rail, those less-than-flattering judgments of Mr Robert Adley, the MP for Christchurch, may disguise a more awkward truth for the government. Mr Adley, a self-confessed railway fanatic turned Tory chairman of the influential Commons backbench transport committee, has emerged as one of the sharpest - and most dangerous - critics of thegovernment's BR strategy. Last week his all-party committee produced a damning, if carefully coded, assessment of the Department of Transport's plans to sell off BR's freight business and to inject private sector competition into passenger services. A still-sharper attack is promised during the lengthy Commons debate on the privatisation bill published by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. If things go to plan Mr Adley will wage a guerrilla war against Mr MacGregor as the bill winds its way through parliament during the next six months. It is possible, just possible, that he will recruit another dozen or so Conservative colleagues to his cause. If he does, the government will be forced yet again to take its proposals for privatisation back to the drawing board. It is hard to deny that Mr Adley has eclectic tastes. During 20 years in the House of Commons his political causes have ranged from passionate support for the communist Chinese in their disputes with Vietnam to ardent, and early, support for the ANC in South Africa. An author of nine books on the age of steam railways who once filled his garden with rail signalling equipment might also be said to be obsessive about the cause of the railways. But if his hostility to the government's plans for BR is founded on the assumption that rail is a superior form of travel there is more to his case than mere nostalgia. Mr Adley foresees another damaging episode in the post-war decline of rail travel. In the process the government will alienate millions of natural supporters - commuters and the users of rural BR lines - in the next general election. It was Mr Adley who coined the phrase that the government's plans would lead to 'a poll tax on wheels'. He is relaxed about being branded an eccentric: 'I take it as quite a compliment that I am being vilified. When ministers resort to personal attacks it is a sure sign they are skating on thin ice.' He is similarly dismissive about Mr MacGregor's claim that the government's proposals have the overwhelming support of the Tory benches: 'When ministers insist they have 100 per cent support it is usually because they haven't' Mr Adley insists that he is not against competition - or privatisation. He suggests that the government should scrap the 1947 act on which BR's monopoly is based and establish a Rail Ombudsman to oversee fair competition between BR and private-sector companies: 'What I want is a better railway'. But the starting point should be a fundamental re-assessment of all forms of transport and include a realistic judgment of the true costs of roads. Rail subsidies are deemed bad but the economic, social and environmental costs of the roads are ignored: 'The real problem is that we do not have a transport policy in this country.' Mr Adley is adamant that Mr MacGregor's plans for BR - selling off the freight division, creating a new track authority and offering operating franchises on individual lines - will not work. Thus far the government has been unimpressed. But there is a niggling suspicion at Westminster that Mr Adley may yet turn out to be one of those mavericks with more than a fair share of common sense.</p>

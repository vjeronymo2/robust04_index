			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pacific Dunlop maintains payout on steady earnings PACIFIC Dunlop, the diversified Australian industrial company, has struggled through the recession almost unscathed, reporting operating profits little changed for the year to June. The company's profit before abnormals fell by just under 1 per cent to ADollars 217.7m (USDollars 160m) from ADollars 219.8m, on an 18 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 5.91bn from ADollars 5.02bn. The directors recommended a maintained annual dividend of 21 cents a share, but it will be paid on capital increased by a ADollars 663m rights issue during the year, lifting payout by 23 per cent to ADollars 189m. Mr John Gough, chairman, said the company had come through the worst recession in 60 years with increased competitiveness and a 'creditable result'. 'Until the last quarter, the recession continued to affect performance in most markets,' he said. 'Australia, New Zealand, the US and Europe all had depressed economies, with weak consumer and industrial demand. 'As the 1992 financial year ended, signs began appearing that the current year may be a little brighter. Each of the business groups is predicting no further deterioration in its markets, but realises that emerging from the recession is likely to be a long and uneven experience,' he added. Pacific Dunlop earned a net ADollars 22.2m from the Petersville food group, which it acquired from Adsteam in August last year. This contributed to ADollars 48m profits from the newly-formed Pacific Brands Food group. The company's biggest earning division, however, remained building and construction, with profits easing to ADollars 135m from ADollars 158m. The biggest improvement in earnings came from South Pacific tyres division, up to ADollars 30m from ADollars 24m. Pacific Dunlop also confirmed yesterday it would apply for regulatory approval to bid for New Zealand-based Wattie Foods. But it stressed it had not decided to proceed with a bid which would rival an offer from the US-based Heinz. The rights issue during the year allowed Pacific Dunlop to reduce net interest marginally to ADollars 66.9m from ADollars 67.3m. But depreciation rose to ADollars 187.9m from ADollars 141.8m, and tax took ADollars 91.9m compared with ADollars 75.1m.</p>

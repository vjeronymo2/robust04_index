			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing not to list as hazardous wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment sludges from the production of triarylmethane pigments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using aniline as a feedstock. If this wastestream were managed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by disposal in a municipal landfill (the plausible management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario used for other wastewater treatment sludges), it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste as hazardous and would be capable of posing a substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present or potential hazard to human health or the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as discussed in Section II.D, Description of Health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Risk Assessments, the Agency has determined that management in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> municipal landfill is not plausible for this wastestream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite this determination, for comparison purposes the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated the risks associated with disposal in a municipal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landfill and with diposal in an on-site boiler. If, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, the Agency determines that it is not reasonable to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel blending as the plausible management scenario, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably would determine that plausible management is disposal in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a municipal landfill for the ground-water pathway, and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal in an on-site boiler for the air pathway. Disposal in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an on-site monofill, which was established as the plausible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management scenario for other wastewater treatment sludges ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K162 and K164), is not a practical option for this wastestream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to its low volume relative to the capacity of a monofill, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so is not feasible economically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on ingestion of contaminated ground water due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> releases from a municipal landfill, EPA calculated high-end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual cancer-risk levels of 1E&hyph;4 and 8E&hyph;5 for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents benzidine and aniline, respectively. The coeluting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene are calculated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pose risks between 1E&hyph;6 and 1E&hyph;5. Therefore, the combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carcinogenic risk for multiple co-existing constituents in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream would be 2E&hyph;4, assuming disposal in a landfill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the risks associated with the current and plausible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management practice, blending with non-hazardous fuel, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insignificant for any constituent. Thus, the Agency is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not to list it as hazardous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock currently is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated at only one facility. This waste is generated from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filter press that is used as part of the wastewater pretreatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. The waste is generated at a rate of approximately 18  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metric tons per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has summarized the risk projections associated with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sludge in Table II&hyph;9. The data presented in this table represent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one sample from one facility. Unlike earlier wastestreams,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health benchmarks exist for all the contaminants detected in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream (with the exception of one coeluting compound, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is discussed later in this section). Additional compounds which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do have health benchmarks, however, have been identified in these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes, but were dropped from further consideration following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk screening. The complete list of compounds found in this and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other wastestreams is presented in the Listing Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket for this rulemaking (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Details on the risk assessment are provided in Section II.D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this preamble, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Listing Background Document for this proposed rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

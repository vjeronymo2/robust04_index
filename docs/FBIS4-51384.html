			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 6 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the  spring of this year, epidemic diseases have increased  dramatically in Yunnan Province, with measles occurring in some  remote counties and townships.    Several days ago, the Yunnan Provincial People's Government  and the Yunnan Provincial Health Department held an emergency  telephone meeting on preventing the spread of epidemic diseases.  The meeting instructed all levels of governments and health  administrative departments to take measures and strengthen  epidemic preventive work.    According to a JIANKANG BAO [Health Newspaper] report, there  have been emergency occurrences of many epidemic diseases, with  a very high death rate. The main reason is that preventive work  is not effective and there are no methods to promptly control  the spread of epidemics.    The Yunnan Provincial Government has asked governments at  all  levels to speedily ensure funding for epidemic preventive work,  to promptly collect information on epidemics, and to ensure the  supply of preventive medicine, remedial medicine, emergency  biological products, disinfectants, insecticides, and all kinds  of relief goods, so that measures can be immediately taken to  control the spread of epidemics at the first signs of an  outbreak.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Somincor forecasts first fall from profit Somincor of Portugal, which mines Europe's biggest copper deposit, expects to register a loss of about Es200m (Dollars 1.1m) in 1993, its first loss since begining operations in 1989 with a profit of Es10bn. It said, however, that even if copper and tin prices remained at present levels, a stringent cost-reduction programme should move it back into a net Es1.5bn profit in 1994. This compares with a profit of Es8.9bn in 1992. The company, 51 per cent owned by the state with the rest in the hands of RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, said that 1993 production of 1.7m tonnes of copper and tin ore and sales of 610,000 tonnes of concentrate (an intermediate material) were slightly higher than in 1992. But sales had fallen 10 per cent from their 1992 level of Es33.2bn. Its mine in southern Portugal, one of the most advanced in the world, reached its target of extracting an annual 1.6m tonnes of ore one year after start-up in 1990. Production is 90 per cent copper ore and 10 per cent tin ore. Final results for 1993 have not yet been published but a spokesman said the expected loss was mainly caused by a 17 per cent fall in copper prices and an 18 per cent drop in tin prices last year from the 1992 level. Depreciation of the Portuguese escudo against the dollar in the second half of 1993 also contributed to the loss. Exchange rate losses for 1993 are forecast at Es4.3bn. All the mine's production is exported and sold for dollars. Last year Somincor (Sociedade Mineira de Neves Corvo) paid back the first Es7.2bn tranche of an Es28bn loan made by the European Investment Bank in 1988. The company has also contracted Es5bn in short-term loans from the domestic market. Financial costs are estimated at Es3bn a year. Following the end of a tax holiday, Somincor will pay corporate tax at 40 per cent for the first time in 1994.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT GOLD MINES INDEX  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Weekly values**           Jan.         % chg                            26        on week  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Index                 2,198.8           -5.1 Regional indices  Africa               2,875.1           -5.4  Australasia          2,857.8           -4.2  North America        1,903.8           -5.3 Gold PM Fix    Dollars 382.00*          -2.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- **Partial: Australasia market, closed Jan 26 *Per troy ounce.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Lingling (3769 3781 3781) and Wang Hua (3769 5478): </F> "Progress Made in Reforming and Developing the Rural Financial  System; Rural Residents' Savings Exceed 600 Billion Yuan"]    [Text] The reform and development of the rural financial  system took another step forward in 1993. Up to the end of last  year, the savings of the Agricultural Bank of China and credit  cooperatives had already reached 827.9 billion yuan, 157.2  billion yuan more than at the beginning of the year. The  balance of various loans was 968 billion yuan, 176 billion yuan  more than at the beginning of the year.    Last year, the Agricultural Bank of China at all levels,  proceeding from the overall situation, exercised strict control  over the total volume of credit, comprehensively implemented  relevant rules, and collected 5.8 billion yuan of funds lent in  violation of the rules. Under circumstances in which savings  slid and banks had difficulties with funds, the Agricultural  Bank of China and credit cooperatives at all levels always put  the organization of funds in the most important position and  rural savings reached 610.2 billion yuan by the end of the year,  126.3 billion yuan more than at the beginning of the year. This  has laid a firm foundation in terms of funds for providing  support to agriculture in the future. The Agricultural Bank of  China, taking ensuring payment as the prerequisite, gave  priority to meeting the need for funds for agricultural  development and to the purchase of agricultural and sideline  products and focused its support on developing "high output,  high efficiency, and high quality" agriculture, invigorating  agriculture with science and technology, and helping the poor  and providing relief to victims of natural disasters. In 1993,  the Agricultural Bank of China and the credit cooperatives  granted agricultural loans totaling 232.9 billion yuan, 30  billion yuan more than the previous year. To give support to  the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and to ensure  purchasing enterprises would not give IOU's to peasants, in 1993  the bank and the credit cooperatives granted loans for the  purchase of agricultural and sideline products totaling 243  billion yuan, 1.3 billion yuan more than the previous year, thus  ensuring the smooth progress of the purchase of agricultural and  sideline products throughout the year.</p>

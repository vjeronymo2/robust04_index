			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> KORENSTEIN BLAMED FOR ALIENATION;  </P> <P> CHALLENGER SAYS PARENTS DISENCHANTED WITH SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Board of Education candidate Jerry Horowitz charged Wednesday that  incumbent Julie Korenstein has alienated parents and caused them to lose faith  in their local schools.  </P> <P> Korenstein "has allowed the situation in the West Valley schools to  disintegrate to the point where parents are not only disenchanted with our  schools but actively seek means to have their children educated elsewhere,"  Horowitz said during a news conference at Sepulveda Junior High School.  </P> <P> Six parents who support Horowitz attended the news conference to talk about  their dissatisfaction with Korenstein and their complaints about bad teachers,  school violence and overcrowding.  </P> <P> Horowitz and Korenstein face a runoff Tuesday made necessary April 11 when  Korenstein fell 57 votes short of the margin she needed to win reelection to  the West San Fernando Valley seat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Principal Angry  </P> <P> Wednesday's news conference was one of five that Horowitz has scheduled for the  last week of the campaign. His choice of a location angered Sepulveda Principal  Wilbert Whitaker.  </P> <P> "This is not a violent school," said Whitaker, who was not told in advance  about the event. He said scheduling the event at Sepulveda implied that it was  plagued by the problems that Horowitz cited. Asked about the choice of  Sepulveda, Horowitz said it was chosen because it was near several freeways.  </P> <P> Asked about Horowitz's statement that she had been inaccessible and had  alienated parents, Korenstein responded angrily: "I have been probably the most  accessible board member this district has ever seen." She said her telephone  number is listed, and she meets frequently with parents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JROTC Program  </P> <P> Among those parents who turned out to support Horowitz was Bobbie Hamilton, who  said she has three children at three district schools. Hamilton said she turned  against Korenstein because Korenstein opposed establishing a JROTC training  program last year at Granada Hills High School, where Hamilton's son Cameron is  a sophomore.  </P> <P> Korenstein's opposition came despite support for the idea from parents,  students and the school principal, Hamilton said, claiming that Korenstein "was  the one person who didn't want it."  </P> <P> Pat Zeke, another parent at the news conference, said she supports Horowitz  because Korenstein had acknowledged her own ineffectiveness at a community  meeting. "She said to get anything done, you need four votes . . . so there  wasn't much she could do," Zeke said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NFLPA DOESN'T DESERVE THE UNION LABEL  </P> <P> Now the National Football League Players Association has reversed its field,  running off in a different direction and deliberately throwing itself for an  embarrassing loss. This is what happens when you play at the high-stakes game  of labor relations.  </P> <P> The leaders, executive director Gene Upshaw and aide Doug Allen, insist they  are not involved in a union per se, which is what a certain sportswriter has  been trying to tell them ad infinitum for well over two decades.  </P> <P> They never had a union concept because they didn't have a wage scale  commensurate with on-the-job experience nor did they respect the picket lines  of bona fide unions in other lines of work when they were on strike. The  players wanted the best of all worlds.  </P> <P> In a shift to a new formation, Upshaw and Allen are asking they not be referred  to as a union but as an association. It sounds as a play of semantics, but the  idea is to trap the NFL into another court case.  </P> <P> Yes, more litigation. The players give the impression they don't know what  they're doing, after taking a beating in the courts, and are grasping for any  option that not only will save face but also save a more substantial part of  their association anatomy.  </P> <P> Tom Gatewood, a former Notre Dame All-American and an erstwhile No. 1 draft  choice of the New York Giants, is interested in starting a rival organization.  You have to wonder what such former officials of the players association as Tom  Condon and Ed Garvey are thinking when they view the scuttling of the structure  they worked so hard to build.  </P> <P> It's said that those still paying dues constitute only 20 percent of the  membership. If the decertification is formalized, then the move threatens such  existing benefits as medical insurance, severance pay and income from the sale  of football-related merchandise.  </P> <P> After a meeting last week in Dallas, Upshaw said, "We are no longer the  bargaining agent of these players. If (management wants) it settled, they can  now settle it in court. Right now, this is the only way to settle it."  </P> <P> This means the players are back to where they were before the association  started -- every individual operating on his own. It may lead to a player  contesting the legality of the college draft and other functions of the NFL.  </P> <P> If this happens, then expansion talk will be silenced again. Without a  collective bargaining agreement it seems doubtful if progress toward expansion  can be made. Meanwhile, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, off to an impressive  start, is carrying his own message to the players.  </P> <P> He has met with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Philadelphia  Eagles and New York Giants. Tagliabue has appeared before them, as something of  a lone ranger, without other lawyers or league assistants. The idea is to  answer their questions and endeavor to create a feeling of trust and  cooperation.  </P> <P> One player, center Randy Grimes of the Buccaneers, is so concerned he sent a  letter addressed "to all NFL players." He went on to say, "No matter who is  right or wrong, we, the players, have been hurt the most."  </P> <P> Grimes claims the owners offered an improved package in the negotiations and he  reads this as the chance to get on with a desired bargaining agreement. "It's  time for us, the players, to take charge of the game we play," he said.  </P> <P> This kind of an expression does not increase confidence in the players  association. Right now, those atop the NFLPA have slashed their own wrists  (breaking what they erroneously called a union) and contemplate throwing  themselves on the mercy of the courts.  </P> <P> It has evolved into something of a labor-management chess game that serves no  purpose because the reality of the situation portends there will always be some  kind of an association, even if they suddenly have turned against the union  label.  </P></p>

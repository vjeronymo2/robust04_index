"The Vatican is alway raising the issue of humanitarian  intervention," the pope said in a written statement during his  weekly audience. "That doesn't necessarily mean military  intervention, but rather undertaking any action aimed at  `disarming' the aggressor."    He did not elaborate on which party he meant by `aggressor'  and what sort of action should be taken to stop the war in  Bosnia.    "According to the moral teachings of the Church, any  military  aggression is considered morally wrong," he said. "But  legitimate defense is, on the contrary, considered acceptable  and even a duty at times."    Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said that the pontiff  believes that the international community is currently in a  position to apply self defense in dealing with the Balkan war  but that all other peaceful possibilities must be exhausted  before resorting to military force.    He stressed that the pope's written opinion on the matter  was  drafted prior to the two-day NATO summit held in Brussels  earlier this week.    Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said at  the  end of the summit Tuesday that they were ready to use air power  in support of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina but appeared in  agreement on applying such power only in two small Moslem  enclaves where Serb forces have obstructed the United Nations.    In his statement Wednesday, the pope also condemned the  warring parties in the Bosnian conflict, saying that they were  openly violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.    "These rights are being violated in a frightening and tragic  manner and those responsible have resorted to justifying their  actions by saying they are obeying orders and certain  ideologies," the pope said.    On Tuesday the Vatican also condemned the international  community's inaction in Bosnia, saying it was acting in a  criminally negligent manner.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Film success lifts PolyGram The low-budget movie Four Weddings and a Funeral helped PolyGram, the London-based music and film group, lift half-year net income 14.7 per cent to Fl 234m. (Pounds 85.5m). PolyGram, which is 75 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, said that while music markets worldwide were healthy, its performance had been held back by a paucity of new hits. Mr Alain Levy, president, said the group would now begin making bigger budget films and look for other companies to help share the costs. Four Weddings and a Funeral, which topped the film charts in the US, the UK and France, has so far grossed Dollars 125m (Pounds 81m). Mr Levy expected final takings to be Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m. Only 35 per cent of the final profits from the film were included in the first-half results. Mr Levy said the first half had been PolyGram's most active period so far in the film business, with seven new releases. Several of these had been unsuccessful, however, including Backbeat, the story of the fifth Beatle. He said revenues from films and non-music videos rose 56 per cent and now represented 10.9 per cent of group sales. While PolyGram's music sales had been hampered by a lack of new hits, prospects for the second half were good, with albums expected from Stevie Wonder, Boyz II Men, Amy Grant and Vanessa Williams. Mr Levy said the classical music market had improved. Luciano Pavarotti's My Heart's Delight had sold 400,000 copies. The singer extended his exclusive worldwide contract with PolyGram into the next century. PolyGram had failed to acquire rights to this year's football World Cup concert featuring Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras. These had gone to Warner. The three tenors' recording of their World Cup concert in 1990 had been a best-seller for PolyGram. Group net sales rose 14.1 per cent to Fl 3.6bn. Income from operations rose 6.6 per cent to Fl 340m. Earnings per share rose 8.3 per cent to Fl 1.30. Mr Levy said the smaller increase in earnings was the result of last year's issue of 10m new shares. Lex, Page 16</p>

The "Washington Post" newspaper quoted a senior U.S.  official  as saying that the administration was obliged to act firmly  after the failure Friday by President Bill Clinton and Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to reach agreement on reducing  Japan's 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States.    By taking the actions, U.S. officials said, the United  States  wants to maintain its negotiating credibility, but no decision  has been made on which products to target.    At the same time, the U.S. administration is seeking to  persuade the Japanese Government that the trade actions should  not cause a rupture of the entire relationship.    Hosokawa cautioned the United States Saturday against  imposing trade sanctions on Japan.    "I very much hope the U.S. will refrain from such actions,"  Hosokawa told reporters before leaving Washington for home.    His top aides warned that such action would cause Japan to  retaliate with sanctions on American products.</p>

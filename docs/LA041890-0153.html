BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CAB FIRM LIABLE IN MAN'S DEATH  </P> <P> A jury has decided that a cab company and driver should pay $1.36 million to  the family of a man who died after being abandoned in snow five years ago.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court jury's verdict was returned Tuesday after a two-week  trial of a wrongful death lawsuit brought by relatives of George Beatty against  FME Auto Leasing and driver Michael Dsingelis.  </P> <P> Beatty, a 72-year-old retired bank executive, died 150 yards from his  Huntington house on Feb. 3, 1985.

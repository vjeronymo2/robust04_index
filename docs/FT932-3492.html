			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Letter: Predictions on share prices, please Sir, The improvement to the FT weather service is greatly welcomed. Particularly useful are the forecast temperatures for the day of publication in the leading centres of the world. Your previous service giving temperatures at noon on the previous day was, after all, of interest to just a few time travellers. Perhaps the time is now right to extend this logic to your excellent London Share Service. The previous day's figures are, after all, an esoteric interest. The value of your newspaper would be immeasurably increased, for the general reader, by the inclusion of forecast share prices at noon on the day publication. No doubt, the actuaries you use for your share indices could easily cope with such a short-term forecast. Gordon Mitchell, 146 Manor Green Road, Epsom, Surrey KT19 8LL</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / MPs seek bigger role in Budget PLANS TO give MPs an opportunity to vote on different combinations of tax, spending and borrowing from those put forward by the government in the Budget were recommended yesterday by the Commons procedure committee. If MPs accept the committee's report Tory rebels and opposition parties would be allowed greater scope to put forward their schemes. The committee said that backbenchers should be able to propose amendments on which votes could be held, suggesting tax or spending changes. They should also be able to approve borrowing plans as part of the Budget motion. To keep in line with Commons practice, amendments would be phrased as expressions of opinion. Although these would not bind the government, ministers would have to take them seriously. Under the present arrangements, a range of issues can be raised in the Budget debate but there is no mechanism for putting many of them to the vote. Sir Peter Emery, the Tory chairman of the committee, said the report should be discussed by MPs before the Budget on November 30.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> MORE BARS:  </P> <P> Cannons, 34344 Street of the Green Lantern, Dana Point.  </P> <P> Open Monday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays  till 11 p.m., Sundays from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. (714) 496-6146. Perched on  sandstone bluffs high above Dana Point Harbor and Capistrano Bay, Cannons  restaurant is known for its spectacular view. In the bar -- choose either the  tiled, outside patio or an inside lounge with lots of windows -- drinks are a  bit pricey, but on a clear day a visit here is more like a field trip than a  pub crawl.

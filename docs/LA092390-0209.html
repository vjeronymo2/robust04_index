			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR SIGNS OFFSHORE SPILL CLEANUP PLAN  </P> <P> Saying "an ounce of prevention would certainly be worth a barrel of spilled  crude oil," Gov. George Deukmejian on Saturday signed into law the most  comprehensive offshore oil spill prevention and cleanup plan in the nation.  </P> <P> In his regular weekly radio address, the governor said the new law "will give  California an unprecedented ability to prevent spills before they happen and to  fight the effects of spills if they do occur."  </P> <P> The statute, which takes effect immediately, is a direct result of the Exxon  Valdez oil spill in Alaska last year and the British Petroleum tanker spill off  Huntington Beach in February.  </P> <P> Generally viewed as one of the major achievements of the recently concluded  legislative session, it would create a $100-million oil spill cleanup fund to  be financed by placing an additional tax of 25 cents on each barrel of oil,  which is expected to add less than a cent per gallon of gasoline sold at the  pump.  </P> <P> In the event of a spill, the state also would be given unlimited authority to  borrow additional funds for cleanup operations that would be repaid by the oil  companies.  </P> <P> The governor is given the power to appoint a state oil spill "czar" or response  administrator who will be charged with setting up a detailed comprehensive plan  for the safe transportation of oil along California's coastline.  </P> <P> These steps are expected to include surprise inspections of tankers and  terminals, up-to-date safety plans for refineries, use of radar for tanker  traffic, and requiring tugboat escorts in hazardous waters.  </P> <P> Oil companies transporting their product through state waters also must be able  to demonstrate that they have $500 million worth of oil spill liability  insurance protection.  </P> <P> For the first 60 days after a spill, cleanup crews will be immune from lawsuits  for property damage they may cause. Oil industry representatives contend that  immunity from liability for professional cleanup crews is necessary because  they must act quickly to prevent the spill from spreading and should not be  inhibited by fears that they might get sued.  </P> <P> The new law is a compromise worked out during nine months of intensive  high-stakes negotiations involving a multitude of interested parties.  </P> <P> They included the Administration, Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) and Assemblyman  Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), sponsors of two rival oil spill prevention and  cleanup measures, the oil companies, trial lawyers and environmental groups.  </P> <P> Deukmejian threatened to veto the Keene bill sent to his desk unless the oil  spill fund was capped at $50 million and the "czar" appointment was not subject  to Senate confirmation.  </P> <P> The lawmakers, who demanded that the fund total $150 million, kept the  confirmation requirement in the final version of the bill. It passed the Senate  by a 30-1 vote and the Assembly by a 70-1 vote.  </P> <P> In his radio speech, Deukmejian said: "As everyone knows, the price of an oil  spill is measured not only in miles of polluted beaches, but also in the tax  dollars that must be expended to clean up the mess.  </P> <P> "I have always said that in any oil spill plan, the oil industry must be  financially accountable for the costs that result from these spills.  </P> <P> "New civil and criminal penalties will be put on the books, and responsible  parties will be made absolutely liable for damages caused by their spills."  </P> <P> He also emphasized the value of oil spill prevention work that will be  stimulated by the new law.  </P> <P> "Cleanup efforts, no matter how well carried out," he said, "pale in  effectiveness compared to solid prevention activities.  </P> <P> "In the case of oil spills, an ounce of prevention would certainly be worth a  barrel of spilled crude oil."  </P> <P> In addition, the governor underlined that California will remain heavily  dependent on oil shipped to the state in tankers to help fuel the expanding  economy.  </P> <P> But the new oil spill prevention and cleanup law "will allow us to maintain  that important balance between economic growth and environmental balance . . .  to ensure that our quality of life will remain the envy of the world,"  Deukmejian said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> O.C. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA PUTS ON PLAYFUL, IMPECCABLE PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> The Orange County Chamber Orchestra demonstrated an ongoing commitment to  enriching audience experience Sunday afternoon by programming one new work and  one infrequently offered. And though the concert -- played in a chilly St.  Joseph Center in Orange -- may not have been entirely familiar, it was not at  all inaccessible.  </P> <P> As featured soloist, oboist Allan Vogel offered enticing entrance into Robert  Cummings' Concerto for Oboe. The tonal work, receiving its first performance  locally, is a celebration of melodic invention cloaked in traditional forms.  Vogel brought an inviting tone, impeccable intonation and a masterly command of  phrasing to its service.  </P> <P> Intelligence and energy permeated Vogel's approach. While in the foreground, he  assumed sure control, speaking his line with sensitive attention to detail. But  he also fit his part into the overall fabric of the piece with rapt attention  to his orchestral partners.  </P> <P> The chamber orchestra accompanied skillfully. Under the personable command of  conductor Micah Levy, the ensemble rose to the playful challenge uttered by  Vogel's unaccompanied opening notes, maintained vitality through an  overabundant use of tremolo, and engaged in vigorous dialogue with the soloist.  Throughout this, and through the entire program, Levy could rely on the  expertise of solid chamber players to weave transparent textures.  </P> <P> Orchestral members attended to clarity and detail with similar earnestness  during the two 18th-Century works that flanked the concerto. In the less  complicated Overture to William Boyce's "See, White Robed Peace," sectionally  executed ornaments, in particular, attested to remarkable control. Thus  nurtured, this early classical, English court music emerged graceful and  intellectually untaxing.  </P> <P> Haydn's Symphony No. 82, nicknamed "The Bear" for its whimsical fourth-movement  dance over a drone bass, stood alone on the second half of the program. Here,  too, players etched lines with sharp distinction, achieving momentum through  energetic use of accents. The results were playful, polished and compelling.  </P></p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / George shied away from July rate rise Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, nearly recommended a base rate rise in late July, according to the minutes of his monetary meeting that month with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, which were released yesterday. The minutes relate to the meeting of July 28 when Mr George and Mr Clarke decided to leave base rates unchanged. Base rates were increased from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent after their next meeting on September 7. In July, after reviewing a number of inflationary indicators such as Confederation of British Industry surveys and input prices, Mr George said: 'It was possible to make a case that, to be on the safe side, there should be a modest move to tighten policy now.' He added, however, that 'there was not much danger of either the economy or the emerging cost pressures running away at present'. He also said there was 'a danger that a small move now would confuse rather than reassure, and provoke an exaggeratedly nervous market reaction'. The governor argued that 'the earlier a move was made the smaller the adjustment would need to be. But in the current circumstances, it was preferable for any move upwards to be to a level which would be a plausible stopping point for a reasonable period.' Some analysts yesterday interpreted this statement as indicating there would not be a further increase in base rates for some time. But Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel, said it was not inconsistent with a further rise this year. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, cautioned against putting too much reliance on the governor's statement since the view of the authorities had obviously been affected by data published after the July meeting. The minutes also show that, as late as the end of July, the chancellor was fairly sceptical about the need for a rise in base rates. Mr Clarke said it was important that 'any change in policy should be based on a balanced assessment of all the evidence. There was a danger of trying to set a game plan too far in advance and not looking at the actual evidence as it unfolded. 'The latest data - particularly M4 and earnings - suggested a rise was not required immediately,' he continued. 'Furthermore, the forecasts suggested inflation might be even lower in the next few months.' Nevertheless, Mr Clarke said: 'It remained true that, sooner or later, interest rates might need to be raised.' The minutes also indicate that the pace of economic growth may have been the main reason why base rates were raised this month. In general discussion, it was argued that 'as well as the absolute size of the output gap (the difference between actual and potential output), it was possible that the speed at which the output gap closed was an important determinant of inflationary pressures'.</p>

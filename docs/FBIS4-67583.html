			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Acting Crimean Interior Minister V. Kuznetsov, </F> Crimean Ecological Center Chairman V. Rysich, and V. Tarasenko,  chairman of the "Ecology and Peace" association: "Crimean  `Russian Island?'"]    [Excerpts] The "Ecology and Peace" association in the  Crimea has repeatedly expressed its justified concerns over the  environmental situation in areas of our peninsula occupied by  military units and facilities. It is also alarming that there  is no environmental control on these areas. Whereas Crimea's  civil ecological service has an efficient scientific and  practical potential (even though certain shortcomings still  exist), the corresponding service carried out by the military  in, for example, the Odessa Military District, is performed  by...two specialists, as we have already reported.    The "Ecology and Peace" association has expressed its  concern  in a letter to the Ukrainian defense minister. In response, the  military department concurred with the Crimean specialists'  assessment of the situation at military bases, has expressed its  full understanding, and concluded that there is no money for  action.    We are not, however, facing a case that if someone does not  want to do something he cannot be forced to do so.    We must act! This is why the three seemingly different  specialists have united under the one "roof" of this article, to  tell readers the truth about the environmental situation in  military towns. [passage omitted on nuclear tests conducted by  the USSR in the 1950's]    Do not think, however, that all the misery is far away from  the Crimea. Similar events are taking place at the Bagerovsk  military range (it is now a radioactive dumping ground).    At a briefing in the Crimean Supreme Council, the range's  deputy commander announced that personnel protecting the  radioactive dump site are slightly inert and sleepy, and that  something resembling lichen has appeared on the servicemen's  skin.    The statement was made on 14 May 1993. Even though our  specialists requested that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry  examine the facility, nobody has so far bothered to do so. The  response is always the same--there is no money. Regretfully,  this response has not been presented to the mothers whose  children are serving at the Bagerovsk range. We would not envy  those who would have to do that! As a matter of fact, this is  just another version of the Russian island in the Pacific Ocean  [site of nuclear tests]. In that case, however, more than 50  admirals and officers were brought to account.    One official document of the former General Headquarters  dated 1988--a protocol on military facilities' harmful impact on  the Crimean environment--listed many garrisons, facilities, and  units in which other environmental "dangers" had been  discovered. The document included advice and recommendations as  well.    Absolutely nothing has changed since then. Our recent survey  has revealed that no environmental certificates are held in  military towns, oil warehouses do not have appropriate  capacities to store oil sediment, sewage systems do not work in  most military units, etc.    Another extraordinary accident has recently occurred--the  spilling of oil products in Sevastopol Bay. On the same day as  we had a conversation at the State Committee for Environment  Protection, reports of a new spill came in. In one of the  military units deployed in the city of Saki, according to  witnesses, 240 tonnes of oil products seeped into a resort lake.  Meanwhile, there is a document in force, signed by all the  "power" ministers, which obligates all civilian and military  leaders to exchange information on emergency environmental  situations. Apparently, however, nobody has been demanding its  implementation.    The authors of the article not only approve and support the  president's program for gradual demilitarization of the Crimea,  they can also provide a specific program for implementing it.  Resources released in this process could be used in resolving  social needs and environmental problems. The program for  gradual demilitarization will contradict neither Ukraine's laws  nor its Defense Ministry's military doctrine.</p>

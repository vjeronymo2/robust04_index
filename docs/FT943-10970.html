			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Fickleness and frenzy in the Shanghai market: A look at the surge in Chinese shares China's infant stock markets surged more than 30 per cent yesterday after Beijing announced a rescue package aimed at arresting a slide in share values. Shanghai's A-share index for local investors leapt 36 per cent to 447.68 points, reversing the sharp declines of recent months. The Shanghai index had lost 80 per cent since highs of early 1993. The leap followed measures announced last Friday by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) that it was suspending new share listings this year. The CSRC, which has been under pressure from disgruntled investors, also said it would permit Sino-foreign joint venture security houses to trade in A-shares, previously reserved for Chinese. This concession points the way to an eventual merging of the A and B-share markets once the yuan becomes a full convertible currency. Chinese officials are vague about the timing of such a move, saying merely they expect it will happen 'within five years'. China's stock markets have proved themselves among the world's most volatile, but analysts were not prepared for yesterday's bounce. However, they believe the rally in A-shares will be short-lived. Mr John Crossman, of Jardine Fleming in Shanghai, said: 'I don't think it will hold very well because the fundamentals are simply not there.' In Beijing, China's hard-pressed stock regulators are finding it difficult to believe that a simple package of announcements could have galvanised the market quite so dramatically. Mr Gao Xiqing, general counsel to the CSRC, was a 'little surprised' at the magnitude of the surge, but he also noted that China was making progress in its efforts to build confidence in the markets. In contrast to the surge in the A-share market yesterday, B-shares registered modest gains. The Shanghai index was up just 1.31 points or 1.83 per cent. Shanghai securities analysts say that after being in the doldrums for much of the year, B-shares had begun to attract support among 'bargain hunters'. They saw no reason why B-shares should not continue to strengthen. Price/earnings ratios had come down to multiples in the low teens from the high teens early in the year. Some quality companies' price/earnings ratios were below 10 which had rekindled investor interest. Mr Crossman also noted that H-shares - mainland companies listed in Hong Kong - had been strongly traded in the past few weeks. 'Local players have been punching up H-shares. Now you're getting a wash of enthusiasm for China-related plays.' Mr Crossman expected B-shares, which were down this year by some 40 per cent at their low point - the index has appreciated by about 10 per cent since June - to continue to strengthen. 'We're looking for a good sustainable rally from October through the early part of next year,' he said. Among factors that are helping to feed an improvement in investor confidence are signs that China's economic austerity measures are beginning to bear fruit with unsustainable rates of growth coming down and inflation showing signs of abating. Investors may be betting on the government easing credit restrictions in the latter part of the year and there are already indications that the central bank is loosening the purse strings to assist faltering state enterprises. Chinese securities regulators argue that lack of institutional investors - most investors are individuals - is one of the main causes of market volatility, but analysts cite other causes such as the relatively small percentage of shares in a particular company on offer in the market. Under the Chinese system less than a third of a company's shares are traded and these are held mainly by individuals. Other shares are vested in the state or are held by 'legal persons' such as institutions, corporations and quasi-government bodies. This structure is aimed at preserving state control, but analysts argue that if the authorities allowed 'legal person' shares to be traded freely this would 'make for a healthier market'. A 36 per cent rise in one day indicates inherent instability. China's stock markets are destined for a continuing rollercoaster ride as investors' febrile sentiment ebbs and flows. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] During today's news conference at Cotroceni Palace,  Presidential Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu made several  remarks on the open letter addressed to President Ion Iliescu by  the Liberal Party '93 [PL'93] containing allegations against  cabinet ministers. He pointed out that, in the absence of a law  on ministerial responsibility, one cannot talk of legal  proceedings unless proof can be supplied that a legally  envisaged crime has been committed. Chebeleu said that the delay  in submitting a law on the budget, due to objective conditions,  cannot be considered a crime; therefore, one can only talk of  political responsibility, at best. However, it is up to the  Parliament to examine these aspects.    The presidential spokesman also denied rumors according to  which the relations between President Ion Iliescu and Chamber of  Deputies Speaker Adrian Nastase have become cooler. He said  that the current slander campaign against Nastase is politically  motivated and aimed at weakening the government party.    In answer to another question, Chebeleu reiterated the hope  that, after the elections in Hungary, the new government will  adopt a realistic approach toward bilateral relations, thus  removing the artificial tensions that have emerged in recent  years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Political Department Chief Faruq </F> Qaddumi, identified by his nom de guerre Abu-al-Lutf, by radio  correspondent Salah Salamah, place and date not given; from the  "Panorama" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Salamah] Brother Abu-al-Lutf, Faruq Qaddumi, head  of the PLO Political Department: The situation in the occupied  territory is still exacerbating. Anger still prevails there  after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The Security Council has  not yet adopted a resolution condemning the massacre or meeting  the minimum level of Palestinian demands. U.S. President Bill  Clinton received Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, but the  meeting produced nothing that meets Palestinian demands. What  are your expectations following the Clinton-Rabin meeting?    [Qaddumi] After studying and scrutinizing the situation, and  following the talks between Yitzhaq Rabin and U.S. President  Clinton, it is clear that Israel does not intend to take  measures that will provide the necessary protection for our  people. Therefore, we expect psychological tension to increase  and fabricated local differences to escalate. The Israeli enemy  will create seditions and local differences, as it did  previously when it faced such impasses. It will practice the  ugliest forms of repression and coercion. It will strike at our  national unity and social cohesion to cover up the crimes  committed by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It will  claim that Palestinians cannot run their own affairs or maintain  their national security, in order to prolong the occupation and  to (?implement) its plan in the occupied territory.    I believe the overall fabricated incidents that have taken  place in some areas in the West bank and Gaza over the past few  months show the Israeli plan to create internal conflicts is  being implemented. Therefore, we -- as individuals and groups  inside the occupied territory -- must be patient in tackling the  local events and not resort to weapons at all in tackling  political and social differences. Only the Israeli enemy  benefits from this.    [Words indistinct] the entire Palestinian leadership  categorically rejects the use of weapons against any Palestinian  citizen and stresses the need to resort to officials and wise  men to prevent any bloodshed. Prophet Muhammad prevents Muslims  from fighting each other.    Therefore, we expect the Israelis' reaction to be negative,  because they agreed with the United States not to take any  measures. This means they are moving toward dealing a blow to  the whole peace process. There will be no peace in the region.    [Salamah] Brother Abu-al-Lutf, Yitzhaq Rabin called from  Washington, and today from Rome, for a speedy resumption of  negotiations with the Palestinians. He also stressed the need  to resume negotiations with Syria and the other Arab parties to  the peace negotiations. In your view, what are the prospects  for the Middle East peace process, in light of the available  facts?    [Qaddumi] Yitzhaq Rabin has narrowed the chances for peace  in  the region. It seems that, with U.S. consent, he is going ahead  with his scheme of striking at the political settlement and  terminating the honest international efforts to boost the peace  process. He postponed withdrawal and used immense pressure to  control security at the crossings. Israel does not want peace.  It continues to devour the land and commit crimes against  Palestinian citizens. Israel has lost its so-called democratic  face. It is a racist state, just like South Africa.    [Salamah] Brother Abu-al-Lutf, after it surfaced that there  are major difficulties facing the Oslo agreement and that this  agreement will not be implemented as scheduled on 13 April, in  your view, is there a possibility that the Palestinians might  give up on the Oslo agreement and return to the formula of  collective Arab dealing with the Middle East peace process?    [Qaddumi] What is the point of going ahead with the Oslo  agreement if Israel violates most of its articles? This cannot  be called an agreement. They want the Palestinian people to  succumb. They want to prolong the occupation. Therefore, they  have torn the agreement into pieces with their heinous behavior  and their terrorist practices. I believe that after this  massacre, which has been completely condemned by the world, the  world has a major responsibility to maintain peace and security  in the region and to preserve human rights. It must be noted  that every day, Israel hammers more nails into the coffin of the  Oslo agreement. Israel proposed the agreement. Now it is  trying to bury it.    [Salamah] What is the alternative, brother Abu-al-Lutf?    [Qaddumi] The constant alternative is continued struggle,  whether or not there is an agreement. As long as an Israeli  soldier occupies Palestinian territory, it is our right to  defend ourselves. This is a sacred right approved by  international law and the UN Charter.    [Salamah] Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political  Department, thank you for this interview with Radio Monte Carlo.    [Qaddumi] Thank you, brother Salah.</p>

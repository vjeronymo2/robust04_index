			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 14 Jun -- Russian Federation Council  Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists after his meeting  today with Senate Speaker Adam Struzik: "We have common views on  almost all issues." He did not explain what "almost" meant.    He also avoided replying to questions on when Russia will  join the Partnership for Peace and why President Yeltsin decided  not to participate in festivities marking the 50th anniversary  of the Warsaw Uprising. He expressed the view that the  development of Polish-Russian economic relations depends, above  all, on creating a legislative basis naturally conducive to  direct cooperation between companies of both countries.  "Political resolve will then no longer matter," he said.    Adam Struzik said the talks focused on general issues and  also on concrete matters such as a future meeting of  parliamentarians of the Kaliningrad oblast and Polish border  regions.</p>

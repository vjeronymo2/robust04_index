			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Arts: Children behaving badly - Theatre In a seaside town live four girl friends: mid-teens, tough-talking, hardbitten. It is an occasional pastime of theirs to lure some solitary man, kick him to the ground and rob him. They are used to being taken in by the police for cautioning, and they have come to know Daniel, a fanciable policeman; one or two of them have already shagged him, and others want to. What they do not know is that he is a women's-shoe fetishist whose libido is draining steadily away into his kink. This causes misunderstandings, and eventually some gory, entirely predictable trouble. The Royal Court Theatre Upstairs,like indeed the Royal Court, has been here often before, as far back as Edward Bond's Saved: children of a demoralised working-class behaving badly. In Judy Upton's new play Ashes and Sand, which won this year's George Devine Award, slaggish young Hayley gets a speech ringingly addressed to nobody in particular - ie us - which says it's all because there are no jobs and nothing to do. That may well be so. Ms Upton, however, lacks Bond's hard, dry eloquence. The girls mostly talk punk-demotic, without frills, and the cops television-speak; but from time to time some sentence emerges which is so clankingly articulate and stilted as to fall stone dead upon the ear. Directed by Ian Rickson, the coven all work hard at being BAD, without quite silencing echoes of St. Trinian's. Superficially, Susan Lynch's vocally abrasive Hayley might seem a piece of rolling-eyed, overstated acting - but perhaps just on that account, it may be closely observed naturalism. The other girls, Rakie Ayola, Samantha Morton and Melissa Wilson, do their best with the bitty cameos they get between their feral group-assaults. Ms Upton connects very little up: the girls' peculiar savagery, Daniel's shoe-fetish, a colleague's unnatural affection for him, his dogged desire to transfer his job to Gibraltar - all float free and unexplained. The trendy Lolita-gang motif - Furies, banshees, perhaps even maenads - was pre-empted by Philip Ridley's Ghost from a Perfect Place at Hampstead last season, and taken to such campily extravagant lengths as to cripple imitators. Ashes &amp; Sand is tamer, and vaguer; at the end, I was unable to guess whether the debagged Daniel had actually been castrated by the coven, or just embarrassed by being smeared with body-paint. But Nick Reding's Daniel is the performance of the evening: chirpy, evasive and sad-eyed in public, prematurely weary alone, he suggests dumb, unhappy depths beyond anything in the text. Michael Packer is deft with several small roles, and Richard Albrecht makes something solid of Daniel's bluff, shyly devoted colleague. Jeremy Herbert's designs involve a mirror-contraption that permits quick cinematic cuts from one scene to another: ingenious, though it works better if you sit near the middle. Ashes &amp; Sand takes an hour and a half, with no interval.</p>

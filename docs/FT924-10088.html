			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fukutoku Bank begins rationalisation scheme FUKUTOKU Bank, a leading second-tier regional bank based in Osaka, western Japan, has started implementing a rationalisation plan, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'The plan aims to strengthen the financial health of the bank,' it said. 'It is not only smaller banks but also the big national banks that are hit by the financial slump.' Through the rationalisation, including a freeze in hiring professional staff, Fukutoku plans to cut operating expenditure by 10 per cent or about Y3bn (Dollars 24.6m) in 1993-94, starting April 1, from a year earlier, the bank said. Fukutoku declined to comment on a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper that the bank's restructuring aims to boost its profits so it can bail out Shimanouchi Tochi Tatemono, an affiliated non-bank financial institution based in Osaka, that is suffering from bad property-related loans. In 1991-92, Fukutoku posted Y4.68bn in pre-tax profits, down sharply from Y8.42bn a year earlier. Under the one-and-a-half-year plan ending March 31 1994, Fukutoku will cut by eight the number of its offices and freeze opening of new ones. It has cut executive pay by 10 per cent from October. Fukutoku has 142 offices in Japan, mainly in the Osaka region which, along with Tokyo, was hardest hit by the slump in the property market. It also has a branch office in New York and a representative office in Hong Kong.</p>

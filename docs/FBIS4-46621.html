Chekmarev,  military economics and finances department editor of TYL  VOORUZHENNYKH SIL VOYENNO EKONOMICHESKIY ZHURNAL, date, place  and occasion unknown, under rubric "Pertinent Interview": "A  Package of Military Laws"]    [Text] Our correspondent's questions are answered by  Colonel General V. Vorobyev, chief of Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense Main Military Budget and Finance  Directorate.    Colonel General Vasiliy Vasilyevich Vorobyev was born  on 11 May 1946 in the settlement of Gidrotorf, Balakhninskiy  Rayon, Gorkiy Oblast. He completed the Yaroslavl Military School  imeni General of the Army A. V. Khrulev in 1966 and the Military  Faculty at Moscow Finance Institute in 1974. He successively  went through various positions in the troops: chief of finance  service of a battalion, regiment, division, army and military  district (Siberian Military District, Southern Group of Forces,  Ural Military District, Far East Military District). He has been  on the central staff since June 1990 (first deputy chief, then  chief of the Main Directorate). Married, has two children.    [Chekmarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, our country is  experiencing a very difficult time. It is fully natural that the  situation which formed in the Russian Armed Forces fully  reflects the socioeconomic and political situation in society.  Therefore, evidently from the very beginning of establishment of  the Russian Army the military leadership has encountered very  difficult problems that demand solution without delay. In your  view, which of these problems are most acute?    [Vorobyev] The first and probably most important  one is the insufficient legislative base for Armed Forces vital  activities. Because of this, so-called irregular situations  often arise which make both the central staff and the troops  feverish. Many of Russia's fundamental laws entering into the  "military package" have not yet been adopted, and those which  were adopted are not "working" to full capacity, since the  mechanism for their realization has not been completely  adjusted. In particular, this concerns the Russian Federation  Laws "On Defense" and "On the Status of Servicemen."    One other very acute problem is establishment of a Russian  Army military-technical base meeting modern requirements. It is  no secret to anyone that after partition of the USSR Armed  Forces our state basically got the troops of interior districts,  i.e., the second strategic echelon, and Russia's share of the  newest arms was only 20 percent.    Moreover, battle management, communications, intelligence,  and missile and air attack warning systems and the system for  providing troops with necessities of life and combat training  were disrupted.    Closely adjoining this problem is the need for removing  troops from the territory of other states and settling-in  hundreds of thousands of officers, warrant officers and enlisted  men at new permanent station locations, difficulties in solving  problems of servicemen's social protection, and the near-crisis  situation with manning of military units and ships.    And finally, economic disorders in the country, a new system  of troop manning providing for contract service, conversion  being carried out hastily and, unfortunately, not always in a  well thought-out way, involvement of troops in regional  conflicts, and also the very rigid framework of the military  budget generate additional problems in Armed Forces  organizational development.    [Chekmarev] What has been done lately and what is  planned to be done to protect servicemen against inflationary  processes occurring in the country and to improve pay for  military labor?    [Vorobyev] The Russian Federation government  periodically indexes pay by raising base pay and allowances.  Thus, the position pay of all categories of servicemen was  raised seven times just during 1992-1993.    Under conditions of inflationary processes occurring in the  country the main emphasis beginning in 1990 has been placed on  strengthening social protection of junior and mid-level  officers, warrant officers and extended-term servicemen whose  level of base pay and allowances (pay for position and rank)  periodically was increased more significantly than the level of  base pay and allowances of general and flag officers.    Payment of a monetary reward for a class rating was  established for the first time beginning in 1990 as a financial  incentive for officers at the troop level to perfect  professional expertise. It presently is 10 percent of position  pay. Payment of a monetary reward for a rating category was  established in these same amounts for medical servicemen.    The Ministry of Defense worked purposefully to expand the  benefits of servicemen performing their duty under special  conditions and whose service involves risk to health and life  (pilots, navymen, landing personnel and so on).    Specific work also was done to improve supplementary  payments  to servicemen performing duty in remote localities and in  localities with difficult climatic conditions. For example, as  of 1 January 1993 payment of higher position pay was established  there in the amount of the regional factors applied to wages of  workers and employees in corresponding localities, if an  increase in servicemen's pay previously was not provided for  there in amounts exceeding the amounts of these factors. A  number of restrictions were removed on paying higher position  pay to servicemen performing duty in these localities.    As of 1 January 1993 significant supplementary payments and  benefits were established for those servicemen who serve on  territories of Transcaucasian and Baltic states and in the  Republic of Tajikistan, and also who perform missions under  conditions of a state of emergency and in armed conflicts (these  are payments of one and one-half or two times base pay and  allowances, a preferential offset for years served for pension  and so on).    That is when the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of  Servicemen" was placed in force, providing for a number of  benefits, guarantees and advantages in social protection for  servicemen, citizens discharged from military service and their  families. In general, this law deserves to be the topic of a  separate conversation. Let us focus attention on the important  thing.    Benefits and guarantees established for servicemen are in  the  nature of compensation. They have the purpose of compensating  for restrictions on certain general civilian rights and freedoms  dictated by features of military service, and unquestionably  have the purpose of socially protecting servicemen and elevating  the prestige of military service.    Guarantees of pay for military labor are legislatively  incorporated for the first time in this important document.  Thus, Article 12 of the Law points out that pay for initial  military positions of privates and seamen performing contract  military service cannot be less than five minimum amounts of  pay, and pay for rank cannot be less than half of military  position pay. Consequently, the Law now guarantees payment of  base pay and allowances to servicemen performing contract  service in the initial position in an amount of at least 7.5  times the minimum amount of pay for labor. In addition, the  amount of servicemen's station allowance was doubled, including  for family members, on official reassignments.    The Law also did not ignore servicemen being discharged on  reaching the maximum age for active military service and also  being discharged for sickness and in connection with table of  organization measures. As of 1 January 1993 the one-time  allowance on being discharged for those reasons was set in the  amount of from 5 to 20 times base pay and allowances (depending  on overall duration of military service) instead of that  previously paid in the amount of five times base pay and  allowances.    Active work has been going on in recent years to unify the  system of base pay and allowances for warrant officers,  extended-term servicemen and officers in order to establish a  uniform system for paying for the labor of servicemen performing  contract service. For example, payment of a percentage increment  for years served was introduced for extended-term servicemen and  warrant officers in the very same amounts as for officers, and  increments for special conditions of service, an increment for  continuous service in remote localities, and others were  established in identical amounts with officers.    The Ministry of Defense will continue systematic work to  strengthen social protection of servicemen and their families  and to improve the system of base pay and allowances, especially  with respect to servicemen serving under contract.    [Chekmarev] Many critical letters about late payment of  base pay and allowances and wages to Army and Navy personnel  come to the editors, and probably also to the Main Directorate  you head. And many are inclined to place the blame for this on  military finance officers. I would like to learn your opinion on  this problem.    [Vorobyev] There is no denying that an enormous  load and responsibility will fall on the Armed Forces Finance  Service in the situation at hand. On the one hand, a periodic  or, more correctly, systematic increase in base pay and  allowances, wages and pensions demands considerable labor inputs  for recomputation. But on the other hand, the constant shortage  of Russian Federation Ministry of Defense financing and its  unsystematic accomplishment in terms of volumes and time,  beginning with the Ministry of Finance and ending with the  military unit level, create a nervous atmosphere in Army  collectives and give rise to unfavorable criticism of Finance  Service work.    And how many troubles are brought to us by the instability  and contradictoriness of hastily adopted laws, which as a rule  are not backed up economically! Whoever you like can argue about  a poor rule of law, but just not finance workers. They must make  decisions and assume responsibility for the blunders of others.  I must declare with all responsibility that the heads of the  Ministry of Defense and Main Military Budget and Finance  Directorate are taking all necessary steps to stabilize the  situation of financial support of the Army and Navy. But the  state's economic situation is such that numerous efforts for now  are not producing the desired result, and this circumstance  cannot be blamed on the Finance Service, since on the whole it  is coping with its tasks. Officials of our Directorate work a  great deal in central economic and governmental entities,  defending Armed Forces interests. We are giving most careful  attention to ensuring a very strict regime of economy in  expending the resources being allocated for defense, to  strengthening fiscal control, and to coming up with proposals  aimed at strengthening social protection of servicemen and Armed  Forces veterans and their families.    [Chekmarev] One other important problem is the  construction and procurement of housing for servicemen,  especially those arriving on the territory of Russia from  abroad. What kind of funds are being spent for these  purposes?    [Vorobyev] In accordance with Russian Federation  Presidential Edict No. 796 of 21 July 1992, the Ministry of  Defense received the right to direct not only appropriations  provided by the federal budget for financing centralized capital  investments, but also extra-budgetary funds obtained from  selling freed-up military property, for building and purchasing  housing for servicemen.    In 1993 over R600 billion from the republic budget and an  additional R5 billion of extra-budgetary funds for constructing  and purchasing apartments were sent to pay for construction of  housing under the state defense order. In 1994 it is envisaged  allocating funds for building 73,300 apartments--more than in  the past year.    [Chekmarev] Are Russian Federation Ministry of Defense  enterprises and organizations subject to privatization?    [Vorobyev] In accordance with the State Program  for Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the  Russian Federation for 1994, Ministry of Defense enterprises are  not subject to privatization. Considering that Russian Ministry  of Defense enterprises and organizations are a very important  element in ensuring Armed Forces combat readiness and vital  activities, in my view it is advisable to refrain from  privatizing them even subsequently. It is necessary to perform  purposeful work to strengthen the Army and Navy  material-technical base, to outfit them with modern kinds of  arms and military equipment, and to keep equipment service life  at the proper level based on upgrading and developing the  performance of military repairs.    [Chekmarev] Many letters come to journal editors from  Armed Forces veterans who are military retirees on matters  concerning their pension support, and in particular on ensuring  timely payment of pensions in new amounts when there is a mass  recomputation of them. How is this matter being resolved  presently and what steps are being taken by the Main Military  Budget and Finance Directorate to accelerate getting pensions in  the increased amounts directly to military retirees?    [Vorobyev] A solution to this problem is very  important at the present time under conditions of the rise in  prices on goods and services and inflationary processes  occurring in the country, inasmuch as a delay in paying a  pension in the new amount devaluates it and lowers its buying  power.    By decision of the Main Military Budget and Finance  Directorate, almost all military commissariats were supplied  with personal computers to improve pension support and shorten  the time for getting pensions in the new amounts to military  retirees. This permits recomputing pensions in 2-3 weeks, and  even faster for those military commissariats where a small  number of retirees are registered. In addition, pension entities  of military commissariats are attempting to adjust close  business contacts with Savings Bank establishments in order to  help the latter's employees complete documents for payment of  pensions.    And still there continue to be shortcomings in pension  support work. The callousness and bureaucratism of some military  commissariat workers have not yet been fully eradicated. Delays  in assigning and recalculating pensions are allowed in places.  There also are simply mistakes in determining the amounts of  pensions and allowances, as a result of which the rights of some  retirees are infringed. We see omissions and defects in the work  of pension entities. Exactingness toward them has been raised.    The majority of military commissariats and finance and  economic directorates of military districts have been reinforced  by experienced officers of finance and pension entities by  decision of the minister of defense in order to improve the  quality of work of servicing retirees. In short, everything  depending on us is being done and will be done to strengthen the  social protection of Armed Forces veterans.    [Chekmarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, tell me, please, what  social guarantees are envisaged for servicemen in case their  health is harmed, and also for their families in case they are  killed or die, for it is no secret that many Russians now serve  in so-called "hot spots"?    [Vorobyev] I agree with you that many Russian  servicemen presently are performing military duty honorably in  areas with an unstable sociopolitical situation, under  conditions of a state of emergency, and in regions where armed  conflicts are taking place. In order to socially protect  servicemen in case their health is harmed or to protect their  families in case the breadwinner is killed or dies, the Russian  Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen" provides for state  personal insurance. In accordance with this Law, insurance  coverage norms which substantially strengthen the social  protection of servicemen and their families were introduced  beginning 1 March 1993 by decree of the Russian Federation  government.    I will give just one example. In case a servicemen  performing  contract military service dies in the line of duty, his family,  consisting of his wife, two children and parents, altogether  will receive 125 times the base pay and allowances authorized  the serviceman on the day of his death.    The procedure for completing documents and also for paying  allowances and insurance is spelled out by the Russian  Federation Minister of Defense Order of 6 May 1993. I would like  to emphasize that it is the responsibility of the Military  Insurance Company to make payments in accordance with the order  I mentioned in order to shorten the time of paying the insurance  sums so needed by families specifically at this moment. As of  today, that insurance coverage answers the realities of the  present moment.    The Military Insurance Company is joining more and more  actively in the work of social protection of servicemen. To  assist families with many children, it has transferred from its  funds R50 million each to the Far East Military District and  Northern Fleet and R75 million each to the Transbaykal Military  District and Airborne Troops. The Military Insurance Company  purchased 35 apartments for servicemen with an overall area of  2,000 m[.sup]2[/], and other charitable acts are being  carried out. Was such a thing really possible two or three years  ago, when the Gosstrakh [Main Administration of State Insurance]  "called the tune"?! Meanwhile, Army and Navy personnel still are  making insufficient use of capabilities of the Military  Insurance Company, although it can insure the lives of children  and other members of the serviceman's family, a summer house, a  car and much more.    [Chekmarev] Changes in the country's economy, the trend  toward a reduction of defense expenditures and of the economic  foundations of Russian Federation military doctrine dictate the  need to perfect the mechanism for providing troops with arms,  military equipment and other material-technical resources, and  consequently also with finances, which are the circulatory  system of the military economy. Our journal's readers would be  interested in learning how the activity of the Armed Forces  Finance Service will be transformed under market conditions.    [Vorobyev] You are right, the country's transition  to market relations, the sharp reduction in defense  expenditures, instability in allocating appropriations, and an  expansion in Armed Forces relationships with enterprises and  organizations with various forms of ownership require developing  new approaches aimed at ensuring thrifty, rational use of  resources being allocated for defense, especially for developing  arms and military equipment programs and for capital  construction. Successful performance of these tasks will be  determined to a considerable extent by the status of economic  activity at all levels of military management.    The Economic Service was established to develop and  implement  a unified economic and financial policy in the Armed Forces. Its  tasks include performing an economic analysis of measures  envisaged by basic provisions of Russian Federation military  doctrine, forecasting military-economic decisions being made,  and determining the economically substantiated need for  appropriations for financing troops and naval forces and for  socioeconomic development of enterprises and organizations  engaged in industrial production and construction. The Economic  Service is to function along with existing finance entities.  Economic structures presently permeate all military management  entities, beginning with formations.    [Chekmarev] In connection with the reduction in the  Armed Forces, a considerable amount of arms, military equipment  and property is being freed up. How does the Ministry of Defense  plan to dispose of this wealth?    [Vorobyev] The Ministry of Defense is given the  right to sell freed-up military property in accordance with  Russian Federation Presidential Edict No 1518 of 30 December  1992. In preparing the draft of this edict the Russian  Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for Administration of State  Property] demanded that there be a maximum limitation on the  number of persons engaged in sales to preclude instances of  abuse in selling military property. In this connection it is  permitted to sell Ministry of Defense property in the domestic  market only through the Specialized State Cost-Accounting  Enterprise, and in the foreign market exclusively through the  Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Central Directorate of  Material Resources and Foreign Economic Relations.    But it stands to reason that not all property will be sold  directly to the national economy. A portion of it may be used  only after presale preparation. In addition, arms and military  equipment cannot be used directly in the national economy. For  their effective use it is necessary to arrange for their parting  and thorough conversion, using industrial enterprises. It is for  these very purposes that special state programs are being  developed for recycling arms and military equipment.    [Chekmarev] What are the main problems in selling and  recycling arms, military equipment and property?    [Vorobyev] Improving the sales mechanism, for  example. At the present time a considerable portion of military  property is being sold on the exchanges, but used property, as  you realize, is not considered exchange goods. The auction form  of trading in property should have been developed to a greater  extent, but unfortunately the advantages of auctions are not  being used to the full extent for now. The question is being  examined of organizing small wholesale and retail trade stores,  which in our opinion will allow simplifying the very process of  selling property. Today that process requires completing a  considerable number of documents, which gives buyers of products  certain inconveniences.    [Chekmarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, the final question:  What is the role of fiscal control under conditions of market  relations?    [Vorobyev] Under conditions of a reduction in the  Armed Forces and the country's transition to market relations,  the main task of fiscal control was to monitor fulfillment of  Russian Federation Presidential Edicts, Russian government  decrees and instructions, and Russian Federation minister of  defense orders and directives on financial and economic matters,  to monitor observance of state and financial discipline in  expending funds, and to monitor timely, correct financial  support to Army and Navy combat readiness.    A basic direction of control is the study of causes of  deficiencies and disruptions in financial and economic activity,  prevention of excesses and mismanagement in expending funds and  supplies, development of proposals for improving financial and  economic activity, and assistance to commanders and chiefs in  organizing and managing finances.    Under present conditions, when commerce and, let's put it  this way, illegal entrepreneurial activity of some heads of  military force elements is actively penetrating the Armed Forces  economy, Finance Service inspectors are faced with new problems  concerning a check of the legality of this activity and  computation of the amounts of damage and losses which our Armed  Forces suffer because of this. Such commercial and  entrepreneurial activity has assumed especially wide scope in  the Air Force, Navy (Pacific, Baltic and Northern fleets) and  GLAVTU [Main Transportation Directorate].    Materials of audits and inspections of financial and  economic  activity of various military force elements indicate that a  number of officials are taking advantage of connivance and the  absence of control and are using aircraft for transporting  commercial cargoes, personal cars and passengers. As a result,  earned funds did not end up in the cash boxes of military units,  but accumulated in the accounts of commercial organizations,  which did material damage of many millions of rubles to the  state.    During 1992-1993 a number of Air Force servicemen illegally  were founders or held leadership positions in commercial  structures. This is clear nonfulfillment of the Russian  Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen"...    Many violations have been uncovered by audits and  inspections  in connection with the sale of automotive and aviation equipment  to outside organizations and commercial structures. Control over  legality of operations and proper establishment of prices is not  being carried out and the sale was made at underestimated  prices, which was one of the reasons for material damage being  done to the state.    Rather serious violations in commercial and business  activity  were uncovered, for example, in the Directorate of the  Commander, Military Space Forces and in military units  subordinate to him.    I would like to note that control and audit entities and  Finance Service inspectors maintain close contact with entities  of the military procuracy in their practical work. Based on  materials of audits and inspections, criminal proceedings have  been and are being instituted against guilty persons.    A number of orders of the minister of defense, commanders in  chief of branches of the Armed Forces, commanders of military  districts and fleets, and chiefs of main and central  directorates of the Ministry of Defense have been issued based  on results of audits and inspections. Guilty officials are being  held strictly liable disciplinarily as well as financially.    The organization and accomplishment of control is a very  important function of the Finance Service. In connection with  this, it is necessary to continue the search for ways of  improving it and raising its quality. The main efforts should  henceforth be aimed at preventing financial violations and  giving practical help in troop activity locally. And of course,  the demand on officials who have allowed violations in use of  funds and supplies must be strict, in accordance with demands of  the laws.

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Warner Estates declines to Pounds 3.76m at midterm WARNER Estates reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.76m for the six months to March 31, compared with Pounds 4.11m restated on a FRS 3 basis to take account of realised capital surpluses less released revaluation gains. The main interest of the company is property investment but the pre-tax figure also included losses of Pounds 268,000 from marble and tiling activities. Turnover was Pounds 5.41m (Pounds 6.42m) including Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 505,000) from marble and tiling. Rental income increased slightly and this was expected to continue as rent reviews and lettings occurred. Further restructuring has been undertaken at marble and tiling where indications for the second half were more hopeful. Earnings per share came out at 5.43p (6.08p) and the interim dividend is raised to 3.65p (3.5p).</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SURGE LIFTS DAMEWORTH TO NATIONAL TITLE;  </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY: AGOURA HIGH SENIOR CONCLUDES AN UNBEATEN SEASON BY PULLING AWAY  TO A 50-METER VICTORY IN THE KINNEY CHAMPIONSHIPS.  </P> <P> Judgment Day arrived Saturday for Bryan Dameworth, the whiz kid whose  undefeated season was put to a test in the Kinney national cross-country  championships at Balboa Park.  </P> <P> Andrew Maris, a senior from White River High in Buckley, Wash., stayed with the  Agoura High senior for the first 2 3/4 miles but could not keep pace thereafter  as Dameworth won in 14 minutes, 49.9 seconds over the 5,000-meter course. Maris  was second in 15:00.9.  </P> <P> Maris tailed Dameworth and Teddy Mitchell of Lyman High in Longwood, Fla., at  one mile and Dameworth and Maris were tied for first at two miles (9:39). But  Dameworth took control in the last quarter-mile with a closing surge to win by  50 meters.  </P> <P> "We were just going to see who would run out of fuel first," said Dameworth,  the fifth California runner in the meet's 11-year history to win the national  championship and first since Marc Davis (San Diego High) in 1986. "I was  concentrating on hanging in there as long as I could.  </P> <P> "I was scared. He's really tough."  </P> <P> Dameworth, who had finished fourth in the 1988 national final, became the  second Valley-area runner to win the title. Eric Reynolds won the 1982  championship in Orlando, Fla., as a Camarillo High senior.  </P> <P> Hoover senior Eliazar Herrera ran a strong final mile to finish 11th (15:25.2)  after completing two miles (10:01) in 23rd.  </P> <P> "I just thought that it was my last race and I wanted to place as high as  possible," Herrera said.  </P> <P> "I ran what I could the last mile, all out."  </P> <P> Arroyo Grande junior Louie Quintana, who shadowed Dameworth with second-place  finishes in the Southern Section 2-A Division, state Division I and West  regional championships, placed third in 15:10.0.  </P> <P> In the girls' competition, Agoura junior Deena Drossin faded from fourth at the  mile mark (5:25) and finished 13th in 18:14.3.  </P> <P> The season-closing meet was a disappointment for Drossin, who had hoped for a  top-five finish after 11th- and 17th-place efforts the past two years.  </P> <P> "I just didn't have it, I guess," Drossin said.  </P> <P> Westlake's Jeannie Rothman, eighth in the West regional, finished 16th in  18:32.7.  </P></p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance Royal has trailed the top flight of UK insurance companies for so long that yesterday's half-year figures are something of an event. Pre-tax profits to the end of June were Pounds 191m. That is Pounds 10m higher than reported by Commercial Union earlier this week and only a shade less than General Accident. Yet the market values Royal at around Pounds 1.7bn, against Pounds 2.6bn for GA and over Pounds 3bn for CU. Unless Royal's earnings are significantly lower quality than those of its rivals, this relative valuation is difficult to defend. Royal's exposure to UK domestic property insurance is certainly a reason for caution. Last winter was especially benign in terms of weather. While all the composite insurers will have to accept lower margins in the UK as rate competition increases, Royal's mix of business could lead to more volatile returns. Its performance in the US also remains a concern. Even allowing for the impact of bad weather in the first quarter, Royal is struggling to turn the business around. If the company can start to convince on that score, though, it will deserve a rating more in line with its peers.</p>

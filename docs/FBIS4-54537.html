			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zbigniew Grzegorzewski: "How Much Haggling, How </F> Much Market?"]    [Text] The debate over the form of the new privatization  law exploded rather suddenly during a recent meeting of the  Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers. It was  unexpected because three ministers knew the draft proposal  earlier and did not offer corrections to it. The ministers of  industry, of agriculture, and of foreign economic cooperation  emerged as opponents of the draft.    The fact that this is not the first time the Alliance of the  Democratic Left has failed to get support from the Polish  Peasant Party (PSL) only adds color to the situation. But this  is only one aspect of the affair, not its most important part.  Three ministries would like to take control of privatization  away from the Ministry of Property Transformations (MPW) or, at  the very least, limit the privatization ministry to a minimum.  Their proposal is that ministers who act as charterers of units  would make decisions about property transformation in those  units on their own.    The minister of industry would thus become the most  important  figure in Polish privatization because the Ministry of Industry  and Commerce is the largest owner of state firms. It fulfills  the function of charterer for 764 public-sector firms, ahead of  the Ministry of Transport and Naval Economy (553 firms), the  Voivode of Katowice (230 firms), and the Voivode of Lodz (189  firms). The position of the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Cooperation would seem to be minor because it controls only 18  firms; however, these are the great foreign trade bureaus! The  Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry has only 47 firms left  because 1,595 have been handed over to the State Treasury's  Agency for Farm Property. Nearly all of the former State Farms  are still held by the state, and these, of course, make up an  important part of the PSL's unhappy electorate.    The owner would thus privatize his own property. There is  thus a question: If three ministers are to take advantage of  this possibility, why not all? Would the minister of internal  affairs, for example, be a good privatizer? That ministry is the  charterer of one state firm, after all. One could equally well  imagine the chief of the Physical Culture Office spreading  privatization culture in his 22 state firms.    Have we thus returned to a Poland divided by industrial  sector? This is certainly one of the dangers but not the only  one. The stakes are more than 5,000 state firms. Voivodes are  the charterers of 3,400 of these; central organs control the  other 1,800. There is general agreement to the fact that control  of strategic areas of national interest should remain in the  hands of the ministries. Examples are the energy industry, the  arms industry, rails, and telecommunications. Many other firms  could be handed over to voivodes--how many is a question about  the scope of the decentralization of power.    Authority over sole corporations of the state treasury  (jssp)  might remain attractive. The privatization ministry has  transformed 522 state firms into such corporations, while the  Ministry of Industry has transformed 118 firms into 58 jssp's.  The MPW has privatized 100 corporations. These have not always  been attractive finds. However, the MPW's power is also a result  of its authority over the composition of supervisory boards.  This has been much less satisfactory for the Ministry of  Industry and Commerce; for example, seven jssp's were created  out of 65 coal mines. The industry ministry thus carries the  weight of restructuring in a very conflict-ridden sphere in our  economy. The privatization ministry has not aspired to the role  of privatizer of mining, which requires a costly and thorough  restructuring. It is not therefore surprising that the  organization of that process has been left to the Ministry of  Industry and Commerce. Elimination also of authority over the  composition of supervisory boards would in this conflict be  illogical. If this were to be so, we could have some kind of  repetition of the Borowski-Kawalec case--as we know, Deputy  Prime Minister Kawalec had authority over the composition of  supervisory boards in banks.    One must also not ignore the act that the reservations about  the privatization law draft were made at a time when there is no  deputy prime minister for economic affairs.    All of this does not mean, however, that one should defend  the present scope of MPW authority. A decrease of that scope  should occur through the aforementioned decentralization of  ownership powers--the devolution of such powers on voivodes,  including through the so-called communitization of state  property.    Should there be a Ministry of the Economy? I do not want to  repeat the arguments from a discussion that recently appeared in  ZYCIE GOSPODARCZE. The state domain is still so wide that such a  resolution would seem to be premature, although it could lessen  the interministry games.    Some time ago, the discussion over state treasury  trusteeships began. It was begun by the privatization ministry,  even though such institutions would mean a lessening of its  domain. The point is to bring to light certain scandals  connected with the partial property rights in privatized  corporations and with the property left over in the state domain  after liquidations of public-sector firms.    However, one should not confuse the idea behind the creation  of a super state treasury. A new, huge state administrative  organ would have to be created because it would have to control  some 5,000 state firms. If such an institution is to be created,  it will exercise ownership authority over a significantly  diminished group of firms. The shrinkage of this group depends  upon the pace of privatization. At the moment, the best solution  would be to create such trusteeships.    It would be quicker to reach agreements that would divide  the  flow of resources from the flow of revenue, and thus the empire  from its domains. The income from privatization does not create  a restructuring stream but, instead, serves constantly to patch  up the budget because the hole in the budget is a drag on  privatization. Such a divide of revenue could be accomplished  within trusteeships.    Meanwhile, we are witnessing a discussion not about the "map  of privatization" but about its division into spheres of  influence. This is not a debate over state treasury trusteeships  but over the right to exercise ownership supervision in jssp's  and in partially-privatized corporations.    The right to influence over privatization can thus be  divided  in different ways--not only by industries or ministries.    Every fight over privatization is thus a struggle for  influence. Privatization itself is a game of interests that are  often by nature at odds with one another. The problem is the  quality of that game. The quality of society's understanding of  privatization depends on the quality of the battles waged over  it.</p>

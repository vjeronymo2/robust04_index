			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A bomb exploded at 0138 today at the German Goethe  Institute on 14 Omiros Street in Athens. Approximately one half  hour earlier an unidentified person who said he represented ELA  [Revolutionary People's Struggle] telephoned ELEVTHEROTIPIA  newspaper and warned about the explosion. The police cordoned  off the area to prevent casualties. However, the men of the  antiterrorism squad did not manage to enter the building before  0420 today because there was nobody in charge to open it. The  bomb was planted in the ladies room on the first basement level  where it caused considerable material damage.</p>

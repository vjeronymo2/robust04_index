			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Malaysian moves Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has made it clear that he is in no mood to rescind his government's embargo on purchasing British goods. 'No contracts in exchange for British press freedom to tell lies,' he wrote in a letter published in yesterday's FT. Dr Mahathir's reaction to newspaper reports that bribes were allegedly offered to Malaysian politicians is unwarranted. The British government has no control over what the country's press says, nor should it. By linking government contracts to whether British newspapers say nice things about his regime, Dr Mahathir has damaged trading relations that are important to both countries. If he has been libelled, the right response would be to sue in the British courts. Eventually Dr Mahathir may realise that the trade ban will damage Malaysia as much as, if not more than, Britain. He has not only reduced his choice of suppliers but alerted the world to the risks of doing business with Malaysia. He should remember that reputations take longer to build than to destroy. In the meantime, the question is how the British government should respond. There should certainly be no apologies, since Malaysia has wronged Britain, not vice versa. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to appeasement by some ministers: Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, has even blamed the press for the dispute. Though apologies should be ruled out, Britain has little interest, at this stage, in escalating matters. An argument could be made for a symmetrical ban on UK government contracts to Malaysian business. But retaliation should only be considered if strong protests fail to change Dr Mahathir's mind. The UK's European partners should be asked to join such protests, for wider issues of press freedom and commercial policy are at stake. The dispute underlines the need for international rules to prevent governments using discriminatory public procurement in this way. Although a Gatt code covering public procurement exists, it has been signed by only a handful of countries, of which Malaysia is not one. It would be naive to think that Dr Mahathir could be persuaded to sign the code in current circumstances. But extending it to all Gatt members should be one of the European Union's medium-term goals.</p>

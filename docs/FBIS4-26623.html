			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, June 23 (XINHUA) -- A poverty-relief and  environment improvement project was officially launched recently  in the mountainous southern part of Ningxia in northwest China,  with free aid from the United Nations World Food Program.    Li Shengrong, the top official in charge of the code-named  4071 Project, said the project will involve the building of  reservoirs, pump stations and wells, which will expand irrigated  farmlands by 3,700 ha.    The project will also sponsor the building of 10,000 ha of  terraced farms, 77 km of roads and water supply works to quench  the wide thirst felt both by humans and stock, Li said.    Li said the project will teach 31,900 to read and write,  reducing the local adult illiteracy rate from 36 percent to 18  percent. About 64,000 farmers, 28,000 of them women, will be  trained in various farming skills.    The project will be aimed at setting up a network of  extension stations for the promotion of new stock and crop  breeds and better farming skills and machines.    Massive afforestation efforts under the project will improve  the local environment and alleviate the shortage of animal feeds  and fuels, Li said.    The three counties involved in the project, namely Guyuan,  Pengyang and Longde, account for 59 percent of the autonomous  region's area, where poor resources, infertile farms and  frequent natural disasters have made the area one of the poorest  places in China.    According to the authority, the three counties now have  639,000 people living under the official poverty line.    Project 4071 will cost 150 million yuan, of which half will  be funded by 80,500 tons of grain donated by the United Nations  World Food Program, Li said. The first batch of 14,500 tons of  grain are expected to arrive by September.    In five years when the project is completed, the authority  hopes that the local grain production will be double its current  figure, and the average income of local farmers will rise above  the poverty line.    To ensure the work quality of the project, Li said the  project authority has invited experts and senior management  staff to provide technological supervision and consultancy  services.</p>

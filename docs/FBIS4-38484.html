			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian State Duma will recommend that the  government continue the talks with the CIS states aimed at  concluding an international treaty on a single external border  for the CIS and on its joint defense on a treaty basis. The  State Duma will also demand that the Russian Government take  measures in order to put an end to any uncontrolled and illegal  traffic of goods through the border, especially to the Baltic  states and to transferring financial funds from Russia to  foreign banks. This was stated in the draft resolution which is  expected to be adopted as a result of the closed parliamentary  hearings in the State Duma on the Russian state borders today.    The draft resolution has been worked out by the  parliamentary  Committee on Geo-Politics (led by Viktor Ustinov from the  faction of the Liberal Democratic Party). It also recommends  that the government prevent uncontrolled traffic of foreigners  and persons without citizenship to Russia, especially those from  China and Korea, and deport all foreigners and persons without  citizenship illegally staying on Russian territory.    In accordance with the draft resolution, the Duma Committees  on Geo-Politics and International Affairs are expected to set up  working groups which will also examine the possible conclusion  of a peace treaty with Japan taking into consideration the  declaration of 1956 on the Shikotan and Habomai islands.    There will also be established working groups in order to  make the appropriate preparations for ratification of the UN  Convention on Maritime Law of 1982 and in order to assess the  agreements between the USSR and the U.S.A. on the line of  delimitation of maritime space.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Businesses warn chancellor against harming upturn: FT writers report on the controversy over the November Budget and gauge the views of voters and industry BUSINESSES ARE warning Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, against raising taxes in November's Budget. Higher taxes would pose a serious threat to recovery, it is claimed, weakening consumer demand and undermining industry's confidence to invest. The British Retail Consortium, representing 300,000 retail outlets, said it had written to Mr Clarke urging him not to extend value added tax. 'We are completely opposed to any extension of the VAT base,' it said. Retailer WH Smith said it was preparing to launch a co-ordinated lobbying campaign with publishers and other booksellers to try to persuade Mr Clarke not to impose VAT on books. The company said: 'We have fought on this issue on three separate occasions since 1985, so we are used to this battle. But we have to say the omens look less favourable this time.' Many retailers fear that an increase in either direct or indirect taxation could weaken consumer spending. In particular they fear that moving the Budget to November might pose a threat to the vital Christmas trade. Some retailers make as much as 90 per cent of their annual profits in the Christmas and new year period. Industry bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors are preparing their Budget submissions for delivery later this month. The CBI stopped short of calling for no tax increases. It noted, however, that the government had already announced tax increases of Pounds 10.5bn over the next three years in the last Budget. 'We don't want anything that adds to the burden on business, or endangers recovery,' it said. Mr John Neill, chief executive of the components group Unipart, pointed out that the motor industry had received Pounds 1.6bn of help through the abolition of special car tax. 'It's probably right that the chancellor should seek to claw some of that back, perhaps through higher petrol duty or road fund licences,' he said. But putting up corporate, employment or personal taxation would devastate Britain's global competitiveness, he said. 'The government must do everything to cut the national overhead, because otherwise it will drown British industry.' Mr John May, managing director of Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency chain, wanted the chancellor to give priority to spending cuts. He believed house buyers were particularly sensitive to personal tax increases in the early stage of a recovery. 'To increase taxes this year would be very damaging to the recovery,' he said.</p>

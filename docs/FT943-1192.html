			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Asean members in dispute over free trade zone plan The six members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations are in unusual disarray over a proposal to turn the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation group into a free trade zone by the year 2020. The Asean members had hoped to form a united core within Apec, but that received a setback at the weekend when their trade ministers admitted they might not be able to agree on a common response to the free trade proposal, which could figure prominently in next month's Apec summit in Jakarta. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's minister for international trade and industry, undercut Asean reservations when he told Asean economic ministers meeting in Chiang Mai that 'basically we are able to accept' the free trade proposal by the so-called Eminent Persons Group of business people and academics Asean ministers were forced to try to smooth over their differences at a late-night press conference on Friday. The reference in the original draft of the press statement that the ministers discussed the free trade report 'at length' was deleted in the final press release. Thailand - like many Asian countries that have enjoyed relatively easy access to the important US market - now fears that Washington will use the proposal to open up Thailand's own increasingly important domestic market. A senior Thai government official said Asean would need to examine 'the hidden agenda inside the conditions tied to 2020'. Malaysia, which has long railed against western domination of international trade, led calls for the report to be shelved. 'The report is a good reference. . . but we cannot subscribe to very long-term visions,' said Malaysia's trade and industry minister Rafidah Aziz. However, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, Singapore's trade and industry minister, said 'It is important for every organisation to have a vision of where you want to go and where you want to be ultimately.' And the Indonesian government argued that 'Asean is now strong enough to face any liberalisation in this region. The problem is simply how do you join this (free trade) bandwagon.' Economic growth in Thailand is expected to accelerate this year and next, but the government needs to tackle problems such as inadequate infrastructure and shortages of skilled labour to ensure sustainable growth in the future, the Thai planning agency said at the weekend, Victor Mallet reports from Bangkok. The state-run National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) predicted that real gross domestic product would grow 8.4 per cent this year and 8.5 per cent in 1995, compared with 7.6 per cent in 1992 and 8.1 per cent in 1993. Inflation is expected to rise to 5 per cent this year from 3.3 per cent in 1993, but will probably drop slightly in 1995. Exports should rise 16.1 per cent this year to Bt1,070bn (Pounds 29bn) and imports increase by 15 per cent to Bt1,315bn.</p>

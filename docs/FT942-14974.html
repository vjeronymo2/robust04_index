			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Spicy recipe for the Big Apple: Martin Dickson assesses the impact of Mayor Giuliani on New York's long-running financial and social problems It is mid-morning in Manhattan and a pudgy 13-year-old boy is playing video games in an amusement arcade just off Times Square, that crossroads of bright lights, sexual sleaze and tourist tat. A team from New York City's new anti-truancy police squad accosts the child, orders him into a van, and detains him for 90 minutes on suspicion of skipping school. A crackdown on classroom absenteeism may not be one of the weightiest reforms introduced to New York in the past three months by its mayor, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, yet it is symbolically significant: the city's first Republican mayor in 20 years is taking the unruly metropolis by its collar and trying to shake it into greater self-discipline, both fiscal and social. Mr Giuliani, who has just celebrated his first 100 days in office, has been a whirl of policy initiatives - in sharp contrast to the reactive style of his Democratic predecessor, Mr David Dinkins, New York's first black mayor, whom Mr Giuliani narrowly defeated in last November's election. The mayor's reform programme, designed to avert a looming budget crisis and reverse deterioration in the city's 'quality of life', has four main elements. The first is a crackdown on crime under a tough new police chief, Mr William Bratton. For example, police officers on the beat can now arrest drug dealers, rather than leaving this to special narcotics squads. The anti-truancy patrols are designed in part to pinpoint juvenile criminals, whose numbers are growing disturbingly. Second, the mayor wants to reform the school system, which suffers from declining standards, crumbling buildings and rising student violence. While vital, this is a complex task on which he has yet to formulate clear policies. His initial goal - to cut education bureaucracy so more money can flow to schools - is only a partial palliative. Third, he wants to create a more favourable business climate, and has made a modest first step by proposing small cuts in the corporate tax burden. Finally, he is trying to end that longest running of New York shows - the city's recurrent budget crisis - with a reform of its finances, privatisation of services and an efficiency drive. His immediate task is to bridge a potential Dollars 2.3bn budget gap in the year beginning July 1. His remedies include cutting the municipal workforce by 15,000 and wringing productivity concessions out of the unions; consolidating various government departments; and selling off at least four municipal hospitals, 85 petrol stations and a television and radio station. He is also trying to get New York state to assume a fairer proportion of Medicaid, which provides healthcare for the indigent and is one of the largest and fastest growing budget items. The business community sees the budget package as a good start, though some critics argue the mayor has been insufficiently radical, particularly in shielding from cuts the heavily staffed fire and police services, which backed him strongly in November's election. Mr Dean Mead, of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog agency, says the package 'holds promise. I don't see anything in it that is going to change dramatically the economic climate of the city, but it is the beginning of that process'. But along the way, the mayor has stirred up controversy. Many New Yorkers say he has yet to demonstrate the skills of diplomacy and political compromise needed to run the world's most polyglot city smoothly over the long haul. For Mr Giuliani, a 49-year-old former US attorney who made his name in the 1980s with the zealous prosecution of New York drug dealers, mafiosi and Wall Street insider traders, has brought to City Hall the bullying, irascible style of the courtroom interrogator, pouring personal scorn on politicians and civil servants who cross him. The strength of this approach was shown at the start of this month, when he pressurised the normally bellicose municipal unions into accepting voluntary redundancies. Its weakness was underlined a week ago, when his interference and insults prompted the highly respected head of the schools system briefly to resign. The new mayor is walking a fine line. As the first Republican mayor of Democratic-dominated New York since the aristocratic Mr John Lindsay in the 1960s, he has few political debts to pay, and therefore has the best chance in a generation of reforming the city's government. But he also needs to talk softly, if he is to win the co-operation of the Democrat-controlled city legislature and municipal agencies. The first real test of the administration's effectiveness will come this spring as Mr Giuliani tries to build a consensus in the legislature for his budget cuts. His predominantly white administration also needs to build bridges to the city's minority communities, particularly the black 25 per cent of the population which supported Mr Dinkins. 'I think he's off to a good start,' says Mr Felix Rohatyn, the veteran banker who helped save the city from a more serious financial crisis in the mid-1970s. 'But it's very important that as soon as possible he be seen as mayor of all the people of the city . . . There are still a lot of racial tensions in New York.' How Mr Giuliani manages this balancing act could have a profound impact on the future of New York, for he has come to office at a delicate point in the city's history: its mounting social and financial problems could mean a slow but inexorable economic decline, while solutions to them could prompt revival. New York is not alone in its problems. Many large cities face budget crises, high crime, an alienated black underclass and a flight of business and the middle class to the suburbs. Nor is it alone in electing a reformist, market-oriented mayor. Over the past year cities as varied as Los Angeles and Jersey City voted in Republicans in place of their traditional Democrats. However, New York does have unique features which set it apart from all other US cities, both exacerbating its problems and offering long-term strengths. On the positive side, the compact nature of Manhattan, its reliable subway system and its cultural attractions means that it has not suffered too badly from 'white flight' to the suburbs. At the other end of the income spectrum, New York retains its allure for new immigrants, who have revitalised some of the city's most decayed sections. 'New York's immigrant-driven culture has given it a ragged energy reminiscent of American cities at the turn of the century,' says Professor Peter Salins, editor of the right-of-centre City Journal. However, the city also has a larger than average quotient of those in need - be they newly landed immigrants, victims of Aids and crack cocaine, the indigent or the deranged. New Yorkers, moreover, have long expected their government to do more than other cities to solve their social problems. The city runs the largest subsidised housing programme in the US, as well as 15 municipal hospitals and an elaborate system of shelters for the homeless. Its bureaucracy is also unusually bloated, thanks to the strength of the municipal union movement and its close ties to the Democratic party machine. Over the past six years, employment by the municipality has risen by 15,000, while a prolonged recession - the result of the 1987 stock market crash and the 1990-91 national downturn - has cut the total number in work in the city by 345,000, or 9.5 per cent. All these factors mean that the city's spending is growing much more sharply than its revenues, which were seriously dented by the recession of 1989-93. Mr Giuliani will be helped by a recovery in the regional economy which began last year, though this looks like being painfully slow, and employment may not recover to pre-recession levels till around the turn of the century. Still, provided New York tackles its 'quality of life' problems, many observers think the city could grow healthily over the coming decades, drawing on what are still immense comparative advantages. It seems in no danger of losing its position as the world's pre-eminent financial hub. That said, it cannot rely on Wall Street for jobs growth. The securities industry has boomed over the past three years, but this has created relatively few new jobs in Manhattan, partly because information technology has increased productivity and partly because companies have moved much of their routine 'back office' paperwork to cheaper cities as far away as Florida. Yet New York remains the single greatest source of creative and intellectual capital in the US and is a leading centre for two of the sectors which seem likely to enjoy particularly strong growth over the next few decades: entertainment/information and international trade. Mr Mitchell Moss, head of the Urban Research Centre at New York University, says the city's competitive, cosmopolitan nature means that 'it is still a phenomenal magnet for the talented'. Mr Giuliani just has to keep it that way.</p>

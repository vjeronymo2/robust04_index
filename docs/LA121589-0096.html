			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW WRITER  </P> <P> Christopher Knight, formerly the art critic of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner,  is now writing art commentary and criticism for Calendar. His initial review is  of a show at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that surveys the first  significant movement in modern art indigenous to California. The exhibition,  "Bay Area Figurative Art: 1950-1965," isn't daring in its approach, but it does  shed a lot of light on a pivotal period in postwar American art.  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott explains plans for funding  -Labour rail policy MR JOHN PRESCOTT, shadow transport secretary, set out yesterday how his party would increase British Rail funding with private investment, self-financing schemes, funds switched from road building - and possibly from extra taxpayers' money. A letter to Sir Bob Reid, chairman of the BR board, said Labour would expect BR to have more board members 'committed to running a public service' and warned that the positions of all board members would be reviewed if Labour came to power. At a press conference Mr Prescott indicated that if he became transport secretary he would push for extra resources from the Treasury. 'We recognise that more money may have to come from the taxpayer,' he said, although later he made clear that any increase would depend on economic growth. Much of the cost of his proposals would come from other sources. For instance, Pounds 150m of replacement rolling stock for Network SouthEast could be leased from a private-sector lender. Old trains would be converted for leaf clearing and de-icing in severe weather. The government's roads programme would be reviewed, almost certainly meaning the cancellation of some bypass and motorway programmes. Labour would end the 4.75 per cent target set by the government for the return on assets of InterCity services, Mr Prescott said. The target Network SouthEast has been set of operating without subsidy after April 1992 would also be dropped. Mr Prescott said that the government's Public Service Obligation grants to British Rail have been cut by a total of more than Pounds 3bn in real terms since 1983. Labour would stop preparation for privatisation and ensure that InterCity routes threated by the government's plans would be preserved. In his letter to Sir Bob, he said the lower public subsidy and the investment needed for projects such as the Channel tunnel rail link meant 'an entirely new financial framework' would be needed, allowing BR access to private-sector finance. BR said it would respond as appropriate when it received Mr Prescott's letter.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW;  </P> <P> A PERFECTLY FRIGHTFUL PRODUCTION OF A HALLOWEEN CLASSIC  </P> <P> The mood is set even before the show begins.  </P> <P> In the darkened theater, on shadowy multilevel tiers, stand leafless trees with  grasping, claw-like branches. Storytellers in 19th-Century dress weave their  way into the audience and regale wide-eyed young theatergoers with scary tales  of "Old Scratch" and ghostly doings.  </P> <P> Suddenly, a mist creeps over the trees, the theater goes dark and the stage  resounds with crashing thunder and screams of fright.  </P> <P> At the Moulton Theatre in Laguna Beach, the Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre is  presenting its spirited production of the Halloween classic, Washington  Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." It's an auspicious start for Joe  Lauderdale, the Youth Theatre's new director.  </P> <P> The self-assured cast, ages 13 to 19, does a pleasing job with the comedic  thriller, adroitly delivering both dialogue and choreography. David Edwards'  sound design and Robert L. Smith's moody set and lighting inspire shivers.  </P> <P> Richard Stauffacher, 19, the pompous, greedy and cowardly Ichabod Crane,  comically makes up for his handsome face with eccentric mannerisms in movement  and speech. Costume designer Brigitte Harper helps with a too-short black suit  and frock coat to create illusory gawkiness.  </P> <P> The other principals -- Peter Kreder as Ichabod's rival, Brom, and Bronwen  Bitetti as vain Katrina, who toys with their affections -- provide humorous  moments. The storytellers, who serve as both narrators-in-concert and  villagers, handle their multiple roles with confidence and enthusiasm.  </P> <P> A word of warning: A chase through the audience -- with Ichabod pursued by the  pumpkin-toting Headless Horseman (sans horse) -- may seem tame to adult eyes,  but it and other moments during this ghost story are too intense for some  preschoolers.  </P> <P> At an early performance, there were periodic bouts of tears, and at least one  anxious child had to take frequent lobby breaks.  </P> <P>  At 606 Laguna Canyon Road tonight at 7:30; Saturday at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; and  Sunday at 2 p.m. Admission: $6 for adults, $4 for children 13 and under.  Information: (714) 494-8021.  </P></p>

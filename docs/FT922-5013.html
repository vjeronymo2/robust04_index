			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: MCA to spend extra Dollars 200m on theme parks MCA, the Hollywood studio and entertainment group owned by Matsushita of Japan, said its recreation services division planned to invest an additional Dollars 200m in its two Universal Studios theme parks in 1992-93. The investments in Universal Studios of Hollywood and Universal Studios of Florida will match the capital spending planned for attractions in the 1991-92 season. The Florida theme park is a joint venture between MCA and the Rank Organisation. Increased revenues from feature films helped Carolco Pictures, the troubled independent US film studio, improve its position for the quarter ended March 31, AP-DJ reports. Net losses for the period were cut to Dollars 4.3m, or 27 cents a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars 6.3m, or 20 cents a share, for the year-ago period. The result was struck on revenues of Dollars 136.5m, little changed from the Dollars 136.6m last time. Carolco said improved revenues from feature films helped offset a fall at its 53 per cent-owned video subsidiary, LIVE Entertainment. Carolco said feature film revenues rose Dollars 18.6m compared with the year-ago quarter. It said 'in light of the current situation at LIVE and our continuing efforts to effect a positive restructuring', it expected soon to retain an investment banking firm to assist its recapitalisation.</p>

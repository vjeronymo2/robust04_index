			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: India to part privatise state airlines Air India, India's state-owned international airline, and Indian Airlines, the state-owned domestic carrier, are to be transformed from public institutions into limited liability companies as a first step towards their partial privatisation, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. The government has formally approved the reorganisation plans, which form part of its economic reforms and include measures to promote greater commercial efficiency in state-owned enterprises. Air India and Indian Airlines will now be free to raise funds in the capital markets and sell equity to private investors, though the government will retain at least 51 per cent holdings. The size, timing and conditions of share issues have yet to be determined. Legislation agreed at the weekend also gives formal recognition to private airlines which have been operating in India for more than a year. They will now be permitted to publish schedules.</p>

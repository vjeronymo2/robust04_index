			<p>BFN     [Text] KYODO News Agency reported on 15 June from New York  that regardless of the official notification to the United  States on its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA], North Korea is continuing to recognize nuclear  inspection activities, such as the work to measure and regulate  inspection machines by the two inspectors dispatched from the  IAEA.    Quoting a U.S. Government official, KYODO News Agency  reported that North Korea had hinted that it would expel the  inspectors when it declared its withdrawal from the IAEA, but it  seems that North Korea allowed inspection activities by the IAEA  inspectors to avoid strong measures against the North by the  international community, such as the strengthening of economic  sanctions by the UN Security Council.    This official also said it is important that the inspectors  carry out activities, not that they are still in North Korea.  He hinted that the content of the sanction resolution against  the North will be influenced if the inspectors are expelled.    He also said that as long as North Korea allows the  inspectors to continue inspection activities, sanctions by the  UN Security Council will not be strengthened abruptly. In  particular, he said that the withdrawal from the IAEA and the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] by North Korea are  significantly different, and emphasized that it is necessary for  North Korea to implement the requirements of the NPT. Thus, he  did not attach much importance to the fact that North Korea  withdrew from the IAEA.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Possession Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A current criterion for the possession aboard a charter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel or headboat of multi-day bag limits is that the vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have two licensed operators aboard. Amendment 7 would delete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this criterion. The Council believes the two-licensed operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aboard criterion has no reasonable biological or management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correlation with multi-day bag limits. NMFS believes that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action should have little impact on the fishery, notwithstanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Council's indication in Amendment 7 that this measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibly may decrease income to operators/owners of charter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels and headboats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Gear Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Amendment 7, the only gear authorized in a directed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishery for snapper-grouper species would be vertical hook-and-line gear, including hand-held rods and rods attached to a vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (bandit gear), in either case, with manual, electric, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydraulic reels; spearfishing gear; bottom longlines; and sea  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bass pots. All other gear would be prohibited. Limits would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed on the possession and transfer of snapper-grouper species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by vessels with unauthorized gear aboard. An exception to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possession limits would apply in the case of a permitted vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that fishes in the EEZ off North Carolina with a sink net aboard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the use of bottom longlines to fish for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> snapper-grouper species in the EEZ south of St. Lucie Inlet, FL,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be prohibited; the use of powerheads to harvest snapper-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouper species in the EEZ off South Carolina would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited; and the use of rebreathers to harvest snapper-grouper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species with spearfishing gear in the EEZ off the southern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Atlantic states would be prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The concept of allowable gear allows managers to regulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fishery more efficiently by enabling managers to test gear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before it becomes widespread. This concept would enhance law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement by establishing standard gear. Environmental damage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the habitat would be minimized because gear would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated before it could be used. Testing of experimental gear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would minimize the possibility that very efficient gear could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause recruitment failure of the snapper grouper resource if it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were allowed to be used throughout the fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exception applicable to the use of sink nets off North  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carolina would allow fishermen in that area to operate with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple gears on a trip, that is, it would allow retention of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> snapper-grouper harvested with sea bass pots and/or vertical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hook-and-line gear and fish harvested with a sink net. A sink  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net has virtually no bycatch of snapper-grouper species and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuously tended, which minimizes the possibility of lost gear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and ghost fishing. Therefore, the Council believes that sink  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nets, as used off North Carolina, do not pose the problems to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> snapper-grouper fishery normally associated with entanglement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nets. This exception would improve the economic efficiency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishermen in North Carolina who are accustomed to using sink nets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and authorized gear on a trip.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council is proposing to ban the use of bottom longlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to fish for snapper-grouper species south of St. Lucie, FL, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the standing stock of tilefish in that area. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council believes that the prohibition of bottom longlines will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease fishing mortality on tilefish; hence, it should aid in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prevention of growth and recruitment overfishing. Also, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council believes that banning bottom longline gear will reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition among traditional bandit gear commercial fishermen,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recreational anglers, and longline fishermen and will result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced habitat damage. The Council noted that the continental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shelf edge is quite narrow south of St. Lucie Inlet, and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> want a bottom longline fishery to develop that would lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflict among the competing user groups in that area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Carolina prohibits the use of powerheads in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters, and powerheads cannot be used in the special management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zones in the EEZ off South Carolina. The Council's proposed ban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the use of powerheads in the entire EEZ off South Carolina is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to enhance enforceability of the prohibition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powerheads in State waters. This measure would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent State and Federal regulations off South Carolina. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council also believes that the ban on use of powerheads in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EEZ would reduce conflict between recreational and commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divers that appears to be a particular problem in the EEZ off  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Carolina.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council believes that the use of rebreathers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly increases the efficiency of divers using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spearfishing gear. The use of rebreathers eliminates bubbles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus allowing divers to stalk fish more easily. The Council is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned about the status of gag, which are particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vulnerable to divers when they aggregate to spawn. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition of rebreathers would lessen fishing mortality on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spawning aggregations, which will assist in prevention of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recruitment overfishing. Amberjack are also targeted by divers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during spawning periods, and this measure would also reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishing mortality on that species and lessen the chance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recruitment overfishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Experimental Fishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Amendment 7, the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Regional Director) would be authorized to issue permits for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimental fishing, provided that, as a condition of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits, data on the gear used and fish caught in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimental fishing must be maintained and provided to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Science and Research Director. Experimental fishing would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide an opportunity to test new gear for possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization for use in the snapper-grouper fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Management Unit for Scup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment 7 proposes to modify the management unit for scup,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Stenotomus chrysops, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  so that management under the FMP would apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only south of Cape Hatteras. Scup are found from the North/South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carolina border to the U.S.-Canada border with a division of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stocks at Cape Hatteras. The northern stock of scup is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overfished and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering measures to rebuild that stock. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of the management unit would allow the Mid-Atlantic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council to manage the northern stock of scup throughout its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range. This is a conservation measure that would result in more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient management of this resource.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While NMFS is inviting comments on all of the measures in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 7, comments are specifically invited on the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns about provisions of the allowable gear measure. (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What are the effects of prohibiting the use of bottom longlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> south of St. Lucie Inlet, FL ? (2) What are the effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibiting the use of powerheads in the EEZ off South Carolina?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Measures in Amendment 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

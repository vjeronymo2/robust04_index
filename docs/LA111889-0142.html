			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGENTS REVIEW POTENTIAL UNIVERSITY SITES  </P> <P> The University of California Board of Regents met behind closed doors Friday to  discuss 136 possible sites throughout the state for three new campuses the  university says it needs to accommodate more students.  </P> <P> The regents refused, however, to identify which properties are under  consideration.  </P> <P> UC President David P. Gardner and the regents said they feared the price of  some of the lands would rise if the discussions were open. Gardner said,  however, many of the sites are being offered to the university as gifts.  </P> <P> Initially, UC officials had planned to release a list of 50 properties Friday  of between 160 and 1,400 acres that are close enough to transportation and  population centers to make viable university settings. Officials had hoped to  narrow the choices down by the end of next year in order to build the first of  the new schools by 1998.  </P> <P> But officials said the number of available sites surprised them. So instead,  Gardner and his staff decided to divide the state into three regions -- north,  central and south -- and focus initially on which area should be the first to  get a new UC campus. That regional decision is expected by early next year, and  two or three of the most promising sites within the area will be selected by  later in the year, with environmental impact studies to follow.  </P> <P> At a press conference after the regents' meeting, Gardner stressed that each of  the three regions needs a new campus by 2005. However, his claim is likely to  face close scrutiny in the Legislature because of the enormous construction  costs -- estimated to be at least $900 million for three schools.  </P> <P> According to a map distributed Friday, the central region designated by the UC  planners contains none of the existing nine UC campuses.  </P> <P> But Gardner warned boosters of a campus in the Central Valley not to assume a  site there will be chosen first. Much will depend on ongoing studies about an  area's college attendance rates and the eligibility of its students for UC  admissions, he said.  </P> <P> Scores of communities throughout the state have lobbied the regents to locate a  campus in their areas because of the economic benefits one can bring.  </P> <P> UC officials anticipate student enrollment will grow by 62,000 to 205,000 in  the next 15 years. But some other education experts have said such growth could  be handled by expanding existing campuses.  </P> <P> In other business, the regents unanimously voted Friday to hike next year's  education and registration fees by 4.7% for California residents and 2.5% for  out-of-state students. Excluding housing, food and books, a UC education will  cost residents $1,703 and non-Californians $7,619 if the Legislature and  governor agree with the proposal.  </P></p>

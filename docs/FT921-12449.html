			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: The proper economic observation Sir, Observer ('Guru glut' January 23) has clearly developed some new skills in word manipulation. The column claimed that I remarked: 'It seems like an inefficient use of time to try to assess economic pressures.' He is obviously referring to what I wrote on January 16, in an article on exchange rates, which was: 'It seems like an inefficient use of time to try to assess economic pressures on the ERM since even if they were analysed correctly there would be no reason to expect the appropriate movement in a currency's price.' The latter and correct quote is a proper economic observation that if you have a fixed or semi-fixed exchange rate regime in place then underlying economic pressures will not be reflected fully in movements in the regime's exchange rates. They may be reflected in the price of bonds and equities or in the performance of the real economy (and time should be spent analysing those variables); but the exchange rate cannot move freely if it is not free to move. Observer's incomplete and, consequently, inaccurate use of my quote is asinine.

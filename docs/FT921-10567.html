			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Princely capitalism THE PRINCE of Wales has undeniably left his mark, for better or worse, on British architecture. Is he now about to use the luxury of his position as a potential head of state to do the same for business? His speech to the grandly named World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday suggests that he aspires to do so. But capitalism is a tougher nut to crack than the British architectural profession; and the prince's interpretation of the business world is sufficiently idiosyncratic to raise a doubt or two about his prescriptions. Business, he asserts, is the core of modern society - a statement that might just make sense of the Japanese social structure, but which seems to bear little resemblance to anything that is happening in western Europe. And business, he adds, has been the real victor of the Cold War. If we are to find solutions to the challenges of the post-Cold War era, runs his argument, business must work in partnership with governments, local communities and pretty well everyone else to achieve not only economic, but spiritual, social and ecological goals. This is a novel interpretation of post-war history and it incorporates a monumental non sequitur. There are many businesses in the former Soviet Union which are not victors of the Cold War and whose problems stem precisely from working in a collaborative system. It so happened that the collaborative system was managerially and administratively less efficient than the more market-oriented systems of the west. Great irony That said, the prince's worries about the ability of old-fashioned economic liberalism to deliver in the late 20th century are not without point. The great irony of the post-Cold War era is that if the former Soviet Union had not collapsed we would now be discussing the dismal performance of capitalism. The debt-laden Anglo-Saxon economies are resisting all attempts at resuscitation; continental Europe appears to have lost the secret of job creation; and the Japanese economic miracle has been won at the cost of a stressfully uneven distribution of wealth. Many share the feeling that deeper human values have been a casualty of the profit motive. This is, of course, a rich man's complaint. And it leads the prince to a curiously eclectic vision in which capitalist animal spirits are incongruously leavened with nostalgia, social responsibility and something that verges on natural mysticism. It is a vision whose pedigree runs from the romanticism of Wordsworth, via the industrial reformism of Dickens's Hard Times, to the socially conscious profitability of Marks and Spencer. It may not be full-blooded collectivism (and it is not, alas, in inspired pentameters) but it is, at the very least, corporatist in spirit. Comparative advantage For all that, there is one sense in which the prince may be more in tune with the modern world than some neo-liberals. Comparative advantage in today's world has much more to do with the efficient deployment of human capital than of natural resource endowment. And there is no doubt that some of the most successful models of economic growth in the Far East are highly co-operative at company level, even though intense competition prevails outside. Human capital is sometimes, though not invariably, treated with greater respect in Japan than in the US or in Britain. Yet it is hard to move from generalisations about mankind's relationship with the urban or rural environment to concrete prescriptions about corporate governance or social and environmental responsibility. And a belief in 'working together' has to be tempered with the knowledge that government has all too often proved a poor partner for business working in the community. Perhaps as well then that the Prince of Wales yesterday did little more than urge what many employers would regard as best practice in relations with the community and on the environment. Take away the mysticism and you have something slightly woolly, very British and really rather familiar. But not something likely to generate an economic miracle.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Adams is condemned for carrying bomber's coffin THE PROSPECTS of the Hume-Adams peace plan for Ulster being accepted by the UK government further receded yesterday after Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of the IRA's political wing, helped to carry the coffin of an IRA bomber. Meanwhile, the Commons moved closer to establishing a select committee on Northern Ireland when its procedure committee decided to examine how such a body might be composed. Politicians from all sides attacked the actions of Mr Adams who shouldered the coffin of Thomas Begley, the IRA bomber who died in the Shankill Road fish shop blast at the weekend. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'We have seen photographs . . . of people in abject misery as a result of what happened in the Shankill Road and (now) we see Mr Adams carrying the coffin supporting one of those who did it.' The Democratic Unionist party yesterday condemned the 'hypocrisy' of Mr Adams, and said the show of solidarity between the Sinn Fein leader and the bomber of men, women and children indicated 'the nationalist leopard is incapable of changing its blood red spots'. Mr Adams last night defended his actions. He said his attendance had been made a matter of controversy. If he had been absent, it would have had the same affect. In the Commons Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the procedure committee, made clear his support for a select committee by urging the government 'to look at our report and act on it'. The report, first drafted in 1990, supported the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee at the appropriate time. Labour, which was opposed to re-opening the issue, accused the government of doing a secret deal with the Ulster Unionist party, which has long favoured the setting up of a select committee to scrutinise the work of the Northern Ireland Office. Downing Street said the establishment of a select committee was a matter for the Commons. However, the establishment of such a committee has become a touchstone of the relationship between the government and the unionists. Mr Tony Banks, a Labour member of the procedure committee, said the Conservatives wanted a Northern Ireland select committee as part of their 'pay-off' to the Ulster Unionists who helped the government avoid a Commons defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year. The Irish government is dismayed by the possibility that the British parliament might set up such a committee. In Dublin yesterday, Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, stressed there was 'no question of simply adopting or endorsing the report of the Hume-Adams dialogue'.</p>

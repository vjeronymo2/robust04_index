			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Van sales lift flagging sector UK COMMERCIAL vehicle sales last month reversed 32 consecutive months of decline. However, the slight increase in sales was concentrated in the vans sector and manufacturers yesterday continued to show little optimism of an early truck-market recovery. At 16,176, total new commercial vehicle sales were up 5.16 per cent on the 15,382 sold in June a year ago. But sales for the first half of the year, at 102,507, were 8.64 per cent below last year's first-half 112,197. The minor consolation for UK-based manufacturers was that, in spite of the fact that imports increased their market share slightly in June, their first-half share fell to 34.64 per cent from 35.47 per cent a year before. Sales of light vans - mainly those derived from cars - rose by 9.61 per cent in June to 5,363, up from 4,893 a year previously. In the first half as a whole they are running nearly 10 per cent below last year's ago levels, and the market appears to be on the brink of an intensified price war after Ford cut prices of its Fiesta diesel vans by 7.7 per cent. Sales of panel vans, typified by the Ford Transit, also rose in June, up 7.83 per cent to 7,246 from 6,720 a year ago. Here too, however, first-half sales remained more than 7 per cent below last year's ago levels. Sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes recorded yet another month of decline, falling 3.82 per cent to 2,5443 from 2,614. For the half year, they remain just over 10 per cent below last year's equivalent period. It is in the heaviest sector of the market - trucks over 15 tonnes - that there is most uncertainty. Sales of 38 tonnes-plus heavy tractor units have been running about 10 per cent above last year's levels in each of the past three months. Even so, a spokesman for Leyland DAF, the UK truck-market leader, said sales would have to recover by well over 10 per cent in the second half of the year to attain even last year's severely depressed levels. ERF, the UK's last independent heavy-truck maker, expects total UK sales of trucks over 15 tonnes this year to be about 15,000 units for the second year in a row, some 60 per cent below the 38,000 achieved in 1989. According to Mr Rod England, ERF sales and marketing director, there remains no sign of recovery.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-JUNE 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Volume   Volume     Share (%)  Share (%)                                (Units) Change (%) Jan-Jun 92  Jan-Jun 91 Total Market*                 102,507   -8.64        100.0      100.0 Imports                        35,505  -10.78        34.64      35.47 Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                          32,507   -9.60        100.0      100.0 Imports                         6,160   -5.01        18.95      18.03 Ford                           13,784  -15.73        42.40      45.49 Vauxhall (GM)                  10,893  +12.25        33.51      26.99 Rover (British Aerospace)       2,551  -35.37         7.85      10.98 Peugeot (incl.

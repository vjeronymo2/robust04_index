			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Independent Insurance at Pounds 10m A good performance from its underwriting business was behind a more than doubling of pre-tax profits from Independent Insurance Group from Pounds 4.29m to Pounds 10.1m for the first six months of the year. The general insurer, which floated on the stock market last year, achieved gross underwriting profits of Pounds 6.4m against a loss of Pounds 2.23m. The latter figure was depressed by a Pounds 5.2m loss on stop-loss policies underwritten for Lloyd's Names in 1989 and 1990. The gross written premium increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 131.3m (Pounds 106.2m), while investment income rose by the same amount from Pounds 3.93m to Pounds 4.86m. Earnings per share jumped from 8.7p to 15.4p and the interim dividend is raised 14 per cent to 4p (3.5p). The company said that a combination of new products and more efficient systems had contributed towards the improvement. In its general insurance business, gross premium income in the commercial division rose 31 per cent to Pounds 52.1m (Pounds 39.7m), resulting in an underwriting profit of Pounds 1.5m compared with Pounds 300,000. Mr Michael Bright, chief executive, said the company was taking precautions against potential problems associated with employers liabilities. The home insurance market produced an underwriting profit 53 per cent ahead at Pounds 2m (Pounds 1.3m). Motor insurance business experienced competitive conditions and the gross written premium slipped from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 18.2m, although profits almost quadrupled from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.9m. Mr Bright added that the encouraging trends seen in the first half were continuing to have a beneficial effect on current trading.</p>

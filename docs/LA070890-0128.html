			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SECOND FIDDLE BY MARY WESLEY (PENGUIN: $7.95)  </P> <P> A droll comedy of manners, set in a provincial English village.  </P> <P> Laura Thornby, the daughter of a determinedly eccentric (and possibly  incestuous) family, takes up Claud Bannister, an unprepossessing man 20-odd  years her junior, the way a more normal woman might take up embroidery or  raising African violets. With smug aplomb, she bullies him into declaring his  independence from his mother and pursuing his goal of becoming a writer. Laura  enjoys meddling in Claud's life so much, it never occurs to her he might have  talent. She discovers his ability and the hollowness of her much vaunted  independence in a comeuppance that is richly deserved and tartly amusing.  </P></p>

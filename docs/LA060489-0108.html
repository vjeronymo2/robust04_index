			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> PNIN  </P> <P> by Vladimir Nabokov  </P> <P> (Vintage International: $7.95)  </P> <P> We are introduced to Timofey Pnin, professor of Russian at Waindell College, as  he rides a train to Cremona, where he will lecture in English -- a language he  has yet to master -- at the Cremona Women's Club. He is particularly pleased  that he had puzzled out the schedules and was taking a train that would save  him 12 minutes. Now he is trying to decide whether to place his lecture notes  in the coat jacket pocket of the black suit that he will later wear or whether  his luggage being stolen was a more likely danger than his forgetting his notes  in his room. "All of which does not alter the fact," Nabokov writes, "that Pnin  was on the wrong train."  </P> <P> This sort of mishap happens often to Pnin, an earnest Russian emigre who is  perhaps "too persistently on the lookout for diabolical pitfalls, too painfully  on the alert lest his erratic surroundings (unpredictable America) inveigle him  into some bit of preposterous oversight" -- and whose charm and humor are  frequently revealed unintentionally and at his own expense. "The cat, as Pnin  would say, cannot be hid in a bag."  </P></p>

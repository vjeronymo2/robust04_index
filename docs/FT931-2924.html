			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: McDonnell Douglas Information shows 23% advance to Pounds 19.4m McDONNELL Douglas Information Systems, the UK-owned computing services company formed earlier this year through a buy-out from the US aerospace group, lifted operating profits 23 per cent in the year to December 31 despite a 9 per cent fall in worldwide turnover. Operating profits were Pounds 19.4m compared with Pounds 15.8m. Turnover fell from Pounds 175.2m to Pounds 159.7m. Net assets, however, rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 77.9m compared with Pounds 59.4m. Mr Jeremy Causley, chief executive, said the outcome resulted from retaining market share in a tough year and keeping a tight rein on costs. Software and services now accounted for 58 per cent of revenues and the company intended to invest further in the development of application software in 1993. Overseas operations accounted for almost 30 per cent of revenues, he said.</p>

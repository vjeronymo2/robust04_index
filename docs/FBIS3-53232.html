While about 120 close supporters of the former LTTE deputy  leader were also taken into custody along with him, the Tiger  leader Prabhakaran is also reported to have withheld the powers  of several others including (Tompranga Yogi), (Baby  Subranaigam), as well as, Anton Balasingham. Balasingham's  Australian-born wife (Adel), however, is said to be unaffected.  One-time second in command of the LTTE, Mahattaya was taken  into custody by the loyalists of the Tiger leader Prabhakaran  following the death of Sadasivam Krishnakumar, alias Kittu, in  January last year. The death of Kittu occurred in an explosion  on board an arms smuggling vessel intercepted by the Indian  Navy. It was blamed on Mahattaya.    According to reports from the North, a section of the  people,  especially of the fishing village of Valvedditturai where both  Mahattaya and Prabhakaran were born, believe that Tiger leader  Prabhakaran was wrong in sentencing Mahattaya for treason. Many  hail Mahattaya as a great leader who held the LTTE together at  the time when Prabhakaran was in hiding in India.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from 14 June PASASON: "New Era of Laos-Myanmar </F> Relations and Cooperation"]    [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] General Than Shwe, chairman of  the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] of the Union  of Myanmar [Burma], and delegation paid an official visit to the  LPDR from 9 to 13 June 1994 at the invitation of H.E. Nouhak  Phoumsavan, president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  [LPDR]. H.E. Gen. Than Shwe and his delegation were accorded an  honorable welcome by H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan and the  Lao people in all places they visited. H.E. Gen. Than Shwe and  the delegation called on Khamtai Siphandon, chairman of the Lao  People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee, in a cordial and  friendly atmosphere. They also visited various places of  economic, historic, and cultural significance in the capital,  Vientiane Province, and Luang Prabang Province.    Official talks between H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of  the LPDR and delegation, and H.E. Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of  the SLORC of the Union of Myanmar, and delegation were held at  the Hokham Presidential Office in Vientiane. The two sides  informed each other of outstanding situations in their  respective countries during their talks, which proceeded in a  good atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding.  They also exchanged views on international issues of common  interest. The two sides expressed satisfaction over the  increasing development of good relations of friendship and  cooperation between the two countries of Laos and Myanmar. This  development has been shown concretely through the exchanges of  high-level delegations, the exchanges of visits between the  peoples, and the settlement of various problems between the two  countries on the basis of sincerity and mutual understanding.    Noteworthy is that following the visit, the Government of  the  LPDR and the Government of the Union of Myanmar have jointly  signed three agreements -- namely the agreement on tourism  cooperation between governments of the two countries, the  agreement on the establishment of joint commission for bilateral  cooperation, and the agreement between Government of the LPDR  and Government of the Union of Myanmar on the permanent  international boundary between the two countries along the  Mekong River. These three agreements serve as a firm basis and  mark a historical milestone for the further and fruitful  enhancement, promotion, and expansion and the long duration of  the existing, good relations of friendship and cooperation  between Laos and Myanmar. The signing of the three agreements  has proved the intention and desire of the two sides to promote  and strengthen the relations and cooperation between the two  countries on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual  benefit, and complete respect of each other's sovereignty.    The success of the SLORC chairman of the Union of Myanmar  and  his delegation during this official visit to the LPDR marks the  opening of a new era -- an era for the further strengthening,  ever more profoundly and extensively, the relations and  cooperation between the two countries and the fraternal  friendship and affection between the two peoples of Laos and  Myanmar. The Lao people would like to wholeheartedly hail the  glorious success of the visit on this occasion. They pledge to  do their utmost, together with the Myanmar people, to contribute  to further developing the existing, good relations of friendship  and cooperation between the two countries and fruitfully  implementing the agreements on cooperation in various fields as  already signed by the governments of the two countries. This  will bring about concrete benefit to the two peoples of Laos and  Myanmar and contribute to promoting and establishing peace,  stability, friendship, and cooperation for development in this  region and the rest of the world.</p>

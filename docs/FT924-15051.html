			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ldn &amp; Manchester premium income rises LONDON &amp; Manchester, the life assurance group, has increased its interim dividend by 5 per cent, from 4.428p to 4.65p, after announcing a 13 per cent rise in premium income in the first half of 1992. On an annualised basis home service division premiums increased by 14 per cent and pensions rose by 36 per cent, offsetting a 21 per cent fall in new business generated by the company's life broker division. Mr John Thomson, chairman, said the strong performance by the home service division - the company's traditional sales force - demonstrated 'the capacity of this mature but vigorous business to deliver sustained and significant real expansion despite the severe recessionary climate.' In the six months new annual premiums, however, fell to Pounds 23m, against Pounds 25m. 1m and Pounds 50.4m for 1991 as a whole, while new single premiums rose to Pounds 92.1m, compared with Pounds 33.2m and Pounds 11.6m for the year. Overall premium income amounted to Pounds 174m (Pounds 115.1m). New business generated by the life broker division fell 30 per cent to Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 12.3m), but premiums earned by the home service ordinary life rose to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 4.2m). Home service industrial life annual premiums increased to Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 4m) and pensions to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4.6m). The group also announced that provisions against losses on its mortgage lending had been strengthened to reflect the continued weakness of the residential property market. Mr Thomson said that 'the impact of the prolonged and deep recession has continued unabated' within the group's non-insurance property-related businesses. 'The management of the virtually closed book of residential mortgage business has been especially onerous, in the face of a housing market characterised by continually falling values and moribund turnover levels.'</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BLACK RAIN' A BLAST OF FIERY RAZZLE-DAZZLE  </P> <P> In "Black Rain" (citywide), director Ridley Scott and his team pump in so much  pyrotechnic razzle-dazzle that the movie becomes a triumph of matter over mind.  It's a blast of pure sensation, shallow but scintillating, like a great rock  melody, superbly produced, where the music pumps you up even as the lyrics drag  you down.  </P> <P> "Rain" focuses on a macho cop from Manhattan who runs head-first into two sides  of modern Japan: the rigid formalities on top, the crazy danger of the  underworld below. It's more movie culture-clash, with Michael Douglas' rude and  surly Nick Conklin, the ultimate fish out of water, trying to blast his way  through an Asian sea of red tape to recover an extradited murderer, while the  city around him becomes the movie's dominant character.  </P> <P> This material has rich potential. It suggests current American paranoia about  Japan's emerging economic supremacy, as well as the skewed modern visions of  the new high-tech Orient in Juzo Itami films like "The Funeral" or "A Taxing  Woman." But the story is standard '80s shtick: boy meets killer, boy loses  killer, boy gets killer. The screenwriters, Craig Bolotin and Warren Lewis,  show little inspiration. They seem to have transplanted bodily Don Siegel's  1968 "Coogan's Bluff" -- in which Clint Eastwood was a brusque Arizona lawman  chasing a crazy extradited criminal all over New York -- and juiced it up with  a lot of yakuza movie bits and a doomed cop buddy named Charlie (Andy Garcia).  Charlie figures in the script's nadir of invention, a dopey scene where he  plays torero with his jacket to a gang of maniacal motorcycle punks.  </P> <P> The yakuza references are deliberate. Ken Takakura, the Eastwood of that genre,  is cast here as the representative of old-style Japanese decency and honor: a  cop assigned to help Conklin. He seems to be the only sane man in the entire  movie, the foil for Conklin's belching rage and his what-the-hell approach to  law enforcement. Takakura plays him with dignity and restraint -- even when he  and Andy Garcia do their big male-bonding number, a duet to Ray Charles'  "What'd I Say" in an Osaka nightclub.  </P> <P> But Scott and his visual team -- including cinematographer Jan De Bont and  production designer Norris Spencer -- give this unimaginative plot a dazzling,  dangerous, overwhelming surface. The images seem to explode right in your face:  a coruscating cabaret street that looks like pop Dante, towering angular  skyscrapers poking like huge computer blocks into a misty black-night sky  aflame with neon, a factory shooting off iridescent sparks, a weird modernistic  golf range jutting over the edge of the city, huge plumes of Scott's trademark  mist spilling out into the black, rain-slickened streets.  </P> <P> Scott may have composed more knock-out frames per movie than any other modern  director, and "Black Rain" knocks your eyes out all over again. It's  hellaciously gorgeous. Much of this movie was actually shot in Osaka, but  somehow Scott seems to have found part of the world he helped imagine in "Blade  Runner": a huge, multimedia hybrid of a city that promiscuously smears together  West and East.  </P> <P> In "Blade Runner," Scott, Laurence Paull and Jordan Cronenweth seemed to have  invented a new visual style: a kind of film noir refracted through the  voluptuously mechanical imagery of movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey." It  became film noir cubed: a world in which night, rain, rot and melancholy  shadows mingled with blazing neon and super-electronic gadgetry, where those  dark "Citizen Kane" camera angles had gone kaleidoscopic and hot. Here, Scott  re-creates the same kind of imagery, minus the rot. You don't watch this movie,  you get drenched in it.  </P> <P> Douglas, who's played great, smooth, shifty slicksters in his last two movies  -- the stock-manipulator Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street" and the adulterous  lawyer of "Fatal Attraction" -- seems to be liberated here. He gets to snarl at  everyone, wear leather and get gutty, honest, and low-down. It's a big, sexy,  swaggeringly self-confident movie-star performance, and it plays nicely against  the crisp, knife-like work of Garcia, Takakura, Yusaku Matsuda (the young  killer) and the others.  </P> <P> But Nick isn't really a character. He's another archetype, a stubble-faced  superman who's usually right and whose battering-ram tactics are better suited  to running down psychos than the slow-but-steady style of the local police.  It's hard to take seriously the idea, which the movie suggests, that he's  learned anything from this culture -- other than to be fond of Ken Takakura --  because the cops we see are tradition-bound fuddy-duddies and the yakuzas are  weirdos or rich, conniving scum, and the only girl Nick flirts with is Kate  Capshaw as a bar hostess from Chicago.  </P> <P> "Black Rain" is not an anti-Japanese film. (The title, which Shohei Imamura  also used for his most recent film, refers to the rain that poured on  Hiroshima.) But it suffers from the same problem as 90% of the big movie  thrillers these days. It divides its characters between the superhuman, the  inhuman and the irrelevant -- with an occasional Kate Capshaw. The movie's  penultimate scene, its idea of a grand ethical resolution, works viscerally  because of the force of the editing and the grandiose bravura of the last big  action scene. But it's feeble on reflection: more market-researched morality  from the Jaffe-Lansing producing team.  </P> <P> Still, action movies are one genre where cliches can be transcended and  execution can triumph over content. That's what happens here. "Black Rain"  (MPAA-rated R for sex, violence and language) has a sheen and pace that puts it  in the high class of glossy new urban thrillers like "RoboCop," "Die Hard" and  "True Believer": mad, overheated, overviolent movies that keep driving up over  the top and taking you with them. Ridley Scott makes you see the world in new  ways. When he and his colleagues are cooking visually, they're in a class by  themselves. Even with an albatross of an action script around their necks, they  can make the world hot, fantastic, wild, make the ragged skies split open, make  hell come raining down.  </P> <P> 'BLACK RAIN'  </P> <P> A Paramount Pictures presentation of a Jaffe/Lansing Production.

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Exploration by Amoco directed overseas AMOCO, the Chicago-based energy group, has underlined the trend in the US oil and gas industry towards keeping a tight rein on capital spending and directing more funds to projects outside the US. Amoco said it planned to spend Dollars 3.2bn on capital investment and exploration next year, a budget that is largely unchanged on the spending level authorised for this year. Some Dollars 1.85bn of this amount will be devoted to exploration and production, of which 70 per cent, or some Dollars 1.3bn, will be outside the US. Last year, the company spent Dollars 1.275bn on exploration and production overseas. A growing number of US oil and gas companies have decided recently to redirect exploration efforts away from the US. This trend results partly from congressional and local restrictions on drilling offshore of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Last July, Amoco announced cost-cutting plans to take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or 16 per cent, by the end of next year. In the first nine months of this year, Amoco's net income was Dollars 222m, compared with Dollars 1.33bn in the same period of last year.</p>

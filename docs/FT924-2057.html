			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Observer: Bunkered Armed with the correct postcode but not much else, the British Post Office has successfully delivered a Christmas card to a colleague; the envelope showed the recipient's name and title misspelt, omitted the Financial Times altogether and lodged us in Warkbridge rather than Southwark Bridge. The signature inside was illegible but scrutiny of the envelope revealed that it had come from the office of Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chief executive of Volkswagen. VW may have produced the 1992 car of the year with its new Golf, but it has some way to go before it can qualify for communicator of the year.</p>

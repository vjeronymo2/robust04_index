			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / House sale lull hits land prices: Inland Revenue report says improvement in property market has petered out Rapid increases in housing land prices seen earlier this year have slowed considerably as the expected housing market upturn has failed to materialise, says a report by Inland Revenue valuation officers. The findings of the Revenue's district valuation officers provide one of the most comprehensive guides to the health of the residential, commercial and agricultural property markets. Their latest report shows that 956,000 property transactions, mostly house sales, were notified to the Revenue in England and Wales in the first nine months of this year - 10 per cent more than in the corresponding period last year. The valuation office said that in spite of this improvement 'the purchaser is still very much in command of the market, making for predominantly static prices in all parts of the country'. The pace of improvement, moreover, had slowed as a sharp increase in sales activity in the spring was followed by an earlier than usual summer lull. This trend had continued in the autumn with reported transactions 6 per cent lower in September than in the corresponding month last year. The report says the number of housing transactions is at a level last seen in 1980, with purchases being dictated by necessity rather than desire. House prices had seen very little increase, with average housing values in England and Wales rising by just 1.3 per cent in the 12 months to the end of October. The valuation office said: 'The regional markets show very little variation, with the majority exhibiting only marginally higher values over (the previous) six months.' Only Wales, south-east England and outer London had shown 'overall increases of any substance'. The slowdown in the housing market in the summer and autumn has led to a corresponding reduction in the pace of housing land price increases, which rose sharply earlier this year. The report says: 'The increased activity seen in the previous reporting period appears to have subsided now that the anticipated upturn in the housing market has not materialised.' Builders were continuing to restock with land but were no longer 'prepared to bid up prices except in favoured locations such as the Home Counties, where marked increases in value have been seen for sites within striking distance of the M25'. There were also big differences in land price movements between northern and southern regions of England. Increases in north-west and northern England had been limited. The market in the southern half of the country, by comparison, had generally been buoyant apart from 'pockets of inactivity where employment in long-established industries has declined such as at English China Clays in St Austell (Cornwall)'. The Revenue said yesterday: 'Overall district valuers are of the opinion that an upturn in the housing market is a prerequisite of any further improvement in the resi-dential building land market.'

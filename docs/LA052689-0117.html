			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUZUKI DECIDES TO PUT ITS AD ACCOUNT UP FOR GRABS  </P> <P> Suzuki has hit the road for a new advertising agency.  </P> <P> The Japanese auto maker, which has still not recovered from year-old safety  concerns over its Samurai sport utility vehicles, said on Thursday that it was  placing its estimated $15 million to $30 million advertising business up for  grabs.  </P> <P> Suzuki sales have nose-dived since last June when Consumer Reports harshly  condemned the Samurai as being prone to roll-overs and asked for a recall of  all Samurai vehicles. The federal government later found that the Samurai was  no worse than the average utility vehicle in its class.  </P> <P> Instead of recalling its vehicles, however, the Japanese importer is recalling  its Los Angeles ad agency, Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. The agency has created Suzuki  ads -- such as billboards with the headline, "A Cure for the Car Sick" -- since  Brea-based American Suzuki Motor Corp. began importing the vehicles into the  United States four years ago.  </P> <P> "When Suzuki first entered the U.S, it looked for an ad firm without automotive  experience so they could bring a fresh perspective," said Laura Segal, a  spokeswoman for Suzuki. "But Suzuki is changing and expanding its product line,  and that may require something different."  </P> <P> Although Keye/Donna was asked to participate in the review, the agency has not  responded to that request. "We want to take a few days to think about it," said  Leonard Pearlstein, president of Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. "I can tell you, we  were surprised by their decision."  </P> <P> It is not all that unusual, however, for troubled businesses to blame their ad  agencies for their problems. And Suzuki has plenty of them. Sales of its  Samurai dropped nearly 89% in the first quarter of 1989, compared to the first  quarter 1988. That's 1,914 Samurais sold during the period this year, compared  to 16,783 during the same period last year.  </P> <P> Several ad industry executives said they now expect that beleaguered Suzuki  will name a new agency by mid-summer.  </P> <P> "Suzuki's problems are much larger than their ad agency," said Peter Stranger,  president of the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS, which  creates the "Joe Isuzu" ads for American Isuzu Motors Corp. "To punish the ad  agency for this is ludicrous."  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA prices dived, weighed down by fund liquidation in New York, with traders struggling to find any fundamental reason for the drop. Traders said there were no fresh figures on crop sizes and if anything, the recent weather reports of limited rain in West Africa were supportive to prices. 'It looks like stale liquidation - there do not necessarily seem to be any origins around. We certainly seemed to be limited on the upside, but I think the downside potential is limited as well,' one trader said. Some traders were also talking of supply and demand being evenly balanced in the coming season rather than in outright deficit. The weakness of the dollar helped to underpin GOLD on the London bullion market and COPPER on the LME. Copper's cheapness in local currencies could stimulate some consumer interest in European and Asian markets, traders said. This should also be true for other metals but they continue to respond sluggishly to the currency factor, probably because of their relatively high stock levels. New York COTTON was lower at midday, scoring lifetime lows for the fifth straight session, mainly on technically driven selling. Compiled from Reuters</p>

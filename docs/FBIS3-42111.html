He is the co-author of a 1992 newspaper article together  with  chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov on Russia's development of  binary weapons leading to the latter's arrest on charges of  divulging a state secret.    Fedorov who is one of the witnesses in a closed trial in  Moscow, says that there is still a shroud of secrecy not only  about new generation weapons but also obsolete toxic agents  which are no longer produced or have been destroyed either in  part or in full.    Thousands of tons of the Agent Orange type chemical weapons  were produced at a chemical plant in Ufa between 1965 and the  late 1970's, Fedorov said.    He spoke of having evidence that the weapons were tested in  the Primorskiy, Krasnoyarsk and Krasnodar regions and in the  northern Caucasus. These must have been sprayed but the  government is still reluctant to declassify the secret  information, Fedorov said.    In his words, decomposition of the weapons leads to the  formation of dioxins, a substance that is hazardous to human  health.</p>

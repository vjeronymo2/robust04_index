			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: Mieno urges banks to write off bad loans JAPANESE banks should accelerate the disposal of non-performing assets and write off their bad loans, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor warned yesterday. Mr Mieno said Japanese banks were slower than their US counterparts had been to deal with their bad debts. He called on them to more actively strengthen their battered balance sheets. There could be no increase in the overall amount of credit without additional equity, he said. The Bank of Japan is concerned that the banks' strategy to gradually pay for the losses over several years could be a long term constraint on both their profitability and their ability to lend. Speaking to a lunchtime meeting of businessmen in Tokyo, organised by the Yomiuri newspaper group, he said the banking system's bad debts were still manageable. The non performing loans of the country's top banks were Y12.3bn (Pounds 71.92m) at the end of last September, about 3 per cent of their outstanding loans. However, Mr Mieno warned that individual banks which were particularly exposed would face painful restructuring. In a wide-ranging review of the economy the central bank governor said the Bank of Japan was facing a challenge without precedent in the post-war era: to maintain the stability of the financial system while securing non-inflationary growth after the excesses of the speculative bubble economy. Comparing the rate at which Japanese and US banks were clearing up their bad debts, Mr Mieno said Japanese banks needed to step up their efforts and make them public to win back trust in the country's banking system. He emphasised that the Bank of Japan would not offer the commercial banks any quick fixes. 'The banks must resist looking for any easy way out. They must do this through self help,' he said. Mr Mieno said the central bank's role was to create a conducive environment for the banks to restructure, providing liquidity if necessary to support troubled institutions.</p>

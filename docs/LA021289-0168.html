			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAINERS RALLY AROUND LUKAS, LAZ BARRERA;  </P> <P> REPORT OF MORE POSITIVE COCAINE TESTS ON HORSES DRAWS ANGRY REACTION  </P> <P> Incredulity and disbelief ran neck and neck, but outrage outstripped them both  at Santa Anita Saturday as horsemen reacted angrily to the latest drug scandal  to rock thoroughbred racing.  </P> <P> Surprised by revelations that Laz Barrera and Wayne Lukas had become the fourth  and fifth trainers to be accused recently of running horses that later were  found to have had cocaine in their systems, horsemen launched a bitter attack  on the California Horse Racing Board and its handling of the sport's growing  drug problem.  </P> <P> Although inadequate security at Southern California race tracks was frequently  mentioned, it was the state's drug-testing laboratory that received  near-unanimous condemnation.  </P> <P> Several trainers said it was possible that the tests were inaccurate and that  Barrera and Lukas had been wrongly accused.  </P> <P> "Obviously, there's something serious going wrong somewhere," trainer Chris  Speckert said. "Why would those two trainers do it? I mean, there's no reason.  </P> <P> "I think they (state officials) were stupid to bring it out without  investigating it further. Common sense tells you that men like D. Wayne Lukas  and Laz Barrera didn't get where they are today by being stupid. They wouldn't  do something like this.  </P> <P> "Obviously, it all boils down to the testing and the testing laboratory. We go  to the Olympics and we go everywhere else and they have good laboratories and  they spend a lot of money on it. But they (the CHRB) go to this one laboratory  (the Truesdail Laboratory in Tustin) that every veterinarian from way back when  recommended they not use, but they keep using it. . . . They're making  themselves look stupid."  </P> <P> Attempts to reach spokesmen at the Truesdail Laboratory were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> The accusations against Barrera and Lukas followed similar claims against three  other trainers: Laz's son, Albert; Bryan Webb, and, last October, Roger Stein,  who is appealing a six-month suspension and $2,000 fine imposed by the stewards  and upheld by the CHRB.  </P> <P> On Saturday morning, the elder Barrera attended an informal hearing before the  board of stewards at Santa Anita, where stewards said he appeared "crestfallen"  and was quoted as saying, "I've never felt so hurt in my whole life."  </P> <P> Steward Pete Pedersen said the three-man board had learned that Barrera's horse  Endow had failed a post-race urinalysis at Del Mar last summer, and that the  positive test for cocaine had been reaffirmed by a second test performed at  Ohio State University.  </P> <P> No date has yet been set for a formal hearing, Pedersen said, but Barrera will  not be allowed to enter his horses in any race in California, pending the  outcome of that hearing. Owners can switch their horses to another trainer,  however.  </P> <P> Because written confirmation had not been received as of Saturday regarding the  tests that Lukas' horse Crown Collection allegedly failed, also after a Del Mar  race last summer, no action has been taken against him. He has yet to appear  before the stewards.  </P> <P> Albert Barrera's formal hearing is scheduled for Feb. 23. He and Speckert both  said that the sudden spate of positive tests has many trainers worried.  </P> <P> "All the trainers are scared," Barrera said, "because if this happens to people  like my father and Lukas, it can happen to anybody."  </P> <P> The cause of this concern is not only what trainers regard as the suspect  validity of the drug tests, but also the ease with which their horses could be  drugged. Under racing rules, if a horse fails a drug test, the trainer is  responsible regardless of the circumstances. Yet trainers cannot be at their  barns 24 hours a day.  </P> <P> "What's scary is that it could happen to me," Speckert said. "It could happen  to absolutely anybody. That's what's frightening. You've got to watch who you  employ and who you talk to. You could annoy somebody and they can just throw  something in (the horse's feed)."  </P> <P> "There's no security. There's nothing here. I can't lock them up. I can't do  anything."  </P> <P> Added trainer Brian Sweeney: "We run into problems with security in the barn  area. We have a night watchman or somebody here all the time. But if somebody  wanted to do something untoward, all they have to do is just walk down a shed  row. The feed tubs are all along the side."  </P> <P> Trainer Ron McAnally doubts that additional security will solve the problem.  Like Speckert, he believes it could just as easily originate at the laboratory.  </P> <P> "I don't know if more security is the answer or not," McAnally said. "It's  obvious that there is either something going on at the laboratory or there's  something going on in the stable area. . . . "Truthfully, I do not know which,  but I do know one thing: that they should straighten it out as soon as they  possibly can to clear up the bad name for racing. . . .  </P> <P> "It's just knocking down everything we've done for the last 100 years to  improve racing."  </P> <P> Stein said he saw a little humor Saturday in the uproar that came after the  linking of Laz Barrera's and Lukas' names to cocaine.  </P> <P> "To see the outrage of the horsemen this morning, all rallying behind two guys  who they know are above reproach, it's interesting," he said. "Because when it  was me, I guess apparently some people thought it was possible.  </P> <P> "But there aren't any horsemen that I've met that would give a horse cocaine.  No trainer, I don't care if he's got one horse or 50, is going to go out on a  limb by using something like cocaine that they know is going to test  (positive)."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Apprentice jockey Fernando Valenzuela rode his first stakes winner Saturday  when he and Sunny Blossom crossed the line first in the $80,850 El Conejo  Handicap. Trained by Eddie Gregson, the brown 4-year-old gelding covered the 5  1/2 furlongs on a muddy track in a hand-timed 1:04 3/5 to win by 2 1/2 lengths  and earn $47,100. Sensational Star, with Russell Baze aboard, was second, a  half-length ahead of Alex Solis on Prospector's Gamble.  </P></p>

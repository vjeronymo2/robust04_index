			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Angel Leon Cabrera] </F>   [Text] As a consequence of the heavy rains that affected  the eastern part of our country last Sunday [15 May], one  citizen died in Soledad de Mayari, 70 km north of Santiago de  Cuba.    At approximately 1500 on Sunday, 15 May, it began to rain in  Soledad de Mayari. This town, located 70 km north of Santiago de  Cuba, could not imagine that only a few minutes later, the  apparently inoffensive Soledad River would acquire such force.  When things calmed down, it was possible to verify the effects  of such rains. Antonio Pena Barrera, 41, died. Two other people  were injured, and 62 houses were seriously damaged. Almost all  families who live on the banks of the river lamented the loss of  something. Risking his life, one man was able to rescue the yoke  of his oxen. Moreover, 20 km of highway was damaged and a bridge  totally destroyed.    Damages to agriculture and to electricity lines were also  reported. The El Cate dam could not resist the force of the  waters. Only by listening to witnesses can one understand the  scope of the damages. One man who lived here all his life said  this never happened before.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified first witness] I do not  remember anything like this.    [Leon Cabrera] There are others who go even further.    [Unidentified second witness] I have never witnessed  anything  like this in the 45 years I have lived here. [end recording]    The heavy rains lasted a little more than 30 minutes, which  caused the river to overflow. In less than 30 minutes, the rains  caused all this disaster. It is not difficult to suppose, then,  what would have happened if these rains had lasted longer. This  is an important lesson in this recovery stage.</p>

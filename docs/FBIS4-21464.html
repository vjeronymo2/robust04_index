			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Alekhin report in the ``Waste'' column: ``Will the </F> TNT-5's Radioactive Cargo Get Into the Sea of Japan?'']    [Text] The sensitive issues of radiation security are  fairly effective in helping politicians build their image.  Naturally, when local authorities decide to rid their residents  of an enhanced radiation danger source, the latter react to this  as manifestation of special care being shown to them. There is  nothing bad about this, yet it is not always that the best  possible methods are found to resolve such problems.    As RIA Novosti reported, the radiation aboard the TNT-5  tanker, filled with radioactive waste from Pacific Fleet nuclear  submarines, has deteriorated. The vessel, moored at the Zvezda  plant in Bolshoy Kamen Bay, has developed a leak in its  drainage, pipe, and valve system, as a result of which the  radiation level in the aft engine room since the previous check  (on 28 December 1993) has doubled, reaching 1,400  microroentgen/hr.    This conclusion, according to the news agency, was made  yesterday by a team of specialists created on orders of the  Maritime Kray administration. Experts believe that in April-May  the situation could aggravate rapidly; in the end this could  lead in particular to the shutdown of the Zvezda plant, which is  engaged in dismantling nuclear submarines under the START II  Treaty. RIA Novosti also reported, citing Yevgeniy Stomastyuk,  chairman of the Maritime Kray Environmental Protection  Committee, that in order to avoid a major ecological catastrophe  the commission deems it expedient to dump the liquid nuclear  waste aboard the TNT-5 tanker into the Sea of Japan this May.    SEGODNYA's correspondent managed to obtain a comment from  employees at the State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear  and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor], an organization in charge  of radiation safety on a Russia-wide scale. Gosatomnadzor  representatives believe that because matters of ecological and  radiation security come under the jurisdiction of federal  authorities, such a decision by a local commission can be only  of a recommendatory character. SEGODNYA's correspondent also  learned that Gosatomnadzor has decided not to allow the dumping  of radiative substances into the sea but to pump the liquid  waste from the tanker to other vessels which are in good  condition; the TNT-5 itself, after corresponding treatment, will  be towed to a safe place.</p>

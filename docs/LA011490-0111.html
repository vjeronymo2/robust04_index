			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE EDGE OF EMANCIPATION;  </P> <P> IMMIGRANTS: CEAUSESCU'S DOWNFALL HAS LIBERATED ROMANIANS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  WHO HAD TREATED EACH OTHER AS IF THEY WERE SPIES FOR THE DICTATOR.  </P> <P> After 28 years spent in political prisons or under the scrutiny of Romanian  secret police, Nicolae Popa arrived in Southern California expecting to find a  place where he could speak openly about his hatred for communism.  </P> <P> But two days after he settled in Pico Rivera, a fellow Romanian taught Popa his  first lesson about freedom in America: "If you want to have a good life here,  keep away from other Romanians," the 58-year-old electrical contractor said he  was told.  </P> <P> Like others before him, Popa soon realized that, even here, fears of spies and  secret police would continue to foster the mistrust prevalent in his homeland.  </P> <P> The result has been a Romanian community in Southern California that cannot  properly be called a community. In a region where immigrants of all  nationalities manage to recreate the ethnic flavor of home, there is no  bustling Little Bucharest.  </P> <P> Today, however, Romanian immigrants believe their community is on the verge of  an emancipation, mirroring in a smaller way the liberation of their country  after the recent overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu's Communist dictatorship.  </P> <P> For the first time since they settled in Southern California, immigrants say  they are beginning to witness an unprecedented openness. Already Romanians here  who once refused to join anti-communism demonstrations are trumpeting their  pro-democracy sentiments to anyone who will listen in gatherings in Westwood  and on the steps of City Hall. Those who once were afraid to celebrate Mass can  be seen filling church pews, church officials say. And Romanian acquaintances  are embraced instead of greeted with suspicion.  </P> <P> "It is amazing," Popa said. "When many of us left Romania we were kind of  brainwashed. The government told us, 'We will let you leave, but watch what you  do because our hands are long enough to reach you and you still have families  here.' Now, like in Romania, we have no fear. We can talk free against the  government."  </P> <P> Hundreds of Romanian-Americans also have banded together to raise money and  send food, medical supplies and clothing back to their native country.  </P> <P> This, they say, is only the beginning. Today, where there are no support  services, no large Romanian community groups and little information to help  immigrants settle in other countries, they hope one day there will be  organizations and relief services.  </P> <P> An estimated 10,000 Romanians live in the Los Angeles area, scattered in  neighborhoods ranging from Santa Monica to Bell with no definable Romanian  settlements, shopping strips or markets. The only places where more than 50  Romanians could be found together, immigrants say, were the churches.  </P> <P> The one Romanian organization in Los Angeles, the 65-year-old Romanian Cultural  Society, revolves around the Romanian Orthodox Church and church activities.  The group has about 200 members and meets once a month.  </P> <P> Of the three restaurants that serve Romanian food in Los Angeles, only one,  Felicia Zanescu's Hollywood establishment, Mignon, displays a visible sign of  Romanian heritage: the flag of red, yellow and blue hangs on a pole outside.  </P> <P> But until the execution of Ceausescu, good Romanian food such as goulash and  stuffed cabbage was about all Zanescu's customers received. Zanescu did not  chat at great length with her patrons, believing any one of them could be a  Communist spy.  </P> <P> "Not now," she said. "Now I speak freely."  </P> <P> For immigrants like Sorin S. Pricopia, 40, a stunt coordinator in Hollywood who  has lived here for 19 years, the transformation in his home country means he  can now write letters to the editor and sign them without reservation.  </P> <P> In the last few weeks he has written three letters to the editor. In the 18  years before that, he had written only two, he said.  </P> <P> For Greta Lonita, 26, who escaped from Romania when she was 15, the death of  the Communist regime means she can discuss politics on her own telephone. There  will be no more runs to the pay phone because of her suspicions that her home  telephone might be tapped.  </P> <P> And for Nicolae Focseneanu, 44, a dental technician in Huntington Park who said  he used to test each immigrant he met with prickly political questions,  Romania's liberation means he can be less afraid that the person sitting next  to him is a spy.  </P> <P> "Now begins a new era not only for the people in Romania, but for the Romanians  in exile," said Cornel Dumitrescu, the co-editor of New York-based "The Free  World," the largest Romanian newspaper outside Romania.  </P> <P> Said Father Cornel Avramescu, pastor of one of Southern California's largest  Romanian Orthodox Churches, located in Tustin: "Our problem lies with unity in  the mind. That is what we have not had and that is what kept us from becoming  close to one another. Now I believe we truly will learn to be unified."  </P> <P> All immigrants agree, however, that a new cohesive community will not happen  without great effort. Forty-five years of Communist oppression and its  repercussions cannot be shed as simply as an old suit, they say.  </P> <P> "When we have lived with mistrust for a lifetime, it is hard to overnight  become trusting," said Mihail Badica of Bell. "I really hope we will come  together, but when and how, I don't know."  </P> <P> "It is a sad reality among us," said Father Liviu Olah, who is the pastor of  one of Southern California's largest Romanian Baptist Churches, located in  Bellflower. "We have been taught not to talk to one another. We can never know  who is a traitor, or who is a friend. It has been that way for so many years,  mistrust is now second nature to us. It is a reflex."  </P> <P> About 3,000 Romanians are allowed by the U.S. government to immigrate to the  United States each year, according to the Immigration and Naturalization  Service. Many others risked death by immigranting illegally.  </P> <P> The immigrants insist that, at some point, security forces and Romanian spies  picked up their trails and watched them, sometimes even trying to harm them.  </P> <P> Ceausescu's government agents "really worked hard to keep us divided," said the  Rev. Father Alecse Constantin, pastor of the Holy Trinity Romanian Orthodox  Church in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Constantin and other immigrants say Communist agents were seen in California at  church services and small gatherings of Romanians. Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden  Grove), who has aided several Romanians resettling in the United States, said  it is widely believed that the Ceausescu government sent false defectors to  infiltrate Romanian immigrant communities.  </P> <P> The Rev. Georghe Calciu, an Orthodox priest living in Washington who spent 21  years in political prison in his native land and who is regarded by many  Romanian immigrants as their moral leader, maintains that would-be assassins  directed by Ceausescu twice tried to poison him in the last four years. Shortly  before the revolution, he said, he was warned by two FBI agents that Ceausescu  had sent agents after him.  </P> <P> FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez would not comment on Calciu's claims.  </P> <P> Immigrants point to other evidence to support their claims that they were being  watched by Ceausescu's security agents.  </P> <P> Avramescu said that, six months ago, he was visited by a parishioner who told  him she could no longer attend church services because she had been threatened  by secret police while visiting relatives in Romania.  </P> <P> The woman told him she believed her relatives would be harmed if she went to  Mass every Sunday. At most, she said, she could come once a month. But until  the revolution broke out, Avramescu never saw her again. On Christmas Day, the  day Ceausescu was reported to be under arrest, the woman came back to his  church.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody understood what was going on in our country and what it  was doing to us," Avramescu said.  </P></p>

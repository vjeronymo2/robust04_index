			<p>CSO     [Text] ``Not just because of an outlook that this depressed  condition of defense spending will continue for sometime, it is  essential for the Japanese aircraft industry, for the sake of  its healthy development, to do away with the present excessive  dependency on the defense needs, and beef up the commercial  aircraft business side.'' So says a don of a defense-related  organization suggesting a future direction the industry should  take. The total sales of the Japanese aircraft manufacturing  industry was only about &yen; 200 billion in FY93, negligibly  small in contrast to those of the U.S. and European countries.  <H5>  World-class Technology Level </H5>   This is the aftereffect of the ban on any aircraft  production  in Japan ordered by the GHQ for a period of seven years  following the end of WW-II. During the same period, the world  aircraft industry entered the jet age, and a remarkable wave of  evolutions occurred in the aircraft technology. In Japan, all  the aircraft engineers scattered away in every direction and the  transfusion of the tradition was held up temporarily during that  period.    Nonetheless, since the restitution of aircraft production in  1952, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (``MHI'') has been  trying to build up its development and manufacturing  capabilities first through the repairs and overhauls of U.S.  military airplanes, then gradually through fuselage production  subcontracts from U.S. manufacturers, and finally the  development of airplanes on orders from the Defense Agency. Not  only MHI, but also Kawasaki Heavy Industries and  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (``IHI'') learned new  techniques and technologies through license productions from the  U.S. manufacturers and tried to catch up with the rest of the  world. Boeing's top management commented recently that, ``They  have reached the world-class level more or less. In certain  areas, they are even ahead of us,'' referring to the  manufacturing engineering technology, which is, after all,  Japan's forte.    The development of an airplane takes many years and a huge  sum of money, particularly if it is a commercial airplane, and  it is getting out of hands for private enterprises as the risk  and cost of the development of a commercial airplane have become  so enormous due to the increase in the size and the  sophistication of the performance requirement.    As a result, international joint development has become a  standard approach world-wide in order to minimize the  development risks, and secure and expand the market. In fact,  Japanese manufacturers are included in the negotiations for the  development projects of large next generation jet liners and  supersonic planes. Yutaka Hineno, a managing director and the  general manager, the Aircraft and Special Vehicle division,  boasts that his company is ``the world's number one when it  comes to the fuselage production which includes aerodynamics and  compound material technology.'' However, for the company which  wants to be No. 1 in everything, the achilles heel of their  aircraft production business is the engine.    A high ranking person of the Defense Agency said, ``Pratt  &amp;  Whitney, General Electric and Rolls Royce are the `Yokozuna  (grand champions of Sumo wrestling),' and Snecma [phonetic] of  France is an 'Ozeki (second ranking in the senior grade).' IHI,  the Yokozuna of Japan, is probably considered a 'Maegashira  (fifth ranking in the senior grade)' in the world ring. That  means that MHI should probably be considered a Jyo-nidan (the  second from the bottom of the junior grade).'' The basic  principle of the jet engine hasn't changed for the last 50 to 60  years. In other words, there hasn't been any technological  breakthrough, but rather, it has been a slow process of  evolution accumulating improvements bit by bit; therefore, the  experience is what really counts in this area. ``It is an area  where it is extremely difficult to catch up and surpass the  forerunner overnight,'' according to the same person in the  Defense Agency.    Hineno, upon hearing this allusive analysis, grinned and  said, ``it is a bit too harsh for anyone to call us a Jyo-nidan,  but we hope to join the senior grade and be able to compete with  IHI, though san-yaku (yokozuna, ozeki and sekiwake) are out of  reach for the time being.'' MHI chose the fuselage when  reentering the aircraft business after WW-II, as they figured it  was too much to pursue both the engine and the fuselage. Under  the government's administrative guidance, it was IHI's destiny  to find a way to become a manufacturer dedicated to the engine  since then.  <H5>  Expectation on YSX </H5>   As to the future direction, Hinone stressed that, ``It has  been agreed that our share will be increased from 5% to  10% in  a large engine joint development project with P&amp;W; in  addition,  we are hoping to be involved in the subassembly developments  through an enhancement of our alliance with them. Also, since we  believe that we are a part of the world-class san-yaku when it  comes to small engine technologies, we will seek a leading role  in the specific field based on our unique and superior  technologies,'' suggesting that they will be after a two-tier  policy of developing small engines as well as large engines.  However, the scale of their commercial aircraft business is only  a little over &yen;40 billion, or slightly less than 10%  of the  Aircraft and Special Vehicle division. In addition, the sharp  yen appreciation in the recent months has caused them a  substantial foreign exchange loss, so that a spokesman admits  that the business is ``not necessary in red, but it is quite  tough to make any money.'' Nonetheless, a substantial market  growth is expected for them so that its importance is undeniable  while the defense business is shrinking. It is quite interesting  to see what happens in the small jetliner ``YSX'' (seating 75  passengers) development project in which Japan is assuming the  leadership asking overseas manufacturers to participate in the  project, as MHI is expected to assume the leader company's role  in the project.</p>

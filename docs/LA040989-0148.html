			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO HANDLE HAZARDS POSED BY 'MAGIC MINERAL'  </P> <P> Asbestos has not been banned. A few uses are outlawed and others have been  discontinued. But some asbestos products are still on the market, and most  homes and other buildings more than 10 years old contain some asbestos.  </P> <P> Experts say there are a number of things that homeowners should keep in mind  about asbestos.  </P> <P> The mere presence of asbestos is not a problem. As long as asbestos materials  are intact and unable to release lung-damaging fibers, they are safe.  </P> <P> Asbestos is dangerous only when it is worn or damaged, or is disturbed by  remodeling or repairs.  </P> <P> Cutting, sanding or puncturing asbestos-containing materials should be avoided.  And homeowners should check asbestos items from time to time to make sure that  they're in good shape.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Avoiding Dust  </P> <P> If debris from broken asbestos has spilled to the floor, it should be carefully  wet mopped to avoid raising dust. It should never be swept or vacuumed, as the  microscopic fibers may pass through the vacuum and into the air.  </P> <P> Knowing what is and isn't asbestos is the hard part. It is often found in  insulation around pipes and near heating sources, in certain ceiling tiles and  plasters, and in some types of floor tile.  </P> <P> But over the years, it has been used in hundreds of products, and few asbestos  products are labeled as such. The manufacturer or installer may know, and  experienced plumbers, electricians or heating contractors may make reasonable  guesses. But the only sure way to determine the presence of asbestos is to have  a sample tested by an analytical laboratory. These are usually listed in the  Yellow Pages.  </P> <P> However, do not break off a hunk of suspicious-looking material just to take a  sample. This could create a hazard that did not exist before. If the material  is already damaged, it may be possible to gently wet it and take a small  sample.  </P> <P> It is best to call a trained professional who knows how to sample asbestos  without raising dust.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finding Consultants  </P> <P> There are consultants who inspect and sample homes for asbestos and give advice  on how to handle remodeling and repairs. Some advertise in the Yellow Pages and  others are known to real estate brokers.  </P> <P> But asbestos consultants aren't licensed in California and should be asked to  show proof of training.  </P> <P> Professional industrial hygienists may also perform asbestos inspections. The  American Board of Industrial Hygiene will provide a free list of members. Write  the board at 475 Wolf Ledges Parkway, Akron, Ohio, 44311, or call (216)  762-7294. Members must be college graduates with degrees in industrial hygiene,  engineering or a related field with at least five years experience in  industrial hygiene.  </P> <P> Some asbestos consultants work for or with an asbestos abatement contractor who  removes or seals asbestos. Before hiring an asbestos consultant or hygienist,  ask that he or she disclose any such ties.  </P> <P> California licenses asbestos abatement contractors, who must have at least one  key employee pass a certification exam. Abatement contractors must also  register with Cal-OSHA, the job safety agency, giving proof of worker training  and safety equipment.  </P> <P> A list of abatement contractors in good standing can be obtained by writing the  Contractors State License Board, Asbestos Information, Box 26000, Sacramento  95826. A list of Cal-OSHA-registered contractors can be obtained from the  Carcinogen Unit, California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, Box  603, San Francisco 94101, or by calling (415) 557-2037.  </P> <P> The contractor license and Cal-OSHA registration aren't guarantees of quality  work. The skill, care and training of asbestos abatement crews varies  considerably. Before hiring an abatement contractor, check with prior  customers.  </P> <P> The EPA and U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission can answer questions and  provide free brochures on asbestos in the home. Write the U.S. EPA Information  Center, 215 Fremont St., San Francisco 94105, or call (415) 974-8076. Call the  Consumer Product Safety Commission at (213) 251-7464. MYRON LEVIN  </P></p>

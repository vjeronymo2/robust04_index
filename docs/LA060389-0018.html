			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT WENT AROUND FINALLY CAME AROUND FOR RACING'S UNSERS  </P> <P> I respectfully suggest that Jim Murray might be better off reviewing old  Hollywood racing movies than irresponsibly sensationalizing the Emerson  Fittipaldi-Al Unser Jr. incident by suggesting that it was anything but an  accident.  </P> <P> Fittipaldi did not intentionally eliminate Unser Jr. for two reasons: (1) To do  so would have been equally dangerous to both; and (2) Fittipaldi is a  gentleman.  </P> <P> More important, neither Unser Jr. nor any of his protective relatives or team  members has blamed the accident on anything but racing.  </P> <P> TEX GUTHRIE  </P> <P> Paradise Valley, Ariz.  </P></p>

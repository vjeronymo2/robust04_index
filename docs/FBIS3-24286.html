This is especially  notable in Ujar Rayon. One of the candidates for membership in  the party's Central Council of this rayon was threatened,  another ANIP member was arrested and beaten by officials of the  law enforcement organs." As N. Imanov stated, local government  organs ordered court medical experts not to take note of the  bodily wounds on these persons. He said further that Shahin  Hummeteliyev, chief of the local police department, gave the  orders for this work. Sh. Hummeteliyev, committing these evil  deeds in the name of high officials in the republic, is acting  arbitrarily in Ujar Rayon. The deputy chairman of ANIP explained  that if this kind of arbitrary action continues, he would  publish the names of the above-mentioned high officials.</p>

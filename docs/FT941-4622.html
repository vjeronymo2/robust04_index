			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Making money out of the wrong terms Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of London Weekend Television, lost his job yesterday - and made some more money. However it was not just the resignation settlement reached after he failed to negotiate acceptable terms to stay on with Granada, the new owners of LWT, that added to his riches. He made another Pounds 46,000 when the market digested the news of his resignation and marked Granada's shares up by 4p, presumably in the expectation that the new LWT chief executive, Mr Charles Allen of Granada, may cut costs more enthusiastically than Mr Dyke. 'We would have liked to have kept Greg Dyke on, but it had to be on the right terms,' said Mr Allen, who has set up shop in the spartan Waterloo room at LWT's Southbank headquarters until the chief executive's office becomes free at the end of this month. The right terms for Mr Dyke, one of the more charismatic executives in commercial television, famous for turning round the fortunes of TV-am, the breakfast broadcaster, by giving greater prominence to a glove puppet called Roland Rat, were essentially that he remained as the LWT chief executive. As the man running a subsidiary of Granada he would have reported to Mr Allen as head of Granada's television and leisure businesses. Mr Dyke, whose jobs have included local newspaper reporter and trainee Marks and Spencer manager, would have stayed if he had been offered oversight of Granada Television as well as LWT and a seat on the main Granada board. Mr Dyke may have lost his job, but even before the effects of the 4p rise in the Granada share price, his stake in the company was worth about Pounds 8.2m. As a result of the successful Granada takeover, one of the oddest but most effective management duos in commercial television is leaving LWT. The 'toff', Sir Christopher Bland, former Guards officer and LWT chairman, will leave at the end of next week some Pounds 14m richer, soon to be followed by Mr Dyke, who has always played up his proletarian origins. Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, will take over as chairman of LWT. Mr Dyke has always insisted that the two were much more similar than appearances suggested. 'We both swear like troopers, have the attention span of a peanut, and like to win,' he said, before it became totally clear that they had lost. The scale of the loss became clear on Friday February 25, the final deadline for the Granada bid. At the 11th hour Sir Christopher and Mr Dyke were offered 4m shares by arbitrageurs at Pounds 8 each, the sort of price they had been arguing the company was worth. After a half-hearted attempt to finance the share purchase they decided to bow to the inevitable, partly because the deal might have cost them several million pounds. In the Waterloo room yesterday Mr Allen was relaxed and conciliatory after a holiday. When he was appointed chief executive of Granada Television 18 months ago after a career in accountancy and general management, it was portrayed as something close to the end of civilisation. He believes he has proved his point that 'the bottom line' and producing an increased stream of quality television are not mutually inconsistent. As with the first months at Granada Television, Mr Allen will spent the next three to six months as hands on chief executive, encouraging staff to come up with a plan for the future and then sticking to it. An unspecified number of jobs will go where there is duplication and overlap between Granada and LWT, but Mr Allen is thinking more in terms of growth and making more programmes than in cutting back. By next year he is thinking of developing an international satellite channel with partners, but calling on the programme strengths and libraries of Granada Television and LWT. By then, Mr Dyke might have a clear idea what he wants to do next. At the moment the speculation runs from chief executive of a bid for a new Channel 5 franchise through managing director of BBC Television (fully occupied at present) to buying Brentford, the football team he supports. More plausibly, some of the City investors who supported Granada in the hostile bid against LWT are now interested in supporting financially whatever Sir Christopher Bland and Mr Greg Dyke decide to do next in the media.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Keeping us sweet in the long run - NutraSweet's decision to sponsor the London marathon is part of a broader strategy At first glance, it seems odd that NutraSweet this week opted to sponsor the annual London marathon. After all, the company - which makes low-calorie sweeteners - has only ventured into sponsorship deals twice before, for tennis in the US and ice-skating in Europe. NutraSweet's European operation - with its headquarters in Switzerland  - is a joint venture between the US company of the same name and Ajinomoto, the Japanese life sciences company. It started marketing its product in the UK in 1983. Ewan Currie, NutraSweet's marketing director in Europe, says the marathon sponsorship deal is partly a public relations exercise to mark a decade's trading in the UK. But the drive to boost an already successful brand name is fuelled by increased competition on the horizon; marketing strategy is coming to the fore. NutraSweet is the brand name given to a combination of two amino-acids which, in contact with saliva, taste like sugar. Indeed NutraSweet claims its formula tastes more like the real thing than saccharin, cyclamate or other chemical low-calorie sugar substitutes. First developed in 1965, NutraSweet gained US regulatory approval in 1981, followed by UK approval in 1983. Since then the company, which in the US is owned by Monsanto, the agri-chemical giant, has ballooned. Now sold in 90 countries, NutraSweet is poised to take advantage of opening doors in leading European markets. Currie bases his expansionary hopes on the experience in the UK; in 1991, 27 per cent of all soft drinks sold in the UK were low-cal, and NutraSweet's share of that market is about 20 per cent. In Europe, the average person annually consumes 25-85 litres of soft drinks; in the US that figure is a huge 180 litres. Moreover, in the US 30 per cent of all soft drinks are low-cal and NutraSweet supplies almost 100 per cent of that market. The only other permitted sweetener in the US is saccharin, but all products using saccharin are required by the Food and Drugs Authority to carry a health warning. In Europe, NutraSweet's upward path was blocked until this year; low-cal soft drinks in Italy and Spain account for no more than 3 per cent of the market. Regulatory approval - in France in 1988, Germany 1990, and in Italy and Spain this year - is now opening the way for expansion. In European markets where NutraSweet is available, it has proved popular, and to meet growing demand, it intends building a factory at Gravelin in France. NutraSweet has become an international brand in just over a decade, with Dollars 900m (Pounds 452m) annual turnover in 1991, Dollars 85m of that in Europe. Market leaders in many countries now formulate products with 100 per cent NutraSweet, including Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi and Schweppes slim-line tonic. But that growth has been fuelled not just by a successful product. A variety of marketing strategies - including placing the NutraSweet logo on products which use it as an ingredient - has boosted both its brand profile and that of the main product. NutraSweet as an ingredient currently has its logo on more than 2,000 products internationally. Currie gives an example: 'We gave a test group a sample. We poured half a can of Diet Coke in one glass and half of the same can in another and said 'here are two different versions of Diet Coke to try'. The result was that 56 per cent said they preferred the version with the NutraSweet logo, 39 per cent chose the other, with no NutraSweet logo. Of course Diet Coke is a tremendously powerful brand name but even with that we can make a contribution to perception of the product.' Thus Currie hopes that the Pounds 4m NutraSweet is spending on sponsoring the London marathon for the next two years will boost his company's brand profile and that of manufacturers which use it. NutraSweet spends Dollars 10m a year on pan-European advertising but backs that up with continuous consumer research and samplings; the first UK television advertising campaign, in 1985, was supported by samples sent out to 8m homes. But NutraSweet is facing the prospect of increased competition. The US patent on NutraSweet expires in December, and four other types of sweeteners are awaiting US Food and Drug Administration approval - sucralose, acesulfamine-K, alitame and cyclamate, with the likelihood that sucralose - (by McNeil Speciality Products, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson) will gain FDA approval first. There are two technological means by which NutraSweet could face down the competition. One is the technologically tricky problem of finding an effective bulking agent to use in chocolate and confectionery. Removing sugar from confectionery removes not just calories but also bulk. A less intractable area concerns baking. Manufacturers of baked products looking for low-cal ingredients to replace sugar find that baking separates NutraSweet's amino-acids, defeating the chemistry which lies behind its success. Although NutraSweet is now developing NutraSweet 2000, which Currie promises will be up to 20,000 times sweeter than sugar (against NutraSweet's 180 times) and will not break down during baking, it needs to capitalise on its brand name while the competition gathers pace. Marketing initiatives - like the London marathon - are part of its strategy to stay ahead of the pack.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / World fund managers phlegmatic about fall TECHNICAL analysts in London suggested that the Nikkei could fall another 5,000 points, although fund managers around the world were more phlegmatic. In London, Mr Patrick Thompson, a director of Fleming Investment Management, said that Fleming had hoped that the index could hold 20,000. 'But on the day,' he said, 'domestic sentiment was completely shot.' Mr Thompson thinks that, under 20,000 on the Nikkei, and certainly at 19,000 or below, Japanese equities will start looking cheap by their own historic standards, and by reference to the domestic bond market. However, he also thought that domestic buyers would need encouragement, in the shape of further interest rate cuts and a greater degree of fiscal stimulus than the economy has seen so far. Mr Peter Widmer, director of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich responsible for international institutional asset management, did think the market could go lower: 'The drop below 20,000 will obviously have a short-term impact,' he said. 'There could be a sell-off - perhaps 10 per cent  - leading to buying opportunities. Mr Widmer said Baer had about a third of the equity portion of its portfolios in the Tokyo market at its peak, but that now it had virtually nothing, expect for some lingering positions in Swiss franc convertibles. 'A lot of stocks have dropped by 60 to 70 per cent so we are actively looking for jewels. Corporate results will be lousy, not only those announced in the next month or so, but also in September. Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company in the US, said that it, too, did not have much to worry about. Mr John Hickling, who manages Fidelity's international growth and income fund, said: 'I've been very dramatically underweight in Japan for some time. 'A lower stock market would make Japan more interesting to us, but right now it's a bit like catching a falling knife - sometimes it's safer to let it stick in the ground than to catch it in mid-air." Looking ahead, Mr Hickling expects a little weakness in the Japanese market through March until funds start trading for settlement in April, when there should be some sort of a bounce.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Betting on a new future Almost 10 years after it struck the Soviet Union glasnost has finally arrived at Ladbroke. The new openness may not persuade everyone; a wealth of information can be used to distract as well as inform. The 'new' management has also been around for a while - the chairman and chief executive have spent a combined total of 27 years on the board so far. Shadows of the optimistic accounting practices which used to worry investors can still be dimly seen. Last year Texas Homecare was claiming rebates which had not yet been paid by suppliers. It had also sold and leased back properties in 1992 which will increase occupancy costs this year. Ladbroke's switching of Pounds 200m of foreign currency loans back into sterling after black Wednesday may have prevented further strain on the balance sheet but crystallised losses. Still, it would be churlish to cavil at a genuine attempt to make a fresh start. The sea change in management's attitude to investors' concerns deserves credit. The board has been strengthened and the dividend rebased at a more down to earth level. Realistic management has been installed at Texas and improvements should be possible even if pressure from B&amp;Q does not abate. Property disposals are now possible into the rising market. Now that difficulties are being tackled goodwill may well support the shares even if the market yield and premium rating do not. But there remains much work to be done restructuring Texas and developing the Hilton brand name with the group's limited capital resources. Perestroika has still to follow glasnost.</p>

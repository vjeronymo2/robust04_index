			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / CBI chief calls for overhaul of lawmaking A call for radical changes in the way parliament drafts and passes legislation was made last night by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Davies, speaking to the European Policy Forum in London, also set out a detailed case for a big overhaul of the way the government handles tax legislation. In a address which echoed the private concerns of many MPs and ministers, he said legislation should be subject to more thorough consultation, better drafting and scrutiny, and the introduction of formal review procedures. His recommendations come against the background of rising concern at Westminster as well as in the business community about the amount of hastily drafted and sometimes ill-conceived legislation passed by MPs. Tory business managers have pointed in recent months to the scores of amendments the government has been forced to make to its own legislation during its final stages in the Commons because it has not been properly drafted at the outset. Mr Davies said that much more intensive consultation with interested parties could avoid 'bad law and expensive ambiguities which have to be resolved in the courts'. Some Whitehall departments consulted effectively and well but, he added, 'but many do not, or do so in an unsatisfactory or perfunctory way'. The government should make space also in the parliamentary timetable for the practical legislation and tidying up measures frequently recommended by the Law Commission. These would be of great assistance to the business community but at the moment were squeezed out by the high-profile bills pressed by Whitehall departments. He cited possible amendments to the Sale of Goods Act and legislation on the Privity of Contract as good examples. The CBI had been consulted on both in the mid 1980s but the government had yet to act. It had similarly done nothing since requesting 'urgent' consult-ation last year on competition law. The CBI believed that a convention should be developed so that governments should be able to set aside time in each parliament for the non-contentious reform of areas of the law. Turning to legislation to implement the annual Budget, Mr Davies said that tax law suffered particularly badly from inadequate consultation. He accepted that policy measures, - designed, for example, to close tax loopholes - had to remain confidential. But there was still ample scope for technical advice to be provided from outside parliament once measures were announced. One solution would be to have separate finance bills - one detailing the chancellor's proposed policy changes and the other, with technical changes to the law. Another improvement would be the publication of a draft bill before its first reading in parliament. Mr Davies said a further area of concern to the business community was the current scrutiny process for European Union legislation in the Commons. While the House of Lords had established an effective select committee on European legislation, MPs did not have a comparable body able to consult with outside interests on draft directives.</p>

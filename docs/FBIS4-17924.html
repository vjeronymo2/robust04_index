			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Totskiy Training Ground"] </F>   [Text] Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian Federation  president's press secretary, has unexpectedly announced that  President B.N. Yeltsin understands the doubts expressed in the  State Duma regarding the advisability of holding joint  Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises at the Totskiy training  ground in Orenburg Oblast. Having studied a pertinent  submission from members of the State Duma, the opinions of  deputies and military experts, and the assessments of the  opposition, the president has instructed the Ministry of Defense  to hold additional consultations with the U.S. side regarding  this issue and to reconsider the matter with due regard for both  the stance of the Russian lawmakers and comments made in this  connection by the general public.    But meanwhile....  <H5>  Pentagon Pressure </H5>   U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry has called Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and urged him to make efforts to  ensure that the joint Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises  planned earlier by Moscow and Washington go ahead in Orenburg  Oblast This was announced by U.S. Department of Defense  spokesman Kathleen de Laski, commenting on a report from the  Russian president's press service passed to the Pentagon by  ITAR-TASS's Washington desk regarding the possible cancellation  of the joint exercises.    The Russian defense minister noted the concern expressed by  W. Perry regarding the exercises and promised to relay this  concern to the government, deLaski said. As far as we know, the  Russian Government has not yet made a final decision on the  exercises, which are slated for July this year. In the opinion  of the U.S. Government, these exercises will represent a very  good start to broadening contacts between the two states' armed  forces. We naturally hope that the plans to hold them will  materialize.    The cancellation of the joint Russian-U.S. military  exercises  at the Totskiy training ground near Orenburg "would be a blow to  U.S. efforts to develop cooperation with Russia," THE WASHINGTON  POST writes.    According to Pentagon spokesman David [as published] Boxx,  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry regards the joint  exercises as "an important symbolic first step toward  cooperation between the military departments of Russia and the  United States."    Citing a high-level representative of the U.S. Defense  Department, the newspaper indicates that "the issue of holding  the joint exercises, and also Russia's participation in the  Partnership for Peace program, will be discussed next week  during a visit to Moscow by a high-level delegation of Pentagon  representatives who are traveling to Russia for planned  consultations with the Russian side on a wide range of problems  associated with ensuring security."</p>

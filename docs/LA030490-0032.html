			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK  </P> <P> MISSION U.K. -- -- * 1/2  </P> <P> "Carved in Sand"  </P> <P> Mercury/Polygram  </P> <P> The passion, the passion. The horror, the horror. Listening to Mission U.K.  frontman Wayne Hussey sing his dedicated innards out on song after song here,  as if raging with every last gulp of air against the dying of some light or  another, you may find yourself wondering,"Didn't Englishmen used to be  reserved?" Moreover, you may wish they still were after suffering Hussey's  unbridled intensity through 10 unforgiving, aggravated tracks.  </P> <P> In the opening "Amelia," the most unsubtle look possible at father/daughter  incest, the anger Hussey expresses is, of course, justified, if way over the  top for musical purposes. This subject has obviously distressed him so that he  stays in the same mood for the rest of the album, regardless of lyric. Whether  it's realistic, socially relevant rock ("Grapes of Wrath," for the workin' man)  or the plethora of moody love songs embracing tacky mythological imagery  ("Mistress of Avalon cast a spell" and so on), Hussey just sounds royally  ticked off, with few breaks from the relentless gush of indignancy and ardor.

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer Presenter Osokin] In Ukraine, pilots of  Black Sea Fleet missile-carrying Tu-22 aircraft are complaining  they are not being allowed to fly. They say the explanation is  the persistent suspicion of the local authorities. The  Ukrainian Ministry of Defense says the pilots are preparing to  fly the aircraft away to Russia. With the directness  characteristic of the military, the aircrew call these  statements complete and utter lies.</p>

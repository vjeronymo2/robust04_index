			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Murray raises offer for Andrews Sykes Mr Jacques Murray has increased his offer for Andrews Sykes, the industrial services group of which he is chairman, valuing the company at Pounds 10.7m, against Pounds 8.24m previously. European Fire Protection Holdings, the private Netherlands-based company owned by Mr Murray, has increased its offer for the ordinary shares from 50p to 65p and from 12p to 15.6p for the preference shares. The move follows European Fire's latest purchase in the market of a 5.5 per cent stake at 65p a share, taking its total holding, including those acting in concert, to 47.65 per cent. In addition, acceptances have been received in respect of 39,942 shares, or 0.28 per cent. European Fire also holds 8.33 per cent of the preference shares. The shares were unchanged yesterday at 67p. The bid is the culmination of Mr Murray's taking control of Andrews Sykes, which began in May when he and four of his supporters won control of the board at an extraordinary general meeting. In July he replaced Mr David Hubbard as chairman. Andrews Sykes is in the middle of a reorganisation to refocus on its core activities of pumping, heating, air conditioning and hire businesses.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Markets Report: Sharp rise for the dollar The dollar yesterday rose sharply in early New York trading on the back of a strong showing from US bond and equity markets, writes Philip Gawith. Improved sentiment, helped by follow-through buying after last Friday's strong set of employment data, helped the US currency recover from recent lows. It ended in London at DM1.7071 against the D-Mark, from DM1.6788 before the long weekend. By the close of New York trading it stood at DM1.7144. Analysts were cautious, however, about signalling a turnround in fortunes for the dollar, which underperformed expectations during the first quarter. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, commented: 'Price activity in the last few weeks has been a case of two steps forward, three steps back.' Elsewhere, the D-Mark was slightly weaker in Europe, but the pound had a better day, with the sterling index finishing at 79.3 from 78.9 where it started trading. After a quiet start, the dollar rose sharply in the European afternoon when US equity markets opened. A key factor in the US currency's recent weakness has been the uncertainty in bond and stock markets since the Federal Reserve first tightened policy on February 4. But yesterday's rally in New York served as a reminder to the market that there remain good fundamental grounds for believing in a stronger dollar. Principal among these are an interest rate differential moving gradually in the US's favour, as German rates (and most of Europe with them) fall and US rates rise; and a growth argument - the fact that the US is enjoying stronger growth than any of the other leading economies. On the other hand, investors are only likely to believe that the dollar's rally is sustainable when it becomes clear that a measure of calm has returned to US bond and share markets. There is a further uncertainty. Mr Steve Barrow, economist at Chemical bank, comments: 'The market is grappling with the idea of whether stronger US data should be interpreted as good or bad for the dollar.' Logic suggests that strong growth will be followed by higher rates, which should be dollar positive. The alternative view is that strong growth will scare the market into believ-ing that the Fed is playing 'catch-up' in the battle to curb inflation. This perception would harm the dollar. The D-Mark ended generally weaker yesterday under pressure from the stronger dollar. The exception was the French franc, which closed in London at FFr3.416 per D-Mark, from FFr3.414 last Thursday. The Italian lira continued to strengthen as post-election optimism about the prospects for a new government persisted. It finished at L960.8 to the D-Mark from L963.3. The focus of attention in Europe, however, was the Bank of Portugal's defence of the escudo, which fell to a low last week of Es104.60 against the D-Mark. There were two strands to the bank's actions. First, the regular intervention rates, normally announced at the start of each 4 to 14-day accounting period, were suspended. Instead, the bank only offered one-day funds, giving it a much tighter grip over money market conditions. Second, the Es344.1bn that the bank put into the system in this way was offered at interest rates of 13 and 14 per cent, compared to the last regular intervention rate of 10 per cent set on March 28. Although analysts said the central bank's efforts appeared overdone, it succeeded in stabilising the currency, which finished at Es101.8, from Es102.7 last Thursday. But Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International, said sentiment remained negative. Most observers believe the economy (IBJ estimates that GDP shrank by 1.5 per cent in 1993) needs lower interest rates, not higher ones. Indeed, Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva contributed to this perception recently when he said rates could fall by 200 basis points by the end of the year. Also, the escudo is overvalued against the dollar, D-Mark and in terms of its own purchasing power parity, said the IBJ analyst. Conditions remained tight in German money markets, with call money at 5.80/6 per cent, down from 6.75 per cent. Dealers expect the rate to go lower. In the futures market the June Euromark contract firmed by two basis points to 94.57. Sterling finished lower against the dollar, at Dollars 1.4638 from Thursday's Dollars 1.479. But against the D-Mark it rose to DM2.4987 from DM2.4829. Yesterday evening it was trading at the DM2.51 level. The pound's better performance on the back of the dollar helped short sterling futures rally after a very weak start. The June contract closed at 94.47, from 94.53 on Thursday, after touching a low of 94.39 at one stage. The December future finished at 93.91, compared to a low for the day of 93.78 and Thursday's close of 94.03. In the discount market the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 250m shortage with a Pounds 271m round of afternoon assistance.</p>

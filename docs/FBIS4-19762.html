			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "The Time for Other Options"] </F>   [Text] Rauf Denktas' rejection of the proposals by the U.S.  coordinator for Cyprus, who has paid a lightning visit to  Cyprus, must have given a political shock to the White House.  It is not by accident that the new defiance by the Turkish  Cypriot leader came while Tugay Ulucevik, a leading member of  the Turkish Government, was visiting the occupied areas. It is  also obvious that while Tansu Ciller might pretend to President  Bill Clinton that... [ellipsis as published] "she is doing all  she can," Denktas does not give in. This is an old trick, since  it is well known that the pseudostate is being maintained by the  Turkish military presence in the occupied part of Cyprus.    This fact alone shows that if it wanted to, Ankara could  pull  the rug out from under Denktas' feet and lead him by the ear.  However, since nothing like this is being done because the same  old double talk continues and the occupation is perpetuated,  President Glavkos Kliridhis' proposal for demilitarization,  which implies the withdrawal of the occupation troops, has  particular significance.    We expect that the United States, which has openly said it  favors the invasion army's withdrawal, will want to adopt and  promote President Kliridhis' suggestion instead of trying to  resurrect a process that has been killed by Turkish  intransigence. Besides, the occupation of Famagusta, on which  most of the disagreements on the confidence-building measures  are focused, is due to Turkey itself.    Consequently, the alternative measures that should ensue  after Denktas' defiance must include the UN Security Council's  order for the withdrawal of the Attila hordes.    We expect that Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's  forthcoming contacts with President Clinton will focus on these  alternative measures, in full alignment and harmony with the  Cypriot leadership and the whole spectrum of the Greek  leadership.    The primary goal of our political strategy must be the one  which President Kliridhis declared before the opening of the  talks on the confidence-building measures. That is, it must  become evident through specific actions that the Cyprus solution  does not depend on Turkey's desire but on the Security Council's  will.    This goal has become more feasible as a result of the  Turkish  intransigence and filibustering tactics, which underline this  historic necessity.    Every evil has its good aspect. Denktas' provocation through  his defiance dictates that it be confronted practically in the  way we mentioned earlier. President Kliridhis has a strong lead  on this issue and he is also indicating to the world powers the  course that is necessary.    It is inconceivable for this unproductive waiting to  continue  considering that the Security Council has ruled that the current  status quo in Cyprus is unacceptable and must end. Now is the  time for words to become deeds and for the state declarations to  become specific actions.</p>

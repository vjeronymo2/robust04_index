			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "President Again Begs Abroad"] </F>   [Text] The Presiden?, Mr. Sam Nujoma, in Brussels  yesterday, on a working visit to Belgium and the European  Commission, requested that Namibia's present status as ab  underdeveloped country be extended for another five years due to  poor economic development since independence, following the  severe effects of the drought and the global economic recession.    He also applied for a bigger export quota for seedless  grapes  for the European market, assistance with the expansion of the  NBC [Namibian Broadcasting Corporation] transmission network,  and an additional 2 million EC [European Currency] Units for the  completion of the part of the Trans-Caprivi highway funded by  the European Union (EU).    Concerning the issue of underdeveloped status, he said that  this "status" should be granted to Namibia to enable the country  to overcome economic hitches experienced in the first few  critical years after independence, adding that economic  indicators did not reflect changes which the country hoped for.    "We therefore intend to apply for the extension of this  status for the second half of the Lome IV Convention."    President Nujoma said that the country benefited from the  least developed country [last three words in English] status  over the past five years and from the special treatment given to  countries in terms of Article 329 of the Lome IV Convention.  "To my deepest regret expectations were not realized. Namibia  experienced a serious setback because of two unforeseen  developments -- the drought and the global recession which  retarded our economic advancement."    The president made a personal request to the vice president  of the Economic Commission, Mr. Manuel Marin, to support  Namibia's application according to the Lome IV revision  agreements. Mr. Nujoma addressed a luncheon hosted by Mr. Marin.    The President said that Namibia had every reason to be proud  of its relationship with the EU, especially against the  background of the 525 million Namibian dollar aid package  granted to Namibia since independence, in accordance with the  Lome Convention. "The real challenge in dialogue on development  issues between the EU and the ACP countries  (African-Caribbean-Pacific) did not concern the issue of  assistance, but trade -- in particular, the matter of duty free  access of goods destined for the European market."    "In this regard I am reminded of Namibia's request to  deliver  duty free seedless grapes to the European market out of season,  when there will not necessarily be any competition with European  products. The EU's reaction was not exactly encouraging because  the European Commission only proposed a quota of 500 tonnes  while Namibia has the potential to deliver a quota of 5,000  tonnes."    "I am mentioning this particular aspect because it embodies  the spirit of the Lome Convention in that it provides work for  approximately 7,000 people in the south of the country. It also  promotes agricultural and rural development and encourages  private initiative, in respect to private investment in an ACP  country. This bold private sector initiative, supported by  capital from two EU members, namely the United Kingdom and  Germany, must be supported so that it can succeed. I am,  therefore, calling on the commission to reconsider its position  and to create a duty free opportunity for Namibia."    Co?cerning the expansion of the NBC transmission network,  Mr.  Nujoma requested that a consultant be provided to assist with  this task. "It is our dream to put up transmitters countrywide  for the education of our people." -- The ACP group of  developing countries and the European Union are meeting from  today for three days in Mbabane, Swaziland, for the medium-term  revision of the Lome IV aid and trade agreements over 10 years,  to expire in the year 2000.</p>

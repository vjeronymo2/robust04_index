He was seen off at  Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. In an  airport statement, Cetin said that hopeful decisions on  promoting bilateral relations were made during Sunsiri's visit.  Recalling that the Turkish Airlines has three weekly flights to  Bangkok, Cetin added that they have agreed to increase the  number of flights. He noted that decisions have also been  reached to bring together the private sectors, especially the  contracting sectors, of the two countries and to continue  high-level visits within this framework. Cetin said:    [Begin Cetin recording] We believe that if Turkish manpower,  development potential, and experience are combined with the  technology, the rapid development rate, and market quests of  Asian countries, both sides can benefit from the results. No  doubt, within this framework, Thailand is an important country  in its region. Our cooperation with Thailand will greatly  contribute to Turkey's cooperation with that region. [end  recording]    Sunsiri said his visit has been beneficial for bilateral  relations. He added that during his contacts an agreement was  also reached to hold the Turkish-Thai joint economic committee  meeting in Turkey this year. Sunsiri will leave Turkey this  evening.</p>

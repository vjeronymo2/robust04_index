Zlenko, on a two-day visit to Slovakia is accompanied by  Minister of External Economic Relations Oleh Slyepichev,  Economics Minister Roman Shpek and Health Minister Yuriy  Spizhenko.    Zlenko and Moravcik discussed bilateral relations, Ukraine's  possible joining the Central European Initiative and ethnic  minorities' issues.    "We can say that we hold close or identical views on all the  issues discussed," stressed Zlenko who will inaugurate the  Ukrainian Embassy in Slovakia. "In creating future Europe, we  have many common interests such as solution to the ethnic  minorities' issues," Moravcik said.    Slovakia favours resolving the minorities' issue on the  basis  of individual rights, while it refuses the collective rights for  the minorities, including the right to self-rule, as advocated  by Hungary.    Zlenko said that there was no problem with Ukrainians  working  "illegally" in Slovakia now. He added that the situation should  be settled in a legislative way in the future.    There is no problem with the "autonomy for Subcarpathian  Ruthenia," which is being "artificially created," Zlenko said.    The expansion of the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, Hungary and Poland) by Ukraine was not discussed,  Moravcik said.</p>

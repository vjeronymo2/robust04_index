			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Tapie to delay appeal on art seizure Mr Bernard Tapie, the beleaguered left-wing entrepreneur, yesterday delayed until October his legal appeal against the confiscation of his art and furniture collection by Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled French bank that is pressing him to repay his FFr1.2bn (Dollars 225m) debts. Credit Lyonnais late last month sent a team of bailiffs to the Tapie family's opulent townhouse on Rue des Saints-Peres in the Saint-Germain des Pres area of Paris to seize the flamboyant Euro-MP's collection of old master paintings, oriental carpets and 18th century furniture. The art and furniture, acquired in the late 1980s when the nouveau riche demagogue was hailed as one of France's most successful businessmen, has been valued at between FFr350m and FFr500m. Mr Tapie used it to guarantee part of his bank loans. Credit Lyonnais, which is under pressure from the French government to clean up its balance sheet after the announcement this spring of a FFr44.9bn state-backed rescue package, claimed it was seizing the collection after Mr Tapie's failure to repay his debts. The bank signed a five-year repayment agreement with Mr Tapie in March. It revoked that agreement two months later claiming the flamboyant entrepreneur had breached the accord and demanding the full repayment of his loans. Mr Tapie claimed that the bank's action was part of a political plot against him by the centre-right government. He is now suing Credit Lyonnais to try to reinstate the original five-year repayment agreement and to regain his art and furniture. The first hearing for his appeal against the furniture seizure was due yesterday morning. However Credit Lyonnais said Mr Tapie's lawyers had requested that the hearing be postponed until October 7 giving them more time to prepare their case. Meanwhile nouveau pauvre Mr Tapie, who was wont to pose proudly for the paparazzi at the helm of his yacht, now poses with his family in tow muttering altruistically about how material success was never really important to him.</p>

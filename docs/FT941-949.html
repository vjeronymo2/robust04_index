			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Tory split on nurses pay plan Tory MPs are split on the idea of productivity-related pay for nurses, says a survey published yesterday. The survey, carried out for Unison, the health workers' union, suggested that 43 per cent of Conservative MPs thought productivity-related pay was undesirable, while 55 per cent supported it. The poll of 100 MPs showed that 94 per cent of Labour MPs were against the idea. It found that 35 per cent of Tories thought such a system would be bad for morale in nursing, while 54 per cent took the opposite view. But just over half of the Tories believed a productivity-related scheme could be introduced.</p>

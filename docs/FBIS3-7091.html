			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Probolinggo, Mar 23 (ANTARA) -- President Suharto  reiterated Wednesday that Indonesia will be firm in refusing  foreign aid that has strings unfavorable to Indonesian interests  tied to it.    "Should no foreign aid be available because of this policy,  we will be ready to carry on our national development by our own  resources," he said in a speech at the commissioning of the  Paiton steam driven power plant near this East Java town.    The head of state said foreign assistance will remain no  more  than a supplement to the country's national resources and in  future its volume will steadily decrease as these resources  continue to increase.    On the other hand, the president conceded that though the  nation is resolved to carry on its development on its own  strength, "we do realize that foreign assistance could be used  to advantage to further our advancement."    A few years back, Indonesia decided to no longer accept  financial aid from the Netherlands because the donor government  kept tying its assistance to political strings.    The Paiton plant commissioned by the president was  constructed with domestic funding supplemented by foreign  financial assistance amounting totally to RP [rupiah] 2.3  trillion.    Two generator units of the plant, completed in the first  development phase and inaugurated Wednesday, each has a capacity  of 400 MW [megawatts], with fuel need of two billion tons of  coal a year.    Touching on the coal use, President Suharto said the 36  billion-ton coal deposit must be benefited to diversify energy  sources especially because natural oil as the main energy  source, is not renewable.    "Coal will become the main energy source that we can rely on  in the future," He said at the ceremony which was attended also  by the first lady, Mrs. Tien Suharto, the World Bank president,  Lewis Preston, and Minister/State Secretary Murdiono.    Acknowledging that it will need hard work, the head of state  called for a well planned coal use.    He also urged for the participation of private sector in  developing steam power plants (PLTU) in Paiton as well as other  projects. The state electricity company (PLN) plans in the  third stage of the Paiton to build a number of more steam power  plants with a capcity of 1200 x 2 MW respectively, because that  of the second stage whose capacity is about 800 MW will be built  by PLN itself.    By giving a chance to the private sector to develop  electricity, telecommunications and social means projects, the  president said, the government can use its fund for the  development of Indonesia's eastern and western regions.</p>

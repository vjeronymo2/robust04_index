			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Flotations sail into choppy waters: New issues flop on both sides of the Atlantic as investors lose their enthusiasm ONCE MAY be happenstance, twice coincidence, but three times must be enemy action. Merchant bankers, their clients and the underwriters must be distinctly worried after two recent flotations have failed, and might be forgiven for wondering whether there is a concerted buyers' strike against new equity. Last month GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, pulled its flotation because of a lack of investor interest. This week, The Telegraph's flotation flopped with retail investors. The two might be coincidental. But a third failure would suggest that the new issue market, which sprang to life after last month's general election, has died. The pricing of MFI Furniture Group's flotation yesterday at 115p - well below earlier hopes and at a significant p/e discount to the stores sector - showed the company's determination to ensure that the issue succeeded. But in these uncertain markets, eight days between the issue of the prospectus and the close of applications is a long time. The situation is even worse for companies contemplating a rights issue, where the gap between pricing and closing is typically three weeks. Yesterday Marshalls, the building materials group, announced that only 27.8 per cent of its Pounds 20m rights issue had been taken up by shareholders. When that issue was priced on June 9 at 75p, the existing shares stood at 97p. The company must have felt the discount was wide enough to be safe. The MFI issue is a large one, raising Pounds 629m, making it a demanding test for the market. But even that is dwarfed by the sale of shares in Wellcome, the drugs group, to be completed by the end of this month. That is still expected to raise around Pounds 2.8bn for the Wellcome Trust, which is cutting its stake in the company. Wellcome's shares have fallen from 1126p just before the Trust announced early in March that it would sell a large part of its shareholding, to 856p at yesterday's close, up 3p on the day. The Trust seems committed to see the sale through. With three weeks to go, and the formal tendering process not yet under way, it would seem premature to pull the issue when so much work has gone into it. The size and price of the issue can be adapted to suit demand and the Trust is planning to reinvest the proceeds in a market which is getting lower by the day. The fall in the London stock market has been sharp, with the FT-SE 100 index losing more than 200 points, or more than 8 per cent, since the beginning of June. Fund managers note that bad news drives the market down, but good news fails to pick the market up. Even so, they feel that the right company could find buyers at the right price. Whether the price that investors regard as right is acceptable to the company is another matter. But any company contemplating raising equity will think hard before going ahead. Lex, Page 18</p>

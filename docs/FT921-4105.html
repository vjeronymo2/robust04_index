			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Disillusion swells tide of protest votes: France's mainstream parties are likely to be the losers in regional elections WITH less than a fortnight before polling day in the French regional elections, the ruling socialists seem to be failing to reverse a tide which is running heavily against them. Senior ministers have been conscripted to lead the socialist campaign in the 22 regions of France, but their efforts appear to be making no impact on opinion polls. These point to a steep drop in the socialist vote to 20 per cent or less. This compares with nearly 30 per cent in the previous regional elections in 1986, and almost 35 per cent in the first round of the 1988 general elections. The socialist setback does not seem to be doing the traditional conservative parties any good, however, and the main beneficiary is Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme right-wing National Front. The most detailed surveys point to a nationwide tally of 13.5 per cent for the NF, and the latest poll suggests the NF is gaining support. Neck-and-neck with the NF are the two ecological movements. The pattern thus emerging from the polls is of a disavowal of the traditional mainstream political parties in favour of eccentric protest parties. So far, the socialists do not appear to have a clear plan to ward off the impending popular rejection. They have been divided over whether these are genuinely regional contests to be campaigned for regionally, or whether they are really a national contest, in effect a trial run for next year's general elections. Their initial response to the rise of the National Front was to go on the offensive against Mr Le Pen in his home ground in the south of France. The standard-bearer chosen for this offensive was Mr Bernard Tapie, the populist businessman who established his local credentials by buying the Marseilles football team, and by winning a local parliamentary seat. Mr Tapie has expended much of his brash energy, and attracted a lot of media attention, with a stream of insults aimed at Mr Le Pen and his supporters. 'If Mr Le Pen is a bastard (salaud),' he has said, 'those who vote for him are bastards too'. For good measure, Mr Tapie has also been directing his street invective against Mr Jean-Claude Gaudin, the centre-right incumbent chairman of the local Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur (Paca) regional council, whom he accuses of preparing an infamous pact with Mr Le Pen. Mr Tapie's braggadocio seems to have been without effect. The polls suggest Mr Le Pen will break all records in the Paca region, with 27 per cent of the vote, whereas Mr Tapie's list is likely to trail in third with only 18 per cent. Last week he conceded ruefully: 'I was mistaken in my campaign. The electorate of Le Pen is more convinced and motivated, and the others do not feel concerned.' Moreover, the socialist campaign against Mr Le Pen seems to have backfired nationally. It has precipitated demonstrations and counter-demonstrations, and led some local authorities to ban public meetings planned by Mr Le Pen. The resulting uproar has been so much free publicity for the National Front, and even though the mayor of Lyons this week refused to let Le Pen use a local hall, most of the mainstream politicians have publicly conceded that it is better to allow his meetings to take place. One result is that Mr Laurent Fabius, leader of the Socialist Party, has tried to cool political passions by appealing for regional campaigning to take place on regional issues. Local factors, such as the presence of a large immigrant community, undoubtedly play a large part in Mr Le Pen's prospects of success in the south of France. Conversely, the socialists have strong industrial roots in Nord-Pas-de-Calais, one of only two regions which they control, though even here they are on the defensive against the challenge of the ecologists. Yet polls show that most voters are influenced by national considerations, such as unemployment. This is not surprising, because regional decentralisation is only a decade old, and still rather tentative. The biggest share of regional budgets is secondary education and training, but regional responsibilities extend only to the buildings of the secondary schools; education proper is still decided in Paris. As a result, most analysts are treating these elections as if they were a national opinion survey. Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, has led the national campaign with extended apologies for the socialists' eleven-year record in office, and Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, has rebuked the electorate for its failure to understand the strengths of the national economy and the achievements of his economic policy. The strongest proof that this is indeed a national not a regional election is that the party and the government have sent most of the cabinet out on the campaign trail, many of them against their will. But few expect these efforts to make a radical difference to the verdict. Paradoxically, the rise in protest votes could produce perverse results. The mainstream conservative parties can expect to come out in front in most regions, as at present. But as they are simultaneously likely to lose ground in many of these regions, they may have difficulty in putting together regional council majorities. Since they have publicly undertaken not to do deals with the National Front, the deciding voice may well lie with the ecologists. In some cases the ecologists may do a deal with the socialists; so the socialists could increase the number of regions they control, even if their national score collapses dramatically.</p>

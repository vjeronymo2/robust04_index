			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Eurotram unveiled ABB Transportation, Britain's largest train maker, has unveiled the Eurotram, which project manager John Swanson and marketing manager John Clark hope will provide the company with significant orders to replace diminishing train business, Chris Tighe writes. A Pounds 50m order for 26 Eurotrams is nearing completion at ABB's York works for the French city of Strasbourg, where a new tram service will be inaugurated next week. The sleek, glass-fronted vehicle, painted cream and green with a pastel interior, is the first tram to be made at the York works in its 150-year history. Securing more train or tram orders in the near future is crucial for the works. Its orders run out next October when it finishes its last British Rail order, worth Pounds 150m, for 188 Networker commuter trains. The imminent completion of the Strasbourg tram order led to the announcement in September of 289 redundancies, a quarter of the workforce. The jobs will go by the end of this year. ABB believes the electrically powered Eurotram offers it a potentially important market opportunity in Britain and continental Europe.</p>

This requirement shall not apply when the application for credit is turned down within three business days after receipt of the application. A format for the Servicing Disclosure Statement appears as Appendix MS&hyph;1 to this part. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the specific language of the Servicing Disclosure Statement is not required to be used, but the Servicing Disclosure Statement must include the information set out in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, including the statement of the borrower's rights in connection with complaint resolution. The information set forth in Instructions to Preparer on the Servicing Disclosure Statement need not be included on the form given to applicants, and material in square brackets is optional or alternative language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Applicant's Acknowledgement portion of the Servicing Disclosure Statement in the format stated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> is mandatory.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional lines may be added to accommodate more than two applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Servicing Disclosure Statement must contain the following information, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Whether the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold or transferred to any other person at any time while the loan is outstanding. If the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer in a first lien dealer loan does not engage in the servicing of any mortgage servicing loans, the disclosure may consist of a statement to the effect that there is a current intention to assign, sell, or transfer servicing of the loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The percentages (rounded to the nearest quartile (25%)) of mortgage servicing loans originated by the lender in each calendar year for which servicing has been assigned, sold, or transferred for such calendar year. Compliance with this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) is not required if the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer on a first lien dealer loan chooses option B in the model format in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, including in square brackets the language ``[and have not serviced mortgage loans in the last three years.]''. The percentages shall be provided as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) This information shall be set out for the most recent three calendar years completed, with percentages as of the end of each year. This information shall be updated in the disclosure no later than March 31 of the next calendar year. Each percentage should be obtained by using as the numerator the number of mortgage servicing loans originated during the calendar year for which servicing is transferred within the calendar year and, as the denominator, the total number of mortgage servicing loans originated in the calendar year. If the volume of transfers is less than 12.5 percent, the word ``nominal'' or the actual percentage amount of servicing transfers may be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) This statistical information does not have to include the assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage loan servicing by the lender to an affiliate or subsidiary of the lender. However, lenders may voluntarily include transfers to an affiliate or subsidiary. The lender should indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, sales, or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) In the alternative, if applicable, the following statement may be substituted for the statistical information required to be provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section: ``We have previously assigned, sold, or transferred the servicing of federally related mortgage loans.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The best available estimate of the percentage (0 to 25 percent, 26 to 50 percent, 51 to 75 percent, or 76 to 100 percent) of all loans to be made during the 12-month period beginning on the date of origination for which the servicing may be assigned, sold, or transferred. Each percentage should be obtained by using as the numerator the estimated number of mortgage servicing loans that will be originated for which servicing may be transferred within the calendar year and, as the denominator, the estimated total number of mortgage servicing loans that will be originated in the calendar year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If the lender, mortgage broker, or dealer anticipates that no loan servicing will be sold during the calendar year, the word ``none'' may be substituted for ``0 to 25 percent.'' If it is anticipated that all loan servicing will be sold during the calendar year, the word ``all'' may be substituted for ``76 to 100 percent.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) This statistical information does not have to include the estimated assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage loan servicing to an affiliate or subsidiary of that person. However, this information may be provided voluntarily. The Servicing Disclosure Statements should indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, sales or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Republic of Crimea President  Yuriy Meshkov Answers MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS Questions"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Bogomolov] If the Crimeans  vote for the republic's independence, would you risk challenging  Ukraine in order to comply with their will?    [Meshkov] There is no need to do so, because the question of  the referendum has been formulated as follows: "Are you in  favor of an independent Republic of Crimea in a union with other  states?" Note, the word "union" is not capitalized. This is  one part of the answer to your question. The second part is  that the Republic of Crimea has been restored as a subject of  the Union Treaty or, quoting literally: "a subject of the Union  and a participant in the Union Treaty." So, now the republic  can be considered a subject of the Commonwealth of Independent  States. It is from these facts that the top authorities of our  republic had to proceed in their activity, but they did not do  so.    [Bogomolov] That is, legally speaking Crimea may be  considered independent?    [Meshkov] There is a legal framework for that, but in order  for it to receive a requisite confirmation we need to resort to  a referendum.    [Bogomolov] Observers single out two statements of yours  with regard to the Black Sea Fleet problem: that the fleet  should belong to Russia, and that its fate should be resolved at  a meeting between Yeltsin and Kravchuk. Many people see these  two statements as mutually exclusive. Is this really so?    [Meshkov] One does not contradict the other. Under the  Massandra agreement, the presidents in fact agreed that the  Black Sea Fleet belongs to Russia, and it will pay Ukraine  compensation for the part of the fleet that in theory was to be  taken over by Ukraine in the form of specific warships.  Naturally, it follows from this -- both from a legal point of  view and from the point of view of elementary logic -- that the  Black Sea Fleet is Russian and that it will be based in  Sevastopol, because there has not been any talk about changing  its deployment area.    [Bogomolov] Do you hope that your supporters will also win  in the 27 March elections for the Crimean Supreme Soviet?    [Meshkov] Judging from the first round of the presidential  elections, which were contested by all the key political forces,  this hope is justified. [passage omitted]    [Bogomolov] Crimea has a strong communist movement. What is  your attitude to it?    [Meshkov] Basically, I have a dual attitude to the communist  movement. We should distinguish between the communist ideology  and the methods of putting it into practice. The communist  ideology is everlasting, as religion, as any other form of a  widespread philosophy of life. In its pure form it comes down  to a desire to create a perfect society, an abstract, perfect  model of human existence. What brings the communist idea close  to Christianity is the fact that after all they both are founded  on love of your neighbor. The natural and ineradicable human  aspiration is to live better, and numerous lives have been  sacrificed to confirm this desire. How this idea is fleshed out  is another matter; the methods are different everywhere: from  Cambodia to Cuba and from Albania to our country. [passage  omitted]    [Bogomolov] Both Russians and Crimeans are concerned about  one thing: Will Crimea return to the ruble zone?    [Meshkov] In theory, this has been agreed on with the  Ukrainian leadership. This is possible. As for the problems of  implementing this plan, this is a technical matter; the only  thing we need here is help from specialists.    [Bogomolov] What is your view on the creation of a free  economic zone in Sevastopol?    [Meshkov] You know, this is a somewhat idealistic desire.  Sevastopol's historical and actual situation as a naval base is  not conducive to this. How all advantages of the Sevastopol  port and all its bays should best be used is another matter.  But this problem should not necessarily be tied to the status  of a free economic zone.    [Bogomolov] Finally, about the problem of the Crimean  Tatars. What solution do you see to it?    [Meshkov] The main problem here is logistic support. As for  purely ethnic problems, the Crimean Constitution has enshrined  the equality of all nations living in the peninsula. This is  from where we proceed.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Threat to 400,000 jobs in Europe's auto parts sector - Study finds 'alarming' gap in productivity with Japan MORE THAN 400,000 jobs are likely to be shed in the European Community's automotive components industry by 2000, according to a confidential report prepared for the European Commission. EC producers have failed to close an 'alarming gap' in productivity in recent years, says the study, which claims European components makers achieve only a third of the productivity of Japan's industry. The report, The Evolving Competitive Challenge for the European Automotive Components Industry, has been prepared by the Boston Consulting Group for the EC industry directorate. It suggests employment in EC automotive components groups - now around 940,000 - 'is likely to decline by at least 40 per cent up to 1999'. This would be the 'absolute minimum for the industry to be viable after 1999', says the report. The study, which has been circulated among leading European components producers, was ordered by the Commission as part of its investigation into the competitiveness of the European auto industry. Its findings are due to be presented to a meeting of the EC Council of Industry Ministers in mid-November. The European motor industry is already in turmoil, as vehicle makers and components suppliers seek to restructure to cope with the deep recession and the growing long-term challenge from producers in Japan and the US. Many leading European vehicle makers such as Volkswagen, Peugeot and Fiat, and components makers such as Robert Bosch, Mannesmann and Magneti Marelli are in loss and are being forced to reduce their workforces. The competitiveness of the components sector is vital to the future success of European vehicle makers, as components bought from outside suppliers often account for 60-70 per cent of a car's final cost. The report says the structure of the EC components industry 'is likely to change radically' with a clear movement to a tiered structure similar to that in Japan. 'A concentration of first-tier suppliers to around 500 principal ones in Europe is probable, with only between two and six main competitors in the EC for most key sub-systems,' it says. The number of companies operating as second- or third-tier suppliers may fall by up to a third, warns the study. Individual carmakers have already taken drastic action to cut the number of their direct suppliers from around 1,250 on average in 1988 to 900 now, but the number is expected to drop again to around 400 by 1997. The greatest challenge to improve productivity in the industry lies among the second-tier suppliers, often small and medium-sized companies 'where awareness of means to improve competitiveness is least advanced', says the report. The Commission is monitoring the progress made by the European auto industry in the seven-year transition period to the end of 1999, when all restrictions on direct imports of Japanese cars and light commercial vehicles from Japan are due to be removed. EC carmakers are unhappy, however, with the Commission's handling of the monitoring of vehicle imports from Japan, which came into operation at the start of the year. They say it is unacceptable for Japanese carmakers to be increasing their share of the EC car market, when the industry is suffering its worst sales decline since the second world war. In the first nine months of this year the Japanese share of the west European car market rose to 12.4 per cent from 11.9 per cent a year earlier. In the same period, new car sales in west Europe have fallen 15.7 per cent year-on-year, while truck sales fell by 26.5 per cent in the first six months.

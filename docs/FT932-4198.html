			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Ferruzzi shares tumble as swap makes investors wary SHARES in Italy's heavily indebted Ferruzzi group plunged yesterday as investors digested the implications of a possible debt-for-equity swap by its leading bank creditors. The price falls came ahead of a meeting between four senior Ferruzzi executives and a committee of five creditor banks, led by Mediobanca, to try to resolve difficulties with the rescue plan. Dealers were unhappy at the prospect of state-controlled banks being obliged to take Ferruzzi equity in return for their loans: 'It's just like nationalisation through the back door,' one said. Prices were also hit by press reports that the group's consolidated debts amounted to L31,500bn (Pounds 14bn), more than double the official figure. Ferruzzi furiously rejected the higher estimate, saying it was 'completely without foundation.' Fondiaria, the insurance group controlled by Ferruzzi through a joint venture is expected to reveal total debts of about L2,000bn, much higher than previously thought. The group's latest accounts say Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the listed holding company, had net borrowings of L15,123bn at the end of last year, of which Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, accounted for L11,511bn. Further details of the group's debt position and the methods used to calculate it may emerge at the general meetings of Montedison and Ferfin later this month. Dealers marked down the group's shares after growing doubts about the feasibility of the rescue plan and fears that Ferruzzi might cut the nominal value of its equity. Shares in Ferfin, which already sank below their L1,000 nominal value on Monday, fell to L795 yesterday from L883 on Tuesday. Montedison shares fell by almost 7 per cent to L1,027, before sinking below their L1,000 nominal value to L983 after hours. Ferfin last month announced record losses of L1,519bn, compared with 1991 net profits of L115bn, while Montedison's net losses were L1,244bn, against net profits of L168bn. The group said the family-owned Serafino Ferruzzi holding company, which controls Ferfin, would open to outside investors, while other subsidiaries would be sold or put into joint ventures to raise cash.</p>

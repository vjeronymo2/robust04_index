			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Estonian President Lennart Meri on Saturday approved  some of the changes in the government proposed by Prime Minister  Mart Laar.    Meri dismissed Maadis Uurike as finance minister and Trivimi  Velliste as foreign minister, replacing the latter with Juri  Luik, up till now defense minister.    Luik was born in Tallinn in 1966 and is a member of the  Isamaa-Pro Patria Party, the largest in the present government  coalition. A journalist by profession, he has been in the  present government since December 1, 1992, having held the posts  of minister without portfolio and defense minister. Luik also  heads the Estonian delegation at current Estonian-Russian  negotiations.    The post of defense minister has been given to Indrek  Kannik,  a member of parliament, born in Tallinn in 1961 and also a  journalist by profession. Kannik is also a member of the  Isamaa-Pro Patria Party.    However, the president turned down Laar's proposals to  replace Toomas Sildmae with another member of parliament, Toivo  Jurgenson, as economics minister and to appoint Heiki Kranich,  also a member of parliament, finance minister.    For this reason, Government Press Secretary Ain Saarna has  issued a statement accusing the president of violating the  legislation. He said the head of state is authorized to appoint  the prime minister alone but that the Constitution and the law  on the government prohibit him from rejecting the government's  proposals for the replacement of other ministers. The  president's refusal to approve the appointment of some of the  ministers means that "the renewal of the government will be  postponed until the constitutional dispute is resolved by the  chancellor of justice or, if necessary, by court," Saarna said.    He said the new ministers would not be sworn in and take  office before the issue was resolved.    The press secretary quoted the prime minister as saying that  the instability caused by the dispute might have negative  consequences, especially with Estonia's present foreign-policy  problems.    "The prime minister has reaffirmed that Estonia is a  parliamentary, not a presidential republic," Saarna said.</p>

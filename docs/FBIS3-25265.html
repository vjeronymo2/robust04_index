Eyewitnesses say about  2,000 armed men entered the town firing shots and shouting that  they wanted to capture Kundi Payhama, who was resting there.  However, the Angolan Armed Forces and the civilian defense  repelled the attack. Once again the people most affected were  civilians. According to preliminary reports 14 civilians were  wounded, two seriously -- a child and a woman aged 10 and 27,  respectively. According to the doctor in duty at the hospital,  it will be difficult to save their lives.

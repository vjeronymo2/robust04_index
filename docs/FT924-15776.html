			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Credit Local lifts first-half profit CREDIT Locale de France, the bank specialising in local authority loans, has lightened the gloom in the French financial sector by announcing an increase in profits for the first half of the year. Mr Pierre Richard, chairman, said Credit Locale, which saw net profits rise by 6 per cent to FFr663.9m in the first half of this year over the same period in 1991, had benefited from 'strong growth in activity despite the difficult economic environment'. The chairman anticipated further growth in the second half of the year, with the final increase in net profits approaching the upper end of his original forecast of 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Credit Locale, which last autumn was the first candidate for the government's partial privatisation programme, saw first-half net banking income rise 20.8 per cent to FFr1.54bn. Gross operating profits were 16.4 per cent up at FFr1.27bn.</p>

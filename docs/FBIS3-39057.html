The RP has not neglected the Alawis in its calls to  various circles urging them to join the party. The RP's  favorite targets in their recruitment efforts have been Turkey's  fashion models, with women with modern or Western appearances  coming in second and, finally, the Alawis following in third.  Alawis, who have distanced themselves from Islamic circles for  years, were stunned at Professor Izzettin Dogan's (a prominent  Alawi leader known as "Dede" or grandfather) flirtation with the  party and subsequent acceptance of the RP's party line. Dogan's  move has elicited a harsh reaction from the Alawis as well as  from other prominent figures. Some, unable to find another  explanation for his actions, have even concluded that Dogan  might actually have lost his mind and described his stance as a  betrayal of the Alawis.    On the other hand, it is claimed that Nurettin Yildirim, an  Alawi who entered the RP with great fanfare, does not enjoy  prestige among the Alawis and that he only joined the RP because  he had been rejected by all the other parties. The cloud of  doubt cast over the sincerity of Yildirim's conversion to the RP  ideology has led to allegations that the RP's Alawi recruits may  be contrived. The fact that Yildirim, who has been completely  ostracized by the Alawis for having joined the RP, has stated on  various occasions that he has been the victim of an RP trap, is  noteworthy. Yildirm had previously served as the secretary  general for the now defunct Unity Party (BP) which was founded  by Mustafa Timisi. It is alleged that Yildirim, who has also  served in the Republican People's Party (CHP) as well as the  Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), has been unable to achieve  any noteworthy successes throughout his political career. RP  Parliamentary Group Deputy Chairman Sevket Kazan said that his  party refrained from laying down any prerequisites for joining  the RP. Kazan said that the RP opened its doors to anyone who  wanted to join. Pointing out that he and his colleagues did not  discriminate between members of Sunni and Alawi Muslim sects,  Kazan said that the RP was open to anyone who believed in God.  He noted that the RP's grassroots constituency had not reacted  negatively to growing Alawi membership in the party.    In reply to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS' question as to what he  thought about the statements that Dogan, who claimed to speak on  behalf of the Alawis, was no longer influential within or  representative of the group, Kazan said: "This is a case of  sour grapes. He was very valuable until he joined the RP. Has  he suddenly become useless after having entered the RP?" Asked  if his party would nominate Alawis in localities where they  formed the dominant constituency, Kazan said: "Of course. The  issue is being discussed among the party's rank and file and the  most popular individual is nominated as a candidate from the RP."    When he was reminded of the fact that Alawi organizations  were opposed to such an association with the RP, Kazan said  that, on the contrary, his party was aware of the number of  Alawis who supported a strong RP-Alawi relationship.    Although Kazan said that the RP would indiscriminately  welcome anyone who wanted to join the party, Alawis have  stressed that a move to the RP would constitute a betrayal to  their own history. It has been claimed that Dogan -- who is  known as an Alawi dede, or prominent leader -- has been  attempting to cooperate with rightist parties since the late  Turgut Ozal's administration. His apparent goal was to merge  Alawis with the right wing within the framework of a  "Turkish-Islam synthesis" and reportedly held several meetings  with Ozal in order to achieve this vision. Dogan said that the  idea of creating an alliance with the RP came up during a visit  to Germany after having met with Ali Yuksel, who identified  himself as the Seyhulislam (grand mufti). Among other issues,  the alliance addresses the allocation of an Alawi budget by the  Religious Affairs Directorate (Diyanet), the provision of sites  for the observance of Alawi religious ceremonies and the  assurance that Alawis will have unobstructed freedom to worship.    Dogan, who has been severely chastised by other Alawis for  his move to the RP, reportedly has a history of establishing  alliances with rightist parties, including the now defunct  Nationalist Democracy Party (MDP), which was created by the  military following the Sept. 12, 1980 coup and of which he was  among the founding members. In addition to Dogan, who has been  confronted by harsh criticism from Alawis and their  organizations, it has been announced that Yildirim will be  officially expelled from the Pir Sultan Abdal Association, a  prominent Alawi organization. Murtaza Demir, the head of the  association, has perhaps expressed the strongest opposition to  reports of Dogan's collaboration with the RP.    In a joint statement made with Hikmet Ozkan -- a relative of  one of the victims of the Sivas tragedy -- on behalf of the  people who were burned to death in Sivas, Demir said he and his  colleagues interpreted Dogan's stance as a "betrayal of the  Alawis." Demir continued saying that despite the fact that it  was well known that those who incited and participated in the  Sivas massacre were pro-Shariah, it was noteworthy that Dogan,  who identified himself as an Alawi Dede and was a scientist by  training, had deliberately chosen to establish close ties with  the RP. Demir said that Dogan's decision to join a party whose  platform was hostile toward the republic and to the principles  of secularism and democracy was Dogan's own business. However,  Demir added that he and his colleagues did not understand why  Dogan insisted on establishing these ties in the name of the  Anatolian Alawis and within his role as an Alawi Dede. Demir  maintained that Dogan's move into the pro-Shariah fold has led  Alawism to become a subject of controversy.    Pointing out that he and other Alawis in the community  regarded Dogan's association with the pro-Shariah party as an  unpardonable offense, Demir said: "This is considered a  betrayal of Anatolian Alawism. Alawis do not support  pro-Shariah and undemocratic parties and organizations. They  will not permit unqualified people to represent their personal  interests." Yet another critic of Dogan's is Ahmet Sahin, the  chairman of the Alawi Association for the Promotion of the Haci  Bektas Culture. Sahin said that Alawis will simply ridicule  Dogan if he attempts to claim to be representing Alawi interests  as an RP member. He said that Dogan must have lost his mind if  he believed that he was actually speaking on behalf of the Alawi  community and added that Dogan's relationship with the RP is  nothing but a betrayal to the Alawis.    Asked if he and his colleagues would support any political  party during the local elections, Sahin said they would make  their decision according to the qualifications of the  candidates. But, he did say that they would be backing only  progressive and democratic candidates.    Similarly, other Alawi organizations and publications also  have criticized the establishment of ties with the RP, using  almost the same style of speech and language. They went as far  as to say that the formation of such an alliance could not even  be possible.    According to figures from the State Institute of Statistics  (DIE), there are 12 million Alawis in Turkey, or 20 percent of  the overall population. However, it is a well-known fact that  Alawis have refrained from identifying themselves with any one  organization or party, although in the past they used to  cooperate with the Democrat Party (DP). In subsequent years,  they seem to have moved steadily toward the social democrat and  radical leftist parties. In fact, the community's reluctance to  rally around only one organization or party, despite their large  numbers, has become a subject of criticism among many Alawis,  especially those who recognize their potential for political  power within the country. However, recently, Alawis have  increasingly begun to join right- leaning parties and have  quickly moved up their ranks to hold top leadership positions.  During the past one or two years, Alawis have started to lean  more and more toward organizations that emphasize the importance  of religious or cultural unity rather than that of political  unity. Many cultural organizations and publications have been  founded to pursue this goal, such as the Pir Sultan Abdal  Cultural Association, the Association for the Promotion of the  Haci Bektas Veli Culture, and the Cem and Nefes magazines.    Meanwhile the social democratic parties have steadily been  losing the support of the Alawi community, especially since the  July 2, 1993 fundamentalist riot in Sivas, in which 33  participants of the Pir Sultan Abdal Cultural Association's  conference were burned to death in their Madimak Hotel. The  fact that the SHP was a junior coalition partner in the  government during the exhibition of gross negligence by security  forces during the incident, has angered many Alawis and soured  relations between them and the social democratic party.  However, due to the upcoming local elections, Alawis have now  begun to discuss the subject of which party they will support.  Meanwhile, in order to announce their candidacies before the  deadline, many Alawis have returned to the SHP and plan to run  on that party's ticket during the elections. Some Alawis,  particularly those who lost relatives during the Sivas riot,  have protested against the SHP alliance, however, many within  the SHP rank and file claim that Alawi opposition to the SHP is  only temporary and will diminish over time. In fact, this  reconciliation between the Alawis and the SHP did not need much  time at all as, following reports of Alawi movements towards the  RP, prominent Alawi figures have accelerated their contacts with  the SHP. It has been reported that most of the Alawis chosen to  be municipal candidates are those who have lost relatives during  the Sivas incident. Alawis are continuing to hold meetings to  determine their final positions for the local elections.  Reportedly, Alawis will favor progressive-democratic  candidates, particularly those selected by the SHP; independent  candidates; or those nominated by other leftist parties,  depending on their qualifications and the situation prevailing  in the specific locality. In any case, it is expected that the  RP will receive neither political support nor participation from  Alawi voters. While Alawis emphasize this point, they also note  that it is well known that those 100 or 200 Alawis who have  opted to join the RP, have done so only after aggressive coaxing  by members of the RP rank and file.    On the other hand, the RP has claimed that new Alawis  continue to join their party and that the names of new Alawis  members will be revealed during a ceremony in which the RP will  announce its mayoral candidates for the upcoming elections.    However, those that join the RP can expect to face strong  disapproval from the Confederation of Alawi Unions in Germany,  one of the fiercest critics of any Alawi movement toward the RP.  The federation has rejected any Alawi who has joined the RP.  Ali Riza Gulcicek, who heads the Alawi Unions Confederation,  said that those who had decided to join the ranks of the  oppressors cannot expect to continue to represent the Alawi  community. Culcicek said: "Cooperation of the RP--which is the  culprit of the Sivas massacre, the defender of the massacre and  hostile to secularism and democracy--with the Alawis is a  betrayal of Alawi belief and tradition. At a time when we are  still suffering from the freshness of our pain and when a gang  of murderers sits in the halls of justice as heroes who have  committed a massacre in the name of God, such cooperation is the  equivalent of having taken part in the crime and of having  vindicated the murderers of their despicable crime." In its  statement, the federation maintained that cooperation between  the RP and Alawis would not serve the establishment of an  Alawi-Sunni brotherhood. It stressed that those who advocated  the conversion of Alawis to Sunni religious ideology could not  possibly have any Alawi links. While the confederation said  that it did not insist that those who wanted to cooperate with  the reactionary forces stop, the confederation did emphasize  that it would be in their best interest to sever their links to  the Alawi community altogether.    Stressing that Alawis would not cooperate the RP, the  statement ended with the quote, "We do not want new Hiriz  Pashas." During the Ottoman period Hizir Pasha, the then  governor of Sivas, ordered the hanging of Pir Sultan Abdal, a  renowned poet famous for his progressive ideology.</p>

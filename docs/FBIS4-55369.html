			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 12 (CTK) -- The United Nations-imposed  arms embargo is a problem concerning all countries of the former  Yugoslavia, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec reported his  Slovenian counterpart Lojze Peterle as saying at their meeting  today.    Peterle is on a two-day official visit to the Czech  Republic.    It is unlikely that the UN Security Council would agree to  lift the embargo for one country only, Zieleniec said.    However, the question might eventually get onto the  Council's  agenda. "The fundamental thing is whether Slovenia will be able  to control the movement of weapons over its territory," he said.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: How to survive an interview THE LATEST market research shows that 97.5 per cent of those who read Hawks &amp; Handsaws regularly are rich and growing richer; are leaders in their fields, or rising swiftly; are svelte and fit, as well as personable and deeply charming; hate bloodsports; admire all Russian composers; wonder why Martin Amis has not yet won the Booker prize - and are generally admired, envied and fussed over. It stands to reason, then, that H&amp;H readers are more likely than most to attract the eye of those Sadducees of the modern newspaper scene, the hot-shot interviewers - the Lynn Barbers, Valerie Groves and Christian Tylers of this world. To hold your own against vivisectionists of this calibre takes nerve, intellect and ingenuity, just what you would expect of H&amp;H readers. However, at the risk of teaching anyone to suck eggs, I thought it would be helpful to jot down 10 golden rules for handling interviewers like this, should they happen to wave their scalpels in your direction: 1) Keep your knees together but use plenty of eye contact and body language. You want them to like you. 2) Although they are admired by other journalists, interviewers of this class are touchy and insecure, so flatter and woo them, make them feel attractive. 3) Imply that you are as familiar with their work as they are with yours. 4) Never lie. 5) Never contradict them. 6) Do not perspire. Even if you are frantic, appear super-languid. They admire self-confidence above all else. 7) When they bowl you a googly, admire their technique - then smack it away elegantly. 8) Use long words occasionally, but keep your sentences short. These people are quote-vultures: far too busy and important to tolerate inchoate rambling. 9) If the going gets tough, imply that you know their editors a shade better than they do (this may not be difficult). 10) At the end of the interview pay all bills, order them a taxi and suggest that you meet them for dinner (Tuscany: late October) so as to further the acquaintance. To show how it is done, here is a fragment of an interview I gave this week to Penelope Powdermaker, a rising young star with a poisonous technique. Observe how her questions are beautifully non-sequential, not that I fell for it: Penelope P: 'Some people say you are raffish and attractive. Especially to women. Has that ever held you back?' Michael T-N: 'It's hard to say, Penelope. But we are all of us, I feel, more than the sum of our parts. Looks like yours, for example, matched to wit and intelligence, must have been a handicap initially. But look at you now, Penelope. You have risen far above the crowd.' Penelope P: 'Do you like yourself?' MT-N: 'Not all the time. I expect it would be a bore. There has to be room in our lives for an element of doubt and self-questioning.' Penelope P: 'How much are you paid? ' MT-N: 'That is a grey area, Penelope. A mite controversial.' Penelope P: 'Why are you running away? It is a perfectly fair question, so give me a straight answer.' MT-N: 'All right, Penelope. I happen to know your editor. He plays at my club. Big, booming forehand though suspect on the cross-court volley. Splendid sort of fellow. So here is what you do. Think of your own salary, Penelope, then multiply it by seven and divide by 0.8. That is what I am paid.' Penelope P: 'Do you name-drop constantly?' MT-N: 'It is a habit from my childhood. I wish I could shake it off but we are prisoners of our nurturing. Although I strive with every sinew to hold myself in check, I am also a bit of a rah-rah, though I stop short of twitdom. 'Some years ago, in the winner's enclosure at Ascot, I was chatting to the Dowager Lady Beaverbrook and lobbed her a question she rather objected to. ''Lady Beaverbrook,' I said. 'You have paid uncounted millions for your racehorses and enjoyed only glancing success. How do you relate what you spend to what you get back?' 'She smiled winsomely, Penelope, and told me confidingly: 'That is an over-complex question. What you are asking me is whether I enjoy my racing. The answer is Yes, I enjoy it enormously.' 'That taught me a lesson, Penelope - not to be pompous when confronted by enormous wealth. But neither to be intimidated. It is an extremely difficult balancing act for which people like you and me - the best sort of professional, with by-lines in 24-point, such a great responsibility - are seldom given credit for. 'When Lady Beaverbrook won the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket last Saturday with a horse called Mystiko at 6 1/2 -1 - I had been alerted to its qualities by a friend of mine, Jack Hillbrooke, and passed the tip on: all part of the service - my heart went out to the dowager in no uncertain style.' Penelope P: 'Are you religious?' MT-N: 'No.' Penelope P: 'You don't believe in a god?' MT-N: 'Only in the hydrogen atom.' Penelope P: 'They say that facetiousness is often a camouflage for an unimaginative mind.' MT-N: 'Often they are right, Penelope. But as Brahms said when people told him that his first symphony sounded like Beethoven's ninth: 'Any fool could say that, and every fool has]'' And so the interview progressed. At the end of it I paid for our meal, called a taxi for Penelope, helped her get into it, said I would buy a copy of her paper when the interview came out and promised to meet her in the Uffizi, on October 27 (I shall be on sabbatical), in front of The Birth of Venus. It was as easy as shelling peas.</p>

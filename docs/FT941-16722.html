			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Rothschild man to head Panel: Takeover chief opposes EU plans for a statutory regime Mr William Staple, a director of the investment bank NM Rothschild, is to be director-general of the Takeover Panel. He will replace Ms Frances Heaton on March 2. Mr Staple is the brother of Mr George Staple, the director of the Serious Fraud Office. 'We will not be discussing City matters at family gatherings,' Mr William Staple said. He added: 'I would hope that matters which come before the Takeover Panel do not later concern the SFO.' His appointment, which is for a two-year secondment, has been made by the panel's chairman Sir David Calcutt QC, with the approval of the Bank of England. The panel is a non-statutory body which for 25 years has set the rules that public companies and their advisers must follow in acquisitions. Mr Staple said he believed the threat of a statutory regime for takeovers was the most significant issue facing the panel. The European Commission, noting the success of the UK system, has proposed that all countries adopt legislation establishing similar rules in an effort to ease the way for cross-border merger and acquisition activity. The UK government is fighting the proposals, arguing that a statutory regime would invite the threat of judicial review for panel rulings. However, Mr Staple, echoing the views of Sir David, said: 'I would want very much to resist a statutory system. People would be tempted to take their takeover decisions to the courts and the ensuing delays would greatly increase the costs of acquisitions.' He said that a statutory, and therefore more time-consuming system, would reduce the speed of the panel. The current structure, he said, had led to a consistent application of general rules such as the requirement that all shareholders be treated equally and that those acquiring more than 30 per cent of a company's shares be required to bid for all of them. Given the economic recovery, Mr Staple said, it was likely that his tenure at the panel would see another spurt of takeover activity, and it was possible some rules would be changed. 'We will need to constantly review the rulebook in light of changing market practice and the cases which come before us,' he said.</p>

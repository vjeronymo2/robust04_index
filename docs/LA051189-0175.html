			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASEBALL;  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTIAGO TRIES TO BRAVE ONE MORE BYE  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago College hasn't fared well this season after having byes in its  schedule, so Coach Don Sneddon hopes he has came up with a way around this  week's break.  </P> <P> The Dons, who finished second in the Orange Empire Conference, had Tuesday --  their normal game day -- off before beginning the first round of the Southern  California Regionals today with a 2 p.m. home game against East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago lost twice to last-place Riverside coming off byes this season.  So instead of taking a break Tuesday, Sneddon held an intrasquad game.  </P> <P> "We made it as real as possible," he said. "We had a draft, announced the  lineups and had the national anthem and an umpire."  </P> <P> With three games left in the conference season, Rancho Santiago had a one-game  lead over Cypress. Following a bye, the Dons lost consecutive games to  Riverside and Golden West before beating Saddleback on the season's final day  to clinch second place.  </P> <P> Cypress doesn't begin play in the regionals until the third round, which starts  May 19.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago's opponent today, East Los Angeles, finished second in the  Southern California Conference, but that's about all Sneddon knows of the  Huskies.  </P> <P> "No one knows too much about them and there really aren't too many people to  call," Sneddon said. "All we know is that if we take them too lightly, our  season will be over."  </P> <P> Jack Bailey, a sophomore right-hander, will start for Rancho Santiago. Bailey  is 11-4 with a 3.44 earned-run average.  </P> <P> Today's winner plays the winner of the Orange Coast/L.A. Valley game in the  second round Saturday.  </P> <P> If Orange Coast and Rancho Santiago should meet again, it would mark the fifth  time the teams have played this season.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago won the first two meetings, 9-0 and 7-5, and Orange Coast took  the next two, 8-5 and 14-7.  </P> <P> Orange Coast is expected to start sophomore left-hander Ryan Thibault against  L.A. Valley today. Thibault is 9-1 with a 2.71 ERA and 94 strikeouts.  </P> <P> The Pirates' lineup also features Scott Talanoa, who leads the state in home  runs with 16.  </P></p>

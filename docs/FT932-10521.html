			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Resurgent Benazir sniffs power: Farhan Bokhari meets the Pakistani opposition leader MS BENAZIR Bhutto, the Pakistani opposition leader, sees power once more within view as her political comeback gains pace. Her bitter isolation has ended with the ousting of Mr Nawaz Sharif's government after 29 months during which many of her closest supporters were victimised. Mr Asif Ali Zardari, her husband, was appointed a cabinet minister last month in the country's new interim government. Under Mr Sharif's administration he had been charged on 12 counts including corruption - in cases backed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the man who sacked both Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto before him. Mr Zardari and Mr Khan recently came face to face at a ministerial swearing-in ceremony which only a few months ago was impossible to imagine. The new alignments in Pakistani politics, where foes of yesterday are friends of today, while perhaps awkward for Ms Bhutto, is seen by some as a period of transition leading to her return to power. In response to criticism, she forcefully defends her decision to allow some of her closest supporters to join the government of national unity that has promised to hold elections on July 14. The cabinet includes members of different political parties, with the largest share going to Ms Bhutto's People's Democratic Alliance (PDA) and politicians who broke away from Mr Sharif's government. 'Time and again, I have said that a political leader needs to rise above personal sentiments to serve the nation. I have certain political objectives, my party has certain political objectives. In the attainment of those objectives, we are willing to sit down and talk with anybody,' Ms Bhutto said. But the new government is already split over the future of Pakistan's four provincial assemblies. Ms Bhutto is demanding that the assemblies should be dissolved because their members were elected in allegedly rigged polls in October 1990. Both Mr Khan and Mr Balakh Sher Mazari, the interim prime minister, are opposed to that. Ms Bhutto also wants the elections to be conducted by the army rather than government officials, and the appointment of an independent election commission to ensure that the polls are free and fair. Senior officials say these two proposals are being discussed. Ms Bhutto's party members had threatened to withdraw from the cabinet by today if the demand for dissolution of provincial assemblies was not met, but this deadline has now been set aside. The power to make that decision has been handed over to an all-party conference of prominent politicians including Ms Bhutto. But the rift has not ended. 'We're in the midst of an election which government partners aren't sure will be fair and I am trying to negotiate with the government to say that Pakistan should be given a better chance. If the elections are fair, I have no doubt that my party and I would return,' said Ms Bhutto. The political upheavals have fuelled concern that the military may again flex its political muscles - the country has been ruled by generals for more than half its 46-year history. Senior army officers deny that they have any aspirations to seek power. Ms Bhutto said: 'I don't think the army is interested to intervene. But if this political mess continues, then I think we'll be creating a political vacuum. History teaches us that there are no vacuums, they are always filled.'</p>

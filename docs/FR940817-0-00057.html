			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 287.10_Expedited Internal Review Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters criticized the expedited internal review process proposed in &sect;287.10 as legally insufficient on a number of grounds. The commenters criticized the proposed rule for incorporating current policies and procedures of the Department's Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility, stating that these policies and procedures do not provide safeguards that are ``accessible and thorough.'' The commenters stated that the proposed rule provided inadequate notice to the public of its right to lodge complaints. The commenters suggested that an outreach system, including posters, private telephone for detainers, and a 24-hour toll-free number staffed by multi-lingual personnel be mandated in the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters also stated that a formal procedure for notifying complainants of the receipt and disposition of their complaints should be implemented by the rule. Confidentiality of complaints should be ensured to protect against retaliation, and information obtained in the process of investigation complaints should be excluded from use against the complainant in deportation or exclusion proceedings. The commenters stated that an official record of all complaints, even unsubstantiated complaints, should be retained so that individual officers can be properly evaluated and, if necessary, retrained, counseled, or investigated. Some of the commenters suggested that this information, including unsubstantiated complaints, should be kept in the officer's official personnel file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters suggested that specific procedures for the investigation of complaints, including provisions for public hearings in the case of serious charges, should be included in the rule. The commenters also stated that an appeals process should be available in cases where complainants or Service officers are dissatisfied with an investigator's report and recommendations. Several commenters also stated that the process for reviewing complaints against Service officers must be improved in order to address allegations of human rights abuses by Service officers patrolling border areas adjacent to Mexico. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Department notes that many of the suggestions made by these commenters are good practices that are addressed in the policies and procedures of the Department's investigative organizations. However, many of the specific recommendations regarding notification and timeliness in the completion of investigations are beyond the scope of this rule and must be addressed in these internal policies and procedures. The Department disagrees with the suggestion that an appeals process be provided. Sufficient review of investigatory reports is already provided in the policies and procedures mentioned above. Under these policies and procedures, confidentiality will be maintained in the course of these investigations. If cause for administrative action is found, the administrative process will be followed, and if grounds for civil or criminal prosecution are found, the appropriate litigation will be undertaken. The Department's investigative organizations currently have established procedures to protect the identities of complainants and witnesses from disclosure to Service personnel. Records of unsubstantiated allegations will be centrally maintained by the Service for the purposes identified in the comments and to provide a basis for management review of the number of allegations that have been made to determine whether additional action should be taken at a management level to improve operations and training, but these records will not be kept in an officer's official personnel file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters also stated that implementation of this section of the rule should be immediate because the reasons for allowing a one-year delay in the provisions of the rule governing enforcement authority do not apply to internal review. The Service and the Department would be in a position to agree if, immediately upon publication of the final rule, the standards were developed and the commensurate training was provided to designated immigration officers. However, the purpose of the one-year delayed implementation period is to enable the Service to develop the standards, provide the training, and certify all designated immigration officers. Because &sect;287.10 creates an expedited review process exclusively for violations of the standards that will be developed during the one-year implementation period, the effective date of &sect;287.10 must coincide with all other sections of the final rule. However, this does not alter the established internal review process for alleged violations of existing enforcement policies and procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters also expressed concern that &sect;287.10(e) of the proposed rule, which would permit Department components to supplement or expand policies and procedures to ensure proper conduct of Service employees and officers, should not limit or undermine the regulations that govern the review of allegations of improper conduct by Service employees and officers. Neither the Department nor the Service intended that &sect;287.10(e) be so construed. It is the intention of the Department to provide greater assurances that its officers and employees will conduct themselves appropriately, not to diminish existing standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 287.11_Disclaimer <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters claimed that &sect;287.11 would preclude victims of unlawful Service enforcement practices from pursuing remedies for regulatory violations. However, this disclaimer merely states that the regulations provide no independent grounds for relief in any civil or criminal proceeding by any party. It does not prevent any party from pursuing relief for alleged violations of the Constitution or laws of the United States. As such, the disclaimer is consistent with the holding in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Caceres,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 440 U.S. 741 (1979). This disclaimer is a standard element for all regulations affecting substantive federal criminal law enforcement authority and is only intended to ensure that the regulations do not create rights not otherwise existing in law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Technology: Driving down a different road - As the final race approaches, John Griffiths explains why Formula One offers few lessons for the car industry When Britain's Nigel Mansell starts practice in Adelaide today for the final round of the 1992 grand prix world championship, it will be his last session at the wheel of his Canon-sponsored Williams-Renault FW14B  - a car which he describes as so technologically advanced that, after further improvements this winter, 'even a puppet will be able to drive it'. Considering that he has been the beneficiary of most of this technology in his successful pursuit of this year's world championship, many see his remark as yet another graceless parting shot at Alain Prost, the French former world champion who will replace him on the Williams team next season. Technologically, says Mansell, 'Formula One is going into the space age'. The Williams-Renault car has a mass of on-board, computer-controlled systems such as active suspension, a fully automatic gearbox programmed not to let its driver blow up the engine, and a traction control system to provide maximum acceleration off the grid and out of corners. It is technical sophistication to match advanced aerospace technology. 'It takes tens of millions of dollars to get where I've just left in Formula One and I think that's totally wrong,' says Mansell, who next year will race a different class of car in North America. Mansell may believe that the technology race is bad for grand prix as a sport, but Renault, Honda, Fiat-owned Ferrari, Yamaha, Goodyear and the other manufacturers of road-going cars, engines, tyres and other equipment feel differently. They justify their involvement largely on the grounds that technology pioneered on Formula One cars cascades down into road cars, to the benefit of ordinary users in terms of performance, safety or efficiency. Over the years it has been a persuasive argument. Disc brakes, for example, evolved from racing. Ordinary motorists owe a debt to grand prix for the synthetic rubber compounds which provide their tyres with levels of grip, handling and durability which would have seemed unattainable 20 years ago. But just how much of the Formula One racing technology now being undertaken is relevant to the roadgoing vehicle industry is increasingly open to question. Even the fuel multinationals which pump large sums of money into grand prix have had difficulty justifying the relevance of 'witch's brew' fuels for grand prix cars. These fuels provide as much as 60 or 70 extra horsepower but some are so lethal that protective suits have had to be worn by people fuelling the cars. Fisa, the world governing body of motor sport, is banning the fuels. But oil group Elf Aquitaine is taking legal action in a bid to get the ban reversed. That such fuels are widely accepted as costing up to Pounds 100 a litre - roughly Pounds 25,000 per fill-up - is indicative of how far financial considerations are put aside. Some technology is even flowing the other way - out of road cars and into grand prix. Next season, Prost at Williams will be using anti-lock brakes for the first time, despite the fact that such ABS systems have been used on road cars for much of a decade. The problems of using ABS on a grand prix car are complex because the system has to deal with the huge weight/speed differentials of a vehicle which has so much aerodynamic force that it could theoretically run upside down across a ceiling at more than 130 miles per hour. The remoteness of grand prix from the mainstream vehicle industry is at least partially responsible for keeping some of the world's leading manufacturers out of Formula One. Jacques Calvet, Peugeot Group's chairman, explains: 'I would prefer to find a championship which is closer to ordinary cars than grand prix racing. We like to accept challenges which improve our road cars - like rallying and sports cars.' Indeed, so dynamically capable have grand prix cars become - when thay accelerate, stop and corner they produce forces of up to five times gravity  -that some of the technology is being reversed. Next year the cars will use rear tyres that are three inches narrower, for example, in an attempt to increase braking distances and give more scope to driver ability. It is also becoming a moot point whether, against the background of world recession, the businesses which fund the grand prix teams - such as Philip Morris through its Marlboro brand - and which have no vested stake in motor industry technology will continue footing the bill when they could compete with lower-technology cars at a fraction of the grand prix price. It is this factor which, Fisa president Max Mosley believes, may soon lead to the wilder technology flights of Formula One being reined in. 'In the long term, it is not realistic to expect a sponsor to pay for electronic suspension,' he said. 'The only people who would pay for that are the motor industry, and only if it's useful to them. If we don't stop spending money on things that are completely useless, sooner or later we'll go out of business.' Mosley's concern, however, is not just with financial practicalities in terms of technology. He believes that over the next decade motor sport is going to come under increasing attack from environmentalists and that grand prix will have to pay more attention to areas like emissions  - currently not even on the agenda - if it is to escape censure. Even then, he acknowledges, there is the problem of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas which is an inescapable product of combustion. Financial pressures are such, however, that the technology-limiting process may already be under way. At a meeting just before the Japanese grand prix a fortnight ago, members of the Formula One Constructors Association listened to proposals for an engine speed limit, and for electronic control systems to be confined to ignition and fuel systems. Costs and the environment have already been cited by Honda as reasons for leaving Formula One and scaling down motor sport involvement. Mazda is withdrawing from the Le Mans 24-hour race next year - which it won in 1991, the first time by a Japanese manufacturer - and is cutting back other racing activities in favour of participating with more production-based cars. Such thinking lies behind the motor sport strategies of General Motors, the world's largest vehicle maker, which eschews Formula One as being too remote from its mainstream business. Mike Nicholson, GM motor sport executive, suggests that the supposed technical spin-offs are questionable even lower down the motor sport ladder. 'Feedback from the competition programme into the road car, via the rapid and innovative technological developments needed to remain truly competitive and reliable, is often cited as justification for motor sport. It was, without doubt, a very important factor years ago,' he says. 'But the modern car is such a well-developed and refined machine as it comes off the production line that there is now less-relevant feedback. This justification, therefore, loses its validity to a large extent. This is particularly so at the higher levels of the sport where the cars are so highly developed that it is at times difficult to relate these to their road car origins.' The most telling indication that image and politics play a more significant role than commercially relevant technology was evident at the Japanese grand prix. Honda, exiting from grand prix this season, built specially powerful engines for the race in order to put on a good show for the home crowd. But Renault had anticipated Honda's move and built its own super-fast engines in order to prevent Honda obtaining even pole position. In terms of 'usable' technology, neither manufacturer's practice engines would have lasted the race.</p>

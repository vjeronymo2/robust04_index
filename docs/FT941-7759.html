			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Seeking Pounds 1bn for organic growths - The prospects for the development of the biotechnology sector The British biotechnology sector is looking to raise Pounds 1bn from the stock market over the next three years, more than the total equity investment in the sector to date. According to a new survey by Arthur Andersen, the accountants, and the BioIndustry Association, the independent biotechnology sector is planning a large shift from private and venture capital funding to the stock market. Following last year's change in the Stock Exchange's listing rules for research-based businesses there have been a flood of biotechnology flotations. The survey, published today, suggests there are many more in the pipeline. Mr David Kirk, head of Andersen's technology group, says it is an open question whether the stock market can absorb the number of potential new issues and warns that investor sentiment remains vulnerable to disappointment. 'One hopes there is the appetite, but one catastrophe could upset the sector.' The survey shows that less than half of the UK's biotechnology companies believe they have sufficient financial resources to pursue their long-term strategic goals. In particular, they may have to drop their ambitions to become fully integrated companies which market the products they have developed. One of the survey's most interesting findings is that 43 per cent of companies plan to become fully integrated. For a further 34 per cent the strategy is to use partners either for marketing or manufacture. The report states: 'The objective of full integration may well be reasonable for the UK's most successful companies. However, as more companies reach the expensive product development phase of their growth, so the competition for available funds will increase and many may have to revise their strategy.' Excluding the biotechnology arms of larger companies, Andersen identified 166 companies 'whose primary commercial activity depends on the application of biological organisms, systems or processes'. The sector, which employs 7,400 people and spent Pounds 130m on research and development last year, has been funded by about Pounds 900m of equity up October 31. Based on the responses to a questionnaire Andersen calculates that the sector is looking for Pounds 1.1bn of equity over the next three years. The total demand is likely to be greater still given that this figure applies only to existing businesses, and that more than a quarter of the companies in the survey are less than five years old. To date, the vast majority of equity funding has come from private individuals or venture capitalists. But the companies expected 84 per cent of future equity funding to come from public markets. Most companies said that they had found it difficult to raise finance and believed that the City generally had a negative attitude to biotechnology. They blamed this on the perceived lack of commercial experience of the companies' managements and the lack of exit routes for investors. The problem arises because the typical four to six year investment period, over which most venture capital firms work, is not long enough to see a biotechnology company to flotation. Until the Stock Exchange changed its rules companies could not, other than in exceptional cases, come to market without a history of mainstream revenues. The recent relaxation means companies can float earlier so bridging what Andersen calls the 'realisation gap'. Mr Vernon Spencer of Andersen's biotechnology group, believes the change will ease the funding problems of start-ups as well as more mature companies. 'If venture capital companies are getting money out through flotations they are more likely to invest it back at the start of the cycle.' The biotechnology sector had turnover of Pounds 470m in 1992-93 which, based on the companies' own estimates, will have nearly doubled to Pounds 878m in 1995-96. Yet the strength of the product development pipeline indicates even faster growth after that with research and development spending set to rise by half to Pounds 202m in 1995-96. However, to put this in context, Glaxo alone is likely to spend about Pounds 200m on research this year with a further Pounds 600m-Pounds 700m on development. Mr Kirk believes that the UK industry is at a turning point. 'There were positive developments on a wide range of fronts last year including finance, regulation and the intellectual property environment.' However, the report concludes that further change in all these areas is required to capitalise on the UK's 'excellent reputation for biotechnological innovation'.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> BIRDS LEAD AFRICANS TO HONEY  </P> <P> Scientists have confirmed Africans' claim that special birds guide them to wild  honey, debunking those who regarded the man-bird teamwork as myth, a new study  reports.  </P> <P> For more than 20,000 years, people living from the central Sahara to South  Africa have collected wild honey, and even today, honey is a staple in the  diets of many nomadic tribes. Africans have long reported that a bird called  the greater honeyguide deliberately leads them to bee hives in hollow trees,  rock crevices or termite mounds.  </P> <P> But because of the folksy nature of such claims, "many consider this  interaction to be a myth," said two researchers, whose study of the  honeyguide's relationship with Kenya's Boran people was published in the  journal Science.  </P> <P> After three years of tracking Borans in their pursuit of honey, H.A. Isack of  the National Museum of Kenya and H.U. Reyer of West Germamy's Max Planck  Institute, found following the birds substantially reduced how long it took to  find honey.  </P> <P> "In unfamiliar areas, their (Borans') search time per bees' nest was, on  average, 8.9 hours when not guided and 3.2 hours when guided," the  ornithologists said.  </P></p>

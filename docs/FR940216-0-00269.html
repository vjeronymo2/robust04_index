Obtain the refiner's or importer's internal laboratory analyses for each batch and compare such analyses for consistency with the analyses results reported to EPA; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Where the refiner or importer has included oxygenate that is blended downstream of the refinery or import facility in its compliance calculations in accordance with &sect;80.101(d)(4)(ii), obtain a listing of each downstream oxygenate blending operation from which the refiner or importer is claiming oxygenate for use in compliance calculations, and for each such operation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Determine if the refiner or importer had a contract in place with the downstream blender during the period oxygenate was blended;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Determine if the refiner or importer has records reflecting that it conducted physical inspections of the downstream blending operation during the period oxygenate was blended;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Obtain a listing from the refiner or importer of the batches of conventional gasoline or conventional sub-octane blendstock, and the compliance calculations for which include oxygenate blended by the downstream oxygenate blender, and test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations contained in this listing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Obtain a listing from the downstream oxygenate blender of the oxygenate blended with conventional gasoline or sub-octane blendstock that was produced or imported by the refiner or importer. Test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations in this listing. Agree the overall oxygenate blending listing obtained from the refiner or importer with the listing obtained from the downstream oxygenate blender. Select a representative sample of oxygenate blending listing obtained from the downstream oxygenate blender, and for this sample:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Using product transfer documents, determine if the oxygenate was blended with conventional gasoline or conventional sub-octane blendstock that was produced by the refiner or imported by the importer; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Agree the oxygenate volume with the refiner's or importer's listing of oxygenate claimed for this gasoline;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Obtain a listing of the sampling and testing conducted by the refiner or importer over the downstream oxygenate blending operation. Select a representative sample of the test results from this listing, and for this sample agree the tested oxygenate volume with the oxygenate use listings from the refiner or importer, and from the oxygenate blender; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Obtain a copy of the records reflecting the refiner or importer audit over the downstream oxygenate blending operation. Review these records for indications that the audit included review of the overall volumes and type of oxygenate purchased and used by the oxygenate blender to be consistent with the oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer and that this oxygenate was blended with the refiner's or importer's gasoline or blending stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) In the case of a refiner or importer that is not exempt from blendstock tracking under &sect;80.102(f):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Obtain listings for those tenders of non-finished-gasoline classified by the refiner or importer as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Applicable blendstock which is included in the refiner's or importer's blendstock tracking calculations pursuant to &sect;80.102(b) through (d);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Applicable blendstock which is exempt pursuant to &sect;80.102(d)(3) from inclusion in the refiner's or importer's blendstock tracking calculations pursuant to &sect;80.102 (b) through (d); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) All other non-finished-gasoline petroleum products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations contained in the analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Agree the listings of tenders' volumes to the gasoline inventory reconciliation in paragraph (b) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Agree the EPA report for the volume classified as applicable blendstock pursuant to the requirements of &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 80.102.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Select a representative sample from the listing of applicable blendstock which is reported to EPA, and for such sample:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Agree the volumes to records supporting the transfer of the tender to another person; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Trace back to the batch or batches in which the non-finished-gasoline petroleum product was produced or imported. Obtain the refiner's or importer's internal laboratory analysis for each batch and compare such analysis for consistency with the product type assigned by the refiner or importer (e.g., reformate, light coker naphtha, etc.), and that this product type is included in the applicable blendstock list at &sect;80.102(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Select a representative sample from the listing of applicable blendstock which is exempt from inclusion in the blendstock tracking report to EPA, and for such sample:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Agree the volumes to records supporting the transfer of the tender to another person;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Trace back to the batch or batches in which the non-finished-gasoline petroleum product was produced or imported.

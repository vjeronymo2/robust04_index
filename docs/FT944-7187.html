			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Torras files debt proposals to lift receivership Grupo Torras, the Kuwait Investment Office's investment arm in Spain, has filed a payment proposal to 3,369 creditors aimed at lifting a two-year old receivership, Reuter reports from Madrid. The proposal offers 97 per cent of debts owed to small creditors of Torras, while creditors related to KIO are being offered just over 10 per cent. The debt owed by Grupo Torras to KIO-related companies accounts for 93.5 per cent of total debt to unsecured creditors which amounted to Pta219.87bn (Dollars 1.69bn) when it suspended payments. Of this, Pta205.45bn was owed to KIO. A source close to the negotiations said the proposal implies KIO-related companies taking a write-down of Pta184.45bn, just less than 90 per cent of Torras's debt to them. The total payments Grupo Torras would make under the plan was Pta27.73bn. The deadline for creditors to respond is January 21 1995. A creditors' committee will be set up, comprising two creditors, a representative of the company and two from the receivers. Grupo Torras filed for receivership in December 1992, in spite of the KIO injecting Pta338bn into the group in the preceding 30 months. Torras said the receivership report confirmed that part of this capital was provided by the KIO during the Gulf war, contradicting claims by former management that it was channelled back to Kuwait and left the group decapitalised. KIO filed suit in Madrid in January 1993 against its former agent in Spain, Mr Javier de la Rosa, the Catalan financier, as well as seven other former KIO and Torras executives. Mr De la Rosa is in jail facing separate charges of fraud in his Grand Tibidabo leisure group. In its suit, KIO-Torras said the former executives, who resigned in mid-1992, were responsible through fraud and misrepresenting accounts for losses of Dollars 1bn and that KIO's Dollars 5bn investment in Spain had been squandered. The case is still before the Spanish courts. Torras said KIO financial backing had been crucial in avoiding a collapse in its Spanish investments, pointing to Pta102bn for paper company Torraspapel, chemicals group Ercros, real estate firm Prima Inmobiliaria and Industrias Bures between May-December 1992. It said following agreement with the Spanish government in early 1993, KIO committed to injecting Dollars 20m into Torraspapel. In April that year, Torras capitalised its Pta23.5bn debt with Torraspapel. With a loan of Pta14.8bn from the state Instituto de Credito Oficial, yet to be authorised, and Pta3.5bn in working capital earmarked by the KIO between 1993 and 1994, it said Torraspapel was on the way to recovery.</p>

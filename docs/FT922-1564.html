			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / International Company News: Expansion planned by Chicago Mercantile Exchange THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange plans to build a second trading floor directly above its current floor. The Dollars 26.6m (Pounds 14.3m), one-year project will double the CME's trading capacity and result in the world's largest exchange trading facility. The CME anticipated the expansion when it built its office tower in 1983. The building has 30,000 sq ft empty space where the new trading floor will be placed. Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, said the exchange needed to grow to alleviate crowding. Trading volume over the last decade had grown 222 per cent. 'Our most successful products - interest rates and currencies - are overcrowded to the point where new business opportunities may be missed if we do not make this move.' The exchange's plans to expand its index products, with new contracts on the Russell 2000 small capitalisation index, the FT-SE 100 and the Goldman Sachs commodity index have made the need for a larger space more urgent. The CME will move its interest rate and currency group products to the new floor next year. The floor will have 16 new trading pits and 770 member-firm booths. The Chicago Board of Trade, also overcrowded, is looking to build a new trading floor as well. However, the CBOT is housed in a 1929 landmark building without any expansion capability. The exchange is consequently looking at other sites, but any of these is expected to cost the exchange over Dollars 100m to construct.</p>

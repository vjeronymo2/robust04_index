			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 8 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Despite increasing  pressure to impose sanctions against the DPRK which, allegedly,  is developing its own nuclear weapons, Moscow maintains that  this problem should be tackled by an international six-plus-two  conference which has been suggested by Moscow. This was  reiterated today by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister  Aleksandr Panov to an ITAR-TASS correspondent.    "Our position has remained the same as before: We are for  the  conference, which should tackle this problem," the high-ranking  Russian diplomat said. "It should be considered multilaterally,  since the dialogue on the bilateral level has failed."    The Moscow initiative, which was confirmed by Russian  Federation President Boris Yeltsin at his recent talks with  President of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-sam, envisions the  convening of an international conference on security and  nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula, with the  participation of South and North Korea, Russia, the United  States, China, and Japan, as well as the United Nations and the  IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency). "We believe that  this is the way out of the situation," said Aleksandr Panov.</p>

Hebei's 110 deputies, who were deliberating Premier  Li Peng's "Government Work Report," were very happy when they  learned that General Secretary Jiang Zemin was coming to see  them.    At 9:10 A.M., General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Deputy Cheng  Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee,  entered the Hebei Hall of the Great Hall of the People chatting  to each other. The Hebei delegation of deputies, who were  waiting to have a group picture taken with the general secretary  in the hall, applauded warmly in welcome.    General Secretary Jiang Zemin cordially shook hands and  chatted with the Hebei deputies. The deputies extended  greetings to him. The atmosphere in the hall was warm and  relaxed in the few minutes before the group picture was taken.    After the group picture was taken with the delegation,  General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an ebullient speech. He  said: Hebei is very close to Beijing. I think I understand the  situation in Hebei. Hebei's work was done pretty well last  year. What I want to say is: The central authorities have  already set major policies -- that is, Comrade Xiaoping's  speeches made during his South China tour, the guidelines of the  14th party congress, and the 50 points set by the Third Plenary  Session of the party's 14th Central Committee. It is crucial to  do a good job of implementing them. First of all, we should  enable leading cadres at all levels to understand and grasp  these major policies. To help people grasp the 50 points,  relevant departments have produced a video with narratives for  study reference. We should study while working.    At this point, the general secretary incidentally asked  Deputy Ye Liansong, governor of Hebei Province: "What did you  major in college?" "I majored in engineering," Ye Liansong  answered. Then, the general secretary sighed with emotion and  said: "Many of our leading comrades majored in engineering and  technology. Now we are establishing a socialist market economy,  and it will not work without a knowledge of economics.  Economics is a great branch of science, but it cannot be  grasped overnight. So we must make arduous efforts to study it  and study it systematically." The general secretary then  continued to say: "Capitalist countries have been engaged in  market economies for hundreds of years, and they have indeed  gained some experience which reflects general patterns and it  would help us to learn. It is the first time that we have  established a socialist market economy. So it is all the more  necessary for us to study in practice. We have set major  policies. We should continue to explore new ways and gain more  experiences in practice. I place great hopes on you comrades.  I'll learn, practice, and work together with you."    Immediately following the general secretary's remarks, Cheng  Weigao said: "We will do our work conscientiously."    As he said farewell to the Hebei delegation, Jiang Zemin  cordially remarked: "I hope that Hebei reaps a good grain and  cotton harvest this year." At this, the deputies burst into  applause.</p>

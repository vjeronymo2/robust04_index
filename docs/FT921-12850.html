			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Wall Street heralds a profitable year - The changing rankings of securities houses in bumper times FOR Wall Street securities houses, 1992 has started in the nicest possible way - with a soaring stock market and a fresh wave of the tremendous issuance of new corporate debt and equity which helped make 1991 so very profitable. In just the first three weeks of this year, issues of investment grade debt in the US totalled more than Dollars 20bn - some 10 per cent of the entire 1991 total. Common stock issue volume was less dramatic, raising Dollars 1.78bn, 3.2 per cent of last year's tally, but investment bankers say equity deals in the pipeline indicate that the early months of 1992 will maintain last year's hot pace. The year 1991 itself proved a banner one, with total domestic financing volume reaching a record Dollars 586bn, up 88 per cent from 1990, the previous all-time high, according to IDD Information Services. And that, in turn, has translated into bumper profits for Wall Street, which derives much of its income from underwriting the sale of securities. Yet behind the overall growth lie some significant changes in the rankings of the Wall Street houses. For the fourth year running, Merrill Lynch maintained its position as the leading underwriter of all new issues - just one year short of the five-year record previously held by Salomon Brothers. It also headed the investment grade corporate debt league. Goldman Sachs maintained its number two position for total underwriting and rose from second to first place in common stock offerings, which are far more profitable for securities firms than debt issues. Lehman Brothers, an American Express offshoot which has suffered some big setbacks in recent years, jumped from seventh to third place in total domestic underwritings, thanks to an aggressive performance in the debt market. And Salomon Brothers, which has been the subject of a bond market scandal, dropped from fourth to seventh for all domestic issues. The two main factors behind last year's new issue wave were the steady decline in US interest rates and the concomitant surge in stock market prices. And both these driving forces were given a powerful new thrust on December 20 when the Federal Reserve took the highly unusual move of cutting the discount rate by a full point to 3.5 per cent. The timing of the cut, just before the Christmas holiday, means that many companies have only begun reacting in the first few weeks of this year. A key question now is whether this early surge can be sustained through the rest of 1992, a year which many expect to produce a gradual US recovery from recession and an eventual reversal of the downward trend of interest rates. Mr Grant Kvalheim, head of global capital markets at Merrill Lynch says that 'if interest rates stay at this kind of level its going to be a busy year.' However, rising rates could put a severe damper on the debt boom, while sharp downward corrections in the stock markets would have the same effect on equities, at least in the short-term. Says Mr Bob Scott, managing director in charge of the capital markets group at investment bank Morgan Stanley: 'If rates were to move higher for any reason, you could see the pace of (debt) financings slow quite quickly.' But whatever happens to the debt market, many on Wall Street expect equity issues to remain reasonably strong for several years as corporate America deleverages its balance sheets from the excesses of the 1980s, when companies' indebtedness rose sharply relative to equity. That process is now being sharply reversed: in 1991 equity issues totalled Dollars 54.8bn, compared to just Dollars 19bn in 1990 and Dollars 43.5bn in 1986, the previous record year. Factors behind the deleveraging include some companies' difficulties in servicing debt during the recession; banks' reluctance to extend new borrowings because of their own bad loan problems; and a fear among blue chip companies that if they do not improve their capital ratios they may risk downgrading by the credit rating agencies. Many companies which went private in the 1980s through highly leveraged buy-outs have returned to the equity market over the past year through initial public offerings (IPOs) of shares. The latest example is Burlington Industries, a textile group taken private five years ago by Morgan Stanley, which announced this week that it would return to the market with an Dollars 855m IPO. Bankers hint that even bigger deals are in the pipeline. Many other privately-owned businesses have been attracted to IPOs by the extremely high prices that the market is currently prepared to pay for shares. Last year, IPOs totalled Dollars 24bn, up from Dollars 10bn in 1990, and represented 44 per cent of the entire deluge of common stock. Some 40 per cent of the IPO offerings represented some kind of deleveraging. Mr Mike Ryan, managing director of the equity transactions group at Merrill Lynch, reckons that factors like these 'will prolong the trend of equity new issuance over the better part of the next few years.' He adds that the current level of the stock market means that 'companies which considered equity last year are now making it a serious priority at board level'. This substitution of equity for debt is a normal phenomenon which regularly takes place at this point in the economic cycle, although the sheer scale of the move towards debt in the 1980s may give added weight now to the swing back to equities. After all, 1991 was the first time in eight years that US companies issued more stock than they retired. Argues Mr Ryan: 'There was such an extended period in the 1980s, when debt was king, that the current (equity) cycle is going to be magnified on the upside, just to get back to a bit of equilibrium.' The surge in corporate debt issues has been a corollary of declining US interest rates, as companies have called in higher-priced bonds and issued new ones with lower rates. The belief that interest rates are near the bottom of the cycle, with perhaps one more Fed easing before monetary policy turns harder, has also been encouraging companies to bring forward future funding needs from the second half of this year. A big dilemma facing treasurers is whether to concentrate debt in cheap short-term instruments, such as commercial paper or move up the yield curve and issue more expensive, but much longer-term, bonds in the belief that long-term rates may not be this low again for many years. Says Morgan Stanley's Mr Bob Scott: 'Yields on US Treasury securities are at their lowest for about 12 years and companies have reason to assume that interest rates over the next 10 years will be higher than now.'</p>

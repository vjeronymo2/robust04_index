			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Ford may reshuffle German posts as cost pressures mount FORD-WERKE, the German subsidiary of the US motor group, yesterday refused to comment on reports that its American-born chairman is to be replaced by a German, writes Christopher Parkes. Mr John Hardiman, head of Ford-Werke for five years, is to return to the US and his post will be filled by Mr Albert Caspers, according to the industry newsletter, PS Report. Mr Caspers, currently vice-president responsible for engineering and manufacturing at Ford Europe, will shortly be joined in the German subsidiary's headquarters by Mr Heinz Soiron, Ford's general manager in Spain, the newsletter added. The reshuffle did not indicate that there was any dissatisfaction with Mr Hardiman, 59, who has worked in Europe for Ford for more than 30 years, PS Report suggested. It was prompted more by the need, detected by Mr Jacques Nasser, the new chief at Ford Europe, for a technical leader to oversee sharp cost reductions in line with those under way throughout the German motor industry. Mr Caspers has been in charge of all 24 Ford plants in Europe since 1989. Mr Soiron, recognised as a high-flier in Ford Europe, is expected to be appointed as sales director and Mr Caspers' deputy. Mr Roger Leite, current sales chief of Ford-Werke, is expected to be appointed northern group director of Ford Europe, the newsletter said. Mr Hardiman would 'probably' return to the US.</p>

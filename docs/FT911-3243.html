			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / New routes awarded to US carriers TWO of the three largest US airlines were yesterday awarded new route authorities between the US and Manchester Airport. At the same time NorthWest Airlines has been given approval to fly non-stop between Detroit and London while Virgin Atlantic Airways yesterday received clearance to start services from Heathrow to New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo. The US Department of Transportation said it had awarded a New York to Manchester route authority to American Airlines, and given a service between Atlanta and Manchester to Delta. It also awarded a back-up authority for the Delta route to USAir, one of the middle-ranking US carrier, to provide a service between Pittsburgh and Manchester. The department also granted NorthWest Airlines' request to reconsider its application to fly non-stop between Detroit and London. The airline was given emergency approval by the US authorities to operate the route until May 22. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways yesterday received clearance to start services from London's Heathrow airport to New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo from July 1. The date was earlier than expected. Virgin has fought to be able to fly from Heathrow in competition with British Airways and the big US carriers.</p>

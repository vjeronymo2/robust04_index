			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Anna Karenina - Tricycle Theatre Tolstoy dabbled in writing drama but he is not best remembered for plays. Even partial adaptations of his novels have been more successful than his plays. At the Tricycle, it is not 'the vasty fields of France' but the cool plains of Russia which Helen Edmundson (adaption) and Nancy Meckler (direction) cram into a black box in their compelling version of Anna Karenina for the Shared Experience company. At over three hours, the play still romps through the Russian countryside and blazes through Tolstoy's plot. Anna leaves a barren marriage to live with her lover; but society shuns them and her world disintegrates. Her story then interweaves with that of Levin and Kitty, building an ideal rural life outside the Moscow-Petersburg axis. Others have done Tolstoy faster - David O. Selznick's 1935 version was a shameless 95 minutes, mostly devoted to Greta Garbo - but the essentials are here. The Tricycle trick is to make Anna (Annabelle Apsion) and Levin (Richard Hope) into player-narrators of their own interlinked stories. They are always on stage, commenting or describing: Anna says 'You are Konstantin Levin, why are you here? This is my story' and Levin replies 'It seems it's mine too'. The staging places city against country, Anna's despair against Levin's hope: in one scene, Anna breaks with her husband (Gregory Floy) and Levin proposes to Kitty (Pooky Quesnel), while the rest of the cast party in the background - this is like good opera, where several things happen simultaneously. The eight actors generate intense energy in a minimal set; and the simple creative lighting (Ace McCarron) makes one wish more directors and designers could be this bold. The only design motifs are pairs of railway lines, like a metaphysical conceit from Marvell: infinite but never meeting and travelling but never arriving. It seems apt that Tolstoy died in a railway waiting room.</p>

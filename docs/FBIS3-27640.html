The meeting pointed out: The construction of these  five economic zones and one economic corridor will play an  important role in making Hunan rank among the country's top ten  provinces. These five economic zones and one economic corridor  will become the province's hi-tech industrial thoroughfare and  export-oriented economic belt. Provincial party and government  leaders Chen Bangzhu [governor], Chu Bo, Wang Keying, Tang  Zhixiang, and Pan Guiyu attended the meeting and expressed high  hopes for the five economic zones and one economic corridor.    In 1993, the cities where these five economic zones and one  economic corridor are located followed the requirements set by  the provincial party committee and government for making  breakthroughs and moving forward ahead of others in economic  construction. They made marked achievements in reform, opening  up, and economic construction. Calculated on 1990 comparable  prices, the five cities' GNP's amounted to 46 billion yuan, an  increase of 14.2 percent over the previous year and 1.6 percent  higher than the province's average. Their proportion to the  province's GNP increased.    The meeting asked major departments directly under the  provincial authorities to work out special plans to support the  construction and development of the five economic zones and one  economic corridor. The meeting explicitly demanded the  following: The five economic zones and one economic corridor  should directly transplant coastal areas' preferential policies  on reform and opening up, as well as coastal areas' successful  experience in this respect, and should apply them to large  regions so they can turn themselves into a rapidly developing  hi-tech industrial belt with strong functions and vitality. In  accordance with the provincial leaders' requirements, the  targets set for the five economic zones and one economic  corridor leading up to the year 2000 will be divided into three  parts: 1995, 1997, and 2000.    At the meeting, the relevant prefectures and cities made the  development program for the five economic zones and one economic  corridor more specific.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme  Council, has spoken out against the division of the Black Sea  Fleet. At a meeting with the Crimean Supreme Council deputies he  proposed that the Black Sea Fleet should not be regarded as an  object to be divided.    According to Moroz, the Black Sea Fleet should be used  jointly by Ukraine and Russia with the fleet remaining under a  unified joint command, and with Russia giving orders to one part  of the fleet and Ukraine to the other. There must be separate  commands for parts the parts, but a joint command as well, so  that the fleet should not be demolished as a fighting unit. The  Black Sea is a special interest zone for Ukraine and Russia.</p>

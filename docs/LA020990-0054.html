			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FREE THROWS HELP USD BEAT GONZAGA, TOP .500  </P> <P> The University of San Diego made 15 of 16 free throws down the stretch to win  its third West Coast Athletic Conference road basketball game in four tries,  73-65, over Gonzaga Thursday night.  </P> <P> The victory put USD (11-10, 6-3) over the .500 mark for the first time since  early in the season and gave them sole possession of second in the WCC with  idle Pepperdine (11-10, 5-3), which is at St. Mary's tonight.  </P> <P> USD point guard Wayman Strickland (12 points) was six for seven from the line  in the last nine minutes, and Pat Holbert, who scored a career-high 22 points,  was four for four.  </P> <P> Torero Coach Hank Egan also came up with his first victory at Gonzaga in six  years.  </P> <P> "It was nice to get a win up here," Egan said. "I'm pleased about two things  tonight. The first is that we won, and the second is I hear this is the last  McPhee.  </P> <P> Gonzaga senior Jim McPhee scored a game-high 29 points. His brother, Brice,  tormented the Toreros before Jim came along.  </P> <P> USD led, 33-25, at the half, but Gonzaga then used a 10-2 run to tie the score  at 35. The Toreros scored the next five points, but Gonzaga tied it again at  43.  </P> <P> But the Toreros then went on a 8-2 run to make it 51-45 with 9:14 left and were  never threatened after that.  </P> <P> "We started playing well right before we went into conference, and right now  we're getting a consistent performance game in and game out," Egan said.  </P> <P> USD, which next travels to Portland for a game Saturday night, also received 17  points and 10 rebounds from John Jerome. Holbert finished six for 12 from the  field, eight of nine from the line and had eight rebounds.  </P> <P> The Toreros shot 43% (23 for 54) from the field and 74% (25 for 34) from the  line. USD was outrebounded, 40-37, but had just 12 turnovers to Gonzaga's 15.  </P></p>

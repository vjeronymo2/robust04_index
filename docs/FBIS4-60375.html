			<p>BFN     [Text] The door of the old synagogue in Jericho has been  broken and its lock shattered. Local yeshiva students blame the  Palestinian policemen for the act. Major General Ilan Biran,  commander of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Central Command,  visited the place and said the issue is under investigation.  Answering a question, Maj. Gen. Biran said that according to the  agreement, every Israeli citizen is entitled to carry arms in  Jericho. Our correspondent notes that the yeshiva students in  the synagogue are armed.    Meanwhile, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is banning  Israeli  vehicles from entering Jericho. Even the passage of military  vehicles through the city requires a special permit. Our  correspondent Moti Amir assesses that this is done in order to  prevent unnecessary friction during 'Id al-Adha and the  celebrations accompanying the opening of the Palestinian  security service office in the city.</p>

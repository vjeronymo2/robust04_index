			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--The Government Wednesday [13 April] said it  had sound and convincing reasons for detaining 10 Islamists  being investigated for membership of an illegal group believed  to be planning "terrorist acts."    Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputies took the case of these  and other Islamists detained on security-related cases to Prime  Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali earlier this week and later  circulated their memorandum to the premier for publication in  local newspapers.    Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said the IAF should  have  waited to "hear the other side of the story" before releasing  their memorandum in the press.    Dr al-'Anani, in an interview with the Jordan Times, said  that Dr. al-Majali, who met with a delegation of the IAF  deputies Monday evening, "told them that arrests are not made  indiscriminately and that there were good reasons for the  detentions."    "The premier told them that we respect their request to  study  the issue but that since each story has two sides the premier  was going to investigate their charges and bring back the other  side of the story to them" Dr. al-'Anani said.    In their memorandum to the prime minister, the IAF deputies  listed names of 72 detainees, including the 10 arrested in  connection with an illegal group, and quoted relatives of some  of the detainees with claims of mistreatment.    All of the arrests, as specified in the list provided by the  IAF, have been made since the beginning of this year.    Ten people have been recently arrested for what security  sources said was establishing a "group planning terrorist  activities." The sources, quoted by the AL-RA'Y Arabic daily  Wednesday, said the group had "islamist ties" and was planning a  series of armed robberies of shops, taxis and at a later stage  banking institutions to collect funds for weapons.    The security sources said the group was headed by a 38-year  old man whom it did not name.    Amman Deputy Hamzah Mansur, the spokesman for the IAF's  parliamentary bloc, told the Jordan Times that their meeting  with the premier dealt with the detention of about 70 people on  charges of belonging to groups to destablise the Kingdom's  security or carry out terrorist attacks.    However, informed sources maintain that the conversation  mainly dealt with the detention of these last 10 Islamists. Mr.  Mansur said that the Monday meeting came after several similar  meetings with the prime minister over the detention of illegal  Islamist groups.    Asked why the IAF deputies decided to publicise this meeting  with the prime minister and not the ones before, Mr. Mansur  said: "We had received promises of quick releases and ensuring  humane and good treatment of the detainees."    But, he added, they went to see the prime minister "because  we felt that the issue still stands."    In a copy of a memorandum released Wednesday, the IAF asked  the premier to interject on behalf of 72 detainees in Jordanian  prisons and ensure that they receive treatment compatible with  accepted human rights standards.    The deputies said that while they did not condone the  actions  of the detainees they wanted to "protect the dignity and  freedoms of citizens as guranteed by the Islamic Sharia and our  constitution."    Mr. Mansur, in his telephone interivew with the Jordan  times,  said that the delegation also wanted the government to release  the detainees when investigations indicate that they were not  party to any illegal activity.    The IAF delegation which met with Dr. al-Majali was composed  of Mr. Masur, Amman Deputy Ibrahim Kaylani, Irbid Deputy  'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur, Amman Deputy Hammam Sa'id, al-Balqa'  Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah and al-Karak Deputy Ahmad al-Kasasibah.    "The delegation briefed the prime minister on the wave  arrests of citizens at this time and what accompanied these  arrests in practices that do not tally with citizens' freedoms  and rights as guaranteed by the Islamic Sharia and our  constitution," the IAF said in a statement Wednesday.    "The prime minister promised to study the memorandum and  deal  with it positively stressing that he will endeavour to apply the  law and protect the diegnity of citizens," it said.    In their letter to the prime minister, the IAF deputies  appeared to concentrate their defence on former Afghan fighters  who were arrested after security forces connected some of them  to a series of bomb blasts in third-class cinemas in Amman and  al-Zarqa.    "Jordan has never lived for itself alone but strove to serve  the nation and higher causes... from this vision some of our  young men flew to Pakistan and Afghanistan when that Islamic  nation fell under Soviet occupation and their deed was  compatible with the wishes of their people, government," the IAF  deputies said in their memorandum to the prime minister.    "People like these should under no circumstances be accused  unless we want to also accuse the Jordanians who answered the  call of duty in Palestine, Iraq, Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, and  others," the memo added.    "We refuse that contributing to help others of our faith in  Afghanistan be considered a crime," the memo concluded.    The IAF deputies also criticized what they said was a wave  of  arrests of university students. They also said that there were  "regretful events in the University of Jordan from parties known  to the security forces aimed to influence the students."    The deputies were particularly careful in their criticism of  the arrest of persons connected to bomb blasts and bombing  attempts. While condemning "any act which targets any  institution on the land of our country and any attempt to  destabilise the atmosphere in the country and hope that those  involved in these kind of acts would be referred to court," the  memorandum said, the IAF "also believes that a defendant remains  innocent and should exercise his right to defend himself until  proven guilty."    The IAF deputies also criticised the crackdown on members of  the Fatah Revolutionary Council (Abu-Nidal) group after their  group was connected to the gunning down of Jordanian diplomat  Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January.    "While we condemn this ugly crime against a faithful son of  Jordan we condemn the indiscriminate arrests," the memorandum  said.    Dr. al-'Anani said that the prime minister had listened to  the IAF's arguments and impressed on them that he believed there  were "sound and convincing reasons" for the detentions.    "But in light of the fact that they had come asking him to  look into the case and the charges of the relatives, the primier  said that he was going to check their claims and come back to  them with his findings," Dr. al-'Anani said.    Dr. al-Majali, the information minister said, also told the  IAF deputies that "he will make sure that justice takes its  course."</p>

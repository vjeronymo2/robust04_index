			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Christophe </F> Turowski; place and date not given: "Poland: Budgetary Dispute  -- Lech Walesa: `Government Lied to the Polish People'"]    [Text] For the last few months, President Lech Walesa has  been at loggerheads with Poland's government coalition. The  Polish president has challenged almost every project making up  the 1994 budget law passed on 5 March by Parliament, which  remains dominated by the post-communists. On 12 April the  President finally agreed to promulgate the budget. The  government anticipates a $3.77 billion deficit (4.1 percent of  GDP) and a 27-percent inflation rate. In an interview with "LE  FIG-ECO," Lech Walesa explains why he has taken so long to  approve the government's proposed budget.    [Turowski] Do you agree with those who claim that the  political situation is currently stabilizing in Poland?    [Walesa] Absolutely. Poland has been carrying out economic  reforms with a lot of rigor, but the lack of capital prevents us  from making more headway, and the West is still pondering the  same question: "to invest or not to invest in Poland?"    [Turowski] Supposing you were a foreign investor, would you  invest your money in Poland given the current political  situation?    [Walesa] Yes, because Poland is a large country which has  been developing very dynamically, a country with 40 million  citizens and free of ethnic, religious or other conflicts.    [Turowski] Why would you not sign the 1994 budget, which had  been approved by the IMF and the World Bank and would make it  possible to reduce Poland's debt to the Club of London faster?    [Walesa] Economically, the budget is sound, except for a few  details. But it is a liberal budget which does not conform to  the current government coalition's electoral promises.  <H5>  "Communist Methods" </H5>   So I ask the coalition this crucial question: why did you  lie  to the Polish people? Why did you promise that economic policy  would change, only to adopt now the same policies as those  followed four years ago by the party born of Solidarnosc ?    [Turowski] So it is politics above economics?    [Walesa] No. But I would like, once and for all, that the  Polish people be told the truth. On the other hand, the  Solidarnosc union had asked me not to sign the budget passed by  Parliament. This means it is opposed by part of the population,  and I also had to take that into account. The budget is  developed for the population, not the other way around.    [Turowski] Although it is now seeking your protection,  Solidarnosc had drifted a considerable distance away from you --  its charismatic leader -- at its last conference...    [Walesa] ...And lost its place in Parliament as a result.  Had Solidarnosc's leaders listened to me at the time, we would  all be in a different situation today. So the union is now  fussing about, trying a little blindly to define its direction  and its place in a society that changes fast, very fast.    [Turowski] The strikes sponsored by Solidarnosc over the  last few weeks have not been a massive success...    [Walesa] They can start again at any time if the population  is not taken seriously.    [Turowski] Do you really want to satisfy populist demands?  This would lead to increasing the money supply which would lead  to increased inflation in a very short time.    [Walesa] I do not share such fears, as the Polish  population has already given ample proof of its intelligence and  patience.    [Turowski] In a similar vein, you rejected the coalition's  candidate for the position of deputy prime minister and economy  and finance minister, a noted specialist who now works for the  United Nations. Thus because of you the Polish economy has been  leader- less for two months. Why?    [Walesa] The government coalition has an excessive regard  for communist management methods. The way things used to be was  that the Politburo would make every decision and all the  government had to do would be to carry out its orders.    Today, things are not the same: The role of the President of  the Republic is no longer to rubber-stamp and to keep his mouth  shut. For various reasons, I do not trust the only candidate  that was presented to me.    There are even politicians who say that I have been  destabilizing Poland; they are mistaken; I just want the men who  steer the Polish economy to be above reproach and to be true to  the promises made to the population.  <H5>  "Europe Bogged Down" </H5>   [Turowski] Let us now talk about relations between Poland  and Europe. You have been highly critical of these over the  last few months. What are your main concerns?    [Walesa] It are Western Europe's misconceptions about the  interests of our Old Continent. Harmonious cooperation between  Central and Eastern Europe is just as important for the latter  as it is for the West.    The association agreements between Poland and the European  Union give Poland a privileged position and, two years into  these agreements, Poland's trade balance is negative. How can  you expect me to be satisfied? Nevertheless, Poland filed its  formal application for European Union membership a few days ago.    [Turowski] Within the European Union, there are those who  say that Central and Eastern European countries must first  strengthen ties between themselves, and then apply together for  European Union membership. What is your opinion?    [Walesa] I want to remind you here that two years ago I  suggested that we should create our own versions of the EC and  NATO. Cooperation among countries located between the Vistula  [as published], Dnepr, and Danube rivers is essential, and it  has been growing. In this respect, much remains to be done.  Regardless of all good-neighborly relations and cooperation  treaties already signed, we must never cease to strengthen  economic relations.    However, this is not something that can be imposed by the  European Union or by ourselves. Only daily life and daily work  can bring us closer to this ultimate goal.    Today, Western Europe sometimes tends to look for rather  strange solutions, because it does not comprehend the changes  that have taken place in the East. There is no doubt that the  communist system has collapsed, while Western Europe has yet to  come to terms with the changes that take place every day in  Central and Eastern Europe. It is Europe that is now bogged  down while we are advancing at the double.</p>

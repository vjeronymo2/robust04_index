			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD / TAC OUTDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> O'BRIEN LANDS WORLD BEST IN DECATHLON LONG JUMP  </P> <P> Dan O'Brien set a world best in the decathlon long jump Tuesday and took the  lead in the Mobil Outdoor Track and Field Championships at Norwalk.  </P> <P> O'Brien, 23, of Portland, Ore., completed the first five events of the  demanding 10-event competition with 4,656 points. The previous first-day best  by an American was 4,526, set by 1968 Olympic gold medalist Bill Toomey at the  Mexico City Games.  </P> <P> Toomey's total, however, will stand as the American record, because O'Brien's  performance was wind-aided.  </P> <P> Defending champion Dave Johnson and Sheldon Blockburger, are tied for second  with 4,359 points.  </P> <P> "This was a little beyond my expectations," O'Brien said. "I always thought I  had the ability to put it together. Now I'm doing it."  </P> <P> In the long jump, O'Brien went 26 feet 4 1/2 inches on his third jump ,  breaking the mark of 26-3 set by Mike Herman in the 1960 national  championships.  </P> <P> Along with the record jump, O'Brien had the fastest time in the 100 meters, a  wind-aided 10.40 seconds; a 50-4 3/4 shotput, second-best in the 16-man field;  a 6-11 3/4 high jump, matching the top performance; and a 49.25 for 400 meters.  </P> <P> In the heptathlon, Cindy Greiner, a two-time Olympian making a comeback at 33,  led by nearly 100 points with 3,763 points after the 100-meter high hurdles,  shotput, high jump and 200-meter run.  </P> <P> Kym Carter was second with 3,666 points and NCAA champion Gea Johnson of  Arizona State was third with 3,659.  </P> <P> Today's final events in the heptathlon will be the long jump, javelin and 800  meters.  </P> <P> Track and Field Notes  </P> <P> Among the bigger names to commit to specific events Tuesday were Carl Lewis,  who will run in the 100 meters qualifying heats Thursday; Jackie Joyner-Kersee  in the long jump and shotput (but not the heptathlon, in which she holds the  world record), and Mary Decker Slaney in the 1,500 meters Friday. Athletes may  make general entries but must indicate three days before competition the  specific events in which they will compete. . . . Steve Scott of Upland and  formerly UC Irvine, will attempt to become the winningest active TAC competitor  when he tries for his seventh title in the 1,500. . . . Among the top U.S.  career records are George Gray's 10 titles in the shotput in the 1880s, Maren  Seidler's 11 women's shotput titles in the 1960s and '70s; Dorothy Dodson's 11  straight javelin titles from 1939 to 1949, and current star Evelyn Ashford's  five titles each in the 100 and 200 meters. Ashford will compete in only the  100 this week.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Syarhey Chyslaw under the "Party Activists" </F> rubric: "Democracy Under the Lash"]    [Text] The Civilian Control Commission [Hramadzkaya  Kantrolnaya Kamisiya -- HKK], which was created by democratic  parties and movements to safeguard the integrity of the  elections, has held a regular session. An increase in the  authority of this public association -- which was created at the  initiative of the Belarusian Association of Servicemen with the  United Democratic Party of Belarus, the Belarusian Popular  front, the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly, the Belarusian  Peasant Party, the Belarusian Christian Democratic Union, the  National Democratic Party of Belarus, the Party of People's  Accord, and the Association of Belarusian Language -- was  evidenced by the fact that it was joined by the United Agrarian  Democratic Party, the Union of Entrepreneurs, the Belarusian  Association of Invalids, and the Belarusian Environmental Party.    Participants in the session discussed the issues of  expanding  HKK structures throughout the Republic and concentrated their  attention on fraud committed by certain individuals seeking  nominations for president. With regard to these facts, the  following press statement was released:    "Mr. Kebich's initiative group was being formed through  state  power structures. Indicative of this is an example in the city  of Zhlobin, where a local school teacher, at his own request,  was included in Shushkevich's initiative group. Later, it  turned out that the same teacher, without being asked for his  consent, was included in Kebich's support group as well. In  this man's opinion, initiative groups in support of Kebich were  created according to the so-called telephone rule [not further  identified].    "During the recent session of the Defense Ministry  Collegium,  the defense minister of the Republic of Belarus was openly  campaigning in support of Kebich as well as against Shushkevich  and Lukashenka, regardless of the fact that our Army is to  remain outside of politics.    "At the Academy of Physical Training, the signature campaign  in support of Kebich is being conducted under an order from the  dean.    "Commanders of the Interior Troops have given orders to  their  subordinates to ensure that Interior Troop personnel vote for  Kebich.    "Managers of the enterprises, which are members of the  Belarusian Scientific and Industrial Association and support Mr.  Kebich, are trying to put under their control the creation of  district electoral commissions."    By the way, the HKK may be contacted by telephone at  36-09-09.</p>

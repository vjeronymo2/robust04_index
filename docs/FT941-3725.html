			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: In step with most intense competition Sir, You comment in your leading article on Europe's competitiveness ('How Europe can compete', March 9) that the poorest performance among European industries is in those most exposed to international competition. This is the reverse of the truth in the case of Europe's footwear industry. Unlike textiles, it has had no protection and yet has stood up to formidable low-cost competition far better than its US and Japanese equivalents. This is despite a severe handicap in exporting in that most third countries, including those with the most competitive industries, do not themselves accept imports. As a result EU footwear production has inevitably fallen. However, a recent study carried out by Brussels showed that, given world-wide free trade, this fall would actually be reversed. The industry has stood up well because it produces the world's best shoes, and because it has adapted skilfully to its ruinous trade environment. But it will only thrive if Brussels becomes much more determined than hitherto to win for it a level playing field in international trade.

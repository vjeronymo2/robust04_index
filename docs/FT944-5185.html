			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / VSEL's suitors fight a war of whispers: Robert Peston and Bernard Gray reveal the behind-the-scenes tactics of GEC and British Aerospace If, as expected, UK trade and industry secretary Mr Michael Heseltine decides this week to refer neither of the two bids for VSEL to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the stage will be set for the final battle for control of the submarine builder between the two rival bidders, General Electric Company and British Aerospace. Many see this as a skirmish in a longer war between the two British manufacturers - GEC's campaign, waged for more than a decade, to win control of BAe. Privately GEC's executives and advisers admit that the company's main reason for bidding for VSEL is a spoiling exercise. If GEC's bidding can force BAe to pay too much for VSEL - or if it can seize control of the shipbuilder itself - then BAe would be more vulnerable to any takeover offer from GEC. GEC does not, however, have the use of all normal takeover ammunition in its battle for VSEL. It promised the Ministry of Defence - a hugely important customer of all three companies - that it would refrain from publishing tracts designed to undermine the credibility of its rival. The MoD wanted to reduce the risk of an erosion of customer confidence in BAe, the UK's biggest defence contractor. But, as in all takeover battles, there is a secret war being waged by GEC and its advisers - the merchant bank Lazard Brothers and the stockbroker Cazenove - in which they express their views in confidential letters, such as the one to MPs leaked last week to the Financial Times, or in private conversations. The nub of the GEC case is that BAe has been leaking cash at an unsustainable rate. Similarly, BAe and its adviser, Kleinwort Benson, are equally damning about GEC's capabilities - especially its competence as a defence contractor. GEC's letter to MPs sets out claims about BAe's financial fragility, based on an analysis of BAe's listing particulars. It highlights five trends about BAe in the past three-and-a-half years: an operating profit margin before 'exceptional' provisions of less than 1 per cent on sales of more than Pounds 35bn; 'exceptional' provisions for liabilities in the order of Pounds 1.5bn; a cash outflow, before rights issues and the sales less purchases of businesses, of Pounds 2.5bn; a fall in shareholders' funds from Pounds 2.5bn to less than Pounds 1bn; a failure to resolve the problems in commercial aircraft and aircraft leasing. The letter says that VSEL's cash would therefore be 'absorbed in covering the cash outflow arising from the large losses accruing in other parts of its (BAe's) business'. The financial snapshot of BAe is made to look even more gory. A claim that total effective indebtedness is more than Pounds 1bn is for example made by including two classes of preferred securities which have some of the characteristics of debt and also the company's net exposure to aircraft leases. Similarly, BAe's net assets are reduced sharply by deducting items not found in the accounts of many substantial companies. These include: prepayments to its pension fund of Pounds 113m; undepreciated costs of launching aircraft at Pounds 486m; the capitalised costs of rationalising operations, totalling Pounds 343m. In response, BAe says that this analysis is based on a highly selective use of financial data and is backward-looking. Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe finance director, said yesterday: 'There is nothing in these figures which is new to either our investors or our bankers, both of whom apply far greater due diligence in interpreting BAe's accounts.' He said that the Pounds 2.5bn cash outflow did not give a true picture of operating performance because it included a Pounds 1.2bn reduction in cash held on account for customers. It also included a Pounds 900m cash drain relating to businesses - such as the Rover carmaker - now sold. He said: 'Confidence is about the future. During the course of the VSEL bid, and unlike GEC, BAe has consulted with its large shareholders extensively, and the management team has their full backing. This was clearly shown by the successful underwriting of the two-part rights issue to finance the VSEL deal two weeks ago.' Nonetheless there could be further cash outflows at BAe. At the end of last year, its balance sheet contained Pounds 1.34bn of provisions to cover future costs, such as the net exposure to aircraft leases mentioned earlier and the forecast expenses of reorganising its businesses. As the reorganisation is carried out over the coming months and redundancy expenses are incurred - or as lease payments are made without receipt of rental income - then provisions will be translated into cash payments. BAe's campaign concentrates on GEC's management and export record. Put another way, GEC's propaganda is aimed mainly at the stock market, while BAe's is probably more effective in influencing opinion in Whitehall and Westminster. BAe, for example, believes that GEC has not been able to establish itself as a credible defence prime contractor - a role it would have to take as owner of VSEL or indeed of BAe. It alleges poor performance - project mismanagement, late delivery - in three contracts worth Pounds 3.4bn in aggregate: the Nimrod early warning radar system, the Spearfish torpedo and the Foxhunter radar system for Tornado aircraft. BAe has collated considerable evidence on GEC's relationship with its workforce, which it describes as 'poor'. In GEC Marconi Avionics, GPT, Yarrow shipbuilders and GEC Switchgear it cites examples of strikes or breakdowns in talks with unions. BAe is also critical of GEC's management of its Yarrow shipbuilding business, where growth in sales per employee is alleged to be worse than that of Vosper Thornycroft, an independent company, and no better than VSEL's. BAe also points out that Yarrow has been largely unsuccessful in winning overseas business. However, in the run-up to the trade secretary's decision this week, BAe's strongest card may be its analysis of GEC's assurances on job security and research and development given during its last big bid. GEC has said it will keep Yarrow open for seven years were it to acquire VSEL. When GEC and Germany's Siemens made a joint bid for Plessey, the MMC report and bid documents contained statements that the two companies had 'no intention' of cutting employment at the acquired businesses and would retain their independent research facilities. BAe's analysis shows that Siemens has stuck to these intentions but that employment at Plessey defence subsidiaries acquired by GEC has been cut by 39 per cent. It also points out that Siemens expanded the R&amp;D facility which it bought, while GEC closed Caswell, Plessey's silicon research group. However, such arguments may soon be irrelevant. If, as is likely, the trade secretary allows GEC's bid to proceed, the battlefield will switch exclusively to the stock market.</p>

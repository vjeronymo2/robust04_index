The fundamental reason leading to Hao Po-tsun's direct  challenge to Li Teng-hui at the standing committee meeting held  on 8 December was Hao's complete disappointment of Li's  so-called principle of sincerity and trust. He tried to make use  of his speech at the meeting to inform countrymen about the  possibility of Li Teng-hui's plan to move up the date for the  direct presidential election. There were three reasons that led  to what happened at the standing committee meeting.    1. On the previous day of the meeting, Hao Po-tsun learned  from a newspaper report that the State Policy Center had begun  to carry out studies on constitutional amendments toward  something similar to the "Fifth Republic" which was often called  the "semi-presidential system" or the "two-chief system."    2. Factions and groups of the National Assembly and the  "pro-Li Teng-hui" deputies of the National Assembly covertly  gathered together from time to time, planning to amend the  Constitution on a large scale in the form of revising the text  of the constitution in April next year.    3. He was also prompted by Hsu Li-nung's withdrawal from the  Kuomintang and Li Teng-hui's plan to dispel Feng Hu-hsiang from  the party.    Hao Po-tsun was fully prepared to deliver his speech at the  8 December standing committee meeting. Early in the morning on 8  December, he went to his office on the Chungshan Road North to  call his aides to help him draft a written statement. Meanwhile  he also personally prepared a five-point gist of his speech,  which he later pointed out to Li Teng-hui. The contents of his  speech were similar to those of the agreement reached by the  four Kuomintang heads, namely Li (Li Teng-hui), Hao (Hao  Po-tsun), Chiang (Chiang Yen-shih) and Sung (Sung Chu-yu) at the  Taipei Guest House on 11 March 1992 prior to the Third Plenary  Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee. On top of this, he  also added the contents of the confidential documents which he  and several scholars prepared prior to the 14th National  Kuomintang Congress to "save the party, protect the Constitution  and safeguard the nation." These contents were also parts of his  speech when he spoke to the overseas Chinese in Washington D.C.,  during his second trip to the United States.    Hao Po-tsun arrived at the Central Committee Conference Hall  on time. No one knew that this Kuomintang Vice Chairman who very  seldom made speeches on several occasions had two statements to  make. The meeting went on smoothly. When discussions were made  on the fourth item of the agenda and after Minister Kuo Wei-fan  finished his report on relevant issues concerning the  "University Law," many standing committee members one after  another expressed their views on various questions on the  University Law, the education system, and the allocation of  funds to public and private schools. When discussions on this  topic ended, participants of the meeting had begun to pack their  things and were making preparations to break up. Li Teng-hui  also made a concluding remark. He asked: "Are there any  questions? If there is no question, we will then ... [HSIN HSIN  WEN ellipsis]. Li Teng-hui did not have time to say that "the  meeting is now over." It was at that time that Hao Po-tsun who  sat in the front row on Li Teng-hui's left side suddenly raised  his hand seeking to say something. Although another standing  committee member Kuan Chung also raised his hand, Hao Po-tsun  ignored this comrade. Even without waiting for Li Teng-hui to  call his name, Hao stood up on his own and put forward a  provisional motion. At that time, some participants had already  packed up their things, while others had half finished their  packing. However, all of them were shocked by Hao's sudden  movement, and unanimously looked at him while holding their  breaths.    As soon as Hao Po-tsun opened his mouth, he said: "I hope  everyone would excuse me if what I say today is impolite or  inappropriate to the chairman or any participant of this  meeting, because what I say today is entirely for the party and  the nation."    Hao Po-tsun then took out the notes he prepared and began to  read. In addition to what was on the notes, he also bluntly  said: "I disagree if anyone seeks to change the current system  to a two-chief system and to increase the presidential power. I  also disagree if the president tends to favor the president-led  system. The president-led system involves many things. It is too  complicated. It involves so many things that even the  constitutional government system will vacillate. In the past,  only issues such as the popular election of appointees or of the  president and the term of the legislature were being discussed.  Is it strange that all of sudden there are so many problems  cropping up? In principle, we hope that we are not going for the  president-led system. Our system should be similar to that in  Singapore. The Singapore president is also elected by popular  votes, but there is no president-led system there. According to  the provisions of the constitution, the president should not  enjoy so much administrative power. I believe that the party  should restrain itself in this respect!" He also said directly  to Li Teng-hui: "It is known outside that the high authorities  have a plan to move up the date for the direct presidential  election. It is not so good to let people think in such a  manner. It may create great disorder. It would also become a  resource for trouble. It is hoped that Chairman Li would be able  to clarify this point and inform people that he has no plan to  do so!"    Hao Po-tsun then took out the note of his second written  statement. That was the note of his speech delivered at the  "Forum for National Construction" in Washington D.C. in the  United States on 13 November. Hao Po-tsun requested that his  speech be put into the record of the standing committee meeting  after he finished reading the note.    During Hao Po-tsun's speech, Li Teng-hui did not look too  well. Nor did he look at Hao Po-tsun. When the latter finished  half of his speech, Li Teng-hui all of sudden seemed lost in  thought. He began to lower his head and took notes. As for those  who were listening, some acted tense with their hearts beating  fast. One staff member even nudged another one sitting next to  him, saying: "Look, the Chairman was mad at all times!"  Nevertheless when Hao Po-tsun sat down after he finished reading  his statements, Li Teng-hui stood up and sought to give a  ruling. However, for a moment he did not know what to do when he  stood there. After pulling himself together, he then replied  while nearly "gnashing his teeth." Some one who was present at  the meeting said that Li Teng-hui was so excited that he had  twice addressed "Vice Chairman Hao" as "Chairman Hao." Li  Teng-hui said: "What Chairman Hao (that was the first time he  wrongly addressed Hao) just said was a rumor outside the party.  There is no need to put such rumor into the record, because  there is simply no such thing. I have never made any decision on  this issue from the beginning to the present moment. All this  does not count. How can we put this thing into the record? Let  the Policy Coordination Commission handle this matter!"    Li Teng-hui kept on talking. Originally he planned to turn  over Hao Po-tsun's written statements to the Policy Coordination  Commission for handling, but he once again thought that it was  inappropriate, and changed his mind. He said: "If this matter is  rashly put on the record and subject to official discussion, it  would then become a source of trouble, because outsiders would  think that we are once again not on good terms, shouting and  bickering. What should we do then? All this would certainly  create disorder within the party!"    Li Teng-hui again said: "In fact, no decision was made on  how the president should be elected. This matter was only  touched upon during the last meeting on constitutional reform."  Participants said, it was at that moment that Li Teng-hui  started to look slightly relaxed and less solemn. Looking  around, he said to Lin Cheng-chih, a national assemblywoman and  Chairman of the Committee on Work Concerning women,: "In fact,  no decision has been made even now on the form concerning the  presidential election, the term of the legislature and the  Premier's authority to countersign. I believe, we must study the  issue on the premier's authority to countersign. Otherwise, the  premier has to countersign his own resignation when he decides  to step down. Is there such thing in the world?" Lin Cheng-chih  promptly nodded. Li Teng-hui went on saying: "Right now, there  is no need to discuss these issues. Nor should they be put on  the record. The Party's Central Committee will set up a group  concerning constitutional reform by the end of December. It is  hoped that Vice Chairman Hao and other relevant Central Standing  Committee members and those cadres in charge of day-to-day  business would be able to participate in the group to discuss  issues!" At that moment, he stood up to see if anyone had any  more question. Right after that, he said: "The meeting is now  over." During that short period, no one raised any hand or  spoke. Even Hao Po-tsun himself kept quiet. [passage omitted]</p>

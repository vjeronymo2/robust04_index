CRA Chairman Sergio Kawi, in a petition he submitted last 18  January to the Commission on Elections [Comelec], disputed  claims that there was a "failure of elections" in the five  Kalinga Apayao towns during the January 1991 plebiscite.    "There was no continuous uneasy peace and order  necessitating  the failure to elect/vote as shown by the fact that the 1992  local and national elections were peacefully held in the area,"  Kawi said in his petition.    But it was the "uneasy peace and order" that initiated the  electoral protest.    Then Kalinga Apayao Rep. William Claver said that there was  a  "failure of elections" because 7,309 voters were disenfranchised  in 28 village precincts in Pinukpuk, Balbalan, and Conner towns.    Former rebel priest Conrado Balweg, head of the Cordillera  People's Liberation Army, blamed the members of the New People's  Army who, he said, snatched the ballot boxes in these areas and  41 other villages in Tanudan and Tinglayan towns.    "There was an election but the votes were not counted," he  said.    Kawi said that under the Omnibus Election Code, another  election should proceed 30 days after the electoral protest was  upheld.    "Matagal nang nag-lapse ang 30 days [thirty days went by a  long time ago], why would they hold the plebiscite only now?" he  asked.    A special plebiscite was actually set on 19 January 1991 --  30 days after the Comelec called for a special plebiscite in  Kalinga Apayao -- but the military conducted an operation  [oplam] named Oplan Redlips in Conner and even declared three  villages as a "no man's land."    Only Ifugao voted for the autonomous region. Kalinga Apayao  had 27,898 "No" votes as against 17,919 "Yes" votes, leaving a  margin of 9,979.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Wafd Party Leader Fu'ad Siraj-al-Din has issued the  following statement: Even before the blood of martyrs drawn by  the bullets of Israel's monster in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque had  dried up, the world was surprised by a statement attributed to  the U.S. President that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of  Israel. The statement was a shock to human feelings and to the  legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. It was also a  flagrant violation of the international agreements on  maintaining the legal status of Jerusalem and ran counter to  U.S. policy itself, which meticulously refrained from  recognizing the city as the capital of the Israeli state.    President Clinton's surprise behavior is an indication of  the indecision of the U.S. Administration, which on the one hand  speaks about peace and on the other pours fuel on the fire, thus  inflaming the feelings of Arabs and Muslims who no longer  believe in the usefulness of the new world order headed by the  United States.    The surprise U.S. decision has swept away all the dreams for  peace and stability in the Middle East. Its dire consequences  will appear sooner or later because insulting Arab ideals and  feelings cannot go unpunished. The Arab people are capable of  regaining their dignity even if they are disappointed by their  governments, who have adopted an impotent stance on the U.S.  decision.    Condemning this unjust decision, the Wafd Party calls on all  national parties, organizations, and forces to stand together  against this impending danger threatening the Arab nation. The  U.S. Administration must know that the voice of the people is  stronger than it thinks.</p>

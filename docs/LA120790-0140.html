			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Roberts Returns to Broadcasting: Kenneth J. Roberts, the former concert  promoter who built KROQ-FM in Los Angeles into a rock radio giant before  selling it for a then-record $45 million in 1986, has jumped back into the  local broadcast scene with the acquisition of two small FM stations.  </P> <P> Roberts said he has agreed to purchase KOCM-FM in Newport Beach and its sister  station, KSRF-FM in Santa Monica, for $17.7 million. The two stations, both  broadcasting at the same frequency -- 103.1 megahertz -- are owned by companies  controlled by businessman Steven Udvar-Hazy, broadcast executive Jack Siegal  and attorney Leonard Weinberg, all of Los Angeles. Roberts said the transfer of  ownership should be completed by March 1.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report compiled by "knysz": "Center for Research on Public </F> Opinion--Confidence Fluctuations"]    [Text] The president and the police are losing  confidence among the people. Meanwhile, the Army, television,  and church continue to hold strong positions.    Both the president and the police have lost the confidence  of  8 percent of those people polled over the past month. The  survey was conducted at the end of March, which was after our  article on corruption in the Poznan police department appeared  and after the president dismissed Marek Markiewicz from the post  of chairman of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting  Council.    Those who were polled also have somewhat less confidence  than  a month ago in the two trade unions--the All-Polish Trade Unions  Agreement and Solidarity (a fall of 3 percent, but the change is  within the statistical margin of error).    The confidence ratings of the Sejm, the senate, the  government, the Army, television, and the church have not  changed.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The poll was conducted on 23-29 March, utilizing a random,  representative sample of 1,197 adult Poles.</p>

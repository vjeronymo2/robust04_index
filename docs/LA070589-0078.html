			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVINGS ARE KEY TO GLOBAL PROSPERITY, WORLD BANK SAYS  </P> <P> More saving by Americans and others is a key to international prosperity, the  World Bank said Tuesday in its annual review of economic development.  </P> <P> The World Bank is the largest source of aid for Third World countries, lending  over $21 billion in the past 12 months.  </P> <P> "The fundamental problem is a shortage of world saving," said Stanley Fischer,  one of the bank's vice presidents and its chief economist.  </P> <P> "We focus very much in economics on the U.S. budget deficit, but that's only  one aspect of the shortage of world saving," he said.  </P> <P> Because Americans do not save enough to meet the borrowing needs of both  government and business, the government has to borrow from the savings of other  countries to deal with the budget deficit. And government demand for money  helps keep interest rates high.  </P> <P> Greater savings would make more money available, thereby holding down interest  rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for business to borrow for the  expansion that creates more goods and more jobs.  </P> <P> Fischer said that countries all over the world need to encourage saving.  </P> <P> The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development finds that of 19  major countries, citizens of Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and  Sweden saved less by percentage than American households did last year.  Japanese, West Germans, French, Swiss, Belgians, Spaniards and Italians saved a  lot more.  </P> <P> Reducing interest rates may be the most important thing that rich countries can  do for the Third World, said Fischer, who presented the World Bank's 1989 World  Development Report.  </P> <P> The report challenged a key tenet of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's  Third World debt strategy. It said developing countries will not be able to  count on more money from Western lenders even if a reduction in their foreign  debt makes them more credit-worthy.  </P> <P> "All the evidence points to continued low capital flows to the developing  countries in the coming decade," the Bank said. "Official flows cannot fully  offset the sharp reduction in private flows."  </P> <P> The report said a reduction in the Third World's $1.3-trillion debt might  significantly improve the investment climate and thereby encourage the return  of flight capital. But it also said debt reduction could lead to a sharp  decline in new money and possibly even to an increase in net outflows, which  would depress investment.  </P> <P> "These considerations reinforce the view that continued and powerful structural  adjustment by the debtor countries remains the most important ingredient in  dealing with the debt problem," the report said.  </P> <P> Millard F. Long, the American who led the team that prepared the 1989 report,  compared the situation in the Third World to the savings and loan crisis in  this country.  </P> <P> "We found institution after institution which, we can say, were technically  insolvent, much as our savings and loans are in the United States," he said.  </P></p>

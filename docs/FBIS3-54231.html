			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent in Jerusalem Nadav Shragay] </F>   [Text] A joint governmental and Jerusalem Municipality  committee of experts states that unless a series of activities  involving construction and expansion is implemented in the  greater Jerusalem area, the city will become a "deadend city,"  with Arab building activity closing in on the city from the  south, north, and east.    An interim report submitted by the committee deals with the  area that was to be included in the greater Jerusalem area by  the national unity government in 1987 -- from Bet El in the  north, Hebron in the south, Mitzpe Yeriho in the east, and Bet  Shemesh in the west. The report states that "Jerusalem will  wither" unless large areas within the greater Jerusalem area are  treated as areas set aside for the city's expansion.    The classified report was submitted two days ago to Mayor  Ehud Olmert and three of his aides -- Uri Lupoliansky, Me'ir  Porush, and Shmu'el Me'ir -- who are in charge of planning and  construction at the Jerusalem Municipality.    According to the committee's figures, 1.125 million people  --  55 percent of them Jews and 45 percent Arabs -- currently reside  in the greater Jerusalem area. Some 47 percent of the greater  Jerusalem area residents -- 72 percent of them Jews and 28  percent Arabs -- live in Jerusalem proper. The committee  assesses that by 2010, the weight of the Arab population in  Jerusalem itself will grow to 31 percent, with 69 percent Jews.    According to the report, 48 percent of the greater Jerusalem  area population -- 90 percent of them Arabs and 10 percent Jews  -- lives outside Jerusalem proper today. An additional 5  percent of the population resides in "the rest of the district,"  mainly in the western part of the greater Jerusalem area.    In one of the working papers submitted to the directors  general committee on Jerusalem in the last few years, it was  stated that "it will be necessary to operate in the greater  Jerusalem area -- within the city's municipal borders and beyond  them -- on the basis of two different sets of laws. At the same  time, it will be impossible to act toward maintaining a  demographic balance and to expand construction within  Jerusalem's municipal area without implementing compatible,  albeit different, moves across the Green Line."    The interim report submitted by the committee outlines such  moves. One of the experts involved in the Greater Jerusalem  area planning work has said that what is involved here is a de  facto annexation of the area surrounding the city, even if this  is camouflaged in various formulations.    According to the expert, the obvious intention is to award  the Jerusalem area a special status within the framework of any  possible future arrangement on the West Bank. Even if this area  will not be under the jurisdiction of Israeli law, it will have  a clear, practical link to Jerusalem.    In order to attain this objective, the committee recommends  expanding Ma'ale Adumim in the direction of Jerusalem; linking  it territorially to Pisgat Ze'ev; linking Giv'at Ze'ev to the  Ramot neighborhood; and expanding the 'Etzyon Bloc toward Betar  and the 'Adulam region.    The committee recommends that road No. 45 from Modi'in to  'Atarot in northern Jerusalem be built immediately and that all  the land necessary be expropriated toward that end. The  committee's plans call for creating "joint Jewish-Arab zones"  for industrial and tourism projects between Modi'in and 'Atarot  along road No. 45.    The committee also recommends separating Arab and Jewish  residential areas and treating the greater Jerusalem area as a  unified functional space with open borders and a joint economic  framework with Jerusalem.    The committee's steering team, which is continuing the  greater Jerusalem area planning work, is headed by Shemaryahu  Kohen, formerly head of the Jerusalem District in the  Construction and Housing Ministry, and Professor Adam Mazor.</p>

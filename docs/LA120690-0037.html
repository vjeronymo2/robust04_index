			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORSE TIGERS PILE UP HONORS AS THEY PILED UP VICTORIES;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: FIVE FROM UNBEATEN TEAM NAMED TO FIRST TEAM, TWO TO  SECOND TEAM IN THE TIMES' ALL-COUNTY SELECTIONS.  </P> <P> Morse High School is being called by many as the greatest team in San Diego  Section history. The Times' 1990 All-County selections illustrate seven reasons  why.  </P> <P> Five Tigers were named to the first team and two made the second team, making  Morse one of the most represented schools in the 13 years The Times' has  selected all-county teams.  </P> <P> Rancho Buena Vista had three players on the first team for the third year in a  row (the Longhorns had four in 1988), including one of the running backs. An  Aliipule from Rancho Buena Vista also has been on the first team three years in  a row. Don Aliipule has made it the past two years, Al Aliipule in 1988.  </P> <P> Point Loma had brothers La'Roi and Darcel Glover at defensive ends. La Jolla  Country Day, the 1-A eight-man champion, placed two juniors on the first team.  </P> <P> In all, there are six juniors on the first team, two more than the past two  years combined.  </P> <P> Players are selected by the Times' high school football writers based on  performances during the regular season and recommendations from coaches around  the county.  </P> <P> A look at the 1990 first team:  </P> <P> DEFENSE  </P> <P> Darnay Scott, Kearny, wide receiver -- Scott, one of the county's top Division  I recruits, had 23 receptions for 456 yards, a 19.6 per-catch average, despite  being double- and triple-teamed all season. Scott (6-feet-3, 190 pounds) also  had a county-high nine interceptions as a free safety. His 14 touchdowns came  five different ways -- on punt, kick and interception returns, on receptions  and on runs.  </P> <P> Kris Plash, Orange Glen, wide receiver -- A reliable possession receiver,  Plash, a junior, can be elusive once he gets the ball. He's superb in Orange  Glen's short passing game and has a knack for getting the necessary yardage for  first downs. Coach Rob Gilster says Plash has dropped only one pass in two  years. He was third in the county this season with 51 receptions for 758 yards.  </P> <P> Donnie Edwards, Chula Vista, tight end -- As a leader and person, Edwards is a  coach's delight. Add size (6-3, 195), quickness and skills, and Edwards, in  Coach George Ohensorgen's words, "stuck out like a sore thumb." On offense,  Edwards bolstered a line that enabled four Spartan backs to ahve big seasons.  As a linebacker, Edwards keyed a defense that finished second in the county.  Edwards lettered three years in football and baseball and two in basketball.  </P> <P> Don Aliipule, Rancho Buena Vista, offensive line -- Aliipule comes right out of  the mold of former section player of the year, Jack Harrington. The Longhorns  do only one thing -- run -- and they do it behind the mobile Aliipule. He is as  athletic as any player on the team, including Markeith Ross, except Aliipule is  240 pounds and delivers crunching blocks.  </P> <P> Salua Poutoa, Morse, offensive line -- The leader of perhaps Morse's best  offensive line ever, Poutoa (6-0, 295) helped open holes for a backfield that  gained more than 3,500 yards in 10 games. "I think he's the real spark plug on  our team," Coach John Shacklett said. "He's the leader. He has tremendous  pride, and he set the standard for our offensive line."  </P> <P> John Moe, Morse, offensive line -- Another outstanding member of a line that  helped Morse average 48 points a game during the regular season, Moe (6-2, 270)  ranks with some of the best blockers ever to play for the Tigers. He has great  technique and mobility on pulls and traps, and has smarts to go with it. He  carry's a 3.1 grade-point average in school and plans to attend the Naval  Academy next year.  </P> <P> John Michels, La Jolla, offensive line -- Coach Dick Huddleston called Michels,  who is 6-7, 230, an intense player who learned schemes quickly and made good  adjustments. Michels also played defense, where he displayed great quickness  and lateral movement. A 3.8 student, Michels has orally committed to play at  USC. "He's made good progress, and he's getting tougher all the time,"  Huddleston said.  </P> <P> Jason Abraham, San Marcos, offensive line -- Described as a late bloomer by  Coach Ken Broach, Abraham (6-3, 215) started only a couple games as a junior.  But this year at left tackle, he was one of the main reasons junior fullback  Mark Frazier rushed for more than 1,900 yards. "We usually ran behind him when  we needed tough yards," Broach said. "He got better each week. I think he  surprised himself more than anybody." Broach added that it was Abraham's  athletic ability -- he also plays basketball and baseball -- that allowed him  to dominate.  </P> <P> Teddy Lawrence, Morse, quarterback -- Morse used to compare all its great  athletes to former football/basketball standout Keith McGee. Lawrence (5-9,  175) now sets the standard. Coach John Shacklett said Lawrence is the best  athlete he's ever coached. Shacklett said Lawrence was reluctant to play  quarterback at first, but he flourished in Morse's option set, rushing for  1,158 yards during the regular season and a county-best 19 yards per carry. He  also threw seven touchdown passes and just one interception in 48 attempts.  </P> <P> Gary Taylor, Morse, running back -- Taylor (6-0, 165) became the second junior  in a row to lead the county in rushing with 1,977 yards in 170 carries. He was  second in the county with 25 touchdowns, yet Coach John Shacklett said he may  be one of the Tigers' most improved players. A quick, tough back with great  cutting ability, Taylor has improved his field vision and ability to find holes  throughout the season.  </P> <P> Markeith Ross, Rancho Buena Vista, running back -- Rancho Buena Vista has had  three of the county's four 2,000-yard rushers heading into this season -- Scott  Garcia, O.J. Hall and Ross, who had 2,242 last year. Ross gained 1,622 yards  this season, but the county's all-time leading rusher (5,285) combines the  moves of Garcia and the speed of Hall. As a result, he had 26 touchdowns,  including scoring runs of 83, 80, 72, 64, 59, 49, and 41 yards. His 158 points  put him ahead of some select company, including Lincoln's Marcus Allen (156,  1977). Ross (5-10, 180) is a bona fide game-breaker, and Bell said his blocking  is underrated.  </P> <P> Eric Abrams, La Jolla Country Day, kicker -- A second-team selection in 1989,  Abrams was again impressive this season. In 11 games, Abrams made 74 of 76  extra-point conversions (three others were blocked), placing him second in the  section record book behind Rancho Buena Vista's Abel Lopez, who had 81 in 14  games last year. In addition, every one of Abrams' 100 kickoffs carried into  the end zone, which in high school cannot be returned. Just a junior, Abrams is  already second on the career conversion list with 125, and he is third in  career points with 140. Abrams has been called by at least one scouting service  as the premier junior kicker in the nation.  </P> <P> DEFENSE  </P> <P> Mike Johnson, Southwest, defensive line -- Defensive player of the year in the  Metro Conference for the second consecutive year, Johnson was one of only four  juniors on The Times' first team in 1989. Johnson, who also played on the  offensive line, led Southwest (9-3) to a second-place finish in the Metro. A  dominating pass rusher and run defender, Johnson (5-11, 225) led the Raiders in  tackles and sacks for the second year in a row.  </P> <P> Darcel Glover, Point Loma, defensive line -- Quickness may earn Darcel Glover a  spot on a Division I college team. Coach Bennie Edens says Glover, a senior  defensive end, has improved his grades since last season, making him more  attractive to college coaches. "A year ago his (school) work habits weren't  real good," Edens said. "He has always been in advanced classes, but he hadn't  achieved at the level of his ability. Now he has settled down and he's doing  great." San Diego State, among others, has shown interest. Glover is the senior  member of Tag Team Glover. His younger brother, La'Roi, was Point Loma's other  starting defensive end. Darcel (6-2 1/2, 225) finished the season with 32  tackles, 10 assists and 5 1/2 sacks. He also doubled as a back-up receiver.  </P> <P> La'Roi Glover, Point Loma, defensive line -- Coach Bennie Edens said Glover, a  strong, overpowering defensive end, could be the best lineman in Point Loma's  history. "He's a dominating football player," Edens said. "He's very intense,  quick off the ball and very aggressive." La'Roi, a 6-2, 265-pound junior,  starts on defense with his older brother, Darcel, and outweighs him by 40  pounds. The Glover brothers helped anchor a defense that gave up an average of  9.3 points a game during the regular season. La'Roi had 43 tackles, 18 assists  and eight sacks; he also started at guard on offense.  </P> <P> Gary Walton, Helix, defensive line -- A good athlete who also plays basketball,  Walton (6-4, 235) was a big reason Helix led the county in defense, allowing  2.3 points per game during the regular season. "Gary is a good demonstration of  commitment and hard work," Coach Jim Arnaiz said. "He will go down in our  record books as one of the best defensive lineman we've had."  </P> <P> Abdul McCullough, El Camino, linebacker -- Coach Herb Meyer couldn't find a  position for McCullough during spring practice. McCullough (5-11, 185) was  auditioned at tight end, running back and defensive end, before he settled in  at outside linebacker. McCullough replaced Ricky Spears, who now plays for Cal,  as the Wildcats' big-play linebacker. Selected as defensive player of the year  in Avocado League, McCullough had 13 sacks among his 33 tackles and returned  all three of his interceptions for touchdowns. "He's like a garbage man in  basketball," Meyer said. "He's always around the ball." McCullough scored a  fourth touchdown while playing tight end.  </P> <P> Wayne Pittman, Mira Mesa, linebacker -- Another outstanding athlete that played  both ways, Pittman made The Times' team as a linebacker for the second year in  a row. He was a second-team pick last year. Pittman, who had 17 sacks, was a  big hitter on what was one of the best defenses in the county all season. As  the cornerstone of Mira Mesa's offense, Pittman (5-11, 190) gained 1,604 yards  rushing and had 17 touchdowns during the regular season. He added 205 yards and  three scores in the Marauders' opening playoff victory over Torrey Pines.  </P> <P> Matt Sailors, Rancho Buena Vista, linebacker -- Coach Craig Bell said Sailors  "is a fierce competitor to the point of being nasty." What more do you want of  a linebacker? Sailors' quickness, agility and nose for the ball set him apart  and helped make him a dominant player on defense. Sailors (6-2, 220) had 26  sacks, four interceptions, six fumble recoveries and four forced fumbles. He  also blocked five kicks.  </P> <P> Brandon Sanders, Helix, defensive back -- "Brandon is a demonstration of  aggressive, intense football playing," Coach Jim Arnaiz said. "He is a blend of  the best defensive backs over the years, but he plays with his own personality  of reckless abandon." Sanders had four interceptions and five blocked kicks  during the regular season. Arnaiz said that Sanders and Gary Walton were, "The  catalysts for a defense that will go down in Helix history."  </P> <P> Tommy Bennett, Morse, defensive back -- Bennett (6-2, 190) was an unsung hero  on a team full of them. But his instincts, athletic ability and intelligence --  he has a 3.2 grade-point-average -- have piqued the interest of recruiters from  UCLA and Stanford. He had six interceptions, two of which were spectacular  one-handed grabs, and four touchdown receptions as quarterback Teddy Lawrence's  primary target. He also returned punts and kickoffs.  </P> <P> Rashaan Salaam, La Jolla Country Day, defensive back -- Because he was also one  of the county's best running backs, Salaam had ample motivation on defense; the  more he got the ball . . . Salaam, a 6-1 junior, put up unbelievable numbers at  the eight-man level in a championship season that included four 11-man  victories. He finished with 2,162 yards on 114 carries and 51 touchdowns,  including 45 rushing. Though he intercepted only three passes, he was dominant  on defense as well.  </P> <P> Danny Branch, Sweetwater, defensive back -- Played five games this year with a  broken wrist and a tender hamstring, but not even sore limbs could trim Branch.  "He's got a heart bigger than his body," Coach Andy Sanchez said. "There's no  quit in him. Pound-for-pound, he's the best all-around player in San Diego  County." High praise, but consider Branch's numbers: 5-7, 165 -- his height and  weight; six interceptions -- two returned for touchdowns; four fumble  recoveries -- one returned for a touchdown; and three kickoffs returned for  touchdowns. On offense, he added 789 rushing yards, third best in the Metro  Conference. Little wonder Branch was named BMOC at Sweetwater's homecoming.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL-COUNTY OFFENSE  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:2.66IN:3.32IN:1.56IN:1.45IN:1.45IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="6"> <ROWRULE>

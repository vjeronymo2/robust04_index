Party committees at all levels in the province  should attach importance to and strengthen the party's united  front work and, following the changes in the situation and  tasks, continuously study the new conditions, put forward new  demands, create new experiences, further consolidate and develop  the broadest patriotic united front, and ensure the  inexhaustible source of strength and the broad and solid mass  foundation for reform, opening up, and economic construction.    In his speech, Jiang Chunyun first emphasized the need to  further enhance the understanding of the importance of the  united front work in the new situation. He pointed out: The  united front that our party established under the leadership of  Comrade Mao Zedong was an important weapon for China to win  victory in revolution and construction. In the new historical  period, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led our party to again make new  and significant contributions to consolidating and developing  the united front and clearly defined it as an important  component of the theory and practice of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward clear  requirements on the united front work in the new situation and  gave important instructions. We must profoundly understand the  importance of the united front work in the new situation and  continuously raise our awareness and have more initiative in  making united front work successful.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Under the leadership of party  committees at all levels, the united front work departments in  the province have united the forces of all quarters and  mobilized all positive factors to accomplish large amounts of  fruitful work and achieve notable results in promoting  Shandong's two civilizations over the past few years. The  provincial party committee is satisfied with this.    Jiang Chunyun emphasized: As China's reform, opening up, and  economic construction are in a crucial period, the position of  united front becomes more important, and its role greater. It  is a great historical task for the entire party and the people  of various nationalities throughout the country to establish an  initial system of the socialist market economy by the end of  this century. Based on the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee and the reality of  Shandong, the recent sixth provincial party congress defined the  three-step strategic objective of Shandong's economic and social  development. To attain this grand objective, we should unite  all the forces that can be united, mobilize all positive  factors, and strive to liberate and develop productive forces;  we should address in a timely manner and correctly handle the  various social contradictions to ensure social and political  stability; and we should fully develop democracy, extensively  give heed to the voice of the masses, strengthen supervision,  and make sure that party and government organs at all levels are  clean and honest and reduce and avoid major mistakes in  policy-making. All these are basic functions and tasks of the  patriotic united front in the new period. Jiang Chunyun pointed  out: To make a success of the united front work in the new  period, we should persistently take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the party's basic line as the guide, conscientiously study to  master the guidelines of the important instructions on united  front work given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other  central leading comrades, resolutely implement the party's  principles and policies on the united front work, and,  proceeding from Shandong's specific conditions and the overall  situation in reform, development, and stability, develop the  advantages, give prominence to work priorities, perform work in  a creative manner, and strive to open up a new situation in the  united front work and win new achievements continuously.       First, we should continue to improve and develop the system  of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the  leadership of the CPC, which is China's basic political system  and also the major characteristic and advantage of the political  system. Continuous improvement and development of this system  is a need in strengthening and improving party leadership, a  need in developing democratic politics with Chinese  characteristics, and also a need in realizing long periods of  order and stability of the state. Active participation of  democratic parties and personages outside the party from various  circles involved in consultation, discussion, and democratic  supervision of the various policy-making groups for reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive can help make  policy-making more democratic and scientific. We should conduct  full consultation with democratic parties and personages outside  the party from various circles on major issues and ensure  consultation before making policy. This should become a system  and be conscientiously implemented. Recommending personages  outside the party to assume leading posts in governments and  judicial organs is the important work for adhering to and  improving the system of multiparty cooperation and political  consultation under party leadership and the important content of  China's endeavor to develop democratic politics. Party  committees at all levels should further enhance understanding,  have a stronger sense of urgency toward this work, and adopt  effective measures to make sure that new and significant  progress is achieved in the job arrangements for cadres outside  the party in the near future. We should cooperate with the  cadres outside the party who have assumed government leading  posts and make sure that they are entrusted with duties, powers,  and responsibilities so that they can truly play their due role.    Second, united front work should be firmly focused on  economic construction, the central task, and its advantages  should be developed in order to improve service. The party's  central task for the new period lies in economic construction,  of which united front work should be geared. With the "three  advantages" put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the  criterion, we should emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts,  actively conduct exploration, adopt various measures, open up  various channels, mobilize all positive factors, concentrate the  will and forces of all nationalities, democratic parties, mass  organizations, and personages from various circles on the grand  cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as much  as possible, and strive to transform the advantages of united  front, such as a galaxy of talent, extensive contacts, and large  social influence, into actual productive forces. United front  work departments should fully perform their functions, embody  their characteristics and advantages, and place their work  emphasis on creating a united, stable, and harmonious social  environment conducive to reform, opening up, and economic  construction and on participating in and discussing the  administration of government and state affairs focusing on  economic construction, offering ideas, serving as advisers, and  providing good service.    Third, we should attach importance to the work for the  representative personages outside the party. Party committees  and united front work departments at all levels should consider  it an important task. In particular, we should attach  importance to and strengthen the work for nonparty  intellectuals, representative personages of the nonpublic  sectors of the economy, overseas targets of united front work,  and representative figures from nationalities and religious  circles. We should put the work of nonparty intellectuals in an  important position. In connection with the work assigned them  respectively, party and government leading comrades at all  levels should make friends with the personages outside the  party, define the scope and the targets, and strengthen contacts  with them. Respect is the prerequisite for establishing  friendship, treating others with sincerity is the channel for  friendship, and mutual understanding is the bridge of  friendship. We should respect, trust, and show concern for the  friends outside the party.       Fourth, we should attach greater importance to and  strengthen  nationality and religious work. Party and government  departments at all levels should fully understand the importance  of achieving success in nationalities work, regard it as a major  task, and conscientiously carry it out. The education on  Marxism and the party's nationalities policies should be  intensified within and outside the party, and communist party  members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, and ordinary  people of various nationalities should be educated to  conscientiously implement the party's nationalities policies.  We should adopt measures, such as support of certain projects,  support by counterpart departments, and preferential policies to  actively and effectively accelerate the economic and cultural  development of minority nationalities to promote the common  prosperity of all our nationalities. We should attach  importance to training cadres of minority nationalities to  continuously improve their political quality, professional  proficiency, and their ability to participate in and lead  economic construction. Party and government organs should  comprehensively and correctly implement the party's policy on  freedom of religious belief, strengthen management of religious  affairs according to law, actively guide religions to comply  with socialist modernization, and lead religious believers to  make contributions to social stability and economic development.    In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The new conditions  and new tasks have set new and still higher demands on united  front work. To raise Shandong's united front work to a new  level and open up a new situation, we should further strengthen  and improve party leadership over united front work. Party  committees at all levels should include united front work high  in their agenda, discuss it several times a year, listen to  reports, and study ways to resolve some major issues. Their  chief leading comrades should take the lead in united front  work, attend to it personally, and implement the party's united  front work policies in an exemplary manner. Comrades in charge  of united front work should conscientiously meet their  responsibility and make earnest efforts to carry it out. United  front work departments should fully perform their functions,  serve as good advisers and assistants to party committees, and  accomplish their specific work in an outstanding manner. We  should conduct extensive and intensive propaganda and education  on the theories and policies on united front work, increase the  dynamics of the propaganda, and broaden the channels for it.  Newspapers, radio, television, and other mass media should  report and publicize the knowledge, work, and activities of  united front, as well as the advanced deeds of the  representative personages outside the party. Through propaganda  and education, we should enhance people's understanding of  united front work and strive to create a situation in which the  entire party and society show concern for and attach importance  to united front work. We should intensify investigation and  study to learn about new conditions and resolve new problems.  Firmly focusing on economic construction, the central task, we  should make great efforts to study ways to guide specific work  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on united front and to make  united front work meet the needs for establishing the socialist  market economy system. We should conscientiously summarize the  guiding experiences to counter the new conditions and new  characteristics of united front work and offer valuable  suggestions to guide and lead united front work to make new  headway. United front work departments should attach importance  to improving themselves and do a good job in division of work  and cooperation. We should intensify the training and education  of the cadres in charge of united front work, arm their minds  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, and strive to upgrade their  theoretical, political, and professional quality.    Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of the province, presided over the  conference and spoke on opinions on how to relay and implement  the guidelines.    Attending the conference were Li Wenquan, deputy secretary  of  the provincial party committee; Li Zhen, chairman of the  provincial people's congress standing committee; Lu Maozeng,  chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]; Han Yuqun, standing  committee member and united front work department director of  the provincial party committee; and Tian Jian, vice chairman of  the provincial CPPCC committee.</p>

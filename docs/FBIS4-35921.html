			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nabih al-Barji in Beirut] </F>   [Text] Political sources close to Damascus in Beirut have  said that Syrian officials were shocked by the decision of  Edward Djerejian, the U.S. ambassador in Tel Aviv, to leave his  post in order to pursue a possible election campaign that will  be led by former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker to face  U.S. President Bill Clinton in the White House battle.    Syrian officials had thought that the appointment of  Djerejian, who had served as ambassador in Damascus before he  was appointed assistant U.S. secretary of state for Middle  Eastern affairs -- to head the U.S. diplomatic mission in Tel  Aviv was a positive signal that the Clinton administration wants  this seasoned diplomat, who is an expert on the Middle East, to  energize Israel's position toward a peaceful formula with Syria  that is thought to be a central formula for a comprehensive  settlement in the region.    Those officials, however, have immediately noticed that  there  are concerted efforts to keep Djerejian away from any important  activities. In fact, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  almost ignored him completely in his efforts to approximate  views between the Syrian and Israeli governments.    Damascus thinks that the decision of Djerejian -- who had  faced a personal predicament from which resignation was the only  way out -- gives further evidence of the efficiency of the  attack launched by the Jewish lobby in the United States to  prevent the Clinton administration from playing a balanced role  in advancing the negotiating process.    The Syrian officials are very tense when they view the  fierce  method adopted by the Jewish lobby to contain President Clinton,  as signs of another presidential election campaign have drawn  near. Some members of the lobby had previously made it public  that they object to giving Syria an influential role in  crystallizing the structure of the forthcoming regional order.    Those sources think that Dennis Ross, the U.S. negotiation  coordinator, and Martin Indyk, the official in charge of the  Middle East in the National Security Council, have managed to  close in on Djerejian.    In fact, Syrian fears go farther than this. Strobe Talbott,  the deputy secretary of state who is known for his relatively  balanced view of the Middle East crisis, is being totally  ignored. Syrian officials have noticed some signs of a trend in  the U.S. State Department and the National Security Council --  without casting doubt on President Clinton and Secretary of  State Christopher -- to dismantle the diplomatic formula  launched by the former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and  on whose basis the Syrians had accepted to attend the peace  conference in Madrid in October 1991.    The Madrid formula depends on Security Council Resolutions  242 and 338 which were bypassed when the Gaza-Jericho agreement  was signed, according to Syria's view of this agreement.    Now that Djerejian is absent from the scene, it seems that  all doors are wide open to Jewish influence in the circles at  which U.S. policies on the Middle East are drawn up.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Return of Heseltine the heavy hitter 'HE'S DEFINITELY taking things easier. Instead of a 9 1/2 -day week, he's cut it down to six,' confided a colleague of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who yesterday completed his first week back at work since his heart attack in July. After nearly four months of enforced leisure, during which he admits to having contemplated retirement from politics, Mr Heseltine is back at his desk. In fact he put in about 3 1/2 days this week. Looking slightly thinner and a bit older, he has been telling well-wishers of all political persuasions that his doctor has given him a clean bill of health. Even so, he emphasises that his return to the stressful and unpredictable world of Westminster will be carefully paced. 'I am not going to rush back in,' he insists. Another colleague said: 'He really is fine. But no-one with any sense goes back after a heart attack with all guns blazing.' Mr Heseltine, who managed entirely to avoid the daily diet of red boxes during convalescence on his Oxfordshire estate, appears happy that reforms of the Department of Trade and Industry aimed at helping improve Britain's industrial competitiveness were pursued in his absence. Much of the responsibility for filling the gap fell to Mr Tim Sainsbury, a member of his ministerial team. But in the words of one DTI official: 'There are some things which need a heavy hitter and it is good to have him back.' The sentiment is shared by many MPs, who believe his heavyweight contribution has been badly missed by a government in trouble. With his planned return to the DTI temporarily postponed following a bad bout of flu - inevitably giving rise to speculation that he was far from fully recovered - Mr Heseltine briefly popped into his Victoria Street offices on Monday. On Tuesday he attended cabinet and in the afternoon held a meeting with DTI officials to see how his department's competitiveness programme was proceeding. Wednesday saw an early morning radio interview, more meetings with officials and lunch with a national newspaper before taking a frontbench seat to hear Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, make a statement on coal. By Thursday he had attended a meeting of the EDX special cabinet committee, which is charged with the task of maintaining public spending targets and later in the day left London to address the Tyne and Wear chamber of commerce. Yesterday he was at home in his constituency. Next week Mr Heseltine's diary includes a Commons debate on coal - Mr Eggar is likely to lead - a Conservative party constituency dinner and a reception in Birmingham. He also intends to honour his commitment to address the Confederation of British Industry conference in Harrogate next month. Ahead of him are decisions on coal privatisation and the future of the Post Office, a deregulation bill and plans for opening a national chain of 'business link' advice centres. As for suggestions that Mr Heseltine's return to the DTI will be shortlived, he says he is pledged to seeing through the changes in the DTI which will help it bat for Britain. After four months under temporary management, it looks like business as usual at the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

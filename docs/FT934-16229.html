			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / BAe shares fall on doubts about Taiwan venture BRITISH Aerospace shares fell for the second day running yesterday amid growing fears that a proposed venture to build aircraft in Taiwan would not go ahead. The shares closed at 399p, down 12p. BAe said the Taiwanese government still backed the deal. But BAe's joint venture partner, Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC), confirmed that the deal's future would be discussed at a board meeting on October 19. 'There will be a report and a discussion, but it is hard to say whether there will be a clear decision,' said TAC. In addition, Taiwanese opposition politicians have stepped up their pressure on the government to cancel the deal. They accuse it of putting industrial strategy ahead of commercial good sense. Collapse of the joint venture, called Avro, would undermine BAe's plans to improve profits: the RJ regional jets, currently made in Woodford, Cheshire, lose money for the company. BAe had hoped to return them to profitability by moving some production to Taiwan. It could also leave the company about Pounds 300m worse off, according to City estimates. In the short term, BAe would lose the Pounds 120m that Taiwan would pay for the assets BAe is putting into Avro. It would then have to make most of the 4,000 people working on the RJ in the UK redundant, costing another Pounds 60m or more. Over the medium term, there could be additional costs associated with leases on RJ aircraft and their predecessors, the 146 range, of about another Pounds 100m. These costs would not directly hit BAe's profits because they fall under a Pounds 1bn provision included in the 1992 accounts. But there might not be enough in the provisions to cope with both the failure of Avro and a restructuring or closure of BAe's loss-making turboprop aircraft unit. BAe cannot easily look to any other potential partners to build the RJ series in an increasingly overcrowded market for short-haul jets. 'It's Taiwan or it's nothing at all,' said Mr Pete Deighton, aerospace analyst with Smith New Court. Taiwan, by contrast, may have a choice of partner. The country is keen to enter the civil aviation market, and French company Dassault may transfer the expertise to build the wings for its Falcon executive jets to Taiwan. Avro's defenders such as Mr Deighton, argue that the recent opposition in Taiwan to the deal is part of an attempt to wring further concessions from BAe. These could involve transferring more manufacturing to Taiwan or a guarantee to design a new aircraft, the RJ-X. They also point out that although the failure of Avro would hurt, the damage would not be as severe as it might have been earlier this year. 'BAe's balance sheet would be considerably more able to cope with the failure of Avro than a year ago. It was practically a forced seller of the RJ business then,' said Mr Paul Ruddle, aerospace analyst with NatWest Markets. 'The cash cost of losing the deal has already been covered by the (Pounds 250m) sale (to US company Raytheon in June) of the corporate jets business.'</p>

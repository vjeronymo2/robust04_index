			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Dart Group Settles SEC Complaint: Corporate raider Herbert Haft's Dart Group  settled an SEC complaint alleging that it had acted as an investment company  because it made large profits from the sale of stocks in a series of takeover  bids for retailing companies. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the  Landover, Md., company agreed in effect not to buy and sell securities as its  primary business unless it registers as an investment company. The SEC accused  Dart Group in a civil complaint in Washington federal court of violating  securities laws by acting as an unregistered investment firm.  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Hurd warns Foreign Office staff on pay Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, yesterday met about 600 members of the Foreign Office's London-based staff to spell out the difficult challenges facing the Diplomatic Service. The one-hour 'full house' meeting, called by the staff unions, elicited little enthusiasm from most staff - particularly the junior officers, whose expectations of assurances on pay and working hours remained largely un-satisfied. 'It was entirely predictable,' one staff representative said. 'Mr Hurd was his usual consummate diplomatic self, but managed to avoid answering many of the practical questions put to him in writing.' The foreign secretary began his presentation by emphasising the satisfaction that could be gained by working for the Diplomatic Service, still one of the most desirable jobs in the public sector. He also assured staff that the government intended the Diplomatic Service to remain a 'core' public service. However, he stressed that it would be spread much more thinly because of financial constraints, and gave little hope to its junior members, who claim to be badly underpaid. He was no more encouraging in response to complaints that some officials, particularly in senior grades, were obliged to work unreasonably long hours without adequate financial reward. Mr Hurd 'fully supported' a cut in long hours. But he said it should be achieved through a reduction in paper flow rather than through a specific allowance. Grades of first secretary and above would not be paid overtime. They could, after all, expect greater compensations in their subsequent careers. In particular, he warned staff they would have to live with money-saving schemes, such as the market-testing programme, affecting some Foreign Office services which had been opened to outside bidders. Mr Hurd said the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, could not carry out his anti-inflation or budgetary policies without keeping a sharp eye on public expenditure including money allotted to the Foreign Office.</p>

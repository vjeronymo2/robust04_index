			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Serbian President Slobodan </F> Milosevic and Romanian President Ion Iliescu in Bucharest on 5  April; from the "Aktuelnosti" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Milosevic] My associates and  I are very pleased to have had the opportunity to visit  Bucharest today, to visit the capital city of Romania with which  we are linked with long historical friendship and many joint  interests. The very fact that the Serbs and the Romanians have  never fought a war and that they have always had very good  relations would be insufficient to describe the content of our  wishes for the future, because what we expect from the  development of our cooperation in the future, I hope will exceed  by far our mutual very friendly and very good relations so far.    The focus of our talks was, therefore, bilateral relations  and I could say that there is literally not a single sphere of  activity on which we did not agree regarding our future  cooperation.    In brief, our mutual relations could be described as very  good, I would even say excellent, but we still expect them to  continually and constantly improve. There are many mutual  interests, as well as numerous reasons for that. A few minutes  ago, President Iliescu mentioned some figures. These are our  joint modest estimates of the possibilities for developing our  cooperation. This is why it is absurd that presently we cannot  realize much of that and improve the standard of living and our  economies, because of the administrative measures and sanctions  that represent an anachronism at the end of the 20th century,  and which were unfortunately imposed by the countries that  consider themselves to be more cultured and more civilized.    However, I am convinced that life itself will bring down  such  an approach, which is not civilized and which runs counter to  the basic laws of the modern world that is integrating and  uniting itself, the world that is permeating itself. In other  words, the world that is opposite to these processes will have  to go where it belongs, into the inglorious past, and I hope,  will do so very quickly.    In any case, I am sure that regarding our country and  friendly Romania, both sides will maximally contribute to this.  There is no doubt, and this is something we jointly concluded  today, that good mutual relations between our two countries  represent an important factor of stability in this region. We  rate our mutual cooperation very highly. We rate very highly  the objective approach by Romania and President Iliescu to the  problems of the Yugoslav crisis and believe that there is every  reason for our cooperation in future to only improve and  increase in the interest of both peoples and both countries, and  in the interest of this part of Europe.    We will leave Bucharest very satisfied with everything we  heard and saw and we are convinced of the success of our mutual  cooperation. [passage omitted on Iliescu answering a question on  the founding of the Yugoslav-Romanian Friendship Society]    [Predal, in Romanian with passage-by-passage translation  into  Serbo-Croatian] Bogdan Predal of ASSOCIATED PRESS. Mr.  President, there are some speculations in the international  press that the regular army of Yugoslavia is operating around  Gorazde. Could you confirm these reports?    [Milosevic] There are, of course, no Yugoslav army members  outside the territory of Yugoslavia. The UN officials on the  ground know that. However, the problem of Gorazde raises  another question. We are undoubtedly talking about a fierce  offensive by the Muslim forces from the so-called protected  zone, which, according to the very definition of a protected  zone, should be demilitarized.    Therefore, one should raise a question of how this was  possible at all, and whether it will finally become clear as to  who is currently carrying out this offensive, and with what aim.  Therefore, your question was well formulated when you said that  there are some speculations. It is therefore correct that we  are taking about speculations and not facts. [passage omitted]    Regarding the question that was addressed to me, there is no  doubt that the stands taken toward the Yugoslav crisis have  seriously compromised the system of the United Nations and the  international community, because the UN Charter itself obliges  the United Nations to preserve the integrity of its  member-states. In the case of Yugoslavia, and especially when  it introduced the sanctions, the United Nations in fact acted in  the opposite direction. It encouraged disintegration and  secession, and punished and attacked those who wanted to  preserve and save their country.    The United Nations went even further than that. I think that  one of the absurdities at the end of the 20th century will be  the fact that a nation was accused of aggression on its own  country. Therefore, one should not look for any logic, since  there is no logic here. Everything that has been done was  exclusively done according to the rule of the stronger.    Peace will be established when the international community  adopts the same, or at least an approximately equal stand toward  all sides in the conflict, and when it at least modestly moves  toward its main declared principle of non-partiality. As far as  we are concerned, it would have been best if they had never  gotten involved in it at all, because this involvement only  harmed us.    Regarding the direct question as to whether Romania is  contributing to the improvement of this situation, my answer is  affirmative.    [Rodin, in Romanian with passage-by-passage translation into  Serbo-Croatian] Michaela Rodin of AGENCE FRANCE-PRESS. Mr.  Milosevic, were you prepared to support the agreement between  the Muslims and the Croats, and would the Serbs join the  federation?    [Milosevic] A country's constitution and its setup are  considered to be an expression of sovereignty of a nation in all  countries. I personally do not believe much in the future of  the creations nor constitutions that are imposed from outside.  However, as far as I am personally concerned, I wish them all  the luck.    Regarding the Serbian people, they have gotten used to  writing their own constitutions in the past and to decide on  their own fate, and this will remain the case. We are a free  people and this is the greatest value that we place before all  other values.</p>

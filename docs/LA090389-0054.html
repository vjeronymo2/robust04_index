			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEEDY  </P> <P> As a waitress at the Stage Deli in Century City, I must correct the Aug. 20  letter of Beryl E. Arbit of Encino. Arbit complained that the rye bread we  serve has no seeds and said, "The purveyors of this stuff should be consigned  for life to counting the caraway seeds in every Carnegie (Deli) creation."  Enclosed you will find a piece of the rye, filled with seeds. Obviously Ms.  Arbit has been living in the Valley too long, got lost coming over the hill and  ate someplace else.  </P> <P> WENDY J.

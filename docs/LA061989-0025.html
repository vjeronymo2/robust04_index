			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST STEP WAS VAGUE, BUT A VOGUE FAD DIPS INTO L.A.  </P> <P> To vogue or not to vogue?  </P> <P> It's no longer a question.  </P> <P> Los Angeles vogued Thursday night at "The Love Machine," a one-night event  organized by the trendies who run the Apartment club, April La Rue and  Christian Farrow.  </P> <P> Very few of the late-late nighters attending, however, had any idea what they  were doing. This was a test run in Los Angeles for the latest urban dance  trend, which, in New York, incorporates modern dance movement, break-dancing,  gymnastics, runway modeling, drop-dead fashion and a great deal of attitude.  </P> <P> "We just had to get it going now," La Rue shouted over the heads of the throng  shoving its way into Palette in West Hollywood, where the hastily organized  event was held. "We couldn't wait another minute. We have just got to vogue."  </P> <P> Later this month, La Rue's and Farrow's Apartment club will be reopening, after  a six-month hiatus, at the Stardust Ballroom on Sunset Boulevard and will  feature regular competitions called vogue balls. From the looks of the  overdressed mob elbowing into Palette, voguing is here to stay . . . at least  for this summer.  </P> <P> "At last, at last," Cafe Mambo's Mario Tamayo, shouted as he strutted past the  phalanx of security guards. "It's here!"  </P> <P> But just what is it that is here?  </P> <P> To vogue, according to New York's lexicographer on the scene, Chi Chi Valenti  (who's composed a glossary of voguing terms), means to dance in a form  "combining frozen fashion model poses and transitional steps."  </P> <P> To vogue, according to Vogue magazine's editor in chief Anna Wintour, is to  "send up the magazine a bit. The stiff posing, that old-fashioned studio look  from the '50s, is what it's about. Although, it's not what the magazine's about  now."  </P> <P> "Houses" -- groups of 20 to 40 kids who vogue under a name -- are named for  their founders, like New York's House of Afrika, founded by Renault Afrika  (bank clerk Renault Verone by day). Or a house may be named for its mentor --  the House of (designer) Thierry Mugler or the name might send up fashion excess  like the House of Extravaganza. Like the dancing itself, voguers poke fun at  the older, stiffer, formal fashion titles of the '40s and '50s -- House of  Chanel, House of Dior -- laughing at the grandness, and perhaps hoping for the  chance to be that grand.  </P> <P> "It's a chance to work out a dream in reality," said David Burns, the  coordinator of Thursday night's "Love Machine."  </P> <P> In New York it is more. Voguing is a way of life for hundreds of kids, mostly  poor, who belong to the 20-odd recognized houses that compete against each  other regularly for cash prizes. And this fashionable way of life is run by a  "father" and a "mother." At first glance, this structured, paternalistic  society may seem like a chic cult brewing; however, the "kids" who report to  their house "mother" or "father" are usually in their late teens or early 20s.  Some of the kids are unemployed, and it is the house mother or father who will  help them find a job or get back into school.  </P> <P> The houses in New York have been developing for "at least five years,"  according to Burns, who worked on vogue balls there for the last several years  before coming out to Los Angeles. "Voguing goes back a long time, maybe 20  years, when it started in Harlem -- black and Spanish kids facing off in  costumes on speaker boxes. It's going white now, much more trendy."  </P> <P> Indeed. Rock impresario Malcolm MacLaren has already produced a record, "Deep  in Vogue," which is moving up on the charts, and he is in negotiations with  Columbia Pictures for a full-length feature on voguing. Thierry Mugler and  Jean-Paul Gaultier have used voguers in their collections on the Paris runways.  Claude Montana is next, it's rumored. And film maker Jennie Livingston is  producing a full-length feature documentary, "one that goes back to Harlem."  </P> <P> But back to voguing in Los Angeles, where no one was quite sure what was about  to happen inside "The Love Machine." Only four houses were scheduled to "walk"  on Thursday night.  </P> <P> It was the usual club scene inside -- no room to dance, people knocking drinks  all over each other, beat-thumping, ear-splitting '70s and '80s dance music,  dark happenings in dark corners. A very few voguers scurried about, wondering  where to and when.  </P> <P> About 11 o'clock, seven oddly dressed people got up on the stages around the  central dance floor and began voguing . . . so to speak. The crowd on the dance  floor was not mesmerized by the woman in the scanty negligee striking vogue-ish  poses.  </P> <P> "This is just a little preview," explained David Burns. "There'll be a show  later."  </P> <P> "I don't think they know what they're doing," surmised perennial late-nighter  Rusty Updergraft, who admitted to only having read about voguing.  </P> <P> Cosmetic maven Gale Hayman, disappointed, was expecting "high fashion  reminiscent of Diana Vreeland." There were only two major hats and no veils.  </P> <P> The crowd was getting restless. Dweezil Zappa and his entourage, and John James  and his, left. At 1:15 a.m., Farrow and Burns decided to get the show on the  runway. Fourteen voguers stood on the main stage, waiting for their cue --  MacLaren's "Deep in Vogue." They waited. They waited, several striking poses  and trying to hold them. The crowd in the balcony took up a chant: "Vogue,  vogue, vogue . . . ."  </P> <P> The music finally began. And then there was voguing.  </P> <P> And cheering, and clapping, and laughing. "Princess Stephanie" of the Apartment  House dipped her way across the stage, puckering her lips, ignoring the ranting  crowd just like a good runway model should. Designer Jerry Jaeger of the House  of Lovestyle stretched his lanky arms out wide, then threw his head back.  Eduardo Lucero, a fashion illustrator, and Ramirez, who works at Modern  Objects, both of the House of Moderns, sashayed across the stage together. One  poseur after another swaggered, paraded, popped, dipped, spun down the narrow  runway. Finally, the mother of the Apartment House, April La Rue, bustled out,  distributing copies of Vogue magazine and Vogue detergent.  </P> <P> Ten minutes of voguing; it was over. That was it.  </P> <P> Voguing. It's here to stay . . . at least for this summer.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Perhaps the most important event in the region will  be the forthcoming world summit on sustainable development, to  take place in Barbados. Representatives from member countries of  the alliance of small insular states are expected to participate  in this summit. Parallel to the world summit on small insular  states that will take place in Barbados, a forum on  nongovernment organizations will also take place in the capital,  at which Cuban youth will be present. (Damodar Pena), one of the  Cuban representatives to that forum, outlines some of the  subjects that will be discussed in that forum.    [Begin recording] [(Pena)] One of the subjects is social and  environmental policies on sustainable development, the work that  youth can do in this regard, and some action plans concerning  what can be done in countries such as ours, taking into account  the fact that this is essentially a meeting of developing  nations and of small islands. This forum will discuss what can  be done in these islands in the quest for sustainable  development.    [Unidentified reporter] What is the Cuban youth experience  in  this context?    [(Pena)] The Cuban youth have actively participated in all  discussions on the development of ecology in Cuba for a long  time. I can tell you that the national bureau [not further  identified] discussed this subject in January 1992 and again in  December of the same year, and it was agreed that the youth  should be charged with these issues and that a national ecology  group should be created.    In May 1993, the ecology issue was discussed in the Isle of  Youth when a set of guidelines was established, especially for  those issues having to do with youth, such as environmental  education of the new generation. I think this is a very  important aspect in which the youth, together with several  social organizations such as the Ministries of Educatio and  Culture and the communities can do much to teach the people to  take care of the environment, love it, and use it for their own  benefit without harming its stability. These are the essential  things carried out by the youth in this regard. [end recording]</p>

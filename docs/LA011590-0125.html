			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EC JOBLESS RATE HITS 7-YEAR LOW  </P> <P> The European Community's unemployment rate fell to a seven-year low of 8.9%  during November, EC's statistics agency Eurostat announced today.  </P> <P> The decline in November -- from 9% in October and 9.7% in November, 1988 -- put  the jobless rate below 9% for the first time since 1982.  </P> <P> Henning Christophersen, the EC's economic affairs commissioner, said the drop  showed the investment and growth-oriented policies of the 12-nation trading  bloc were working.  </P> <P> Eurostat said national unemployment rates either fell slightly or were  unchanged in November except in West Germany and Denmark. The rise in West  Germany reflected the movement of East German workers to the West seeking jobs,  the statement said.  </P></p>

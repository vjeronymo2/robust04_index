			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Bank Austria veils transparency TRANSPARENCY is all the rage among big Austrian companies these days as they try to increase their appeal to international investors. But the idea of disseminating information in a fair and orderly way is not one that comes easily to the clannish Viennese. Consider the misadventures of Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, in the past few days. Yesterday, the bank, which has already applied for a listing on the London Stock Exchange, announced that it was launching an American Depository Receipt (ADR) programme, a move likely to encourage US investor interest in the bank's shares. The news was distributed to journalists in the morning with a request not to publish it until noon, presumably so that European investors would not have an edge over American ones. However, an advertisement sponsored by J P Morgan, the bank's US depositary, had already revealed the story in the morning's European financial newspapers. In any event, the real news from Bank Austria yesterday emerged from an impromptu press conference in Vienna given by the bank's chairman, Mr Rene Alfons Haiden. The bank's dividend for 1992 would be cut from 14 per cent to 12 per cent, Mr Haiden disclosed. That news should not have been published until April 22, when the bank, which is the product of a merger between Zentralsparkasse and Oesterreichische Landerbank in 1991, is to reveal its 1992 financial results. Perhaps Mr Haiden, a Zentralsparkasse man, was trying to re-establish his competitive standing as a bank spokesman. Last Thursday, Mr Gerhard Randa, the deputy chairman and a former Landerbank man, lifted the veil on another aspect of the bank's 1992 results, telling Reuters news agencythat the operating profit was roughly unchanged at Sch3.3bn (Dollars 295m). Mr Randa, who still maintains his office and staff in a different building from that occupied by Mr Haiden, also expounded on the bank's plans to take full control of Wiener Holding, the sprawling conglomerate of industries and services held by the city of Vienna. Some Sch2.1bn worth of new Bank Austria equity would be issued to the city in return for the stake, he revealed. Surprisingly, these informal disclosures have had virtually no impact on the price of Bank Austria shares - which suggests that market insiders in Vienna already knew what was coming.</p>

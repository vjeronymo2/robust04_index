He recalled how the  two countries were supportive of each other during their  respective national liberation struggles and were able to  develop a lasting friendship. He said the two developing  nations as members of the nonaligned movement share identical  views on regional and international affairs.    Sr. Gen. Than Shwe added that the two countries have a  similar approach in managing national construction tasks aimed  at raising the standard of living of the people, establishing a  modern nation and regional stability. He noted that the two are  both agricultural countries which are practicing a market  oriented economy. He said he is very heartened to observe the  success and progress Vietnam has achieved in a short period  after initiating a market oriented economy. He said the  countries can observe each other's experiences and contribute to  mutually beneficial cooperation and help promote the emergence  of stable and prosperous countries which will lead to a  developed region. He said relations between Myanmar and Vietnam  are based on friendship, goodwill, and mutual understanding.

The senior general believes that the visit  of the prime minister will further promote the bilateral  friendship. He said he looks forward to the opportunity to  exchange views on matters of mutual interest and the  international situation.

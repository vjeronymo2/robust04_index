			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Ex-communists in Lithuania win a majority FORMER communists yesterday swept to power in Lithuania, the largest of the three Baltic states, with an absolute majority in the 141-member parliament. With the last results of the second round of voting still being counted, the most conservative estimate gave 73 seats to the Democratic Labour party (DLP), successor to the Lithuanian branch of the Soviet Communist party. This would allow it an overall majority without relying on any of the small centre parties. Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, the DLP leader and former first secretary of the Lithuanian CP, said he would form a 'technocratic' cabinet with members drawn from a variety of parties or from outside the political world, and he pledged to continue pro-market reforms. 'Those who have written in the Lithuanian and foreign press that the communists are returning here do not know what has happened in our party. We are a social democratic party with only 5 per cent of our members from the communist period,' he said. However, Mr Brazauskas said he would 'seek to moderate' the programme agreed between the International Monetary Fund and the outgoing nationalist government of Mr Vytautas Landbergis. 'We think the IMF was not properly informed of the economic situation here, of how bad it is. We don't want to change the principles, but we want to try to make the transition to the market easier.' He said he would seek better relations with Russia, but stressed that Russian troops - estimated to number about 20,000 - must withdraw next year as scheduled. Mr Landsbergis grudgingly conceded defeat and said he hoped the communists had changed. His Sajudis movement won only about 26 seats. Election observers in Vilnius voiced concern that the parliamentary commission investigating links between deputies and the former Soviet KGB had announced that the new parliament could not sit until it had screened all deputies. Mr Jens Thoft, from Denmark, leader of the EC delegation, said that 'this possibly indefinite delay is not what we expect in a democratic election'. Professor Bronius Genzales, a DLP deputy and a member of the commission, said the statement had been made only by individual members, not the commission itself.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a provincial experience summing-up  meeting, up to now, our province has completed 8,000  administrative village-level satellite ground reception  stations, bringing the total up to more than 10,000 in the whole  province. This has enabled our province to increase its  broadcast coverage rate to 72 percent, and its television  coverage to 77 percent in terms of population. These stations  have played an important role in propagating the party line,  guidelines, and policies, educating and encouraging the masses,  and enriching their cultural life.    The meeting pointed out that the main reason our province  could built more than 10,000 satellite ground reception  stations, which account for one fourth of the total number of  satellite ground reception stations in the whole country, within  a short period of three years was that the provincial CPC  committees and government attached great importance to it, in  addition to enthusiastic support by CPC committees and  governments at all levels. Workers and staff members on the  radio and television front throughout the province also worked  hard for this project.    The meeting stressed that the future focus of radio and  television development projects in our province will be placed  on impoverished counties which are supported by the provincial  government, densely populated areas, and areas where the  broadcast and television coverage rate is still comparatively  low. To ensure safe and high-quality operations of the  above-mentioned more than 10,000 satellite ground reception  stations, the specific requirements for their administration in  the future are: First, strengthening training and education for  administrative personnel. Every year, the provincial radio and  television department, and the relevant departments in  prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and counties must provide  their junior, middle-ranking, and senior management personnel  with several training sessions. Second, each and every county  will set up a maintenance and service department which has one  or two full-time maintenance personnel in charge of maintenance  work. Third, enterprises manufacturing radio and television  equipment must provide satellite ground reception stations with  high-quality products and service.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A judge issued a gag order Thursday barring attorneys and court personnel from  talking to the press regarding the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge Earl Gilliam refused to discuss his reasons for the order  after the court session Thursday, saying he is also covered by the gag order.  </P> <P> Richard Marmaro, one of Hunter's attorneys, protested the gag order in court,  saying it is unfair that the defense cannot air its side of the story to the  news media.  </P> <P> Marmaro told the judge the gag order is an "inappropriate restraint on the  defense."  </P> <P> But Gilliam responded that there is to be "no trying the case in the press."  </P> <P> Gilliam expressed irritation at Assistant U. S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo on Thursday  about some comments she made, but did not address the remark specifically.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the San Diego Union quoted Hugo as saying that the defense is  "making a mountain out of a molehill and the judge is letting them." She was  referring to a longstanding dispute between the prosecution and the defense  attorneys, who allege that she is not turning over documents to them on time.  </P> <P> Gilliam said the order will last until after the jury returns its verdict in  the case, which concerns Hunter's involvement in the scandal-tainted J. David  &amp; Co. investment firm.  </P> <P> The failed business was begun by Hoover's former lover, J. David (Jerry)  Dominelli, who is serving a 20-year federal prison term for his part in the  Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of $180 million.  </P> <P> The order will also forbid court clerks and attorneys from disclosing whether  the trial is in recess or in session, when the jury is deliberating or when a  verdict has been reached.  </P></p>

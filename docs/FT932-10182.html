			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Generali raises capital for subsidiary GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, is planning a complex capital-raising deal for its Alleanza life insurance unit. It also announced slightly higher profits for 1992 after two years of profit falls. The deal will raise between L457bn and L710bn for Alleanza, which recently invested heavily in a stake in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, Italy's biggest private-sector bank. Details of the capital raising are not finalised and the impact for Alleanza, Generali or shareholders is unclear. Generali's net profits rose to L389.8bn (Pounds 165.73m) last year from L380.6bn in 1991. The increase, after falls as underwriting losses grew, was in spite of a L349bn write-down on the securities portfolio. Taxation increased sharply to L149.5bn last year from L65.4bn in 1991. Operating profits rose to L255.3bn from L108.2bn, on a 21.9 per cent jump in group premiums to L8,804bn. Preliminary consolidated premiums soared about 40 per cent to L22,425bn. Adjusted for exchange-rate factors and acquisitions, the rise was about 12.5 per cent. The improved profits came despite a rise in non-life underwriting losses to L142.7bn from L112.8bn. By contrast, Generali's life insurance profits rose to L532.5bn from L493.4bn. Earnings were also boosted by a L249bn gain on exchange rate movements. Shareholders' confusion over the Alleanza deal was mitigated by Generali's decision to pay this year's dividend of L350 a share wholly in cash, instead of a mixture of cash and Alleanza shares as last year. The Alleanza transaction involves, first, a free one-for-four issue of 108m new ordinary shares and 21.6m savings (non-voting) non-convertible shares. That will be followed by a second capital increase, involving up to 50.7m new ordinary shares, which will serve a new six-year convertible bond. This bond will pay interest between 4 and 6 per cent, and will be priced between L9,000 and L14,000. Generali will also issue three-year warrants, in a like number to the convertible bonds, on 16.9m non-convertible Alleanza savings shares it currently holds. The warrants will be priced at L1,200 each. Generali will receive L60.9bn for the warrants. Further proceeds will come through the linked sale of its Alleanza savings shares.</p>

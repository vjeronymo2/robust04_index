			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The People's Assembly approved the  draft of the state budget for 1994. Gezim Qinami reports:    [Qinami] This morning the People's Assembly continued  proceedings in a plenary session to discuss the draft of the  state budget for 1994. The deputies discussed it at length and  later approved the draft with a majority. At the end of the  session, we interviewed Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi.    [Begin Meksi recording] The People's Assembly today approved  the state budget for 1994; it is the most important financial  act for the government and country. Of course, the approval of  the budget comes after long preparation by the government in  every aspect -- in examining the possibilities of incomes, in  planning expenses, and in carrying out a series of laws to do  with the restructuring of the Albanian economy and the  reformation of the organization of all judicial activity.    Of course, this budget bill was examined for approximately  three weeks by the parliament's various commissions and remarks  were made. The government considered these remarks, depending on  the case, by debating with the deputies in the commissions, thus  seeing the utility of these changes and reflecting these remarks  in the budget, because when we withdraw money from one side, we  need to balance the other side.    On this occasion, I would like to thank all commissions and  deputies, regardless of party affiliation, for the valuable  propositions made. This is a new experience for all of us,  which will certainly be improved in the coming years.    Compared to a year ago, the state budget includes, of  course,  a series of improvements in its structure, as well as in the  government's greater financial possibilities to face various  problems, because we should consider that the budget deficit is  lower this year. The financing of the state from abroad and  banks is lower, thus, incomes are greater than before. At the  same time, inflation has been forecast at 19 percent this year,  compared to about 35 percent last year.    The government is experiencing more difficult working  conditions, but the country's economic growth makes it possible  to overcome it. Of course, this year's forecast is positive.  While last year we had more than 10 percent increase in general  production, this year it has been forecast at about 8 percent.  My opinion is that it may even be more. Of course, it is up to  all Albanians, as now it is not the government that is working  to fulfill the plan, but all the free and private Albanians,  just as the state enterprises. They deposit incomes into the  state budget and the state can function to the benefit of all  the citizens and Albania as well.    I wanted to say that we can implement many things this year  because we close the second year of governing in a month and  many things can be done as the Albanian economy has grown, the  social basis of this state has been changed, private companies  constitute the majority, and laws enabling the forward progress  of the Albanian economy have been changed. However, one thing  should be considered -- that Albanians do this. [ends recording]</p>

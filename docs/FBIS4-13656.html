			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Questions About the Russia's Credibility"] </F>   [Text] PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's  visit to Moscow has again focused attention on Russia's role in  the peace process -- a role that it has continued to play since  the collapse of the Soviet Union. One of the most prominent  features of this role has been Russia's cosponsorship, together  with the United States, of the peace process from the Madrid  Conference to this date.    Much has been said about the dimensions of the Soviet role,  and subsequently those of the Russian role. Questions have been  raised over the last decades about the credibility of this role  through the harsh experience to which Palestinian-Russian (and  previously Palestinian-Soviet) relations in particular, and Arab  relations with Moscow in general, had been subjected.  Comparisons were made between those relations on one hand, and  Israeli-U.S. relations on the other.    The realities of the new international order, which have  marginalized to a great extent the effectiveness of the Russian  role in the world, forced Moscow to reduce its foreign  preoccupations in the interest of difficult domestic and  economic problems. Thus, Russia trimmed its responsibilities  and commitments inherited from the Soviet era and often appeared  as another Western power that attaches greater importance to its  own private interests.    Despite this, observers are noticing signs of Russia sliding  from the narrow confines of the new role. Hence, the attempts  to circumvent this role in Bosnia-Herzegovina and expand its  basis in the Middle East. In particular, those attempts were  apparent during the Security Council discussions on the issue of  international protection for Palestinians following the Hebron  massacre, and also through Russian initiatives and proposals in  this sphere, which aroused the annoyance of Israel and the West.    Will the slow Russian moves in the Middle East continue in  such a way as to deviate from the Western lines drawn for Soviet  policy? Such a development requires intense Palestinian and Arab  efforts, which do not seem to exist right now. Consequently,  Russian moves will remain subject to mere Russian realities on  one hand, and the West's political monopolization on the other.  This does not herald that a significant change will occur in  Russian diplomacy, at least not in the foreseeable future.</p>

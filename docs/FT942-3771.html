			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Major's reprieve is nothing to cheer about Mr John Major may have been granted a reprieve. But the prime minister and his party have nothing to cheer. The voters of southern England are no longer afraid of Labour. It is a measure of the dramatic decline in the Tories' fortunes that Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, could hail such results as an achievement. Before this summer the Conservatives had never scored below 30 per cent of the vote in a nationwide poll. In the past two months it has done so twice - first in the local polls and now in the European elections. But the party started last night fearing even worse - that it would be pushed into third place behind the Liberal Democrats and its representation in the European parliament would be reduced to single figures. It did better than that. Just. To the extent one can judge the success of a brief election campaign, Mr Major's decision to give a sceptical edge to his party's message was the right one. On the doorstep, Tory candidates found that the voters held the government in contempt. But there was no enthusiasm for Brussels. There were other straws to clutch. Once again Labour's share of the vote nationwide - estimated at 47 per cent - fell below its recent opinion poll ratings of 50 per cent and more. The Tories suffered from what the psephologists call differential turnout - in other words many of their disgruntled supporters felt safe with the idea of staying at home. Who after all cares about Europe? In a general election many of these traditional Tories would return to the fold. But Mr Major and his ministers should not kid themselves. This was an extremely bad result, far worse than could be brushed off as the inevitable protest by the electorate during a bout of mid-term blues. It was bad not just because the Tory share of the vote was so low. Much more importantly for the future shape of British politics was the fact that Labour demonstrated for the first time since 1979 that it was capable of winning votes and seats in southern England. Look at some of the Euro-seats it has now won: Essex South, London South East, and London North West. These are places where the Conservatives have been entrenched for 15 years, where Labour barely existed a few years ago. Since 1992 the voters in the south have punished the government by voting Liberal Democrat. Mr Paddy Ashdown's party has claimed spectacular by-election victories in Newbury, Christchurch and, most recently, Eastleigh. Last night it entrenched its position in its west country power base by winning its first ever seats in the European parliament. But for as long as the principal threat came from the Liberal Democrats, Tory MPs could persuade themselves that it would be entirely possible to rescue the position at a general election. It is after all one of the great traditions of British politics that the third party wins seats from the Conservatives during the lifetime of a parliament and then hands them back at the following general election. The picture has now changed. Labour is now the real challenger across a swathe of southern England. It can win in places such as Norfolk, where seven out of eight of the parliamentary seats are Tory-held. John Smith's legacy has made itself felt. Mr Tony Blair, almost certain to succeed him as Labour leader, is likely to be more, not less reassuring to those among the middle- and skilled working classes who think Labour once again is a party fit to vote for. There is not necessarily a correlation between the results of a European election and the outcome of the subsequent general election. But this time there might be.</p>

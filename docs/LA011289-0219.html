Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BODY BUILDERS TO BE DRUG-TESTED  </P> <P> Manitoba will become the first Canadian province to impose mandatory drug  testing on amateur body builders, at the provincial championships in June, the  president of the Manitoba Amateur Body Building Assn. said.  </P> <P> Randy Pearson said it's time to start weeding out steroid users.  </P> <P> "They are taking the place of people who don't use steroids by winning at a  lower level and then not being able to compete after that, because there is  testing on national and international levels," Pearson said.  </P> <P> He said he didn't expect the plan to meet much resistance.  </P></p>

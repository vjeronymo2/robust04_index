			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 (CNS) -- China will find it much  more difficult in getting rid of its foreign trade deficit this  year, according to a projection made by the member of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference and head of the study group for  restructuring the foreign trade system Mr. Wei Yuming.    Mr. Wei pointed out that some factors would have an effect  on  export growth in foreign trade this year.    First, the shortage of capital places foreign trade  enterprises in a difficult position while they will also find it  rather difficult in obtaining loans from banks. Capital for the  purchasing of export commodities is inadequate.    Second, domestic prices are going upwards leading to a rise  in prices for export commodities, a phenomenon also affecting  overseas businessmen's confidence in China's commodities.    Third, the world economy is seeing a slump and the overseas  market is not brisk.    Following the release of rights to foreign trade to a lower  level since last year, according to Mr. Wei, relevant work has  been done in the wake of necessary adjustments during the past  year. Banks have also tried their best to lend support to such  trade. China is ready to set up import and export banks which  will be advantageous to the foreign trade target set for this  year.    The most difficult period in the course of the restructuring  of the foreign trade system is something of the past, Mr. Wei  said. The new problem, according to Mr. Wei, mainly lies in the  exploitation of a diversified market in a bid to let foreign  trade enterprises develop into large groups as well as  preventing the drainage of talented personnel from this sector.</p>

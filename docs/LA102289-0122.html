			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION '89;  </P> <P> 3 CANDIDATES VIE FOR 2 SEATS ON POLICY-SETTING LIBRARY BOARD  </P> <P>  Three candidates are vying Nov. 7 for two vacancies on the Palos Verdes  Library District Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> The library board serves without salary and sets policy for the three-library  system serving the Palos Verdes Peninsula cities of Rolling Hills Estates,  Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Seeking the two seats on the board are incumbent trustee Janet C. Smith, 55, a  community volunteer; Frances M. Bolton, 46, a demographer, and Teresa Sun, 54,  also a community volunteer.  </P> <P> Incumbent Robin Hinchliffe is not seeking reelection, so there will be at least  one new face on the five-member library board.  </P> <P> Alex Rennie, 72, a retired general contractor, will be on the ballot, but he  has withdrawn from the race because a business venture may take him out of the  area.  </P> <P> All three candidates say the quality of the library is not an issue in the  election, nor are there major problems to tackle. The biggest community gripe  -- no Sunday hours -- was largely resolved last fall when the main library at  Peninsula Center was opened Sunday afternoons during the school year.  </P> <P> The candidates -- and the library -- are awaiting the results of a study  examining library use with an eye toward the changing peninsula population and  whether modifications in services are needed. Library district Director Linda  Elliott said the study, which is to be completed this month, was authorized by  the trustees. Among the changes on the peninsula is that its youth population  is declining, the older population is increasing and there is a burgeoning  Asian community that now accounts for 20% of the population, she said.  </P> <P> Although she is seeking a second term, Smith is facing an election for the  first time because she and Hinchliffe were declared winners four years ago as  the only contenders for the two seats.  </P> <P> A Rancho Palos Verdes resident, Smith is emphasizing her experience and  knowledge of the community. "I've lived for 26 years in the community and have  been fairly active in groups since 1980," she said. "I have a pretty good feel  for the community." She added that she is "open to change . . . and responsive  to the changing demographics" of the peninsula.  </P> <P> Bolton, a resident on the Rancho Palos Verdes east side for three years,  believes that her activity on area issues -- particularly her membership on the  board of the East Peninsula Educational Council -- gives her name recognition.  The council has been at the center of a bitter fight over keeping Miraleste  High School open despite a decision by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified  School District to close it because of declining enrollment.  </P> <P> A first-time seeker of public office, Bolton said: "I think I'd be a good  representative for the public. I do believe the taxpaying public's opinion is  very important. We need to listen and serve."  </P> <P> Sun, who came to the United States 30 years ago from Taiwan and has lived in  Rancho Palos Verdes since 1971, believes that she could provide the board with  the perspective of the peninsula's growing immigrant population -- particularly  its Asian residents. The former college professor has been involved in several  community groups, and has served on the multicultural committee of CAP, the  Community Assn. of the Peninsula.  </P> <P> While praising the present quality of the library, Sun said she would like to  see the collection and programs provide "a wider view of the world and of  different cultures." She said the library could be instrumental not only in  helping immigrant people become a part of the community, but in making the  community more receptive to them.  </P> <P> Both Smith and Sun are working on advanced degrees, Smith a master's in English  and Sun a doctorate in education.  </P></p>

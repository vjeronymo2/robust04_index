			<p>BFN     [Text] The radioactive situation in the Tomsk region, where  the Siberian chemical plant is situated, is very complex;  several territories are contaminated with Plutonium-239 and 240  as a result of numerous discharges from this enterprise, Marina  Khotuleva, expert of the Radioecological Research Center of the  Social- ecological union, declared to Interfax.    In her words, contamination of territories located nearby  the  Siberian chemical plant in Tomsk-7 exceeds the background  contamination several times, in some places it is 3000  becquerels per sq.meter.    "Discharges of radioactive water from the plant into the Tom  river have resulted in its contamination with radionuclides  Cobalt- 60, Zinc-65, Manganese-54," said Khotuleva.    As she said, the Radioecological Research Center conducted  an  independent investigation of the consequences of the accident at  the Siberian chemical plant which occurred on April 6, 1993 and  found out that the territory was additionally contaminated with  a short life cycle radionuclides, Ruthenium-103, Niobium-95, and  Cerium-144.    Ecologists are concerned over the fact that liquid  radioactive wastes are being pumped into the underground water  layers for storage for a long time already.    As Khotuleva declared, a total of 40 Mn cubic meters of  liquid wastes, including those which contain plutonium have been  pumped under the ground since early fifties till now. "Nobody  can rule out possibility that these radioactive materials can  appear in reservoirs and in water supply systems intended for  drinking," said she.</p>

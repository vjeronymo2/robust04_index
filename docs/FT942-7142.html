			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (4): Patience is running out - How Japan's corporate bond market is being undermined The Japanese way of doing things gradually, in an orderly manner with a long-term perspective, has long been considered by outsiders to be the reason for its success in becoming an industrialised power. However, in the world of finance, this rule does not apply. The piecemeal reforms under way in Japan's financial markets today, are undermining Tokyo's chance of becoming a truly international financial market. The country's financial markets have been tightly regulated by the powerful ministry of finance, and closed to outside influences until the 1980s. However, the stock market boom of the late 1980s and the rise in the financial power of Japanese financial institutions led to calls for deregulation both from home and abroad. However, financial authorities, who feared losing their power over the industry, financial markets and capital flows, have been reluctant to implement fully-fledged reform, claiming that it would bring 'confusion' to the markets and investors. Such dragging of feet, say market participants, will lead to a decline in Japan's position as an international capital market, even though it may be among the world's largest. 'Japan's capital and foreign exchange market is facing a severe case of hollowing out,' says Mr Mikio Fujii at Nomura Securities' bond division. He says issuers and investors are shifting their activities to less regulated offshore markets such as Hong Kong. Restrictions on the types of investment products which can be issued, difficulty in bringing market prices into fund-raising activity, the lack of a proper secondary bond market, the lack of hedging tools for straight bond trading are frustrating foreign investment houses which hoped for a lucrative market following deregulation. Officials at foreign securities houses now also warn that their patience will not last forever. 'If things haven't changed by April next year, we will have to reconsider our Tokyo operations,' says a leading US investment house. Since the mid-1980s, the ministry of finance has been promising deregulated financial markets. So far, on the corporate bond market, they have managed to lift various regulations and bring in the mechanism for the primary market. Over the past year, the limit on the maximum amount of new issues has been lifted, and the market has been opened to a wider range of issuers, with the minimum credit rating for issuing foreign and domestic yen bonds by Japanese companies lowered from single A to triple B. Restrictions on floating rate notes has been lifted, while companies issued domestic dual currency bonds for the first time in March. The entrance of banks' subsidiaries into the securities business, the initial step for the ministry's partial easing of the barrier between the securities and banking industries, has also helped bring in competitive pricing and increase the number of companies issuing corporate bonds. Ten trust banks and long-term credit banks were allowed last April to establish securities subsidiaries, and city banks, or the large commercial banks, will follow suit this summer. However, products such as junk bonds and index-linked bonds are still barred, and the ministry of finance is hesitant about innovative instruments tailored for the issuers' needs - an area in which foreign investment houses excel. Asset securitisation, which many foreign securities companies are eager to promote, has also failed to take off domestically due to the ambiguous status of asset-backed securities as an investment instrument, and various procedural barriers. And although the corporate bond primary market has grown to Y2,900bn, a secondary market remains virtually non-existent due to an archaic bond registration law, and the lack of an efficient clearing system. Because the Japanese legislative system treats bonds in the way in which they were treated before the second world war when such instruments were considered unmovable assets, investors are required to register their bonds with designated banks. Such procedures can sometimes take up to a month, hampering smooth trading. A centralised clearing system similar to Euroclear would solve such problems, boosting secondary trading. This would require a change in legislation but strong opposition from banks, which receive a registration fee, and the cost of setting up such a system are obvious barriers. However, foreign investment house officials say such fundamental problems need to be solved if Japan is to become an international financial centre. Along with such structural problems, large Japanese institutional investors still remain reluctant to diversify investments and balance risks with returns. Here again, much of this is due to rigid investment guidelines set by the ministry of finance. But brokers say the mentality of the Japanese fund manager, who is not evaluated on the basis of his investment returns, has been partly responsible for the slow pace of the country's financial revolution. Since performance does not affect the salaries or the amount returned to the beneficiary, investors tend to be satisfied with low risk, low return products and do not feel the need to trade bonds or to buy asset-backed securities. Mr Fujii at Nomura likens the Japanese capital market to someone with the 'moratorium syndrome' - common among Japanese university students, who refuse to go out into the real world after graduation. 'It's like a spoiled child, who suddenly realises he's become an adult physically, but doesn't really want to grow up,' he says.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Price of keeping Jaguar in native habitat may rise: The carmaker's strong position over government aid The government's decision to give Jaguar Pounds 9.4m grant aid to persuade it to keep assembly of its new sports car in the UK could be dwarfed by the scale of the support that would be needed to ensure the company's next new range is manufactured in Britain. Jaguar, the British luxury carmaker, acquired an array of new options for production locations after its Pounds 1.6bn takeover by Ford of the US late in 1989. Ford - which has made little secret of its pique at the UK government's strong support and encouragement for the rival Japanese carmakers Nissan, Toyota and Honda in the UK - is clearly determined to extract maximum advantage from any 'mobile' investment projects. Outside the company it had always been taken for granted that the new luxury sports car range - to replace the XJS coupe and convertible - would be produced at Jaguar's plants at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham (body welding and paint), and Browns Lane, Coventry (trim and final assembly). But Ford made clear to the Department of Trade and Industry that the car - code-named X100 - could just as well be assembled at its plant at Azambuja, Portugal, where the authorities were ready to provide handsome amounts of state aid to acquire such a prestige project. This time Pounds 9.4m was enough to keep the X100 project in the UK. It is likely that much more will be needed when the bidding starts to attract the project for Jaguar's planned smaller sports saloon. The project - code-named X200 - is for the development of a new car range for Jaguar, below the XJ6 luxury saloon, which would compete with rivals such as the BMW 5-Series. This car, planned for production towards the end of the decade, could radically increase Jaguar's production volumes, but it is far from clear that it would be built in the UK. No final decision has yet been made, but it is expected that the new car would be a derivative from a new range of rear-wheel drive cars planned by Ford for production in North America. The Jaguar version could be assembled in the UK, but it may need a large of amount of state aid to convince the US carmaker to make such a choice. Ford has faced a difficult ride with Jaguar in its early years of ownership. It has been in loss for the past five years and is not expected to return to profit until 1995. Its fortunes are improving after radical restructuring and help from rising demand in the US and the UK, its two main markets. It should be further boosted by the launch later this year of the substantially revamped version of its XJ6 luxury saloon, the X300. Jaguar cut its operating loss last year to Dollars 371m from a loss of Dollars 412m in 1992 and one of Dollars 354m in 1991. Last year it increased its retail sales by 22 per cent to 27,000 - including a 47 per cent jump in sales in the US to 13,000.</p>

As noted above, EPA's notice regarding the Ohio SIP addressed this deficiency through its technical support document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> d. WPS's Air Quality Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> WPS Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> WPS supplied an alternative air quality analysis that concluded, ``Controls resulting in the PM&hyph;10 emissions in Attachment 2 are shown to meet the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 when naturally occurring buoyancy of several process fugitives is included in the dispersion modeling.'' Attachment 2 lists the PM&hyph;10 emissions rates for model input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Setting aside the problem that this analysis was not submitted by the State of West Virginia and, therefore, does not satisfy the requirement of section 189(a)(2), this analysis is not approvable as an attainment demonstration for at least two reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the emissions estimations used as model input are flawed. While an attempt was made to correct the unapprovable aspects of emissions from coke ovens, estimates of emissions from WPS's basic oxygen furnaces (BOF) in Mingo Junction, Ohio remain profoundly underestimated. Deficiencies in BOF emissions estimation were outlined in the TSD and described in more detail in EPA's notice and TSD regarding the Ohio SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the buoyancy of emissions from certain large volume sources (coke oven battery fugitives, the BOF, and blast furnace cast houses) was only incorporated in the estimation of impacts at receptors (locations) where a more conventional methodology failed to show attainment. This approach is unapprovable because incorporation of buoyancy effects, by design, will disturb the spatial distribution of estimated PM&hyph;10 impacts. Therefore, it is necessary to model using a more extensive array of receptors than was employed in the WPS analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, WPS's air quality analysis does not effect today's action or its underlying rationale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is approving West Virginia's submittal for the limited purpose of incorporating the enforceable provisions into the SIP and disapproving the submittal for the purpose of fulfilling the attainment demonstration requirements of Part D of Title I of the Act. EPA is also formally finding that PM&hyph;10 precursors do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 concentrations exceeding the NAAQS in the Follansbee area (see section 189(e)). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Note that while EPA is making a general finding for this area, today's finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such potential differences in the significance of precursor emissions in PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This limited disapproval constitutes a disapproval under section 179(a)(2) of the Act (see generally 57 FR 13566&hyph;67). As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, the State of West Virginia has up to 18 months after a final SIP disapproval to correct the deficiencies that are the subject of the disapproval before EPA is required to impose either the highway funding sanction or the requirement to provide two-to-one new source review offsets. If the State has not corrected its deficiency within 6 months thereafter, EPA must impose the second sanction. Any sanction EPA imposes must remain in place until EPA determines that the State has come into compliance. Note also that any final disapproval would trigger the requirement for EPA to impose a federal implementation plan within 24 months as provided under section 110(c)(1) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

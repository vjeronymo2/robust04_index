			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: USX-US Steel Group expects improvement MR Charles Corry, chairman of USX, expects the company's USX-US Steel Group to have a better year in 1992 than in 1991, Reuter reports.

Mr Corry said he was reluctant to forecast when the US economy might turn up. But he added that USX does expect the second half of 1992 to be better than the first half. He also said that US Steel had in recent weeks seen a slight upturn in its orders for steel.

Earlier this week, Bethlehem Steel, the second largest US steelmaker, said it was exiting some of its businesses in a restructuring that would result in the elimination of 6,500 jobs. It also eliminated its 10 cents-a-share quarterly dividend. Mr Corry noted that USX's board declared the steel group's 25 cents-a-share quarterly dividend on Tuesday, unchanged from the previous quarter. He said any further decision on the dividend would be made on a quarterly basis. Early in 1991, US Steel had said it would shut down part of its Fairless Works in eastern Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, the company said it was closing its South Works in Chicago. 'We have nothing further in mind at this time,' said Mr Corry. 'We have honed our operations pretty well.'</p>

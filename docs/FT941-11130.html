			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Time limits on a Pep I have a self-select general Pep. At the moment, it consists of Pounds 17,000 equities and Pounds 10,000 cash. Some Pounds 6,000 of this cash was added in early December (for 93/94). I am an active investor and will buy and sell from time to time. The plan managers, the stockbroking arm of a major bank, wrote to me on December 20 1993 urging immediate investment of the cash. Otherwise, they said, the Inland Revenue might declare the plan invalid. The latest edition of The British Tax Reporter says the last Revenue release on general Peps stated there was no limit to the time cash may be held in the plan. Please can you tell me who is right? If the bank is right, could I sell all equities in the plan and keep the cash in it? How long before the cash had to be re-invested, and what percentage of it could be retained as cash in the plan? If no - what proportion could be sold and how long before the cash released into the plan had to be re-invested and what proportion of this could be retained in the plan in cash? The Personal Equity Plan Regulations 1989 (as amended) do not specify an absolute time limit within which cash held by a plan manager must be invested or reinvested. But failure to use available cash to make investments within a reasonable time would be prima facie evidence that a so-called personal equity plan was, in fact, a sham and that the investor was simply trying to exploit the Pep legislation for tax-avoidance purposes. People who prefer cash to equities should put their money in a tax-exempt special savings account, not a Pep, and must accept the Tessa restrictions. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

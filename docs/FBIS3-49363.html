			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Jan 6 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister  Antonin Baudys today said that further cuts in the Czech Army  will probably be halted in the near future and that it is  possible that the role of the Army will grow again.    At a press conference, he said this would depend on  developments in the former Yugoslavia and in southern areas of  the former Soviet Union as well as on what the political and  economic consequences of the first democratic elections in  Russia would be and how they would be reflected in concrete  steps, given the economic and political stabilisation of the  country.    Baudys said that the reduction of military forces is a  historical process currently underway in Europe as a result of  the break-up of the bipolar world. He said it was a natural  response by certain states but not all of them. In this context  he mentioned Sweden, which is increasing its army budget, and  Austria, which is strengthening its anti-aircraft defence.    Baudys said that, in his opinion, there should be no cuts in  the army in future, but rather that its effectiveness should  increase. Therefore, it is necessary to build effective systems  of management and command and effective defence systems. But  this is rather expensive, and "we must take into consideration  what our budget is," he concluded.</p>

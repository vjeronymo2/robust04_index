			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk arrived in  Luxembourg today on a one-day working visit, following meetings  there on Monday [13 June] and Tuesday of the European Union's  Council of Foreign Ministers. Also today, he signed an  agreement on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and the  European Union.    The document confirms that the EEC member-states will  support  Ukraine as a sovereign and independent state within its existing  borders. The agreement lays down the principles of, and a  mechanism for, a permanent political dialogue between Ukraine  and the EEC and systems of periodic consultations at different  levels on the entire range of political, economic, cultural, and  other issues.    The agreement also provides a qualitatively new basis for  economic relations between Ukraine and the European Union on  market economy principles. The sides will grant each other most  favored nation status in trade, and will lift import  restrictions with regard to trade agreements in coal, metal, and  nuclear materials. Ukraine will also be able to sell its textile  products on the European market.    The sides urge employers to lift discriminatory restrictions  on employment of the partner country's citizens and ensure that  the citizens' pension rights are preserved.    National terms are granted to European Union companies  functioning on Ukrainian territory and with regard to access of  trade ships to each side's ports.    The Ukraine and Luxembourg foreign ministers signed an air  transport agreement.    The Chernobyl aid package to ensure complete shutdown of  this  nuclear plant and the safety of others will be finally agreed  before the G-7 Summit in Naples. Leonid Kravchuk confirmed  Kiev's consent to shut down the Chernobyl reactors if the  international community assists Ukraine in this matter.</p>

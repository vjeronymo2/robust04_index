			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Problem an opportunity Sir, I was disappointed to read the quotes from Roger Key, partner at consulting actuaries, R Watson and Sons, in your story 'Goode report strikes a fine balance' (October 1) and in the Lex column ('Goode intentions') in reaction to the Goode report recommendation on a 90 per cent solvency floor test for a final salary pensions scheme's wind-up position. They were, respectively, that 'many actuaries are likely to recommend that schemes switch their investments to gilts which historically have yielded less than equities' and that 'heavier investment in gilts would surely result'. By the judicious use of derivatives (one market-leading investment house has a Guaranteed Fund, which gives a 90 per cent guarantee on the value of equities purchased based on previous years price highs) the potential problem subsequently becomes an attractive opportunity.

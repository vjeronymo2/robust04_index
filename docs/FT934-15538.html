			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (8): Where to go for expert help - Cross-border moves by businesses often run into big problems. Yet good advice on avoiding potential pitfalls is not hard to find, it just depends on investors accepting that they need guidance / Planning a move which seemed absurd, as he had only flown in from the US that morning. Another couple of faces at the table also started to look vaguely familiar. He was too busy negotiating with an agent over the cost of office equipment to investigate further, but the puzzle was solved a few days later in a local bar after a hefty thump on the back and deafening shout. 'They were old Army buddies I had not seen in years,' he says. 'Like me, they were setting up German outlets and we had all chosen our old stamping ground. We were stationed together nearby in the 1960s'. Every consultant dedicated to preaching the science of location analysis has a similar story to tell: the Japanese entrepreneur who checked potential sites against a map of Europe's top golf courses; the British chairman who insisted on a distribution centre conveniently close to a Riviera marina where his yacht was berthed; and an Italian who rejected several suggested cities because the hotels and shopping did not impress his mistress. But most of the 200 or more of the leading inward investments to Europe each year are a lot more scientific, according to Stephen Bradley of Plant Location International, a subsidiary of Price Waterhouse. Around half call in specialists to organise the whole project and the rest usually farm out at least some of the tasks, ranging from acquiring multi-million-dollar buildings to advising on the right car to drive in Spain. 'The worst problem is when a group gets half way through a project and then finds it can't handle it,' says John Siraut, of Ernst &amp; Young's European Location Advisory Service. 'Sometimes you have to push them back to square one, questioning whether they are even looking at the right areas.' Big international management groups have been handling cross-border investments for decades but the tempo has accelerated in the last couple of years. Both PW and E&amp;Y dealt with around 30 or 40 developments each over the last 12 months as companies rush to set up inside the Single Market or find new outlets in eastern Europe. Other advisers are also treading on their heels for a share of this expanding market, however. Property consultants have built networks of offices around Europe which can be tapped for the cross-border acquisition of sites and premises. Richard Ellis, for instance, has just developed a master plan for Hewlett-Packard's properties in Milan and bought a new headquarters site for L47bn. The Corporate Property Group also helps companies moving into the UK by helping choose locations and negotiate with local authorities and arrange finance. Jones Lang Wootton claims to have broken the traditional link with landlords and developers to act purely in the interests of occupiers - 'when a company asks us to recommend a location, we are not looking to buy or sell buildings on our books but to find the best deal,' says Andrew Burt, of JLW Corporate Real Estate Services. They also go further than rents and prices, delving into other factors such as labour costs, housing and schools. His team is currently drawing up an appraisal of Lisbon, looking at facilities, such as restaurants and hotels. Another client aiming to set up a software centre wants information on universities which would provide a stream of graduates. Finance is another significant factor where advisers can prove invaluable. Every European country has an army of official information centres, ranging from individual towns through government development agencies to a network of European Commission offices dedicated to offering the best deal on grants, incentives and loans. Trying to work out the best deal can be daunting, however - 'it can be crucial, for instance, whether you choose to locate on the Swiss side of the Italian border or vice versa,' says Mr Bradley. Grants and incentives are so fiendishly complicated that Price Waterhouse's guide is more than an inch thick and needs updating each two years. A more immediate source of costs and incentives for each region called Eurosite is held by PLI on a computer database. INDEPENDENT researchers also feed in a growing body of information. Companies can compare the expense of keeping staff in various locations through indices for every major city compiled by the PE Centre for Management Research. It also produces and constantly updates guides to salary levels and European personnel policies. 'A successful move often depends on detailed knowledge of non-financial matters such as whether you need to pay maternity benefits in Spain, where to get health care in St Petersburg or how to deal with industrial tribunal procedures in Switzerland,' says Anita Saunders of Hamptons Relocation, which will be providing house-price information for the PE cost index this year. Such legal and cultural quirks are constantly on her mind as she deals with the least predictable factor in cross-border investment - people. Most of the leading advisers farm-out movement and resettlement of staff to specialists like Hamptons because they just cannot handle the variety of demands, and strong emotions, involved. Finding the right home, the right schools, perhaps the right golf courses - and simultaneously pleasing a spouse who might not be thrilled about moving  -requires endless diplomacy, tact and patience. You may have to tell an executive that driving a flashy company car is not the done thing in Spain. His wife might need similar persuasion not put too much importance on the marvellous kitchen which attracted her to a Turin apartment; the Italians often take such fittings along when they move. Many cross-border moves turn into a disaster - and two-thirds of those failures are because businesses choose the wrong location, says Mr Bradley. Yet advice on avoiding the potential pitfalls is not hard to find: it just depends on investors accepting that they need guidance. Rediscovering your Army buddies or playing on the best golf course in Europe rarely balances out the cost of a false move.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORKING TIME REGULATIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country and maximum hours in a working week; with figures on the right to show the maxium overtime allowed:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria, 40 hours                                  60 hours a year Belgium, 40 hours                         65 hours in three months Denmark, no legislation                    no overtime legislation Finland, 40 hours                     20 hours per two-week period France, 39 hours                                  130 hours a year Germany 40 hours                                   60 hours a year Greece, 40 hours                                  150 hours a year Ireland, 48 hours                                 240 hours a year Italy, 40 hours                            no overtime legislation Luxembourg, 40 hours                               two hours a day Netherlands, 48 hours                              12 hours a week Norway, 40 hours                                  200 hours a year Portugal, 44 hours                                160 hours a year Spain, 40 hours                                    80 hours a year Sweden, 40 hours                                  200 hours a year Switzerland, 45-50 hours                                 350 hours UK, no legislation                         no overtime legislation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: EC and national governments  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

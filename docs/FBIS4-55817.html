			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 22 (TANJUG) -- The government of the  Bosnian Croat republic of Herceg-Bosnia [as received] has  decided to introduce a new currency as of June 1 -- the kuna.  The kuna, which is the national currency of neighbouring  Croatia, will replace the Croatian dinar, which has so far been  in circulation in Herceg-Bosnia too.    Despite strong protests, the government in Zagreb has  decided  to reintroduce the kuna, the national currency of the Nazi  puppet independent state of Croatia which existed during World  War Two. The opponents of the Croatian Government's decision  argue the kuna will only link Croatia with its infamous Nazi  past. The Moslem government in Sarajevo has still not reacted  to Herceg-Bosnia's move.    After almost a year of fierce battles, Bosnian Moslems and  Croats in mid-March yielded to U.S. pressure and signed a  federation agreement. The constitution of their binational  state in Bosnia, which should subsequently form a confederation  with neighbouring Croatia, envisages a single federal currency.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / BZW fined for breach of rules BZW Futures, the futures broking arm of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has been fined a total of Pounds 67,500 by the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange for breaching its rules. As well as fining BZW, Liffe fined four BZW floor traders, who were found to have 'acted with reckless disregard for the interests of a client' in incidents between April and June 1992. Liffe fined all four traders and suspended them from the exchange floor for between two weeks and two months. The breaches involved executing clients' orders at disadvantageous rates and crediting the resulting profit to a BZW futures account. Nearly 100 bond futures trades were executed through BZW Futures' 'error account', designed to handle failed trades. The breaches involved losses to clients of less than Pounds 5,000, and there was no personal profit for the traders. The four were named as Mr Giovanni Cameran, booth manager, Mr Tom Rainey, booth broker, Ms Louisa Gibson, pit trader, and Mr Jason Willis, booth broker. Mr Cameran and Mr Rainey have both resigned from BZW, a spokesman said. Mr Cameran was fined Pounds 2,000, Mr Rainey Pounds 4,750 and Ms Gibson and Mr Willis Pounds 1,000 each by Liffe. The breaches were discovered as a result of routine surveillance procedures, Liffe said. Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of Liffe, said: 'It is a matter of great regret that these breaches of the exchange's rules occurred.' The breaches are an embarrassment for Mr Nick Durlacher, BZW Futures chairman, who is also the chairman of Liffe. BZW said yesterday it accepted the findings of the Liffe disciplinary panel and did not condone any disregard for Liffe rules. BZW has about 35 traders and support staff on the Liffe floor. In 1992, BZW Futures contributed Pounds 5.75m to BZW's Pounds 241.8m pre-tax profits.</p>

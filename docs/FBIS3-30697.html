On the 3d of this month, Tusk said in Bialystok  that the new party will also be counting on the so-called  absentee electorate. He added that the UD-KLD unification  congress will take place in April this year.    "The unification itself of the two parties does not give any  positive effect, and it can cause withdrawal of small, marginal  groups from the new party. While maintaining everything that is  good in the KLD and the UD, the most important task for the new  party will be to create such an image of the party that would be  attractive to the "absentee electorate," Tusk stated.    "As far as the leadership of the two parties is concerned,  the determination [to merge] is mutual. Amid the party  grass-roots there is skepticism, as such a merger for the  middle-rank people in the union and the congress will mean lost  opportunities for promotion because the internal competition  will increase," the leader of the KLD said.</p>

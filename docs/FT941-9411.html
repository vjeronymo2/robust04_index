			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Observer: Play it again, Yam Yaman Toruner, Turkey's new central bank governor, is better qualified than his predecessors in one respect. Apparently he's a big fan of Madonna and has indeed been known to bop at her Turkish concerts. Hence Turks are hoping that this might help him strike a chord with a 'material girl' much closer to home - Turkey's first female prime minister, the redoubtable Tansu Ciller. It's a challenge that has beaten the two previous incumbents of the governor's office.</p>

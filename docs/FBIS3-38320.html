			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara, Jan 31 (A.A) -- Central Bank Director  General Bulent Gultekin announced his resignation on Monday [31  January], five days after an 13.6 percent devaluation of the  Turkish lira.    Gultekin, at his post since August 26, said the atmosphere  of  confidence was fading and there was a need for a medium-term  economic programme.    Bankers had been calling for the governor to resign after  what they said was monetary mismanagement which led to the  devaluation last Wednesday night.    Gultekin was quoted as saying the Central Bank had used all  the necessary tools to soothe the markets, thrown into disarray  by currency chaos.    He said the bank `was left unaided' since two international  credit agencies cut Turkey's rating on January 14.    `My resignation will not lead to a new crisis,' Gultekin  told  reporters at a news conference.    `I hope my resignation will bring the seriousness of  economic  problems onto the agenda', he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by Eugen Georg </F> Schwarz and Bettina Baeumlisberger; place and date not given:  "The Government Must Travel the Country"]    [Text] [FOCUS] Confidence in the coalition is dwindling  and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is gaining a  lot of sympathy. How can the Christian Social Union [CSU]  counteract this?    [Waigel] What we have brought about politically in Bonn is  not at all bad --in particular, fiscal and monetary policy,  health reform, the postal service, and development aid. In  concrete terms: the government's strict consolidation course,  equalization of financial burdens between the Federal Government  and the laender, the law to secure business location Germany,  health, railway, and postal reforms, and asylum laws. We are  still competent in all these areas, and the SPD is not.    [FOCUS] According to all the opinion polls, the majority of  voters sees this quite differently.    [Waigel] This does not scare me. If I were to ask the  people who has the necessary experience in health matters, seven  out of 10 would say: Horst Seehofer, not Rudolf Dressler. As  far as the debate on postal reform goes, the voters do not know  anyone in the opposition who has commented on that matter.    [FOCUS] But you cannot gloss over the low morale.    [Waigel] It is, of course, right that nine months before the  general elections, we are going through difficult and unsteady  times and that the government and the coalition have to mobilize  all their forces to deal with our political opponents. So far,  they have hardly ever done that and have been busy with  themselves. It no longer makes sense to work our way from  coalition circle to coalition circle, from mediation committee  to mediation committee. Due to the agonizingly slow  decisionmaking processes, the results of these actions are no  longer credited to the government.    [FOCUS] How do you want to change this?    [Waigel] It is a matter of doing what can be done. In  nursing insurance, for instance, a decision has to be taken  during the next few weeks: Is there still something to do or not.    [FOCUS] There is not much to do in other areas either. Most  people seem to have lost hope that the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU]/CSU can lead them out of the recession.    [Waigel] Everyone should know that the reasons that brought  about the recession, and thus the strict austerity measures,  could not have been influenced and were no responsibility of the  government: the structural crisis of the economy, European  problems, reunification, loss of the East European markets.    [FOCUS] However, the question "How can the government lead  us out of this misery?" remains unanswered.    [Waigel] I see this quite differently. Our fiscal and  economic policy has resulted in the first signs of economic  recovery. This year, we will certainly have some economic  growth again. The interest rates on the capital market are  lower than ever before and offer a good starting point for  investment. The inflation rate is declining, possibly to below  3 percent this year. There have been tax reliefs for companies.  All these factors will strengthen the positive economic trend.  But, we must also say this: Politics is not responsible for  everything that happens in the economy, especially not for  things resulting from false wage policies. Reasonable wage  settlements are necessary. Strikes are the last thing we need  in this situation.    [FOCUS] As finance minister, you are the best hated  politician in Bonn because, with your strict austerity measures,  you are after people's purses. How do you cope with that?    [Waigel] Without severe public savings, the problems cannot  be solved. Anyone who does not understand this should suggest  an alternative. Savings are always expected to hit the others:  If I cut social benefits, they call me a "cold social killer."  If I cut the Bundeswehr budget, then security is endangered.  If I cut research, I endanger technological progress. Wherever  I cut, I do the wrong thing because I cannot do it right, since  I have to save 70 billion German marks [DM] everywhere. The  necessity to save is accepted, but the willingness to save in  one's own sector leaves much to be desired. The debate on  saving is a phony one.    [FOCUS] Are you talking about the SPD?    [Waigel] I am particularly annoyed with those who did not  want reunification in 1989-1990. Like Mr. Lafontaine, who can  redevelop debt-ridden Saarland with the government's help of DM8  billion, or take Mr. Scharping, who secured DM219 million in the  solidarity pact negotiations to finance political leadership in  his land. Both these gentlemen now add these sums to the  federal debts and cry out: Look at Theo Waigel's enormous debts.  They are the biggest hypocrites in the debate. I will deal  with this very intensively during the next few months.    [FOCUS] You are painting a very positive picture of the  government's work. Why do you think the coalition is no longer  supported by the majority of the population?    [Waigel] Did Adenauer and Erhard let themselves be  influenced by opinion polls? How often did Franz Josef Strauss  have to weather the storm. They had a clear conscience and the  courage to do what they thought was right in Germany's interest.  We also have a clear conscience, because this government  achieved more over the last four years than any other government  over the last 30 years. This is why we have to stand up and  say: This is the balance, these are the challenges we are  facing, and this is Germany's role in the world.    [FOCUS] But who is to say this?    [Waigel] The chancellor must say it.    [FOCUS] But he would not do it.    [Waigel] He will do it, but everyone else in the government  has to do it as well. The cabinet must not withdraw to a corner  and sulk, but its members have to travel the country and wake  people up. We have to convince people that our chances for a new  beginning have never been so good before.    Germany is facing a big challenge, just like in 1948. The  SPD is only winning sympathies in opinion polls because it does  not make any specific statements on any problems and only stirs  up dissatisfaction.    [FOCUS] Can you give us an example?    [Waigel] The new asylum law was not passed five years  earlier -- as would have been necessary -- as a result of the  SPD's refusal to cooperate. If the nursing insurance fails, it  will be because there are Social Democrats who would prefer to  make it a topic in the election campaign. Anyone who condemns  monetary and fiscal policies without telling the voters how he  would come to grips with the deficits is stirring up emotions,  but he is not making politics. And the opposition does, of  course, not say a word about Helmut Kohl's foreign policy.  Germany's relations with other countries have never been so  good before.    [FOCUS] But still, the vast majority of Germans do not  appreciate this.    [Waigel] We have to make it clear to the voters that it does  not do any good to go to the polls or vote for a splinter or  even a radical party out of protest. Splitting up the political  forces does not bring about a solution to the problems. It is  quite simple: either us or Weimar.</p>

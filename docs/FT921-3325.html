			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Bovis to manage Olympics construction BOVIS, the construction arm of Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation (P&amp;O), the British shipping and property group, has won the contract to manage the main construction works for 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. The contract, thought to be worth between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn is to provide sports facilities and accommodation, transport, communications and other infrastructure. A spokesman for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games said that McDevitt and Street, an Atlanta-based subsidiary of Bovis, had been selected as lead contractor for the construction programme, but the detail of the contract was still under negotiation. It is the latest in a string of large contracts for Bovis which managed the construction contract for the first phase of the Euro Disney theme park near Paris and has recently won a Dollars 700m contract to manage the second phase. It also managed construction of the Canary Wharf tower, Europe's second tallest building, for Olympia &amp; York in London's former docklands.</p>

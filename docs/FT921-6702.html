			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A preference for proper equity 12.9) ECC's decision to repay the bulk of its US auction market preferred stock (AMPS) with the proceeds of a Pounds 200m rights issue will do little to calm jitters in a once fashionable corner of the securities market. It always seemed imprudent for companies to build a substantial part of their capital structure on an instrument which relied on a tax concession for its efficiency; the strategy becomes that much more unwise when the relative cost of servicing starts to increase. ECC's decision will no doubt revive discussion about how AMPS are to be treated under revised rules from the UK's Accountancy Standards Board. Common sense suggests they should be included as debt for cover purposes in the profit and loss account. The unfortunate example of Ratners demonstrates that in balance sheet terms they can more legitimately be counted as equity. ECC, though, is very far from the Ratners league and investors, encouraged by a much better than expected profit forecast, shrugged aside the cash call with a 7p increase in the shares. It may be the new paper will put an end to the recent outperformance of the shares. But with chief executive Andrew Teare's touch apparently as sure as ever it would not do to count on it.</p>

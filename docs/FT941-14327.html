			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (27): Revived fortunes lure investors - European insurance company shares rose by 57 per cent in the 12 months to November 1993, outperforming the FT Actuaries Europe index by 13.2 per cent / A look at the sector / Sector Analyses - Insurance Attracted by the prospect of improved trading prospects and sharp increases in the value of insurers' investment portfolios, the markets favoured the European insurance sector last year, leading to increases in the capitalisation of the continent's largest companies. Nine of the leading 10 companies edged their way up the FT500 rankings. During 1992, profits at a number of Europe's biggest general insurance companies were dented by rising claims in motor and property insurance and a fall in capital gains. Last year, though, insurers pushed through rate increases, and investors responded positively to indications of an upturn in the traditional insurance cycle. The markets were also lured towards the sector by trends in the equity and bond markets. Insurance companies, especially in Germany, Switzerland, France and Italy, benefited from the trend towards lower interest rates which increased the value of their bond portfolios. Figures produced by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK securities house, show that European insurance company shares rose by 57 per cent in the 12 months to November 1993, outperforming the FT Actuaries Europe index by 13.2 per cent. Reflecting the particularly strong performance of the German markets during the year, Germany's largest insurers all did well. Allianz Holdings, Europe's biggest insurer, increased its standing from 7th to 4th. Munich Re, the biggest reinsurer, moved up 10 places to 27. AMB Aachener &amp; Muenchener - the German insurer whose share price almost doubled in 1993 - improved its ranking from 201 to 154, while Allianz Lebensversicherungs, listed separately from its Munich-based parent, also moved up the table by 24 places to 96. Italy's biggest companies also figure prominently in the listings, again reflecting a combination of a strong performance of the local stock market and expectation of future profits following premium increases. Generali, the Trieste-based company - and Europe's second largest - improved its ranking from 23 to 20, while its Alleanza life insurance subsidiary, move up 43 places to 90. Alleanza's position was also strengthened by a mid-year capital raising exercise. Fondiaria, the Florence-based company which left the 500 last year following a poor performance of its share price, re-entered at number 270 (with a capitalisation of Dollars 2,022.8m) while SAI and RAS both improved their standings from number 282 to 163 and from 417 to 309. Scandinavian companies saw the value of their shares plummet during 1992, largely as a result of confusion surrounding efforts by Uni Storebrand and Hafnia to take over Skandia, the region's biggest insurer. Following the failure of those efforts and a marked improvement in local trading conditions, Skandia's share price has recovered. It is now the 372nd largest European company with a capitalisation of Dollars 1,438m. Trygg-Hansa SPP Holding of Sweden, and Baltica of Denmark, two other leading Scandinavian insurers caught amid the market turmoil in 1992, have also re-entered the 500, Trygg standing at 381 with capitalisation of Dollars 1,409.7m and Baltica with capitalisation of Dollars 999.9, standing at 477. France's two largest companies also show up well, with part of the improvement here reflecting the impact of the biggest cross-border deals in the sector during the year, in which both Assurances Gejnerales de France (AGF) and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) strengthened their position in the German market. During 1993, AGF issued more than 10m new shares as part of an exercise to raise capital to increase its stake in AMB from 25.1 per cent to 33.5 per cent. The issues will increase capitalisation by about Fr6.4bn. UAP also raised about Fr1.3bn in fresh capital as part of its moves to secure control of Colonia, Germany's second biggest insurance company, from the Suez Group. (The listings only partially reflect the impact of these moves, since only part of the AGF capital increase and all the UAP increase are included in the September 30 capitalisation figures on which the tables are based. UAP moved up from 69 to 58, while AGF rose from 110 to 80). British insurance companies sustained record losses during 1990 and 1991, when they were hit by a combination of weather losses and recession. During 1992 there was a recovery in their fortunes, with rate increases helping two companies - Commercial Union and Guardian Royal Exchange - into profit, and reducing losses at Sun Alliance, Royal Insurance and General Accident. The recovery continued in 1993, when each of the five companies was expected to be back in the black. Two companies - Royal Insurance and Commercial Union - repaired their balance sheets with rights issues. Royal raised Pounds 404m in a deeply discounted rights issue in May, while CU raised Pounds 428m in February. Both companies' capitalisation increased, with Royal Insurance moving up the rankings from 303 to 189. Other leading insurers to edge upwards include Swiss Re (up six places to 102), which, like its rival reinsurer Munich Re, has benefited from particularly attractive trading conditions in international reinsurance markets. A string of catastrophe losses, including hurricane Andrew, the United States' most expensive natural disaster in August 1992, has depleted the reserves of the reinsurance industry, leading to increases in rates of up to 400 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INSURANCE COMPANIES BY MARKET CAPITALISATION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 FT500    Company                         Dollars m     Rank   Sector  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 Allianz Holding                   30867.4        4      151  2 Generali (Assicurazioni)          18347.3       20      151  3 Muenchener Ruckversicherungs      13975.6       27      151  4 Prudential Corporation             9827.0       56      141  5 UAP                             9585.5       58      151  6 Zurich Insurance                   7972.5       70      151  7 AGF                                7189.2       80      151  8 Alleanza                           6090.2       90      151  9 Allianz Lebensversicherungs        5894.8       96      151 10 Swiss Reinsurance Group            5719.8      102      151  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 11 Fortis                             5026.3      116      151 12 Commercial Union                   5023.2      117      151 13 General Accident                   4818.7      119      151 14 Aegon                              4780.7      120      151 15 Sun Alliance Group                 4733.2      123      151 16 Lloyds Abbey Life                  4638.4      125      141 17 GAN                                4033.4      141      151 18 Winterthur Versicherung            4003.2      142      151 19 AMB Aachener &amp; Muenchener Beteil   3712.8      154      151 20 Legal &amp; General Group              3614.9      156      141  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 21 RAS                                3442.5      163      151 22 Royal Insurance Holdings           3017.5      189      151 23 Guardian Royal Exchange            2818.0      202      151 24 Victoria Holding                   2664.5      212      151 25 Fondiaria                          2022.8      270      151 26 Royale Belge                       2000.4      277      151 27 SAI                                1752.6      309      151 28 Baloise Holding                    1582.6      343      151 29 Wuerttembergische AG Versich       1538.3      353      151 30 Volksfuersorge                     1505.8      357      151  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 31 Toro (Assicurazioni)               1491.6      359      151 32 Skandia Forsakring                 1438.1      372      152 33 Trygg-Hansa SPP Holding            1409.7      381      151 34 Britannic Assurance                1380.0      390      141 35 Mapfre (Corp)                      1139.6      438      151 36 DBV                                1104.3      443      151 37 Nuernberger Beteiligung            1074.5      453      151 38 Baltica Forsikring                  999.9      477      151 39 Codan Group                         973.7      485      151 40 Assitalia                           932.1      499      151  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky 42302, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;538&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon an exchange service between Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Gas states that on January 16, 1979, Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf received an order in Docket No. CP78&hyph;525&hyph;000 (Order) issuing to them a certificate of public convenience and necessity (6 FERC &para;61,038 (1979)) authorizing the transportation of natural gas by Columbia Gulf and the exchange of gas by Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf under a transportation and exchange agreement dated July 6, 1978 (Agreement). Under the Agreement, Columbia Gulf received for Texas Gas's account, on a firm basis, up to 3,000 Mcf per day of gas purchased by Texas Gas at the Exxon Garden City Gas Plant (Plant) in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, through an existing interconnection between Columbia Gulf and the Plant and transported such gas to Columbia Gulf's Rayne Compressor Station in Acadia Parish, Louisiana, it is stated. Columbia Gulf says that it then retained such volumes, less a pro rata share of fuel and delivered by exchange equivalent quantities of natural gas, less such pro rata share, to Texas Gas at an existing interconnection between Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf in Egan Parish, Louisiana.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Gas further states that such Agreement was terminated by the parties effective January 16, 1991.

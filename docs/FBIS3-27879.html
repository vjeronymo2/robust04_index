			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu says that the North Korean nuclear issue  would be referred to the U.N. Security Council unless it is  resolved by Feb. 21 when the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] convenes a Board of Directors meeting. Han made the  prediction in an interview with Japanese correspondents  stationed in Seoul, the KYODO news service reported Thursday.    Han also explained that even if North Korea agrees to IAEA  inspections of its nuclear facilities, the agency will now have  to undertake much more thorough and additional inspections as  continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has already  broken, KYODO said.    Han said he expects some kind of results will emerge from  the  IAEA-North Korean negotiations on the inspection within next  week. Han added that they could be either positive or  negotiative, KYODO said.</p>

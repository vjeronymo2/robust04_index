			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> CELTICS' PRIDE, PLAYOFF FUTURE ON THE LINE  </P> <P> The mood Monday was hardly one of fear or desperation. Nothing that transpired  on the Boston Garden floor would lead an onlooker to think that it might be the  last practice of a long season for the Boston Celtics.  </P> <P> Robert Parish, kept out of shooting drills because of his tender right elbow,  mercilessly mocked teammates Kelvin Upshaw and Ron Grandison. Larry Bird  perspired like Moses Malone and stayed for some three-on-three with the scrubs.  He is still on hold until the next series, or next season, whichever comes  first.  </P> <P> Kevin Gamble and Dennis Johnson watched from the sideline in sweat suits,  hoping their bodies would do the impossible in 24 hours: stop hurting.  </P> <P> And the coach? Did he feel as if he were standing on a trap door with Detroit  Pistons stars Isiah Thomas or Dennis Rodman holding the lever?  </P> <P> "We're three victories away from winning this series," Jimmy Rodgers said.  "That's the way we're approaching this."  </P> <P> The Pistons, however, are only one victory away, having held serve in the  Palace with defensive-oriented 101-91 and 102-95 victories. They can close out  things Tuesday night with a victory, which would make them only the third team  to sweep the Celtics in a playoff series (Milwaukee 4-0 in 1983; New York 2-0  in 1951).  </P> <P> The Celtics don't have to be told what it's like to be up 2-0 in a best-of-five  series; they were in such a position in 1984, '85, '86, '87 and '88. In three  cases, they dropped Game 3 before administering the coup de grace in Game 4. In  the other two, they finished off their prey in the third game.  </P> <P> "They definitely can smell blood now," Parish said of the Pistons.  </P> <P> And the Celtics? They hope to awaken Wednesday, smell the coffee, and head back  to Boston Garden for another practice instead of to clear out their lockers.  They have been eliminated in the first round of a playoff series only four  times in 35 post-season forays, the last time 33 years ago to the Syracuse  Nats.  </P> <P> And, despite Pistons Coach Chuck Daly's typically pessimistic pronouncements  ("I expect this to go five games"), the Celtics would need something akin to a  miracle to avoid a fifth first-round exit.  </P> <P> They can take some solace from the site. They were 30-8 in Boston Garden this  season and had won 12 straight in the 60-year-old home until their April 18  defeat to the Washington Bullets.  </P> <P> "It's a psychological lift to be at home, a pride thing," Parish said. "Plus,  the mood now is very relaxed. No one is up-tight, although we do know we have  our hands full."  </P> <P> And even the best of road teams (such as the Pistons, who were an NBA-leading  26-15) have had trouble away from home in the playoffs. For instance, the  1985-86 Celtics were 27-14 on the road; in the playoffs they were 5-3. The  1986-87 Los Angeles Lakers were 28-13 on the road and also were 5-3 on the road  in the playoffs.  </P> <P> So, there is hope, even if neither of the above lost a game in the first round.  </P> <P> "We're definitely in for a dogfight there," Mark Aguirre said.  </P> <P> The Celtics can also be optimistic about their chances given their play in each  of the first two games. The problem each time has been one lousy quarter  undoing three pretty solid ones. Against Detroit, that's too much to give away,  however.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing,  vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, said here  today that the parties concerned should try every means to  resort to dialogue for settling the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    During a meeting with Choe Kwang, chief of the General Staff  of the Korean People's Army, and his party this morning at the  Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, Liu said that on the Korean  peninsula nuclear issue, it is China's basic goal to promote  denuclearization and maintain peace and stability in the region.    The people and armies of China and the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) enjoyed profound friendship, Liu said,  and such valuable friendship should be passed on from generation  to generation.

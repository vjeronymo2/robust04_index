From now on, we must gear all our efforts toward  prevention and education." This was how Raymond Kendall, the  secretary general of Interpol, summed up the conclusions of the  second pan-European conference on drug addiction, which brought  together some 40 European health ministers at the Council of  Europe.    Prevention and education: Those were the main points of the  conference, along with an undercurrent of aid to the countries  of East Europe, which are for the moment totally devoid of any  legislation, institutions, or specialist personnel. Cooperation  with the East European governments, which are asking for a great  deal of aid to combat drugs, "is slowly taking shape," explained  Christopher Luckett, head of the drug division at the Pompidou  group. "These countries have set up government committees on  drug trafficking with which we are working," continued Luckett.    Unlike our Western democracies, East Europe is not yet used  to a high level of consumption of hard drugs. "In these  countries, alcohol, solvents, and the abuse of medicines  prevail," continued Luckett. The priority in the fight against  drugs is therefore, as the Interpol head stressed, "to prevent  the importation of a consumption market into East Europe. This  is where prevention is essential," something which could be  implemented through pan-European action.    East Europe -- a drug transit region through the historic  Balkan route, which bypasses wars like the one in Yugoslavia, or  which finds different ways --has become a major production area.  This is what really worries most of the participants at the  Strasbourg conference. "Indeed, our biggest worry today, or at  least the worry of the institutions which are fighting drug  trafficking and production, is the tens of thousands of hectares  planted with poppy and cannabis and growing in the Asiatic  republics of the former USSR: Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and  Tajikistan have now become uncontrollable areas for us, where  local and ethnic conflicts are mixed up with arms and drug  trafficking, with the one financing the other." Luckett  concludes that Europe has no weapons to fight this.</p>

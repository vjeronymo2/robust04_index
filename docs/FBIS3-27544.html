A Foreign Office spokesman, when contacted, told XINHUA  today  that all the staff has been evacuated from the embassy after  Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali left Kabul  Thursday.    "Nobody remains in the embassy in Kabul," he said.    Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, who paid a brief  visit to Kabul on Wednesday and Thursday, is expected to give  more details this afternoon at a press conference about his  visit and the closure of the Pakistan's embassy in Kabul.    "The present condition of the chancery in Kabul is such that  it cannot serve as a diplomatic mission till major repair and  maintenance is carried out," said a foreign office statement.    On Wednesday, several embassy employees were beaten and part  of the facility set on fire during a violent anti-Pakistan  demonstration by hundreds of Afghans.    They protested against Monday's killing of the three armed  Afghans who had hijacked a school bus and held over 70 children  and teachers hostage, demanding ransom, food supply to  Afghanistan and opening of Pak-Afghan border.</p>

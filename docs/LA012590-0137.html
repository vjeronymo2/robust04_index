			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH TO PROPOSE $1.1 BILLION IN AID TO PANAMA  </P> <P> President Bush today will announce a $1.1-billion package of aid to Panama  designed to help the country recover from the pre-Christmas U.S. invasion and  to resuscitate its crippled economy after 21 months under American economic  sanctions.  </P> <P> Officials cautioned that the proposal, developed in secret by the National  Security Council, still has not won final approval from the President and could  well be changed slightly at the last minute.  </P> <P> However, senior officials briefed key members of Congress on the plan late  Wednesday and said they expect it to remain essentially intact.  </P> <P> A White House official said Wednesday that the Administration will seek  congressional approval for $500 million in new cash aid in a supplemental  budget request later this year, rather than including it in the fiscal 1991  budget that Bush will send to Congress next Monday.  </P> <P> The remaining $600 million would come in the form of trade benefits, loans and  loan guarantees and incentives to increase private investment by U.S. firms,  which have little impact on federal spending levels.  </P> <P> The program includes these elements:  </P> <P>  -- $45 million to $50 million in emergency humanitarian aid to help  Panamanians recover from the looting that followed the invasion, rebuild  shattered homes and businesses and provide welfare payments to the homeless.  </P> <P>  -- $500 million in direct cash assistance, first to inject new cash into  Panama's once-flourishing banking system, which was strangled by the U.S.  economic sanctions, and second to finance major public works projects designed  to restart the economy.  </P> <P>  -- $500 million worth of medium-term help designed to get Panama's economy  moving again. These range from credits for agricultural goods to loans and  guarantees for trade and investment and restoration of trade benefits cut when  the sanctions were imposed.  </P> <P> The latter include duty-free status for Panamanian exports, revival of Panama's  allocation under the U.S. sugar-import program and renewed participation in the  Caribbean Basin Initiative, which grants tariff cuts for basic imports here.  </P> <P> In addition, the two countries will begin fast-track negotiations on an  investment treaty that could prompt increased investment in Panama by American  firms.  </P> <P> The public works projects would have two goals -- to rebuild the country's  deteriorated infrastructure, including roads, bridges, highways and schools,  and to create new jobs so as to relieve unemployment.  </P> <P> About $125 million of direct cash assistance would help bring Panama up to date  in its payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank -- a  prerequisite to obtaining further loans from those institutions.  </P> <P> Washington also will try to get other industrialized countries to contribute to  the effort and may provide a temporary bridge loan to tide Panama over until  International Monetary Fund and World Bank loans actually are disbursed.  </P> <P> Panama is $540 million in arrears on payments to the World Bank and  Inter-American Development Bank. Its debts to commercial banks, not covered by  the package that is to be announced today, would be negotiated separately.  </P> <P> The package outlined Wednesday is similar to the $1.5 billion in aid requested  by the government of newly installed Panamanian President Guillermo Endara.  </P> <P> Administration officials said the approach taken in the package -- that is,  providing so much in trade preferences and other indirect assistance -- was  based on the belief that Panama already has a viable economic structure.  </P> <P> "They're politically stable, so they're going to be getting this stuff  automatically," one said. "Look at it as a jump start. That's what they need.  Then they're off and running on their own. The very presence of the (Panama)  Canal is a stabilizing factor."  </P> <P> At the same time, however, officials conceded the job may be more difficult  than some might have expected, partly because Panama's banking sector -- which  provided a hefty portion of the country's overall earnings -- had made so much  of its income from drug-related money laundering.  </P> <P> One official said that what has been missing most is the political stability  and U.S. economic backing needed to restore confidence among international  investors.  </P> <P> "We hope this will go a way toward reviving some of that," one well-placed  official said.  </P> <P> The official said the Administration had been prepared to present the program  Wednesday but delayed for a day to review it with congressional leaders. He  said the leaders appeared "pretty happy with it" and promised prompt action.  </P> <P> Bush was expected to issue proclamations today certifying that Panama is  respecting human rights and is cooperating in the war against drugs, required  under U.S. law before Washington can resume aid to Panama.  </P> <P> Congressional leaders declined to speculate late Wednesday how soon the aid  package would be passed. But officials noted that the notion of aiding Panama  is popular on Capitol Hill, particularly in the wake of the U.S. success in  deposing strongman Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> They said they expected that lawmakers would give their approval within a  couple of weeks.  </P> <P> The Dec. 20 invasion more than doubled the 13,000 U.S. troops based in Panama  and caused millions of dollars in damage to homes and other buildings.  </P> <P> Endara said last week in an interview with senior editors and correspondents of  The Times that without sufficient economic aid for his government, the effort  put into toppling Noriega will have been a waste.  </P> <P> "For us, the United States' reaction is slow, very slow," Endara said. His  government was seeking $1.5 billion to help it recover not only from the  invasion but also from the economic wreckage left by the two-year American  effort to oust Noriega.  </P></p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Cookery: Is there anyone for squash? I confess I am a nosey parker. Sights and smells gleaned in other people's kitchens inspire me. In markets, supermarkets and specialist shops I find it hard to resist staring into other people's shopping baskets and mentally trying out recipes using the ingredients they are taking home. In Spain, on the plain of La Mancha in the pumpkin season, I was led by the nose to explore the kitchen and larder of a saffron grower whose front door was ajar. She was toasting freshly plucked saffron on a hair sieve placed over a wood-burning stove. An unmistakable smell. An irresistible lure. She welcomed me in. A rabbit caught in the garden that morning hung from a hook, its muzzle neatly bandaged with gauze to staunch the blood. Bunches of grapes and tomatoes on the vine hung from other hooks, drying in the autumn sun, concentrating their sweetness for winter eating. There were shelves of preserves and a row of pumpkins and squash in the process of curing. She offered me an aromatic, freshly baked slice of pumpkin. Not the usual crescent moon slice you might find elsewhere but the top slice or lid of a pumpkin. She had brushed it with fat, she told me, sprinkled it with spices and baked it cut side up with a sheet of foil laid over the top to protect against burning. It smelled delicious and looked wonderful. She had cut it like this for practical reasons - in order to fit the narrow drawer-like oven at the bottom of her wood- burning stove. But the shallow cup shape and the ribs of the pumpkin gave the impression of a prettily fluted flan minus the pastry, a decorative idea I determined to copy. Back in Wiltshire I bought a variety of colourful squashes with which to indulge in kitchen experiments. I apologised to the shopper behind me for holding up the queue with so many purchases. As good fortune would have it she was intrigued by my selection and asked the name of one sort, pointing, so she told me apologetically, with fingers stained from picking mulberries most of the previous two days. I pounced on her greedily, for mulberries are a magical fruit and impossible to buy on the open market, too easily crushed to be commercial. Yet they crop so heavily that anyone who has a mulberry tree tends to have more fruit than they can cope with. I was planning a figgy dessert, I explained, and I thought that vinous-rich mulberrries might provide the perfect finishing touch. Any chance, I begged, that she could let me have some. Kindly she agreed. Hence today's second recipe. GOLDEN NUGGET WITH GOAT'S CHEESE, TOMATOES &amp; THYME (serves 2-8) Choose a flat rather than a ball-shaped squash if possible so that when cut in half each half looks a little like a deep fluted flan tin. The quiche-like filling is deliberately highly flavoured to foil the dense chestnut quality of the flesh. Cut the halved squash into wedges (like a pastry-less flan) for a first course for six to eight. Or allow one half squash per person for a handsomely rustic supper (in this case the squash is best eaten with a spoon). Serve with good bread and a salad on the side. 1 golden nugget squash measuring about 5 1/2 -6 in in diameter; 2 oz Mendip or chevre log goat's cheese; scant  1/4 oz butter; 1 egg; 2 1/2 fl oz single cream; 2 1/2 fl oz double cream; 1-2 sun-dried tomatoes, drained of oil or rinsed and dried if packed in salt; thyme and oregano or marjoram. Cut the squash horizontally in half. Scoop out coarse fibres and seeds. Use the tip of a knife to slash the hollows shallowly with criss-cross cuts. Rub the hollows and the fleshy rims with butter. Sit the squash, cut side up, in a baking dish or in individual oeuf sur le plat dishes, propping them with wedges of bread as necessary to keep them level and steady. Cover loosely with a dome of foil and bake at 400'F (200'C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, brushing the rims with melted butter once or twice as they cook. Beat the egg lightly and mix it with the creams. Snip the tomato(es) into small pieces, add them to the creamy mixture and leave to soften while the squash bakes. Then stir in the diced cheese, plenty of thyme, some oregano and sea salt and black pepper to taste. Carefully spoon the highly flavoured custard mixture into the hollows of the squash and bake for 20-30 minutes more until the squash is perfectly tender and the filling is softly set like a quiche-type custard. Serve warm, rather than piping hot from the oven. MEDIEVAL FRUIT FLAN (serves 8) The ancient combination of saffron and honey, multi-seeded ripe black figs, wine dark mulberries and handfuls of nuts make this a memorable dessert - and it is simplicity itself to prepare if you cheat and buy a ready-made sponge flan case. If you cannot lay hands on either mulberries or blackberries, use one extra fig instead. 1 x 10 1/2 inch sponge flan case; 1 x 200 ml tub of creme fraiche;  1/4 teaspoon or so of orange flower water; 4 level tablespoons runny honey; a good pinch of saffron; 4 very large ripe black figs; 4 oz ripe mulberries or blackberries (optional); 1 oz pistacchio kernels (2 oz in the shell);  1/2 oz slivered almonds;  1/2 oz pine-nuts Stand the jar of honey in a pan of hot water for at least 20 minutes so the contents become very liquid. Meanwhile pound the saffron to a powder with mortar and pestle, pour on 2-3 teaspoons boiling water and leave to infuse. Shell the pistacchio nuts, and toast the almonds and pinenuts in a fatless frying pan over low heat. Beat the orange flower water into the creme fraiche. When smoothly blended spread the creamy mixture over the flan base. Slice the figs and lay them, just overlapping, over the cream. Scatter with berries and sprinkle with nuts. Measure the honey carefully into a small bowl that has been warmed by rinsing it out with hot water. (If you do not have a standard tablespoon (15 ml) measuring spoon, use a tableware dessertspoon - as the capacity of tableware spoons tends to be much greater than that of measuring spoons, and too much honey will make the flan oversweet.) Stir the saffron into the honey and drizzle the mixture over the fruit and nut filled flan. Leave until cold before serving with a bowl of soured cream or creme fraiche.</p>

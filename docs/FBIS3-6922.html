Against this background, Japanese Government officials  reportedly began closed-door discussions of "economic sanctions"  against the DPRK on March 22.    The non-existent "nuclear issue" of the DPRK is not a matter  to be discussed by the United Nations Security Council. The  attempt to take such "sanctions" through the United Nations  against the DPRK on the charge of its refusal to accept an  unwarrantable "nuclear inspection" is unjustifiable and  unreasonable from the legal point of view and is a gross  violation of the UN charter.    This is nothing but an offspring of such perfidious act of  the United States as wholly reversing the agreed conclusions  reached between the DPRK and the United States at the New York  contact and its trite hostile policy toward Korea.    Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries, obtrusively  enough,  are showing extra zeal in "economic sanctions" against the DPRK,  while adding fuel to the U.S. criminal scheme to take this step  through the United Nations. This is an intolerable, grave  challenge to the DPRK.    It is only too clear that they are seeking to isolate and  stifle the DPRK at any cost by setting the "international  cooperation system" in motion and, at the same time, add wings  to their ambitious scheme to become a nuclear power, charging  the DPRK with the "nuclear issue."    While keeping mum about their criminal design to turn Japan  into a nuclear power any time, they are trying to take even  unjustifiable "economic sanctions" against the DPRK, labelling  this peaceloving nation as a "nuclear offender." This is a  criminal act which may entail a perilous situation.    We have already declared that if seditious forces dare put  unreasonable pressure upon us in the form of "sanctions," we  would regard it as something equivalent to "a declaration of  war."    In that case, there will be nothing good for Japan, either.    The Japanese reactionaries must properly judge the serious  developments and promptly stop their reckless scheme of  "economic sanctions" against the DPRK.</p>

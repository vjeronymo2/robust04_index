			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TED BUNDY SHOWS US THE CRYSTALLIZING EFFECT OF PORNOGRAPHY  </P> <P> It is tempting to do our best to forget Ted Bundy, but this man and the lessons  that his life offers must not be forgotten.  </P> <P> Bundy roamed the country on a 20-year trail of premeditated, sadistic violence  -- a trail marked by rape, mutilation and murder. In a chilling final interview  beforehis execution, he discussed at length some of the formative influences in  his destructive life. The role of alcohol abuse is not surprising, but the role  of hard-core pornography in his life sheds new light.  </P> <P> Bundy documented his early exposure to hard-core pornography, saying that the  material had a "crystallizing effect" on his violent tendencies and his  eventual acting out of the fantasies he had seen depicted for so long. Bundy  referred to hard-core pornography as the fuel for his fantasies.  </P> <P> We could dismiss these conclusions as the 11th-hour ramblings of a psychopathic  murderer if the evidence supporting them were not so strong. Most Americans are  unaware of a 1985 study of 36 other serial murderers by the FBI. According to  the final report of the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, 81%  of those studied "said their biggest sexual interest was in reading  pornography."  </P> <P> The words of Arthur Bishop, executed in June for having sodomized and murdered  five boys (ages 4 to 13) in Utah, are particularly illustrative: "Pornography  wasn't the only negative influence in my life, but its effect on me was  devastating. I lost all sense of decency and respect for humanity and life, and  I would do anything or take any risk to fulfill my deviant desires."  </P> <P> Like Bundy, Bishop went on to describe his progress in the use and abuse of  pornography. Starting with addiction to common pornography, he escalated to a  need for more violent, degrading material and to an increased propensity to act  out fantasies portrayed in such material.  </P> <P> For those who have seen today's hard-core pornography, the progression is not  surprising. The range of degradation includes the explicit depiction of  simulated and real rape, whipping, bondage, torture, urination and bestiality  (sex with animals). The material is a far, far cry from the airbrushed  centerfolds of 20 years ago.  </P> <P> When one sees the true content of the hard-core world, it's not difficult to  believe that, as many researchers and studies have confirmed, it has  contributed to the rise in the abuse and degradation of women.  </P> <P> Ted Bundy, like so many who have gone unnoticed before him, reminds us that the  time has come to stand together in opposing pornography. In most states, laws  are already on the books to prosecute this material. The Supreme Court has  declared unequivocally that obscenity is not a protected form of speech. Yet  hard-core pornography remains readily available on the shelves of adult  bookstores and so-called "family" video outlets.  </P> <P> So what lesson can we learn from the death of a serial killer? That we no  longer can remain ambivalent. Each of us must stand up and let our local, state  and federal officials know that hard-core pornography destroys lives and must  be stopped. The world of hard-core has already produced enough victims. How  many more Bundys or Bishops must tell us of pornography's destructive role? How  many more studies must be completed? How many more lives must be lost before we  say enough? It's time that the charade of hard-core pornography's innocence  ended.  </P></p>

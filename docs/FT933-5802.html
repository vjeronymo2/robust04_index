			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Litton Inds wins Dollars 1.2bn suit against Honeywell A LOS ANGELES jury yesterday awarded Litton Industries, the Californian high technology group, Dollars 1.2bn for the alleged infringement of a patent by Honeywell, the Minnesota-based controls company. But Honeywell pointed out that the judge was continuing to hear evidence in the case, which it insisted was far from over. The jury's award is very high by the standard of patent cases and could hurt Honeywell's shares when the New York Stock Exchange begins trading this morning. The stock of both companies was suspended ahead of yesterday afternoon's announcement and trading did not resume later in the day. The case centres on ring laser gyroscopes, a device used in aircraft navigation, which Honeywell pioneered in the 1960s. Litton alleges that Honeywell infringed its patents, taken out in 1979 and 1989, for a process to coat mirrors used as part of the gyroscope's measuring system. Honeywell argues that Litton's patents are invalid and Honeywell's coating process is anyway different from that of its rival.</p>

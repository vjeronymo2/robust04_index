			<p>BFN     [Text] Member of Jordan's delegation to the Arab-Israeli  peace negotiations Mundhir Haddadin says since 1967 Israel has  been using all the water in the River Jordan, to which the  kingdom has natural rights. He said because Jordan was unable  to organize the flow of the al-Yarmuk River by constructing  dams, Israel increased both pumping the al-Yarmuk waters for  storage in the Tiberias lake and utilizing them directly. Mr.  Haddadin said much of the water used by Israel from the  al-Yarmuk River is of Jordan's rights. He said Israel uses  about 80 million cubic meters per annum well over its natural  rights of the river, which do not exceed irrigation of 16,000  donums. He said considering these facts, Jordan was obliged to  insist that water rights be included under item three of the  joint agenda agreed upon with Israel on September 14, 1993. Mr.  Haddadin said in order to negotiate the water issue, Jordan  proposed a secondary agenda for detailed discussions, adding  that this is what was agreed upon between both sides following  four sessions of talks on June 7, 1994.</p>

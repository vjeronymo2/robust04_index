			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Lindt executive quits as marriage wrangle deepens THE CHIEF executive of Lindt &amp; Sprungli, the Swiss fine chocolate makers, has resigned two days after the 72-year-old chairman, Mr Rudolph Sprungli, announced his marriage to a 44-year-old member of an obscure religious sect. The resignation puts a serious twist on a story which has in recent days brought some levity to a depressed summer in Zurich, sparking speculation about the family-controlled group's future. Mr Ulrich Geissmann is the latest in a long line of executives to fall out with Mr Sprungli, who has led the secretive company for 30 years. A joint statement said only that the respected former executive with the Migros retail group would leave tomorrow 'by mutual agreement'. Zurich analysts suggested that the marriage was the last straw for Mr Geissmann, who was appointed in June 1991 with a mandate to cut costs and update the group's slightly dowdy product range. They said he had been given assurances that, unlike his four predecessors in the previous six years, he would not be faced with constant interference from the chairman. However, last spring it became known that Mr Sprungli had divorced his wife and become engaged to Ms Alexandra Gantenbein, a sometime member of an obscure religious sect called 'I am'. Simultaneously, allegations surfaced that Ms Gantenbein, who was not employed by the group, had improper influence on its executive appointments. Mr Sprungli promptly called off the engagement and appointed accountants KPMG Fides to investigate. Last Thursday, the group published the results of the investigation, claiming that they showed that all was well. But one sentence quoted from the report suggested otherwise. 'Mrs A. Gantenbein, occasional member of the 'I am' movement, gained some importance and influence in decisions over top manager positions,' it said. On Monday afternoon, the couple's marriage was announced, and by last night Sprungli shares had lost one-tenth of their value. The departure of Mr Geissmann creates a serious problem. No one of any stature will want to replace him under the present leadership, said Mr Rene Weber, analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich. Exact details of how the family controls the group are unclear, but its total holdings have slightly less than half the voting rights and are split mainly between Mr Sprungli and his ex-wife. The three Sprungli children are set to inherit the business, but that could change, analysts said. Observer, Page 15</p>

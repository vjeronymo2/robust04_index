			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EBERSOL IS NAMED HEAD OF NBC SPORTS  </P> <P> Dick Ebersol, one of the creators of "Saturday Night Live," Tuesday was named  the president of NBC Sports, effective May 1.  </P> <P> He will replace Art Watson, who has been president of the network's sports  division since 1979 and has been with NBC since 1956.  </P> <P> Watson, 54, will remain with the network as an executive vice-president until  his anticipated retirement next year. In his new position, Watson will continue  to be involved in rights negotiations.  </P> <P> Ebersol, 41, started at ABC Sports in 1967 as an Olympics researcher and became  executive assistant to Roone Arledge, the department's president, in 1971.  Ebersol also was a college football producer.  </P> <P> At 28, Ebersol became an NBC vice-president after he and an independent  producer, Lorne Michaels, created "Saturday Night Live" in 1975. Ebersol,  currently the producer of "Later With Bob Costas," is married to actress Susan  Saint James.  </P> <P> Tuesday's announcement came as a surprise. It had been speculated that when  Watson retired, either Ken Schanzer, current executive vice-president of  sports, or Al Barber, the network's executive vice-president who oversees  sports, would become president.

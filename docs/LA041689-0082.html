			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAP  </P> <P> Rap is an extension of African-American genius. What bothers me is that the  local black weekly newspapers have failed to give rap the coverage it deserves.  </P> <P> Ice T, Dr. Dre, Malcolm, et al., have yet to receive proper respect for  cultural achievement. Why should Times writers Hilburn, Hunt, Hochman and  Marlowe have to author such when the local black weeklies should have been in  the forefront?  </P> <P> TOM REED  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 15 BUILDINGS PROPOSED FOR HISTORIC STATUS  </P> <P> After two years of study, Whittier officials are proposing that the city  designate 15 buildings as historic structures, covered by a special code that  prohibits owners from altering the buildings' appearance without city approval.  </P> <P> The City Council deferred action Tuesday night, and scheduled a study session  March 13 to discuss the proposal.  </P> <P> Some owners of the buildings complained that the city's proposal is an  infringement of their rights.  </P> <P> "I want to be allowed to get up on a Saturday morning and paint my front steps  . . . without getting a work permit," Barbara Light, the owner of one of the  homes, told the council Tuesday night. "I want to be allowed to select the  colors of the paint on my home and decide whether my bushes need to be pruned."  </P> <P> But local conservationists say that regulations are needed to protect the  city's historic resources.  </P> <P> "These are not just resources that belong to individuals," said Helen Rahder,  spokeswoman for the Whittier Conservancy. "These are resources that belong to  the community. These are resources that belong to everyone."  </P></p>

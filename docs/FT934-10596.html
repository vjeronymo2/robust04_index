			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: MAN cautions on further decline PROFITS at MAN, the German commercial vehicles and heavy engineering group, may have further to fall, following a 45 per cent slump in the year to the end of June, Mr Klaus Gotte, chairman, warned yesterday. Although incoming orders rose 12 per cent to DM3.7bn (Dollars 2.2bn) in the first quarter of 1993-94, all the growth came from outside Germany, he said. Foreign orders were up 21 per cent at DM2.3bn, while domestic demand was unchanged from a year earlier. Meanwhile, sales fell 12 per cent to DM3.2bn. The group expected turnover for the full year to fall slightly to DM18.3bn, compared with DM19bn, while the fall in earnings would be moderated by the shedding of a further 2,000 to 3,000 jobs, according to Mr Gotte. Warning that he did not expect any improvement in domestic demand before mid-1994, he seemed sceptical of a recent report from Germany's six leading economic institutes forecasting 1.5 per cent economic growth next year. The board could only hope they were right, Mr Gotte said, pointing out that investment goods makers were also hoping for relief through lower interest rates and modest pay deals. There were good prospects that MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the trucks and buses division, and mainstay of the whole group, would remain in the black in the current year after last time's fall from DM506m pre-tax to DM61m. MAN Roland, the printing machinery business which lost DM220m last year, and has already forecast another deficit in 1993-94, had been restructured and was well-placed to return quickly to profits once markets improved. Global demand for printing equipment had almost halved since the winter of 1991-92, Mr Gotte said. Reviewing the last financial year, he reported growing sales in east Asia, which accounted for 20 per cent of all export business. Diesel motors, printing machines and plant construction services had done especially well.</p>

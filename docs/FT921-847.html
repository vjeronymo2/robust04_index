			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Singapore sets 'outstanding example' over trade policies SINGAPORE is 'an outstanding example' of how liberal trade policies and social stability combine to promote economic success, Gatt's secretariat says in a report on the island's trade policies. It sees Singapore as ranking among the world's most dynamic economies. Average annual growth of GDP over the past two decades has exceeded 8 per cent and per capita income is now about Dollars 10,600, (Pounds 6,127), one of the highest in Asia. This dynamism has been founded on outward-looking policies that have encouraged speedy structural transformation, Gatt says. Singapore shifted rapidly in the early 1960s from entrepot trade to labour-intensive manufacturing. Later, it moved to skill- and technology-intensive industries and to services, Singapore has the highest trade-to-GDP ratio of any country in the world, with trade valued at more than three times GDP. Merchandise exports, including re-exports which account for a third of the total, have grown more rapidly than world exports in recent years, the report notes (see chart). With a population of just 3m, the island ranks among the world's top 20 exporters and importers. Some 96 per cent of imports enter duty-free, with virtually no other trade barriers. Singapore's open trade regime has been coupled with large government involvement in the private sector through tax incentive schemes for new investments and research and development, equity participation in industry and sizeable public investments in infrastructure and training. Singapore's trading partners did not find much to niggle about in their discussion of the Gatt report yesterday. Some countries questioned the island's status as a developing country in view of its high per capita GDP, and there was criticism that Singapore had 'bound' (pledged not to raise) very few of its tariffs in Gatt. Singapore was urged to improve its offer on tariff bindings in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, to sign up to more of Gatt's voluntary codes of trade conduct, to run a more open policy-making process and, by the US, to go further in opening its financial services and telecommunications markets in the Uruguay Round services negotiations. The Gatt secretariat says economic prospects look promising despite slower growth last year. Domestically, the main constraints are a shortage of labour and land for expansion, which Singapore is trying to overcome by co-operation with neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia. Externally, Singapore's heavy reliance on international trade means its economic performance 'remains crucially dependent on an open and predictable international environment'.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: TNT bounces back with ADollars 25m TNT, the Australian transportation group which saw boardroom upheavals last year and has been pruning its activities in an effort to reduce heavy borrowings, yesterday reported a net operating profit before abnormal items of ADollars 25.5m (USDollars 18.3m) in the six months to end-1993. The equity-consolidated figure compares with a loss of ADollars 9.81m in the same period of 1992. After abnormal items, the net equity-accounted profit stood at ADollars 22.3m, a sharp improvement on last time's ADollars 74.5m loss. Revenues were ADollars 2.85bn, compared with ADollars 2.8bn. TNT said that the return to profit was largely due to better trading results from Ansett, the Australian airline which it owns jointly with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and to the general restructuring of the group's business, which has involved a significant disposal programme. It pointed out that TNT benefited from some non-recurring items in the first half of 1992, due to the involvement of its event merchandising arm in Expo '92 and the 1992 Olympic Games, and the underlying improvement in the most recent six months was more marked still. Despite the overall advance, the group's core transportation operations still had a mixed first half. The Australian business showed a 'significant' improvement, and the Canadian business continued to turn round. The domestic freight business in the UK was also strong, while TNT Germany improved profits. But other parts of continental Europe were more difficult. The Spanish operations 'performed below expectations in a severely depressed economy'. In Italy, TNT Traco reported profits 'marginally lower' than in the previous period, while in France the TNT Chronoservice business remained in the red, although losses were reduced. TNT's share of net profits before abnormal items from Ansett Transport Industries rose handsomely, to ADollars 38.5m from ADollars 8.79m. But its 50 per cent interest in GD Express Worldwide, the international express delivery operation, delivered a loss of ADollars 24.6m against a loss of ADollars 22.8m last time. TNT said that GDEW's operating loss was expected, and that the target of profits by 1995 was still on course. Interest expenses in the first half fell to ADollars 41.3m from ADollars 46.8m, and the company estimated that its net debt to equity ratio had improved from 2.18 at end-June to 1.08 at end-December. Looking ahead, it added that the improvement in operating performance was expected to continue, but that second-half results would be affected by seasonal factors, especially in the third quarter.</p>

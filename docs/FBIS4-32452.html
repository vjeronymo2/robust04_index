			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] A session of the Council for Istria was  held on Brijuni today under the chairmanship of Franjo Tudjman,  the president of the republic. Zdravko Kleva reporting.    [Kleva] [Video shows Brijuni and the meeting] Assessing the  international position of Croatia and Istria and problems at the  local level, it was seen as useful to form an advisory body.  Consequently, journalists were told after the constituent  session in Brijuni, the Council for Istria was formed. Today's  session was attended by 12 of the 17 members appointed by Franjo  Tudjman, the head of state. Other state officials also attended.    [Begin recording] [Nevio Sesto, not further identified] We  know that two people are out of the country and they could not  attend. Two more people apologized for not being able to  attend. Only one member has not turned up without a word.    [Unidentified correspondent] There was one more member.    [Sesto] Yes, we received a request to extend our membership,  that is, that a member of the Istrian County branch of the  Association of Croatian Volunteers in the War for the Homeland  wanted to join us, and we accepted that. We expect the  president of the republic to soon appoint Mr. Ivan Pletikosa as  a new member of the Council for Istria. [end recording]    [Kleva] The Council for Istria will be active in five groups  which will propose solutions for strategic issues in  Istria--from demographic issues and those concerning culture and  education to economic issues. Advisory groups will be set up to  work on relations between the state administration and local  government. The council will present its proposals to county and  central state authorities.    [Begin Monsignor Josip Pavlisic, president of the Council  for  Istria, recording] On my part, I believe that it is useful to  give a good word or thought to those who seek our advice in  order to coordinate the needs and wishes of the head of the  republic and local bodies. We are not advising political  parties, but people holding certain posts. The president of the  republic is the president of all Croats and people living on  Croatian territory. We decided that we had to take that into  account, and our actions, discussions, and advice will not refer  to a party or the opposition, but how best to achieve the best  conditions for development and improvement of living conditions.  [end recording]    [Kleva] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman invited  representatives of the local public and political life to a  luncheon in honor of the members of the Council for Istria  today. The mayors of Istrian towns and Istrian County Prefect  Luciano Delbianco apologized and did not attend the luncheon.</p>

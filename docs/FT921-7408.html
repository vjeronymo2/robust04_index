			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Another name for shelter ANOTHER week, another acronym in the tax shelter market. This week brought us HEDGE (Higher Education with Determined Growth &amp; Exit), sponsored by Capital Ventures, and RAY (Residences At York), sponsored by Hodgson Martin. Both are covenanted 'buy-back' companies, which attempt to assure a return after five years by buying property for universities and then selling it back to them for a fixed price. HEDGE has buy-back agreements with the University College of North Wales, Bangor, and the University of Salford - at Pounds 1.38 for every Pounds 1 spent now. The rate on offer from RAY is only Pounds 1.28, but this is being funded out of fixed interest deposits bought by the University. Two other companies, Sun Life BesRes VIII Phoenix and SERAH III make no attempt at a guarantee but will go 'bargain-hunting' in search of high capital growth. The most interesting launch is the Friendly Stop Inns series of 14 companies. This extends the 'buy-back' principle to trading companies. It will buy small hotels for Friendly Hotels, and sell them back to Friendly after five years. Investors have a put option to sell the inns to Friendly at a price of Pounds 1.36 for every Pounds 1 spent now, after costs have been taken into account. There is no third party guarantor; the deal is dependent on Friendly, which has net assets of Pounds 73.5m and market capitalisation of Pounds 45m. The Enterprise Zone market remains in the shadow of Canary Wharf, in London's Docklands. The Cabot Square Trust does not have the greatest yield, but does have strong financial security and populist marketing - you receive an invitation to go to the top of the Canary Wharf tower with every prospectus. Laser Richmount this week fought back with a series of less glamorous but possibly higher-yielding EZ trusts. Its Chatham Trust will raise Pounds 16m for five office buildings, aiming for an 11 per cent initial post-tax yield. The Inverclyde Trust is raising Pounds 9.5m (yield 11.76 per cent after top rate tax), while the Dudley Trust is looking for Pounds 9.5m, offering a 13 per cent initial post tax yield.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: CUTTING EDGE OF UNDERWATER WEEDING  </P> <P> If you own lake- or pond-front property, there's a new underwater vegetation  harvester called Water-Weeder, which can make quick work of those pesky  submerged weeds.  </P> <P> The device, which can be used from a dock, shoreline or boat, works like a  below-the-water hedge trimmer or sickle. It uses four-foot stainless steel  blades to cut most types of aquatic vegetation. It is lightweight -- about 8  pounds -- and has an 8-foot aluminum shaft, with an optional four-foot section  that can extend its cutting depth to 12 feet. The tool, with plastic and  fiberglass handles and connections, is powered by a 12-volt motor that can run  off a boat battery or a portable battery pack.  </P> <P> "Up until now, the only way to combat underwater weeds was with a large  commercial harvesting machine" or with chemicals that could cause environmental  problems, said Water-Weeder inventor Michael Schmidt of Waterside Products  Corp. in Mahopac, N.Y., a lakefront community about 50 miles north of  Manhattan.  </P> <P> He said the Water-Weeder, which took him three years to develop, is virtually  tangle-free in operation, because its blades are mounted on special swivel  joints that pivot in all directions. The blades can be reversed in motion,  easily freeing snags. The harvester also comes with a special net to collect  cut weeds when they float to the surface.  </P> <P> Water-Weeder costs $300, "about the price of a good lawn mower," said Schmidt.  It can be purchased by calling the company's toll-free number, (800) 552-1217  or writing to Waterside Products Corp. P.O. Box 876, Lake Mahopac, N.Y. 10541.  </P> <P> Flying Flowers  </P> <P> There's a new San Francisco company that specializes in sending fresh cut  flowers anywhere by mail. But Calyx &amp; Corolla doesn't ship through your  local florist; it mails flowers directly from growers nationwide.  </P> <P> "This concept has never been tried before," said Calyx &amp; Corolla President  Ruth Owades."I think it's the right idea for today, with upscale Americans  spending more time at home, entertaining more, and demanding new levels of  quality and service in their lives."  </P> <P> Calyx &amp; Corolla puts out four seasonal catalogues each year, which can be  ordered through the company's toll-free line, (800) 877-7836. Owades' previous  venture into catalogue selling was Gardener's Eden, a mail-order catalogue for  garden items. She sold that venture to Williams-Sonoma.  </P> <P> Because her new company eliminates middlemen, Owades said it can offer flowers  at "a good price," and deliver them fresher to customers because most varieties  can be shipped via Federal Express the day they are ordered.  </P> <P> For example, the firm can send 25 long-stemmed roses to a home, office, friend  or relative for $88, which includes air delivery. Vases cost extra. Or, for  $495, you can order a year of roses -- 12 long-stemmed, 18 classic or 24  sweetheart -- to be delivered the first week of each month.  </P> <P> The Calyx &amp; Corolla catalogue carries an excellent selection of floral  varieties, including tropical, and will even offer Christmas trees, greens and  wreaths in its fall holiday issue. All prices include air delivery charges.  </P> <P> Owades explained that a small "apartment size" tree, 3-4 feet, from a tree farm  in Michigan will cost $50; a 6 1/2-foot Frazier fur from North Carolina, $95.  </P> <P> Step-by-Step Patios  </P> <P> Do-it-yourselfers will be interested in Patio Pal, new plastic brick-laying  guides that keep bricks permanently in place and weeds from growing in between.  </P> <P> Each plastic form holds eight modular bricks so they will be spaced properly as  you lay your patio or walkway. Designed by San Diego engineer Bob Goldman,  Patio Pals come 10 to a package. The forms interlock and each space where the  brick is to be placed has a drainage hole in the bottom of the plastic.  </P> <P> Once you have put your 2x4 edging around the space where you're building the  brick patio, fill it with sand and smooth so it's level. Place the guides atop  the sand and put a brick in each space in the form. Fill the joints between the  bricks and mist.  </P> <P> "The plastic doesn't slip once the bricks are in it, so you can't make a  mistake and the bricks all sit in place neatly," said a spokeswoman for Argee  Corp., Patio Pal manufacturer.  </P> <P> Patio Pals can be ordered for $8.95 per package, plus shipping and handling,  from Argee Corp., 9550 Pathway St., P.O. Box 222, Santee, Calif. 92071; phone,  (619) 449-5050. Company representatives can tell you how many of the forms  you'll need and the number of bricks, depending on the square footage of the  patio or walk you're building.  </P> <P> By late August, Patio Pals will be available in building supply stores, garden  shops and home improvement centers nationwide.  </P> <P> The Ties That Bind  </P> <P> General Binding Corp. of Northbrook, Ill., recently introduced a new system to  bind up to 30 pages of documents in their own folders.  </P> <P> The GBC 1-Step can turn out permanently bound reports, contracts or  presentations in 60 seconds, once you've placed them in special covers used  with the machine. The 1-Step is compact -- only 12 inches square, 1 inch thick  and weighing less than two pounds.  </P> <P> Company representatives say the system works akin to a car's rear-window  defogging system. Just as an electric current goes through the grid on the car  window to defrost it, the 1-Step uses contact points to transmit electric  current through the cover to melt adhesive and bind loose pages to the folder.  </P> <P> The special covers, which come in six colors and two spine widths, are  available in packages of 25 for $24. Suggested retail for the 1-Step binder is  $99 and it can be found in office supply or stationery stores nationwide. To  locate stores in your area, call the company's toll-free number, (800)  DIAL-GBC. LYNN SIMROSS  </P></p>

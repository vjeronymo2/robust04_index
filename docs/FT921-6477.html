			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / BTR chief attacks attitude of institutions THE BANK of England and the Institutional Shareholders' Committee were 'doing a disservice to investors by encouraging them to think of themselves as owners' Sir Owen Green, chairman of the conglomerate BTR, said yesterday, Barry Riley writes. Speaking at the annual investment conference of the National Association of Pension Funds in Eastbourne, he robustly attacked institutional investors' attitudes to corporate governance. Debating with Mr Mike Sandland, committee chairman, he denounced concepts such as audit committees and independent non-executive directors. 'The word independence sticks in my gullet,' said Sir Owen. 'I don't think there is very much wrong with corporate governance as it stands.' There might be a problem with institutional investors growing so large that they could not easily sell investments in companies they did not like. But that was a fiscal problem rather than one of corporate governance. Mr Sandland, an investment manager with Norwich Union, said shareholders should assume the responsibilities of ownership. Institutional investors should show their commitment by playing a full role as active shareholders. Sir Owen said shareholders would be better regarded as freeholder landlords than owners of public companies. 'It is different in concept from the ownership of goods and chattels,' he insisted.</p>

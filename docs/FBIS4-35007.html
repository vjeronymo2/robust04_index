			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Silvia Pisani] </F>   [Text] Ottawa -- The first day of President Carlos Menem's  visit to Canada was full of diplomatic signs: There were doubts  about a possible meeting (later confirmed) with U.S. President  Bill Clinton, while on the other hand Argentina ratified its  international alignment with Washington.    "If the United States is negotiating the membership of other  countries in NAFTA it is because its two partners agree," Menem  told Canadian congressmen, who asked him to define his position  on the country which they describe as "the elephant that sleeps  by our side." Apparently, Menem's answer did not please the  leader of Congress. He told him that if he had trouble  negotiating with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], he "can  seek our advice." All this was said amid smiles.    Today, Menem will watch the Argentine soccer team play its  first match in the World Soccer Cup, one of the reasons that  prompted him to travel to these latitudes. One activity on his  official agenda is to watch the Argentine national soccer team  play Greece. Menem will attend the next match, against Nigeria,  from a seat in the stadium in Boston.    A few months ago, Menem planned to attend the matches of the  Argentine national team in the United States, so a meeting with  Clinton was slated. Following the electoral setback last April,  however, Menem changed his mind and canceled everything. A  little later, in May, he again changed his mind and he tried to  resume the original agenda.    "So far nothing has been arranged," Menem said about his  possible meeting with Clinton while Argentine delegation sources  gave the meeting "a 0.01-percent chance," adding that if it  happens it will be a "real surprise for everyone." And so it  was. Sweeping aside all pessimistic forecasts, it was later  learned that Clinton would receive Menem on 24 June at the White  House.    Perhaps with the Constituent Assembly in mind, Menem made an  observation about the role of the vice president. He recalled  the resignation of his predecessor Raul Alfonsin, saying that in  that case, "it would have been logical for the vice president to  take charge."    Menem made more definitions:     -  The Argentine proposal to  send troops to the Bosnian front stands, even if congressional  approval is necessary. "Every Argentine soldier knows his  mission is to defend peace and to reinstate it where it is  lost," Menem said. A decision on this subject is imminent.  "Perhaps next week," Menem said.    -  Argentina will sign an  agreement next week for the nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons.    -  Argentina may join NAFTA, but has yet to be invited to  do so. Menem said it would best be to invite the whole of  Mercosur to join.     NAFTA was one of the points discussed during his meeting  with  Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. The Argentine Government  invited a Canadian delegation to visit Buenos Aires to explain  its position regarding the trade agreement with the United  States and Mexico.    Although it belongs to NAFTA, Canada has some disagreements  with Washington and is attempting to counterbalance Washington's  enormous weight by bringing new members into the group.    Most of Menem's entourage members kept an eye on Washington.  "The fast track [preceding two words in English] was approved,  the fast track was approved!" someone said in a low voice  regarding the U.S. Government petition to speed up in Congress a  list, which has yet to be drafted, of countries that could join  NAFTA.    Will Argentina be included? The impression of entourage  members yesterday was yes, but they doubt if the status given to  Argentina "will be the same as that given to Chile... which will  be on better terms."    Menem wants to broaden his enthusiasm for sport. "I may soon  begin to play rugby," Menem told the members of a national  softball team that is playing in a championship here and who  invited him to attend one of their matches. "Just give me a  bat, tell me what to do, and I will learn fast," he said.</p>

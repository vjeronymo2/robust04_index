There has been  no official explanation of why the troops surrounded  Tshisekedi's Kinshasa home but the move appeared to be linked to  a strike on Wednesday called by him to protest the dissolution  last week by President Mobutu Sese Seko of the country's rival  legislatures. Shops and most offices stayed closed and the  capital's streets were virtually empty of traffic all day.</p>

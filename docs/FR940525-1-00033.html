If a national bank has no claim on a transferred asset, then the retention of any risk of loss is recourse. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution transfers assets and retains an obligation to repurchase the assets or absorb losses due to a default of principal or interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse arrangements include, but are not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Representations and warranties about the transferred assets other than standard representations and warranties as defined in this section 1(c) of this appendix A;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Retained loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans being serviced (other than servicer cash advances as defined in this section 1(c) of this appendix A;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Retained subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying assets;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Loan strips sold without direct recourse where the maturity of the participation is shorter than the maturity of the underlying loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (28)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Servicer cash advance  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> means funds that a loan servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments or the timely collection of loans, including disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses arising from a loan to facilitate its timely collection. A servicer cash advance is not recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled to full reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal on that loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (29)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard representations and warranties  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> means contractual provisions that a national bank extends when it transfers assets (including loan servicing rights), or assumes when it purchases loan servicing rights, that refer to existing facts at the time the assets are transferred or servicing rights are acquired and that have been verified with reasonable due diligence by the transferor or servicer. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions for the return of assets in the event of fraud or documentation deficiencies. Standard representations and warranties do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix A <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Amended] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

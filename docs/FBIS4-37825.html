			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maher Chmaytelli] </F>   [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 23 (AFP) -- Fighting on frontlines  around Aden and northern attacks on the city left 30 people dead  and nearly 150 others wounded Thursday [23 June], and the south  appealed for foreign intervention to break the stranglehold.    The bombardments began at dawn, continued through the day  and  were still in progress as night fell. Twenty-two civilians were  killed and around 100 wounded as Katyusha rockets slammed into  the city's northern suburbs and shells hit the city centre,  officials at Aden's main hospital said.    Fierce fighting on the north and northwestern fronts left  eight soldiers dead and 48 wounded when northern troops launched  two offensives, according to the city's other hospitals.  Wounded taken to the main hospital had to be treated in the  corridors because of lack of space, while weeping relatives  crowded the courtyard.    A spokesman for the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic said  on Aden Radio: "Following renewed, blind bombardments by the  north of Aden, we urgently call on the international community  to impose a ceasefire by force." He appealed for northern  troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to be forced to  withdraw from the south and to be treated as war criminals.    Aden Radio called on the town's citizens to "join in the  defence," assuring them there had been no breakthrough by  northern forces, while television read out an army communique  indicating "resistance operations" within territory held by  northern forces. The army statement said 47 northern troops had  been killed in the previous 48 hours during two "resistance"  operations in the Lahij region, some 100 kilometres (60 miles)  north of Aden.    Military sources here said the north had managed to seize  the  entrance to the town of Bi'r Ahmad, 15 kilometres (nine miles)  northwest of Aden, close to one of the city's three power  stations. The plant was hit by eight Katyushas, causing a fire  in fuel pipelines and resulting in a partial shutdown and power  cuts in several Aden districts. A cloud of dust and sand hung  over Bi'r Ahmad caused by explosions as a Toyota car, with a  siren blaring, scoured the area picking up dead and wounded  soldiers.    Electricity was restored to many districts in the city after  a power cut caused by a rocket attack on the Hiswah power plant,  west of Aden.    On the northern front the battle raged for control of the  pumping station at Bi'r Nasir which provides Aden's drinking  water supplies.    Two shells hit the fish market at Ma'allah on the sea front  and a salvo of Kaytusha rockets destroyed five houses in the  working class district of Mansurah. Shells fell on Aden at the  rate of two or three a minute and the Khormaksar district near  the airport and northern suburbs near the front were also hit.    Southern leaders said in a statement that 800 civilians had  been killed or wounded by northern attacks on Aden and its  suburbs since June 17.    Salih and southerners backing his rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid  have been locked in civil war for almost two months.    "The Sanaa regime is continuing to defy the international  community," the statement added, referring to a UN Security  Council resolution adopted on June 1 calling for an immediate  ceasefire and the start of talks.    The north's Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani is en  route for Washington where he is to meet with UN Secretary  General Butros Butros-Ghali to discuss the war which broke out  on May 5. Al-Iryani will also meet UN special envoy Lakhdar  Brahimi who failed to broker a truce during a 10-day tour of the  region, the official SABA' agency said.    The north demands that the south renounce its May 21  declaration of a separate state before entering talks.    The minister, scheduled to hold talks in Washington with  U.S.  State Department officials, will discuss the "means to apply UN  Resolution 924 in the context of Yemeni unity," the agency said.    The war shattered four years of uneasy union between the  former Marxist South Yemen and conservative, tribal North Yemen.    Meanwhile in Cairo, Russian Ambassador Vladimir Polyakov  said  any recognition by Russia of the breakaway state would depend on  the findings of Brahimi's report.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (2): A bet on how long you'll live - Annuities WE START with the investment you usually make at the end of your career. An annuity is one of the most disarmingly simple products offered by the financial services industry, yet a series of distressing issues must be faced when you buy one. You pay a lump sum to a life insurance company, or friendly society, which then guarantees to pay you a (normally fixed) annual income for the rest of your life. The money is invested in gilts (see G for Gilts) to ensure that there is no risk with the repayments. The life office will not pay you any more than the fixed sum, unless you buy a specialised contract, and all payments cease when you die. Your heirs will not benefit. So when you buy an annuity you are effectively placing a bet on how long you will live. If you die soon afterwards, the annuity will turn out to have been a bad investment. But if you live to be 100, the annuity effectively spreads your life savings to keep you financially secure in a lengthy retirement. Two chief factors affect annuity rates: the gilts market and life expectancy. The higher the yield on gilts when you buy your annuity, the better the annuity rate will be. More important, the annuity rate will be higher if your life expectancy is shorter. This means that, as a general rule, you should wait as long as possible before buying an annuity. There are three different times in life when you might want to buy an annuity. When you retire: The bulk of the proceeds of a personal or self-employed pension plan must, by law, be put into an annuity when you retire; as must all the money you have saved through making additional voluntary contributions to a corporate pension scheme. If your company pension scheme operates in terms of a fraction of your final salary, then you will not have the opportunity to buy an annuity with these funds. However, if the company has a 'money purchase' scheme, you need to buy an annuity (see R for Retirement Planning). These annuities are referred to as 'compulsory purchase'. You pay income tax on the entire annuity payment, as it is assumed that this will be your prime source of income. An easy way to boost your annuity payment is to use the 'open market option'. This allows you to shop around different insurers for the best rate, rather than just take the annuity offered by the company which managed your pension fund. To do this, you need an independent financial adviser, who can find the best rate on offer on the market. For example, best rates last month all came from Sun Alliance, according to Baronworth Investment Services. For a down-payment of Pounds 100,000, best fixed rates available were Pounds 12,778 for a 60-year-old man, and Pounds 14,149 for a 65-year-old. A 55-year-old woman could receive a best rate of Pounds 10,796, while a 60-year-old woman would receive Pounds 11,479. Inflation is the great enemy of your income when you retire. If you are lucky enough to have a long retirement, the real spending power of your fixed-rate annuity may be eroded. A range of annuities can combat this problem, but they are expensive. Insurance companies usually offer protection against inflation only in return for paying you a substantially lower annuity in the early years. The longer you think you are likely to live, the more appropriate an inflation-proofed annuity will be. Annuity contracts which afford some protection against price rises are: Index-linked annuities which rise in line with the retail prices index; Increasing annuities which rise by a fixed amount each year (normally 5 per cent); With-profits annuities which add on a bonus, provided investment performance can sustain one, each year; and Unit-linked annuities which have the disadvantage that they can go down, but should in the long run provide a haven against inflation. A final option to consider is an underwritten annuity. These make most sense if you have strong reason to believe that you do not have long to live. For example, if you already have a history of heart trouble it could be possible, with medical evidence, to persuade a life office to give you a bigger annuity. Figures from Sun Life show how much difference underwriting can make. A 65-year-old man could normally buy an annuity of Pounds 11,953 with a fund of Pounds 100,000. If he had twice suffered coronary thrombosis, most recently two years ago, Sun Life would be prepared to pay an annuity of Pounds 14,427.72. If the man were still exhibiting moderately raised blood pressure, the annuity would be Pounds 15,123.24. Once your decision is made, you are stuck with it, so give your pension annuity a lot of thought. When you need to increase your income in retirement. If you need extra funds to pay for medical care in your home, or in a residential home, an annuity may be the best way to do it. As people who do this are normally much older than when they retired, the annuity rates available are more generous. The tax regime is also more generous. When buying an 'immediate' annuity, as such annuities are called, you pay tax only on the income element of the payments - the portion of the annuity which is counted as repayment of capital is tax-free. According to Baronworth, best rates last month, for a Pounds 100,000 lump sum, were: for 75-year-olds, Pounds 17,825 for men and Pounds 15,287 for women, from Co-operative; and for 80-year-olds, Pounds 21,488 for men and Pounds 20,078 for women, from Standard Life. You can also buy an annuity that is 'capital-protected'. Thus, if you are nervous about your heirs, you can opt for a contract which guarantees to repay the capital to your estate if you die within a certain period. The insurance company will keep any investment profits. As people live longer and medical care improves, it is becoming more common to buy annuities late in retirement. A popular route involves mortgaging a part or all of your house, and buying an annuity with the proceeds. For people much over the age of 75, the annuity payment should outstrip the mortgage repayment costs, but take professional advice before doing this. When you are putting together a complex financial package. For this purpose you will usually need a temporary annuity. These differ from other annuities in that they pay out over a fixed term, and then stop. This makes them very useful as income providers when placed 'back-to-back' with another investment which provides growth. Typical plans might involve buying a temporary annuity for 10 years, and putting another lump sum into a with-profits bond, or a personal equity plan. The annuity would provide a substantial income, while the growth investment would grow enough to replace the money spent on the annuity after 10 years. The end result, if the plan works, is that you have enjoyed high income for 10 years with no loss of capital. Temporary annuities are also popular as an aid to school-fees planning. Parents save up a lump sum until their child starts at senior school, for example, and then buy a temporary annuity for six years. This pays the fees at the beginning of each educational year. Baronworth's best buys last month on temporary nine-year annuities, for a Pounds 100,000 lump sum, were: for 40-year-olds, Pounds 16,710 for men and Pounds 16,730 for women, from Sun Alliance; and for 80-year-olds (possibly of use for long-term care), Pounds 23,300 for men, from Standard Life, and Pounds 20,170 for women, from Sun Alliance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jerzy Krajewski: "A Holding Company Beyond the </F> Law; Agency Will Take Over 50 Trillion Zlotys Worth of State  Wealth"]    [Text] The minister of foreign economic cooperation,  who is a member of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], is trying to  put together the biggest holding company in Poland. The company  will take over the state's shares in Cenzin, Ciech, and  Baltona. The ownership transformations minister, who comes from  the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], thinks it is a scandal and  amounts to using loopholes in the legal system.    The holding company in question is the state-owned Agency  for  Economic Development [Agencja Rozwoju Gospodarczego], which was  set up by Minister Leslaw Podkanski on 2 February 1994. Over  the next few years, the agency is to assume control over several  dozen State Treasury partnerships that deal primarily with  foreign trade and that are currently supervised by the foreign  economic cooperation minister.  <H5>  From Cenzin to Baltona </H5>   The assets of these partnerships are evaluated at over 50  trillion zlotys [Z], which would make the agency the largest  capital/financial holding company in Poland.    Currently, its share capital is Z4.570 trillion and includes  state-owned shares in three companies registered on the Warsaw  Stock Exchange: 270,000 shares of the Bank Rozwoju Eksportu  [BRE], 1.080 million shares of Electrim, and 2.628 million  shares of Universal.    Over the few next years, the agency is to take over the  state's shares in such big companies as Cenzin (62.7 percent),  Ciech (51 percent), Baltona (51 percent), Animex (34 percent),  Budimex (53 percent), Polimex Cekop (51 percent), Paged (30  percent), Pol-Mot (24 percent), and Metronex, Poznan  International Fairs (60 percent). So the agency will hold  significant influence over the composition of the companies'  governing boards.  <H5>  NIK's Control </H5>   According to Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw  Kaczmarek, the establishment of the agency is a scandal: "Such  institutions must be based on the legal system rather than  taking advantage of loopholes in it," Kaczmarek told ZYCIE  WARSZAWY. "As far as I know, the Supreme Chamber of Control  [NIK] is examining the issue," he added.    "NIK has been examining the agency since May, within a  program of controlling foreign trade centers," confirmed NIK  Press Spokesman Wojciech Daniel. "Results will not be published  until mid-July at the earliest."  <H5>  Ambitious Plans </H5>   According to the agency's statute, its goal, among others,  is  to provide financing for investment projects (construction of  highways, border crossings, or inland waterways), promoting  Polish exports, and providing guarantees or financial  reinsurance for large economic ventures.    "Company `X' wants to bid on a modernization project for  Beirut airport, which is estimated to cost $300 million. But  first it has to put up collateral worth one-sixth of the  contract. Our financial potential makes it possible for us to  help the company in a such a situation," explains Wieslaw Kuc,  chief of the agency and a former member of the BRE governing  board.    What will happen if the agency finds itself in a situation  of  having to pay in place of a dishonest contractor? Shares and  participation in State Treasury partnerships are one of the  agency's assets. The agency does not want to sell them off, but  it does not rule out doing that in case it gets into trouble by,  for instance, having to repay a large credit that it had  guaranteed earlier. Still, Chairman Kuc sounds confident that  there will be no slipups because, in granting guarantees, he  will be using the same kinds of procedures as those applied by  banks.</p>

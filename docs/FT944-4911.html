			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Setback at Barito Pacific Barito Pacific, the world's largest tropical hardwood plywood producer, said its net profit in the nine months to September 30 fell 35 per cent from a year earlier following a slump in world plywood prices. The Indonesian company's earnings were also hit by a delay in the renewal of its timber concession licences. Net income fell to Rp142.3bn (Dollars 45m) from Rp220.1bn. Sales dropped to Rp696.6bn from Rp778 bn. Income from operations dipped to Rp95.2bn from Rp276.4bn mainly because of a two-month delay in the renewal of licences for its concessions, forcing the timber giant to buy timber from other logging companies. Higher log transportation costs were also to blame for increased operating expenses, which climbed to Rp98bn from Rp72.7bn. In June this year, Indonesia's ministry of forestry took over 49 per cent of the shares in two concessions supplying Barito Pacific as punishment for what it said was irresponsible forest management. The move was followed by pledges from the forestry minister, Mr Djamaldun Suryohadikusomo, to crack down on logging offenders.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 11 Mar (EFE) -- Despite the hard blows it has  sustained since the arrest of its founder Abimael Guzman in  1992, the Maoist Shining Path [SL] movement is still trying to  reorganize and, above all, regain the strength it has lost in  Lima.    This was established after Counterterrorism Directorate  (DINCOTE) agents arrested 13 SL terrorists, among them two  women, during a dragnet operation between 24 February and 7  March. Information on this operation was disclosed a few hours  ago.    According to the police, the arrested individuals belong to  a  recently created SL organization called "New Network" [Nueva  Red] which apparently has replaced the "People's Aid" which, up  to now, had been in charge of selective murders and of providing  logistic support for SL attacks.    The police have also said that the "New Network" has started  to proselytize in Lima shantytowns in an attempt to gain new  supporters and "establish a new social platform" in order to  form "combat committees."    The "New Network" has three secretariats: militants who  belonged to the "People's Aid"; a committee of relatives of  arrested individuals; and a department for workers and  neighborhoods.    The police have also spotted houses belonging to the  terrorists in various Lima neighborhoods.    Lima has always been very important to the SL because the  attacks perpetrated in the capital have a greater impact abroad,  such as the destruction of buildings and dozens of deaths on  Tarta Street in Miraflores, a residential neighborhood in Lima,  a few months before Abimael Guzman was arrested in Lima on 12  September 1992.    Guzman was arrested with all his closest aids, the same as  the leadership of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)  which has sustained even harder blows than the SL. Ninety  percent of the MRTA leaders, the same as the SL leaders, are  under arrest and have been sentenced to life imprisonment.    Since then the decay of the SL, which, according to Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori will have disappeared by 1995 when he  leaves government if he is not reelected, has been notorious.    The Peruvian Communist Party, which is the SL's true name,  has split up. One of the branches is headed by Abimael Guzman  who, in letters addressed to President Fujimori in 1993, urged  his followers to maintain peace and order and not to perpetrate  attacks.    The SL leaders under arrest, after a meeting arranged by the  government in Lima, decided to support the appeal for peace made  by Guzman but those who are still free have not followed suit.    Although the two groups maintain that they respect the  ideology of "President Gonzalo" as Guzman is called in the  cryptic SL language, the truth is that the movement has split up.    Moreover, there is no information on Guzman's relationship  with the government, about which a lot was said until a few days  before the 31 October 1993 referendum to approve the new  Peruvian Constitution.    Oscar Duran, aka Feliciano, seems to be the new SL leader.  He and Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, the only important MRTA leader  still free, are being sought.    The daily ONDA today reported that DINCOTE has dismantled  Cerpa Cartolini's plan to reactivate the MRTA, in an attempt  apparently similar to that of the SL.</p>

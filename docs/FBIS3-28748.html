The  consultative meeting of a number of NAM foreign ministers under  way at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Jakarta will end  tomorrow.    Opening the meeting this morning, Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas  said efforts to end Serbian brutalities and to enhance  cooperation between the NAM and the Group of 77 are among the  pressing issues that need to be tackled. Indonesia reiterated  the need for an immediate lifting of the arms embargo on  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the convening of an international  conference on Bosnia. The lifting of the arms embargo will  motivate the Serbs to honor various UN resolutions and end their  indiscriminate acts against the Bosnians.    The NAM members also need to continue paying attention to  the  debts of developing nations. He reminded the NAM and the Group  of 77 to continue coordinating and consolidating their economic  activities.    The consultative meeting attended by 21 NAM members,  including Indonesia is expected to overcome the problems in  preparation for a NAM ministerial meeting to be held in Cairo,  Egypt in early June.</p>

Plenty, if you happen to be Roman Zubinsky Phifer, UCLA's  outside linebacker.  </P> <P> Phifer said he believed for several years that his middle name was given to him  because his father had a wartime buddy in Germany named Zubinsky.  </P> <P> "I didn't learn until last year from my mother that they got the name Zubinsky  out of a phone book," Phifer said.  </P> <P> As for his first name, he acknowledged that he's the namesake of Roman Gabriel,  the former Ram and Philadelphia Eagle quarterback who grew up in North  Carolina, as did Phifer.  </P> <P> Phifer, who was suspended from school last fall for an off-campus altercation,  had a career-high 13 tackles, including three behind the line of scrimmage, in  the 34-14 loss to Oklahoma Saturday.

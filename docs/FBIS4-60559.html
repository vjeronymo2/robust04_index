			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of an appeal by Defense Minister 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur </F> Hadi to the "misled" forces; date not given]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Peace and blessing be upon His noble Prophet. To the misled and  helpless brother officers, noncommissioned officers, and  soldiers: O heroes of the Armed Forces--officers, NCO's, and  soldiers: You have always been a symbol of national unity and a  splendid example of national cohesion. You had the honor of  taking the initiative to reunite the homeland. Therefore, you  categorically rejected the instructions of the gangs of apostasy  and secession and sided with the constitutional legitimacy, that  is, with the people and the unity of the homeland. Therefore, a  decree under Law No. 1 for 1994 was issued announcing a general  amnesty in appreciation of these stands.    Consequently, the Defense Ministry has fixed the reception  areas as follows:    1. The Aden axis. The brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers  in the Aden Governorate should report to the units near their  places in order to be sent to the military areas where they can  perform their service.    2. The Lahij axis. The brother officers, NCO's, and  soldiers should report to the units near their places in order  to be sent to the military areas where they can perform their  service.    3. All shall enjoy all rights and duties enjoyed by others  in the Yemeni Armed Forces in accordance with the  above-mentioned decree.    4. We appeal to all to respond and benefit from the sympathy  and tolerance expressed by the decree toward the misled and  helpless ones by joining the forces of legitimacy in order to  form one unified army that fights bravely and faithfully for the  sake of the people and homeland.    It is God who grants us guidance and success.    [Signed] Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi,  minister of defense</p>

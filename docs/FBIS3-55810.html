The Latvian side informed Laar that the situation was  getting  back to normal.    Both sides compared the events with the situation in Latvia  in 1940 which led to those countries' occupation by the Soviet  Union, and emphasized the importance of preserving peace and  stability, and of efforts to ensure their countries' security.    An agreement was reached on maintaining permanent contacts  between the Latvian and Estonian governments until the crisis is  resolved.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Quintero de Leon] </F>   [Text] After six years of negotiations that began with the  military government of Panama, the Republic of Panama yesterday  formally established diplomatic relations with the Russian  Federation in a ceremony attended by Panamanian Foreign Minister  Jose Raul Mulino and his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, in  Moscow.    The Panamanian Foreign Ministry disclosed that the two  ministers signed an agreement called the "Declaration of  Principles of Relations and Cooperation Between the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Panama." The essence of the  agreement is the expansion of the respective countries' consular  missions to the level of embassies.    Consular relations began in 1991 when President Guillermo  Endara and President Boris Yeltsin decided to establish  consulates to handle trade relations and cooperation between the  two countries.    A Foreign Ministry bulletin reports Foreign Minister Kozyrev  said that the Russian Federation considers Panama a future  economic and financial power, and that he wants to strengthen  trade relations.    In addition, Minister Mulino offered Panama's cooperation on  banking issues, the Free Trade Zone, the reinsurance system, and  on "maintaining constant consultation on Latin American  geopolitical issues."</p>

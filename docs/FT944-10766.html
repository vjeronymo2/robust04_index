			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Arms seized in French crackdown on Islamic 'militants' French police yesterday launched a crackdown on suspected Islamic militants, seizing a cache of firearms and detaining more than 90 people, including alleged supporters of an Algerian guerrilla organisation. Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, said the operation revealed a support network for Algerian guerrillas which has links in four other western European countries and in Canada. 'It provides evidence of a network of extremists determined to pursue clandestine or terrorist actions from our territory or other nations,' he said. Mr Pasqua said surveillance carried out since mid-October had confirmed the existence of a support network for the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) with branches in Germany, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Canada. The interior minister declined to comment on whether he expected arrests in those countries, but has previously demanded that France's allies take stronger action against suspected Moslem terrorist groups. Yesterday's operation reflects the tough line taken by the French government, anxious to avoid the spread of the conflict between the military-backed regime in Algeria and its Islamic opponents. The GIA is the most radical of the Moslem fundamentalist groups attempting to overthrow the Algerian government. The conflict in Algeria has escalated in recent months, fuelling fears in France of a possible wave of immigrants from its former colony. Yesterday's action - mainly in the Paris region - was the second large-scale operation against suspected Islamic fundamentalists in France since the summer. In August, 20 suspected Moslem extremists were expelled. The French government has maintained the pressure on suspected Islamic extremists. Last Sunday, France deported an Algerian Moslem cleric accused of spreading fundamentalist propaganda. Mr Pasqua claimed yesterday's operation demonstrated the threat posed to internal security by militant Islamic groups. Officials emphasised the scale of the arms seizures, which included assault rifles, handguns and detonators, found in a building in the southern suburbs of Paris.</p>

The Shandong Provincial CPC Committee,  the provincial people's congress standing committee, the  provincial government, the provincial committee of the Chinese  Peoples' Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], the  provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, and the provincial  military district held a gathering here to observe the Spring  Festival.    The gathering began at 0900. Jiang Chunyun, member of the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of  the provincial party committee; Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of  the provincial party committee and governor; Li Zhen, chairman  of the provincial people's congress standing committee; Lu  Maozeng, chairman of the provincial CPPCC Committee; Tan Fude,  secretary of the provincial Discipline Inspection Commission; Yi  Yuanqiu, commander of the provincial military district; and Liu  Guofu, political commissar, were seated on the front row of the  rostrum to extend Spring Festive greetings to all comrades  attending the gathering and to all people across the province on  behalf of the provincial party committee, the provincial  people's congress standing committee, the provincial government,  the provincial CPPCC Committee, the provincial Discipline  Inspection Commission, and the provincial military district.    Jiang Chunyun gave a speech at the gathering. He said: The  past year was very unusual. It was a year during which we  advanced courageously on the road to socialist modernization.  Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, people  across the province conscientiously implemented the guidelines  of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, deepened reform, expanded the degree  of opening up, and actively promoted the building of two  civilizations, thus giving rise to an excellent situation of  political and social stability, economic development, and  invigoration in all fields of work throughout the province.  This is the result of the united efforts and hard work of the  broad masses of party members and cadres across the province to  overcome serious natural disasters and all sorts of difficulties  and to advance and make progress in a pioneering spirit. Let me  extend festive greetings and cordial regards to the broad masses  of party members and cadres working on all fronts on behalf of  the provincial party committee and the provincial government.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: This is a crucial year for  comprehensively promoting reform and building the socialist  market operational mechanism. The tasks will be glorious but  arduous. During this year we should rally more closely around  the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  nucleus, persist in taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line as the guidance, act in line with the work principles  defined by the party Central Committee and the State Council,  deeply implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and  the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic  structure, and maintain a sustained, speedy and sound national  economic development. It is necessary to realistically  strengthen the building of the party, clean politics, spiritual  civilization, democracy, and the legal system, maintain  political stability, and promote a comprehensive social  progress. In the course of building the two civilizations, all  levels and all trades and professions across the province should  be subordinated to and serve the overall situation of seizing  the opportunity to comprehensively deepen reform, expanding  opening up, and promoting the development of the socialist  market economic structure, further emancipate the mind, seek  truth from facts, engage in arduous struggle, exert vigorous  efforts to make the country strong, and strive to win a new  victory in socialist modernization with new ideas, a new  attitude, a new work style, and new achievements.    Attending the gathering were members and alternate members  of  the provincial party committee in Jinan, vice chairmen of the  provincial people's congress standing committee, vice governors,  special advisers to the provincial government, vice chairmen of  the provincial CPPCC Committee, standing committee members of  the Discipline Inspection Commission of the provincial party  committee, principal responsible persons of the provincial  military district, the provincial People's Court, the provincial  People's Procuratorate, and various provincial-level democratic  parties, provincial-level veteran comrades serving as deputy  heads, various provincial-level committees, offices,  departments, and bureaus, and colleges and universities in  Jinan, and responsible comrades of Jinan city.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF THE JAPANESE CAN OVERCOME WW II ENMITY, SURELY AMERICAN FIRMS CAN SUCCEED IN  ASIA  </P> <P> James Flanigan's article "Asia Beckons as a Land of Vast Opportunity" (Sept.  12, 1990) was a well-done piece on the Asia Pacific market. I recently spent  three weeks visiting Singapore and Indonesia.  </P> <P> In both countries I was impressed by the American presence in music, clothes  and food. Every hotel we visited had an "American buffet breakfast." I was  disappointed, however, to see how completely the automobile market was  dominated by the Japanese.  </P> <P> In many hotels the elevators were Hitachi, as was the moveable sidewalk in the  Singapore airport. It occurred to me that the Japanese must have overcome  enormous buyer resistance in those two countries, where people have memories of  the World War II Japanese occupation. I think the American auto makers really  missed the boat by failing to develop these markets.  </P> <P> It may be too late for car makers, but other industries should be prepared to  develop markets, particularly in Indonesia, whose next census should report a  population in excess of 180 million. While in that country I visited high  schools in Java and Sumatra and met administrators, teachers and hundreds of  students.  </P> <P> Indonesian students, from grades seven through 12, study English and are  fascinated with California. I got the sense that they almost see it as a land  unto itself. I'm convinced that an aggressive marketing campaign by  California-based companies could produce substantial dividends in a very short  period.  </P> <P> WILLIAM WEBSTER  </P> <P> Educational administration professor  </P> <P> California State University  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

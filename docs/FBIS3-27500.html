In his indictment, the prosecutor recommended a 12-year  sentence for Luo Changhua, 38, and eight years for his wife Wang  Yuying, 34, for violations of the Civil Aviation Law.    The couple, along with their 11-year-old child Luo Wanghuan,  hijacked a Fujian Airlines airliner to Taiwan on its way from  Ganzhou to Chengdu on Dec. 28, 1993. The child was placed in  the care of Luo's relatives in Taiwan.    The prosecutor said he recommended shorter sentences because  they had surrendered themselves upon landing at the Chiang  Kai-shek International Airport.    Ten civil air flights from Mainland China were hijacked to  Taiwan in 1993.</p>

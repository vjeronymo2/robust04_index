			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Ballet Peter Wright has for some years hoped to present a staging of MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet for his section of the Royal Ballet. The move to Birmingham, which brought increased forces and stage potential, made this hope a fact, and on Monday night Birmingham Royal Ballet showed us their own Romeo. And perhaps because BRB is, in essence, an ensemble young in spirit as in personnel, Sir Kenneth MacMillan has chosen a young talent to decorate the production. Last year he saw the graduate show of the Wimbledon College of Art stage design course, and was impressed by the work of Paul Andrews. So, at the age of 22, Mr Andrews found himself entrusted with a three act ballet as his first professional commission. The decision was bold, but it has produced decoration which has an enthusiasm, a freshness of eye, that accord very well with this tragedy of youthful passion performed by a youthful company. Mr Andrews has inevitably had to accommodate the shape of his set to existing choreographic outlines. His basic structure, of a curved and tiered colonnade broken by a central stair, is handsome, and the stage space is varied - for Juliet's bedroom; for the Capulet tomb - to provide a more intimate, rectangular dance area. The decoration pays its historical dues to quattrocento and cinquecento painting and architecture in shapes and colour. It is an incidental pleasure that at moments one may recognise Mantegna or Uccello, and Mr Andrews' own sense of delight in renaissance Italy is communicated to performers and audience without undue fuss. Design is not flawless - I find Escalus' glittering gold armour altogether too bright, and the bushy page-boy wigs for Romeo and his chums help extinguish their characters - but it is a brave and stimulating view of the drama, and it is superlatively lit by Hans-Ake Sjoquist, who enhances every moment of the action. Monday night's premiere was intended to feature the Moscow guests Nina Ananiashvili and Alexey Fadeyechev, both experienced MacMillan interpreters after their success in Prince of the Pagodas. Unhappily, Fadeyechev has sustained a knee injury, and Kevin O'Hare who replaced him, though conscientious in everything, could not provide all the emotional and physical rapport demanded by Ananiashvili's gifts. She is one of nature's Juliets. The role is often played in terms of innocence awakening to a first passion. With Ananiashvili there is the added fascination of seeing a ballerina 'as' Juliet. The power and the savour of the interpretation lie in the reconciliation of a child's grace with the authority of the superlative classical artist. (Plisetskaya's ardent Juliet was just such a reading). In the first act, Ananiashvili played sweetly to O'Hare's innocent Romeo, the balcony scene exquisitely done. It was in the third act - which is Juliet's alone - that she revealed her command of the role. As Romeo leaves her bedroom, she stands as if stunned, lost in dreams; sitting for an eternity on the bed, we see her draw courage from her feelings as her body becomes erect; the run to Friar Laurence has an irresistible momentum (and was superlatively lit by Mr Sjoquist); facing to her parents' anger, she bows in acquiescence, then eddies away from them (and from her plight) in an exquisite pas de bourree that speaks of her innermost feelings. It is Ananiashvili's sensitivity to MacMillan's physical truths, and the refined utterance she gives them, that make this so beautiful and honest a reading, and one so grandly that of a ballerina. Like O'Hare's Romeo, company performances are as yet mostly promising sketches. Ensembles are full of vitality, albeit certain scenes seem diffuse. The pacing and weighting of effects will come with experience, but the production already represents a major achievement by the Birmingham troupe. I salute Anita Landa's Nurse, a lovingly judged portrait, and the clean dancing by the ensemble. From Barry Wordsworth and the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, an account of Prokofev's score that was vivid in colour, purposeful in drama. Romeo and Juliet continues at the Hippodrome, Birmingham, until June 6; thereafter it can be seen at the Apollo, Oxford, June 29, 30 and July 1; and then in Southampton and Bristol.</p>

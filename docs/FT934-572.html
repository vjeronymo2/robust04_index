			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Ciampi seeks modest budget surplus: Italian government to approve measures raising extra revenue of L6,700bn The Italian government has pledged to approve before the end of the year additional fiscal measures to raise L6,700bn (Pounds 2.67bn) to add to the 1994 budget. The extra receipts are considered necessary to ensure a modest primary surplus (the balance between revenues and expenditure excluding interest payments) of L31,000bn in 1994. However, the continuing increases in the cost of social security and pension payments, coupled with lower revenues, both as a result of recession, could well force a mini-budget in mid-1994. The 1994 austerity budget itself finally cleared all its parliamentary hurdles on Wednesday, having been first presented in September. Its progress was aided in the past three weeks by the agreement of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) to give direct support to the various budget bills instead of abstaining. Another important piece of financial legislation also cleared parliament this week. A new law will permit the sale of the state's huge housing stock, held variously by local authorities, the railways (FS), the Ministry of Posts and the Treasury. Special discounts will be offered to encourage owner-occupiers, while 80 per cent of the receipts will go towards building new houses and 20 per cent to the Treasury. With these pieces of financial legislation, the government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has virtually completed the terms of its mandate undertaken in May. An announcement on the dissolution of parliament is expected at the end of the year. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday met Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the head of the senate, and Mr Giorgio Napolitano, the leader of the chamber of deputies, to co-ordinate the dissolution. The extra 1994 revenues are expected to be raised via a further VAT rise, plus increased taxes on alcohol and cigarettes as well as in selected stamp duties. A further rise in already high petrol taxes was considered but appears to have been ruled out, in part to avoid inflationary effects. The new budget deliberately seeks to attack the deficit by seeking cuts in spending rather than through an increase in the overall tax burden. Thus, of the extra L32,000bn needed in 1994, L23,000bn will come from spending cuts. The deficit is due to be cut from more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product to 8.7 per cent of GDP. Mr Sergio Cusani, a leading financial consultant whose trial for alleged corruption in Milan is causing a political sensation, was yesterday ordered to be released from prison. Mr Cusani had been in prison for more than five months, refusing to talk to investigating magistrates except in a public court. His trial began three weeks ago, but he has refused to appear in court until now.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Rush for Balladur's winter bargains / Examining the initial success of France's privatisation programme So far, so good. The smooth sale of the French government's stake in the chemicals group Rhone Poulenc means that the first brace of companies on its 21-strong privatisation list has been successfully dispatched from the public sector. As with Banque Nationale de Paris, which launched the government's FFr250bn (Pounds 28.47bn) privatisation programme last month, Rhone Poulenc was much in demand. The public share issue was three times over-subscribed, prompting the government to exercise a claw-back option from institutional investors, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, announced yesterday. 'We are off to a strong start,' says an official at the economy ministry. He adds that the FFr13bn to be raised from the sale of Rhone Poulenc and FFr28bn from Banque Nationale de Paris will enable the government to reach its target of FFr40bn from privatisations this year. Over the next few weeks, the private sale of Banque Hervet, the small retail bank, should be completed, adding about one billion francs to privatisation proceeds. But this year's receipts pale alongside the whole programme, the largest sell-off in a wave of privatisations in Europe. The big question facing the government and investors is whether the successes of Rhone Poulenc and BNP can be repeated as bigger, more complex or less attractive issues are led to the auction block. Most observers are confident, at least for the next few issues. 'I don't see the process becoming more difficult,' says Mr Didier Cherpitel, managing director in Paris of J P Morgan, the US investment bank. 'The companies to come are well known and in appealing sectors.' The government has also shown its willingness to sell its assets at attractive prices - shares in both BNP and Rhone Poulenc were offered at a discount of about 13 per cent to their market price. Next on the auction block will be Elf-Aquitaine, the oil company and France's largest industrial group. It is the final name on the list of four companies selected to launch the privatisation programme and will be sold early next year. The next phase in the sell-off has yet to be announced. But Union des Assurances de Paris, the country's largest insurer, is expected to be near the top that list. Preparations for the sale of Elf and UAP are under way. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has installed his own men to head the two groups - Mr Philippe Jaffre at Elf and Mr Jacques Friedmann at UAP. Like BNP and Rhone Poulenc, Elf is suffering from falling profits - a result of depressed European markets and the weak oil price. Mr Jaffre predicts 'mediocre' results of just over FFr1bn this year, against FFr6.2bn in 1992. But industry observers expect an adequate demand for shares in Elf, as profits are set to recover over the next two years. At UAP, recovery is under way. After a sharp fall in profits last year, the insurance group announced a 15 per cent rise in net profits to FFr1.09bn in the first half. More importantly, Mr Friedmann's predecessor, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, resolved a long-standing dispute with Suez, the financial and industrial holding company. The agreement gives UAP control of Colonia, the German insurance group, and enables Mr Friedmann to strengthen his company's European presence. The further down the list of privatisation candidates the government moves, however, the more complex the sell-off process becomes. In some cases this is because of restructuring plans, in others because the candidates are loss-making, indebted enterprises. The biggest restructuring is at Renault, which is attempting to merge with Volvo of Sweden. The government's decision to complete the merger before privatisation is logical. 'You can't ask investors to buy shares before a big change in the shape of the group,' says Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman. But the merger is proving problematic. Swedish shareholders, concerned about the terms of the agreement, could sink the deal at a vote on December 7. Renault, which has remained in profit throughout the downturn in the world car industry, could be sold with or without a successful merger with Volvo. Elsewhere, however, restructuring is likely to be a condition of privatisation. One example is Pechiney, the loss-making aluminium producer. To increase its attraction, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, is considering a classic case of what the French describe as 'industrial meccano'. This would involve an alliance between Pechiney and Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, a low-cost supplier of hydro-electricity. Such strategic restructuring illustrates a paradox likely to appear in several privatisation issues - the need for the state to intervene in some companies to prepare the ground for a loosening of state control. In the case of Pechiney it has prompted resistance from Electricite de France, the state-owned utility, which is understandably reluctant to lose one of its most profitable operations. But the interests of EDF's political masters are likely to overcome such protests. Stronger opposition to the privatisation plans comes from union protests against rationalisation. Without job cuts, loss-making companies on the privatisation list - such as Bull, the computer manufacturer, Air France and Aerospatiale, the aerospace group - will find it difficult to return to profit. With unemployment at 11.8 per cent and rising, the government is unwilling to risk social unrest by fuelling the ranks of the jobless. Last month's strike at Air France, which prompted the government to shelve an austerity plan at the airline, sent a powerful signal that public sector industry should avoid involuntary redundancies. As the more attractive members of public sector industry line up for sale, such a constraint is limited. But the postponement of rationalisation measures at Air France and other loss-makers may make it difficult to privatise them within the government's five-year timetable. If the supply of companies to be privatised may become more problematic after next year, what are the prospects for demand? The potential remains strong. 'There is a lot of domestic liquidity,' says Mr Cherpitel of J P Morgan, referring to the FFr1,200bn of savings held in Sicav money market funds. These funds have been rendered less attractive as interest rates have fallen. Interest rates on three-month loans are now less than 7 per cent against more than 9 per cent late last year. In addition, there are savings committed to the government's Balladur bond, which raised FFr110bn when it was issued last summer and which can be converted into privatisation shares. International prospects are also encouraging. 'The French programme should be quite successful in attracting US investors,' says Mr David Boyle, managing director of Citibank in New York. He argues that France represents only 3 per cent of the European equities held by US investors and is, thus, underweight in most US portfolios. Both the BNP and Rhone Poulenc issues were oversubscribed by international institutional investors. Whether potential demand is transformed into purchases will, however, depend on French economic prospects and the stock market's performance. 'The major risk is that a longer, deeper than expected economic recession could renew equity market weakness in late 1993 and 1994,' says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Bros in London. The government has struck an upbeat tone in this respect. 'The economy seems to be on the right footing,' said Mr Balladur last Sunday, promising further stimulatory measures if necessary. But private sector economists are more cautious. They describe official forecasts of a 1.4 per cent increase in Gross National Product next year as optimistic, arguing recovery requires a fall in interest rates and a revival in consumer confidence. Without lower borrowing costs the prospects for economic recovery will remain fragile. So too will the performance of the stock market. In that case, France's grand public sector sell-off would find the going much harder.</p>

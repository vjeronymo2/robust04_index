			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SYLMAR'S TRIBUTE TO VELA COMES IN FORM OF 16-2 WIN OVER RESEDA  </P> <P> There was laughter in the Sylmar High dugout again, friendly jibes exchanged  among players and coaches. A player handed Coach Gary Donatella a batting  helmet when Donatella was nearly leveled by a screaming foul ball. Donatella  verbally jousted with the plate umpire and fined a couple of players for  penny-ante rules violations.  </P> <P> Winning, it seems, is therapeutic. And a lopsided victory, such as the 16-2  defeat of host Reseda in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game Monday, is the ultimate  panacea.  </P> <P> "It was nice to get back on the winning track again," Donatella said. "Shoot,  it was nice to get back out here and play again."  </P> <P> Ten days ago, the Sylmar program was devastated by the death of senior  outfielder Ryan Vela, who was killed in an auto crash that involved two other  varsity players. Sylmar postponed two games with Monroe last week, school  psychologists met with players and virtually everyone connected with the  program was visibly affected by the news, Donatella said.  </P> <P> "It was a very rough week," Donatella said.  </P> <P> A memorial service Thursday lasted 2 1/2 hours, and so many people turned out  to pay their respects that the line stretched out the church doors, Donatella  said.  </P> <P> Members of the San Fernando High varsity -- Vela had transferred to Sylmar from  San Fernando -- showed up for the service.  </P> <P> Sylmar players showed up for the Reseda game with Vela's uniform number, 17,  stenciled and stitched in every place imaginable. Each player had the number on  the back of their caps and on the left breast of their uniform top. Some had it  painted on the backs of their spikes, others had it on their wristbands.  </P> <P> The team wants to remember, yet somehow forget, what happened to their  teammate.  </P> <P> "They want to remember him for the way he was, the way he liked to play,"  Donatella said. "It is a weird feeling with the numbers everywhere. But we want  to remember him, and in a positive manner."  </P> <P> The best way to move forward is to rack up a rout. London Woodfin started in  right field, where Vela had played, and was three for four with a double,  triple and four runs batted in.  </P> <P> "It's a weird feeling, being at his old position," Woodfin said. "I knew I had  to do the job."  </P> <P> The rest of the team felt similarly. Donatella said he didn't bother with a  rah-rah speech before the game. He sensed there was no need.  </P> <P> "With (Ryan) in mind, maybe that's why they played so well today," Donatella  said. "I can't use something like this to motivate kids. All I had to do was  listen to them and I knew they wanted this game."  </P> <P> Sylmar (7-4, 3-3 in league play) blew the game open with six runs in the sixth  to take a 13-2 lead. Nearly everyone took part in the victory: Sylmar's 14 hits  were scattered among 10 players.  </P> <P> Woodfin said the team felt there was debt to pay.  </P> <P> "If we had lost today, we'd be out here knowing in our hearts that we let  ourselves and Ryan down," Woodfin said. "We're doing this for us, but we're  doing it for him, too." STEVE ELLING  </P></p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow claws back recent losses in hesitant trading Wall Street US STOCK markets clawed back some of their recent losses yesterday, but investors remained hesitant to commit more funds to the market and the dominant influence on sentiment remained fourth quarter corporate results, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.04 at 3,232.78. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly firmer, up 0.52 at 415.48, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks gained 1.82 to 624.68. NYSE turnover was 214m shares and rises outpaced declines by 899 to 796. Oils featured among individual stocks, Exxon rising Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/4 on news of a fourth quarter profit of Dollars 1.12bn, which boosted full-year earnings to Dollars 5.6bn, the highest in the company's history. The figures were particularly impressive considering the decline in oil prices in 1991. Chevron also unveiled fourth quarter figures, the stock easing Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 66 1/4 on news of a modest final three-month profit of Dollars 39m, which included a Dollars 244m charge to cover workforce reduction and operational changes. Over the year, Chevron made a profit of Dollars 1.29bn. Dow Jones jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 30 3/8 , a new 52-week high, after analysts at two big broking houses, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, recommended the stock to clients, citing improved business trends and the relatively low valuation of the shares. The newspaper and newswire publisher reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings on Thursday. Kimberly-Clark rose Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 49 7/8 after the opening was delayed due to an order imbalance on the buy side. Buyers were attracted to the stock by the company's strong fourth quarter earnings and by a recommendation from Bear Stearns, the securities house. Orion Pictures, the troubled Hollywood film company, jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 3 7/8 on speculation that Turner Broadcasting might make a bid. Orion, which is operating under the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, has already received a bid from New Line Corp. Burlington Northern fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 despite a forecast from the company that its 1992 earnings should be substantially better than the 1991 pre-tax operating income of Dollars 469m. Delta Woodside fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 15 3/8 after Merrill Lynch lowered its profits forecast for the company and cut its long-term rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'above average'. On the over-the-counter market, Adaptec rose Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 27 5/8 after reporting fiscal third quarter net income of 35 cents a share, well up on a year ago. Cirrus Logic was also boosted by good quarterly earnings, the stock adding Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 19 1/8 . Canada TORONTO prices closed little changed in moderate trading. ccording to preliminary data, the composite index gained 6.22 points, or 0.17 per cent to close at 3630.75. Advances led declines 357 to 277 on volume of 27.996m shares valued at CDollars 329.8m. Ten of 14 stock groups gained ground, led by pipelines, up 1.1 per cent. Consumer products, energy and industrial products also closed higher. The transportation group had the day's biggest decline, off 1.0 per cent. Financial services also closed lower. The mining and gold groups finished steady. Petro-Canada lost  1/4 to 10 1/2 . The company said it would take a CDollars 369m charge against fourth-quarter earnings for costs related to a rationalization of its products division.</p>

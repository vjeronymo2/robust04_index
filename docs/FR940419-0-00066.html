			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 29. Contractor Authority To Decline EPA Work <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment stated that an EPA contractor should be allowed to decline specific work assignments because of a conflict with other work that the contractor may have accepted after the EPA contract was awarded. We disagree. The contractor does not have the discretion to reject a work assignment. The contractor must report all conflicts of interest to the EPA Contracting Officer who evaluates conflicts, makes a determination of whether a conflict is significant and determines if the conflict can be avoided, mitigated, or neutralized. Under the terms of an EPA contract, a contractor is required to accept and perform work issued under work assignments. Where there is an overriding public interest to perform the work when a conflict of interest exists, the Contracting Officer may decide that the work should be performed despite the inability to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict. For example, if an emergency situation exists and immediate action is needed to stabilize a site to prevent injury to nearby residents, the Contracting Officer may determine that performance on the work assignment is necessary regardless of the contractor's inability to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize a conflict at the site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 30. Contractor's Right To Stop Work <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters stated that a contractor should have the right to stop performance if it reasonably believes that there would not be a significant impact upon the Agency as a result of the work stoppage. We disagree. The contract requires performance, and work may be stopped only by the Contracting Officer. The Government's right to control costs incurred as a result of stopping work must be protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 31. Time Limit for Responding to Conflict of Interest Requests <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters stated there should be a time limit, such as three or ten days, established for Contracting Officers to respond to any conflict of interest notification or LOFC request. Commenters further suggested that contractors should be able to assume that approval, if required, has been given if a response has not been received from EPA within ten days. The commenters stated that contractors may not only be placed in a position which may cause them to lose business due to slow responses by EPA, but also may be subject to bid bond forfeitures or other penalties for failure to accept a contract if time limits are not included in the rule. Also, for Federal contracts, contractors may risk having their bids found non-responsive if the bid is conditioned upon EPA granting approval to enter into the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since each conflict of interest situation is unique and has varying degrees of complexity and because contractors often do not initially provide sufficient information for a Contracting Officer to make a timely decision, the establishment of an arbitrary time limit is not appropriate. We do not agree with the suggestion that failure to respond within ten days should automatically be interpreted as approval. Arbitrary time limits can result in procedural questions over submission and receipt dates and create delays. Although set response times are not included in the rule, EPA is committed to providing timely responses. We have clarified our LOFC clauses to indicate that contractors may seek an expedited response regarding their initial LOFC requests by submitting their requests to the Contracting Officer and the next level within the Contracting Officer's organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 32. Review Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments recommended that EPA institute an appeal process for contractors that want a review of an adverse conflict of interest decision made by a Contracting Officer. The decision on any conflict of interest determination is the responsibility of the EPA Contracting Officer. We have clarified the review process available for LOFC requests if a contractor disagrees with the decision of a Contracting Officer. The contractor may file a request with the Contracting Officer for reconsideration or the contractor may request that a Contracting Officer determination be reviewed at a higher administrative level. Filing a request for reconsideration however, does not preclude a contractor from seeking review at the next administrative level. The LOFC clause has been modified to include the review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

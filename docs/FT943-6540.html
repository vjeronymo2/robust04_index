			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Korean crash fault South Korean police have laid responsibility for the crash of a Korean Air Lines Airbus earlier this month on the Canadian pilot and South Korean co-pilot. A police official on Cheju Island said at the weekend that Barry Woods and Chung Chan-kyu had been charged with violating aviation laws and causing accidental injuries. All 160 people escaped before the plane exploded at Cheju. A Transport Ministry report said the voice recorder showed Woods and Chung arguing as they brought the plane down. A final report will be published next month.</p>

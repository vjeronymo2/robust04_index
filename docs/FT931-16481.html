			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities welcome political calm - But foreign investors are likely to be more circumspect in 1993 Brazil closed 1992 with a new president and a rise in share prices. But most traders are circumspect about predicting a return to the boom of late 1991 and early 1992, partly because foreigners are likely to be much more cautious this time around. Large single day upswings were sandwiched around the Christmas holiday: the Sao Paulo stock exchange's Bovespa index gained 13.3 per cent on December 23 and 13.0 per cent on December 27 in turnover of about Dollars 100m a day. That movement was partly a reaction to a government decision to allow real price increases for Telebras, the state-owned telecommunications holding company that accounts for one-third of the index and generates about half of the market's daily trading volume. The upsurge also anticipated the removal from office of the president, Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, who resigned on December 29, just as his impeachment trial on corruption charges was about to begin in the senate. Having expected Mr Collor's demise, the Bovespa declined 1.4 per cent on the day he stood down. The year-end rally greatly improved the monthly figures for the Bovespa, but was modest compared to the expectations held during the heady days before May when the political corruption scandal involving Mr Collor first came to light. In spite of a December jump of 19.2 per cent in dollar terms, the Bovespa closed the year showing a loss of 3.6 per cent, measured in the US currency. By contrast, during the first four months of 1992 the index had outdistanced the dollar by 65.7 per cent. Traders seem content, if not completely satisfied, with the early policy statements of President Itamar Franco and Mr Paulo Haddad, the plan-ning minister. Official dec-larations have indicated a willingness to pursue economic reform and fiscal adjustment, with greater concern for social policy, even if they have been short on details. Investors have been encouraged by the new administration's repeated promises to eschew disruptive heterodox economic 'shock' programmes akin to those periodically imposed by Mr Collor and his predecessor, Mr Jose Sarney. To some extent, the market has lapsed into a mildly optimistic 'wait-and-see' attitude. Last Wednesday, when Mr Franco presented his economic policy to the nation, the Bovespa index rose 2.1 per cent, while on Monday, the first trading session after Mr Haddad had given details of some of the proposals, it put on a further 5.4 per cent. Yesterday the Bovespa jumped 5,766 points, or 8 per cent, to end at 77,238 in heavy turnover of Cr1.54 trillion (Dollars 123m), well above the average of the last few weeks. 'I do not think we have seen any reaction yet to the macro policy statements,' says Mr George Rexing, director and head of foreign banking services for Banco de Boston, the local subsidiary of First National Bank of Boston. 'That reaction will come from foreigners.' It was foreign capital that was primarily responsible for the market's surge in late 1991 and early 1992 following the decision in mid-1991 to allow overseas institutions to operate directly in Brazilian bourses. During the first four months of 1992, foreigners funnelled nearly Dollars 1bn in net investment into equities. But this tailed off during the rest of the year, so that by the end of November, figures for all foreign capital market investment in Brazil showed a net inflow of just Dollars 1.9bn. Telebras, by far Bovespa's most heavily traded stock, closed 1992 at Dollars 17.73 for a 1,000-share lot, down from a high of Dollars 36.29 in April. It recovered steadily after the government announced that it would permit real increases in telecommunications fees, reversing initial indications from Mr Franco that public utility prices would be held down to fight inflation and make services more accessible to Brazil's poor majority. Telebras should continue to dominate trading in 1993, reflecting its liquidity and low price. Nevertheless, other publicly owned utilities began to attract interest after the administration's decision to allow real increases in tariffs.</p>

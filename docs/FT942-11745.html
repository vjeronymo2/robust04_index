			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: DnB moves back into the black in first quarter Den norske Bank, Norway's largest bank, moved back into the black with a net profit with NKr586m (Dollars 79.2m) for the 1994 first quarter, from a loss of NKr138m a year ago. The turnround was helped by reduced losses on loans and guarantees and came in spite of lower non-interest income. Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing director, said the improved performance continued a trend which began last year. Net interest income rose slightly to NKr1.27bn from NKr1.23bn, helped by 'comfortable' margins in the face of strong competition. However, gross interest income was reduced by NKr1.44bn to NKr2.97bn as interest expenses were cut by NKr1.48bn to NKr1.7bn. Non-interest income fell by NKr296m to NKr662m with currency and securities gains falling to NKr65m from NKr120m. DnB explained that unrealised gains on shares amounted to NKr392m at end March and that an increase in interest rates had led to a loss on bonds, partly offset by an increase in value of other financial instruments used to hedge interest rate risk. Group operating profit, before losses on loans and guarantees, fell to NKr780m from NKr1.06bn. Losses on loans and guarantees were cut to NKr180m from NKr1.17bn. DnB said there had been some strong recoveries, particularly where the improvement in the Norwegian economy had a positive impact on customers' ability to meet payments and on the value of the bank's collateral. The volume of non-performing loans was NKr8.9bn, a reduction of NKr1.3bn since the end of 1993. DnB said the volume of new non-performing loans registered in the period was moderate while several previous non-performers had been reinstated as performing assets. 'The quality of the bank's loan portfolio was enhanced during the first quarter,' said Mr Hvistendahl.</p>

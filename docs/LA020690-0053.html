			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> AKIYOSHI BAND LIVES UP TO 'SOUNDS OF GENIUS'  </P> <P> The presentation of the Toshiko Akiyoshi Orchestra at Ambassador Auditorium in  Pasadena was part of the "Sounds of Genius Series." Genius is a term tossed  around too often by hucksters, but if ever it was merited, this unique  composer-arranger-pianist-bandleader deserves it.  </P> <P> Ironically, the band she co-led in Los Angeles from 1973-82 with the tenor  saxophonist and flutist Lew Tabackin was never invited to the Ambassador.  Thursday's concert, their first ever in this acoustically splendid hall, was  given by the orchestra she and Tabackin formed in New York after moving back  East seven years ago.  </P> <P> Both orchestras were the creatures of Akiyoshi's intensely fertile mind. More  than any other writer in modern times except Gil Evans, she has been a  wellspring of melodic invention, of textural colors that far transcend the  simple brass-reeds-rhythm patterns of the traditional big band.  </P> <P> In "Blue Dream," one of two consecutive works that made the 5/4 meter seem as  natural as a heartbeat, she juxtaposed Tabackin's flute with low, contrasting  brass sonorities. Her own sublime piano solo on "Remembering Bud" (dedicated to  the late Bud Powell) led to a passage in which five flutes were backed by  trombones and muted trumpets. The changes of color, tempo, meter and dynamics  within the body of a given piece were handled with superb finesse by this  incomparable ensemble.  </P> <P> Tabackin as always is the principal soloist, surely the premier tenor  saxophonist and arguably the finest flutist on today's jazz scene. Among the  other soloists, Scott Robinson and Jim Snidero on baritone and alto saxes were  the best of an adventurous bunch.  </P> <P> From the opening "Strive for Jive" (built on a basic "I Got Rhythm" line)  through the complexities of "Feast in Milano" to the familiar shuffle blues  played as an encore, Akiyoshi paid as much attention to diversification as to  the act of creation. That she is able to keep this orchestra together only for  two or three months a year seems almost criminal at a time when mediocrity on a  mass scale rules the airwaves and the rock concert halls.

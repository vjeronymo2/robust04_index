			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Personal View: US should go softly, softly on China President Bill Clinton has made a tough choice in imposing trade sanctions against China for apparent violations of international arms controls. Sanctions may have been an effective weapon against China in the past, but the emerging global realignments make their efficacy more questionable and the risks higher. The US move - especially if followed by further sanctions directed against China's repressive internal regime - could drive the Chinese, and ultimately the members of the Commonwealth of Indepen-dent States, away from the west. Until the break-up of the Soviet Union, China was regarded by the west as an important counter-weight to Soviet power; it is now thought to have little strategic importance. But the west should recognise that China is almost guaranteed to become an economic superpower and that it could easily grow to dominate and influence the economies of the CIS countries. The CIS countries are currently determining whether to seek long-term strategies of economic integration with the west or whether to turn inward. While the US is pouring billions of dollars into those countries in the hope of persuading them to integrate with the west and adopt democratic institutions, it is virtually ignoring the profound implications of the emerging Sino-CIS rapprochement. The risk of the CIS turning away from the west is great despite its short-term dependence on aid. When President Boris Yeltsin visited China late last year he signed 24 agreements that he said gave the Chinese a head start over the west in developing links with Russia. With Dollars 6bn in bilateral trade, China is the only country that is expanding trade with Russia. Official border trade has exploded from less than Dollars 100m in 1987 to Dollars 2bn in 1992. The actual trade volume is substantially higher, as indicated by the more than 3,000 arrests along the frontier for smuggling offences last year. There is an undeniable degree of economic complementarity between China and the CIS, with China's consumer goods being traded for CIS raw materials and heavy industrial technology. What is more alarming is that many of the central Asian republics are adopting the 'Chinese model' in which autocratic rule coexists with economic liberalisation. It is the success of this autocratic regime in countries like China, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea that makes extracting internal political concessions so difficult, even though the cost could be losing most favoured nation status. Many Asian business leaders believe that economic growth has priority over political freedom and that without the strong hand of government such growth may be doomed. They point to Taiwan and South Korea as examples of where patience with the authoritarian ways of government has led not only to a stronger economy but ultimately to increasing political freedom. And they cite Russia as an example of where pushing political freedom too quickly can make it impossible to achieve economic growth. This is a point not lost with the governing elites in Moscow. Against this backdrop, any efforts by Mr Clinton's to force China to make internal reforms are likely to have at best a cosmetic impact on freedom. For example, the Chinese may agree that no prison labour is to be used on products exported to the US. But that does not stop them from diverting prison labour for domestic uses and/or exports to other nations. In the meantime, China does not stand still. Where possible it is diversifying its export base away from the west. Despite a rapid expansion of total trade, China is no more dependent on the US and European Community than it was in 1989. Apart from the CIS it has dramatically expanded trade with former foe Japan and opened ties with another former foe, South Korea. If, through protracted economic failure, the CIS develops along the same lines as China, and China continues to diversify its export base, then both could become gradually isolated from the west. At that point the US would no longer be so cavalier about its position towards China. In order to hedge against this risk, US foreign policy must now draw China's economy further towards the west. If it is successful, then even if the CIS does go the way of China, it is still be likely to become integrated with the west. That would help preserve peace and freedom.

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTLOOSE: IT'S A TALE OF TWO CITIES ON HAWAII'S KOHALA COAST  </P> <P> This town on the Big Island has a split personality in more ways than one.  First, it has two names. Also, when it's sunny at one end of the village, the  rains at the other end could scare Noah.  </P> <P> The names resulted after John Parker, a New England seafarer who walked off his  ship here in 1809, married King Kamehameha's granddaughter, had a son named  Samuel (Kamuela in Hawaiian) and made the town his namesake. Many early  settlers, however, preferred Waimea (red water). As a result, both names are  used.  </P> <P> The meteorological change is caused by Waimea-Kamuela's upcountry location --  between the relatively dry western Kohala Coast and the rain-forest wetness of  the Hamakua Coast to the east.  </P> <P> In any case, hotels and restaurants are sprouting like wildflowers, real estate  prices are erupting and everyone believes that the town and coast have very  rosy futures.  </P> <P> Even mainlanders will agree that the Kohala Coast and this very pretty little  town have plenty of room to grow before suffering development pains.  </P> <P> Getting here: United is the only airline that will get you to the Big Island  without changes. American, Pan Am, Delta, Northwest, Continental and TWA will  take you to Honolulu, with Aloha and Hawaiian Airlines flying onward.  </P> <P> How long/how much? Stay a week, at least. All sorts of accommodations in  moderate prices. Dining the same.  </P> <P> A few fast facts: A rental car is a must for seeing the Big Island. Most firms  have desks at the airport. Dollar Hawaii gives out a booklet with discounts at  70 dining spots.  </P> <P> Getting settled in: The Royal Waikoloan (Box 5000, Waikoloa; $90 to $175  double) has a large indoor-outdoor lobby, seven restaurants and lounges, big  bedrooms with private balconies or lanai. The beach is a step away and golf and  tennis are available. The rooms are $90.  </P> <P> Parker Ranch Lodge (Box 458, Kamuela; $58-$67 double) has 20 rooms, all  enormous. Painted barn red with white trim, the lodge looks like a well-kept  stable. It offers handsome-pine bedroom furnishings, fresh flowers and a  refrigerator. The lodge is at village center. Good restaurants are nearby. The  coast is about 20 minutes away.  </P> <P> Mauni Lani Point Condominiums (Kohala Coast) charges $150 to $180 for one  bedroom, $210 and up for two and three bedrooms. It has daily maid service,  equipped kitchen, washer-dryer, a pool, a Jacuzzi, a sauna, a color TV and a  general store nearby for provisions.  </P> <P> Units are on Mauni Lani Bay Hotel's golf course. The tennis club is a short  walk away. Condo guests get privileges for both and other hotel facilities.  </P> <P> For other particulars, call toll-free (800) 642-6284.  </P> <P> Regional food and drink: Hawaiian cuisine is slowly developing a measure of  character beyond poi and the luau. Although seafood has always been plentiful  and fresh daily, it still is a chore to get it without the sweet sauce that  hides its delicate flavors.  </P> <P> Some of the local fish not swimming in sauces are opakapaka, a pink or red  snapper with flaky meat; onaga, snapper with whiter meat; mahi-mahi, a  non-mammal dolphin that is the state's most popular fish; ono, a king mackerel  that's also called wahoo, and ahi, a yellowfin tuna that's popular broiled or  used in sushi and sashimi.  </P> <P> The Big Island's Parker Ranch beef (10 million pounds produced yearly) is used.  French and California wines are readily available but costly.  </P> <P> Dining: Bree Garden restaurant (Waimea-Kamuela) is new and elegant, the work of  German owner-chef Bernd Bree. There are framed wall displays of antique German  dining silver, old butter molds and 19th-Century fashion prints in the small  bar.  </P> <P> The menu offers pepper-broiled salmon steak, Wiener schnitzel, honeyed rack of  lamb, prawns in an Amaretto, brandy and cream sauce, plus plenty of other  seafood.  </P> <P> The Canoe House (Mauna Lani Bay Hotel) is the newest dining spot on the island.  Room and terrace are open to the beach and decorated with old Hawaiian paddles,  canoes and other nautical artifacts.  </P> <P> The menu is imaginative: bamboo-steamed mahi-mahi, wok-fried snapper, smoked  duck with jicama-mango relish and grilled shrimp, scallops and Japanese  eggplant with fresh taro chips.  </P> <P> Merriman's (Kamuela) is another new spot opened by a young man determined to  improve Hawaiian dining. Peter Merriman uses fresh seafood, Parker Ranch beef  and Kahua Ranch lamb to creat a menu that draws locals in droves.  </P> <P> Try his marlin ceviche with peppers and cilantro, wok-charred marlin or the  Thai-style shrimp curry.  </P> <P> Going first-class: The Mauna Kea Beach Hotel (Queen Kaahumanu Highway;  $220-$330 double) is still queen of the Big Island hotels and the standard by  which other luxury resorts in the Pacific are measured. Mauna Kea's Batik  dining room is considered the island's finest. The Pavilion, Garden and  Japanese Terrace restaurants offer a broad choice of dining adventures. A  children's program also is bringing Mauna Kea an ever-younger family business.  </P> <P> On your own: The Kohala Coast is strung out along the western shore of the Big  Island, from Keahole Airport north to the island's tip. Hawaii is a volcanic  island, with such greenery as you see on Kohala in patches around hotels,  public beaches (not too many) and the town of Waimea-Kamuela.  </P> <P> Waimea's Parker Ranch, the largest family-owned ranch in the United States,  offers tours.  </P> <P> Spend time in the art gallery of Richard Parker Smart, the ranch's present  owner. The gallery has a formidable collection of Impressionist paintings and  Venetian furnishings housed in an 1864 home. You'll find the tour office in  Waimea's Parker Ranch Shopping Center.  </P> <P> Ancient Hawaiians carved petroglyphs from the island's lava, and you'll find a  good number of them in the Puako Petroglyph Fields off Highway 19. These are  works of human and mythical figures and ancient signs and symbols.  </P> <P> Kohala is the birthplace of Kamehameha the Great, who conquered most of  Hawaii's islands by the end of the 18th Century.  </P> <P> For more information: Call the Hawaii Visitors Bureau at (213) 385-5301, or  write to 3440 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 502, Los Angeles 90010 for a brochure on  the Big Island, two more on accommodations and restaurants. Ask for the Kohala  package.  </P></p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada considers customs tariffs CANADA HAS made a substantial concession to its partners in the Uruguay round by agreeing to consider replacing production quotas and import controls with customs tariffs to protect dairy, poultry and egg farmers. Retention of the 'supply management' system has been one of Ottawa's most pressing concerns during the Uruguay Round. Government officials insist that customs duties, which could be as high as 300 per cent on some types of cheese, will provide the same degree of protection for farmers as supply management. But the realisation is gradually taking hold that far-reaching reforms - if not the gradual dismantling - of supply-management are inevitable. Producers have warned that their survival against lower-cost competitors in the US and Mexico depends on the quotas and other controls presently permitted under Article XI of the Gatt. Dairy farmers in Quebec, who make up 40 per cent of the total, exert strong political influence. The government was especially nervous of offending them in the run-up to last October's constitutional referendum. In deference to the dairy lobby, Ottawa has delayed implementing a Gatt finding against curbs on yoghurt and ice cream imports. Canada has found little support for its view among other Gatt members, and its stance on supply management has made life uncomfortable for the Canadians in the Cairns group of farm-exporting countries. A senior trade official said that backing expected from Switzerland and Japan has not materialised, adding 'we cannot impose our views on the rest of the world.' Pressure for change has also come from food processors which are increasingly turning to foreign suppliers for items such as frozen pizzas and butter cookies, which contain dairy products, but less than the 50 per cent which would subject them to import controls. Supply management has kept Canadian food prices unusually high. Processors buy milk for 60 Canadian cents a litre in Ontario; across the Niagara Falls, in New York state, it costs 32 cents. Although Canadian farmers are almost as efficient as their US counterparts, the rules allow them to inflate their costs, for instance, by charging voluntary work done by a teenage son at the same rate as industrial wages in the nearest town.</p>

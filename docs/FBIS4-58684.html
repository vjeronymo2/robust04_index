			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with MBC correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit in Sanaa by </F> announcer Nicole Tannuri--live]    [Text] [Jazulit] First of all, I would like to say that the  MBC information team is at this very moment in the Sanaa  television building, which is now the target of southern  warplanes. This means that the military situation has taken a  grave turn, and that the Sanaa television building is being  strafed by the southern warplanes. Fighting is still raging,  and we can see this very clearly.    As for the situation in Sanaa, I would say that guarded calm  prevails in the capital, but the Yemeni citizens in the capital  are afraid that the military situation will get worse,  particularly considering the power outage and the shortage of  gasoline. Official departments and businesses are closed. It  is also observed that soldiers are patrolling all streets.  Tanks are deployed in certain areas but not in the capital as  some news agencies have reported. I personally did not see any  tanks in the city center as I was leaving my hotel for the  television building.    [Tannuri] Tawfiq, can you contact Aden to learn about the  latest developments there?    [Jazulit] As correspondents, it is difficult to contact Aden  in view of the fierce fighting raging in this area of Yemen.  This also applies to any Yemeni official or citizen in Sanaa or  in the northern provinces.    [Tannuri] Do you know what the latest military situation on  the combat lines is?    [Jazulit] First, the southern Basahib brigade was completely  destroyed following ferocious fighting that lasted until this  morning.    Second, some centers of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in  Sanaa were destroyed by troops.    Third, huge military units are advancing toward south Yemen  to consolidate the al-'Amaliqah positions in the Abyan area.    Fourth, the military fighting is revolving around Aden,  which  has been isolated from the outside world. Sanaa has dispatched  additional troops to reinforce their positions in order to  settle the battle in its favor.    Fifth, the two sides are now using their air power, and  military observers believe that YSP forces could enjoy  superiority in this field.    Sixth, the fierce fighting has spread to the various Yemeni  provinces and military zones, except for Sanaa, where the sound  of artillery is continuously heard.    Seventh, we still do not know if the tribes are taking part  in the fighting. As you can hear now [sound of explosion in the  background], it seems that fighting has erupted anew in Sanaa.  But I will continue my report. According to initial  information, some tribes are taking part in the ongoing bloody  struggle. Observers believe that the fighting between two  regular armies might change to guerrilla warfare. I must stop  now because it seems that fighting has intensified [sound of  explosion in the background].</p>

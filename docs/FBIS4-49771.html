			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Some leading U.S.  congressmen today called for de-linking human rights and trade  in order to get the country's China policy right.    Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, told an American Enterprise Institute conference on  China here that the United States needs a multi-faceted policy  toward China.    "With a country as important and complex as China, we cannot  allow one interest -- whether it is human rights, commercial  ties, or geopolitical strategy -- to dominate," he said.    He urged president Clinton "to present to the Congress and  the country a China policy that looks towards the future, not  the past."    Speaking of what the U.S. policy should be on MFN, he noted  that whatever leverage MFN conditionality has provided in the  past year, its application in this next phase would probably be  counterproductive. "It is time to de-link," he stressed.    He also disagreed with the argument in favor of imposing  selective sanctions. It "is not workable...it would be just as  confusing as the present state of affairs," he said.    Also speaking at the conference, Senator Max Baucus warned  that China is not a country "we can take lightly."    The policy of MFN conditions, he pointed out, has proven  ineffective in promoting human rights, and revoking MFN is, in  fact, the economic equivalent of "dropping a nuclear bomb."    "If we continue a conditional, year-by-year renewal policy,  sooner or later, the nuclear bomb will go," he added.    Baucus described the United States as being isolated in  linking human rights and trade with China. "Not one country  supports our policy...carrying it out would be a disaster," he  remarked.    "The time has come to do what we ought to do -- to renew MFN  permanently and take it out of politics for good," he said.    Most of the other speakers at the one-day conference were  also united in calling for unconditional renewal of MFN as the  best way to maintain normal economic and trade relations with  China.</p>

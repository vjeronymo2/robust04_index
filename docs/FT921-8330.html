			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / FT Cable and Satellite Conference: EC fears row over sports rights PRESSURE is likely to mount on the European Community in the wake of the winter Olympic games to legislate on the issue of exclusive television rights to sporting events, a European commissioner warned yesterday. There have been protests about the exclusive television rights to both the winter and summer Olympics bought by the European Broadcasting Union, and about the subsequent sale of exclusive satellite rights to Eurosport, which consists of a number of broadcasting union members. Mr Jean Dondelinger, the EC commissioner responsible for audio-visual policy, told the Financial Times Cable and Satellite Conference in London yesterday the present approach was 'clearly not the right way' to serve the market. The commission had been reluctant to intervene immediately under competition rules and possibly interfere with programmes. 'What appears to be clear is that in future the question of access (to rights) still needs a solution,' said Mr Dondelinger, adding that possible legislation would be considered later this year. Mr Dondelinger was answering questions after emphasising that the challenges posed by the development of high-definition television in Europe were as great for programme-makers as for equipment manufacturers. 'What the viewer will want is high quality wide-screen programmes on wide-screen sets,' Mr Dondelinger said. 'One without the other would be waste of time, effort and money.' He also argued that as demand for satellite television increased, the best possible management of the orbital positions of satellites would be needed to ensure that viewers received the best pictures and sound at the best prices. Mr Jean Grenier, director-general of Eutelsat, the European satellite organisation, said it planned to locate two satellites in the same orbit. This meant that about 40 channels could be received with a single dish from the same orbital position. The decision, likely to be taken soon, is a clear sign that Eutelsat is fighting back against the Astra television system. Astra plans to offer 48 channels on a single dish by locating three satellites in virtually the same orbital position. Mr Grenier said tests on interference between the two satellite systems showed that British Sky Broadcasting channels, in which Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times has a stake, would not be affected by interference as Astra had previously feared. Eutelsat still believed, however, that while 60cm satellite dishes could be used in certain conditions, 80cm dishes were needed to protect against all risk of interference. Mr Gerard Le Febvre, director of strategy at CLT, the Luxembourg-based broadcaster, said that since 1987 the total audience share of public-service broadcasters in Europe had declined 62 per cent to 35 per cent last year. A new role for some public-service broadcasters would be to broadcast new services worldwide via satellite. Mr Le Febvre said that cable would be the biggest television growth area in the 1990s. He predicted that in each country there would only be one national public-service channel with one or two competing pay channels, up to three private general-interest channels in each language area and a growing number of special-interest satellite channels.</p>

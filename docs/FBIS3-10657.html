			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in  Portuguese on 6 March, on page 8, carries an approximately  800-word report by Vasconcelo Quadros on the worst crisis the  Federal Police, PF, has experienced in its history.    The report notes that with only 4,200 members, a little more  than half what it had in the 80's, the PF is plagued by  unbridled corruption, the improper discharge of duties,  disagreements, lack of leadership, and disrespect for the chain  of command, etc.    The article says the PF is losing the main characteristic of  any police force -- its desire to investigate, and mentions  cases that reveal the PF agents' apathy about investigations.    Quadros then mentions cases that reveal how PF agents  discharge their duties inefficiently, engage in corruption, do  not respect the chain of command, and are involved in crimes,  including rape.</p>

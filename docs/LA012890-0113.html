			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER JUSTICE ARTHUR GOLDBERG  </P> <P> Our country lost a great American when Arthur J. Goldberg passed away (Part A,  Jan. 20). One regret is that he left without writing his memoirs.  </P> <P> It would have been historically important to reveal in detail how President  Lyndon Johnson persuaded him to leave the Supreme Court for the United Nations  ambassadorship. As a dear friend since World War II Arthur told me the story  several times, but it deserved public revelation.  </P> <P> In effect, Johnson insisted that Goldberg alone, with his vast labor  negotiation experience, could help negotiate world peace at the U.N., that it  was his duty to mankind to make such use of his talents. He then looked Arthur  in the eye and said, "As your commander in chief I am directing you to  undertake that responsibility." How could anyone refuse the President of the  United States, Goldberg would ask rhetorically. However, the potential  development of another Louis Brandeis or William Brennan was thwarted.  </P> <P> It was not long before disillusionment set in. As United Nations ambassador  Goldberg did not have free rein; he was subject to directions from the State  Department and the White House. And it was soon apparent that the real reason  he was asked to leave the Supreme Court was to make room for President  Johnson's personal associate Abe Fortas.  </P> <P> My wife and I will miss the heartwarming visits with Arthur Goldberg and his  late wife, Dorothy, both here in California and in Washington. More sadly, the  nation will miss his wise counsel.  </P> <P> STANLEY MOSK  </P> <P> Supreme Court Justice  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P></p>

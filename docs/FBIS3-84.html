Here is an  excerpt of the communique issued at the end the deliberations.  It is read by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui:    [Begin recording] Concerning the consequences of the  devaluation of the CFA franc, the heads of state noted that  prices skyrocketed and this resulted in a substantial fall in  purchasing power, as was predicted. They examined the backup  measures taken for three different purposes. The measures were  implemented through the Bank of Central African States, BEAC, to  check rising inflation; the states in the subregion to minimize  increases in prices of essential commodities; and through  international financial institutions, including the IMF, with  whom letters of intent were signed to ensure an influx of funds  needed to reestablish financial balances and relaunch economic  activities in our countries.    Analyzing the effects of the monetary adjustment on the  BEAC's balance-sheet, the heads of state noted the negative  effects that the new exchange rate has had on their transaction  accounts, all of which are now in debt. They therefore stressed  the need to rapidly offset this loss. [end recording]    This summit, which has just ended in Libreville, began 24  hours before the meeting of African finance ministers, which  will examine a very important issue: problems related to the  financing of development in Africa. This meeting, which is  their fifth one, is held every two years.</p>

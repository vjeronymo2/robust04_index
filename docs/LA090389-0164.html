			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> British undercover soldiers shot and killed a Protestant extremist in Northern  Ireland minutes after he and another gunman killed a Roman Catholic in the  Ardoyne area of Belfast, security sources said. Residents said the man killed  by the army is believed to be a member of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force.  His accomplice was wounded. Witnesses said the two attackers came up to their  victim, Patrick McKenna, 38, on a motorcycle and that one dismounted and shot  McKenna. As the attackers sped off, leaving McKenna dead on the sidewalk, their  motorcycle was rammed by an unmarked military car carrying out an undercover  patrol.  </P></p>

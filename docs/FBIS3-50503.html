The signing of the act was made in the Coat of Arms Hall of  the Interior Ministry by Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, Labor  Minister Armando Caro Figueroa, and Chubut Vice Governor Jorge  Aubia on behalf of Governor Carlos Maestro, who is on leave.    With the admission of Chubut to the Fiscal Pact, according  to  the act signed tonight, there is a balance in favor of the  province of a little over 57 million pesos, which corresponds to  a credit balance of 61 million pesos and to a debt with the  nation of 4 million pesos.    The agreement also "resolved once and for all many claims  and  trials involving the nation and the province" through the  signing of the act "for the reorganization of the financial  situation between the state and the Province of Chubut."    This is how the government was able to get the support of  one  of the provinces opposed to the Fiscal Pact. Cordoba and  Catamarca Provinces may also join the initiative.    In addition to these two provinces, the others that still  remain to sign the agreement proposed by the government are Rio  Negro and Santa Cruz Provinces.    Minister Ruckauf expressed optimism that when the meeting of  the governors with President Carlos Menem is held next January  in Chapadmallal "all the provinces will have joined the Fiscal  Pact."</p>

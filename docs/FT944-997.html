			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Neste prepares Finland's largest sell-off Preparations for what could be Finland's largest privatisation have taken a step forward with a proposal by Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group, to issue up to 18m new shares, or a 20 per cent stake in the company, during 1995. The government, which owns 97 per cent of Neste, is expected to approve the proposal at a special shareholders' meeting on December 29 and clear the way for the country's biggest industrial group, by sales, to seek a listing on the Helsinki stock exchange. Neste wants authorisation to issue for subscription a maximum of 18m new shares with a nominal value of FM10 a share. Some estimates have valued Neste, which had sales of FM33bn (Dollars 6.8bn) in the first eight months of the year, at FM10bn, implying that the sale of a 20 per cent stake in the company would raise more than any single Finnish privatisation issue to date. However, the company and the government are adopting a cautious approach, refusing to set a timetable or speculate on the price and other conditions of the planned issue. A recent cooling of the Helsinki stock market - which has been Europe's top performing bourse this year - and the withdrawal this month of a FM1.5bn share issue by Kymmene, the forestry group, have raised concerns about the market's ability to digest further big issues. A slowly accelerating privatisation programme by the centre-right government has seen FM7.4bn raised in the last 12 months through the sell-off of stakes in five companies - Outokumpu, the mining group; Rautaruukki, the steel producer; Valmet, the paper-machine maker; Veitsiluoto, the pulp and paper manufacturer; and Kemira, the chemicals group. The latest issue is a FM500m offer of 12m new shares in Finnair, Finland's national airline, announced this month. Neste has been seen for some time as the most likely next candidate. The government has parliamentary approval to reduce its stake to a minimum of 50.1 per cent, in line with the step-by-step approach to privatisation adopted by Helsinki under which the state usually retains a majority or large minority holding. Neste has been restructured over the past few years to sharpen its focus on oil and energy. It has returned to the black this year, swinging to a pre-tax profit of FM879m in the fist eight months from a loss of FM1.3bn in the same period last year.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Observer: Missing inaction Mohammed Nashashibi, Palestine's new finance minister, was not in his office yesterday. Not surprising really, as he doesn't have an office, a telephone, or a secretary. He may or may not - depending on who you talk to - have a home in Jericho, the fledgling capital of Palestinian self-rule. Mohammed Shaker, the only man officially allowed to talk to the press on behalf of the Palestinian administration, said the minister's whereabouts were unknown. He may have gone to Nablus, or east Jerusalem, or perhaps was indeed somewhere in Jericho. Nashashibi has said that his finance ministry would be the 'most important department' of the new Palestinian administration. If he had a secretary, that message could probably be passed on to his fellow officials.</p>

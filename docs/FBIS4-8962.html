			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Albanisation of Tetovo"] </F>   [Text] The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] Radio informs of recently increasing  practice of Macedonians selling their homes in Tetovo.  Purchasers are mainly Albanians from outside, offering  enormously high prices in hard currency. The tax department in  Tetovo has received 1,700 applications for house, business  locals and real estates sales, only in the period from last  January until this month. The sales are especially frequent in  the city centre. The basic reasons for this is the present  chaotic and lawless situation, expelling the official Macedonian  language from use and the uncontrolled processes of Albanisation  of Tetovo and surrounding villages.</p>

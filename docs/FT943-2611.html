			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / US invasion of Haiti halted as Carter strikes deal with junta: Military chiefs to step down - American troops to enter peacefully US troops will enter Haiti peacefully today after former president Jimmy Carter struck a last-minute deal with the Haitian military leaders last night to avert a full-scale invasion. In a televised address early today President Bill Clinton revealed that the junta had agreed to step down only when convinced that US paratroopers were on the way from North Carolina. Mr Clinton said he had in fact ordered the invasion to start last night and 61 aircraft were in the air when the agreement was clinched. The aircraft were recalled. He said the junta would leave Haiti as soon as the Haitian parliament had passed an amnesty agreement and in any event no later than October 15. Mr Clinton said the agreement was 'good' for the US and for Haiti. He paid tribute to the mission led by Mr Carter which included Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the armed services committee, and former General Colin Powell the previous head of the joint chiefs of staff. He said the US intervention was still not without risk but he was confident that it would now succeed. The president's announcement should defuse what has been his most difficult foreign affairs crisis. The breakthrough came, however, in the last few hours of Mr Carter's mission to Haiti, which began on Saturday and culminated in a six-hour session yesterday with Lt General Raoul Cedras, the republic's military strongman. After the last session of talks at the headquarters of the Haitian military in Port-au-Prince, the capital, the two teams adjourned to the presidential palace for a final session with Mr Emile Jonassaint, the de facto president appointed some months ago by the junta. The first sign of a possible deal occurred when Mr Carter and Gen Cedras went from the military headquarters in Port-au-Prince to the presidential palace for a joint visit to Mr Jonassaint. Although Mr Jonassaint's authority has never been recognised by the US, the development for the first time raised speculation that a constitutional settlement might be found which would allow Gen Cedras to step down. The Carter team, to the surprise of some Washington observers, had also met Mr Jonassaint on Saturday. Earlier yesterday there had been reports from the Haitian side that Gen Cedras was demanding that Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in a 1991 coup, agree to step down as a condition for the junta's capitulation. But senior US government officials insisted that Mr Carter's mission was authorised only to agree the departure of the three-man junta. They had stressed that the return of Mr Aristide was non-negotiable especially after his agreement not to contest presidential elections scheduled for December 1995. Other reports had said that General Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff, was holding out against leaving, but that Gen Cedras and Lt Col Michel Francois, the police chief, were resigned to exile. President Carlos Menem of Argentina yesterday said he was prepared to offer asylum if the junta left before any invasion. It emerged at the weekend that Mr Clinton decided to send the Carter mission only after Thursday night's televised address in which he had demanded that the junta leave. Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said the final decision was taken jointly by Mr Clinton and Mr Carter but he denied that 'this last-minute effort for peace' had been opposed by some administration members.

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Swiss armaments group back in black OERLIKON Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and shoe retailing group, returned to profit in the first half for the first time since 1985. Net profit was a nominal SFr5.3m (Dollars 4.24m) on sales up 10 per cent to SFr1.6bn. In the full year for 1991 the group recorded a SFr187m loss and incurred restructuring costs of SFr700m. Mr Hans Widmer, the chairman who was brought in last April to rescue the group, forecast that cash flow in the full year would reach more than SFr200m and the group would be in profit. Net debt stood at SFr1.72bn at the end of June, down SFr59m since the end of last year, and the manpower has been cut from 26,437 at the beginning of 1991 to 16,487. Mr Widmer said the group's focus had shifted to rebuilding its businesses. New orders in the first half in the civilian businesses were up 9 per cent to SFr1.3bn and the Contraves military business, specialising in anti-aircraft missile systems, received a further SFr1bn in orders. Among the group's divisions, the Contraves business remained the biggest loss-maker with a SFr75m operating loss on sales of SFr597m in the first half, attributable mainly to a contract in Canada. Sales of the Bally shoe subsidiary were up 9 per cent to SFr546m and operating profits were SFr33m. Balzers, the vacuum pump and anti-wear coatings group, had a SFr42m operating profit on a 7 per cent rise in sales to SFr230m.</p>

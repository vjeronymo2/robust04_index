			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: 'THE LONG WALK HOME' -- FOUR VIEWS;  </P> <P> A SLICE OF LIFE FROM ANOTHER TIME  </P> <P> In today's world, unlike old biblical times, we do not "visit the sins of the  parents onto the children"; but even if we should, we must be sure that the  children are true descendants of the parents. "The Long Walk Home" is a fine  creative effort; it is not a pretentious piece of revisionist history, as is  "Mississippi Burning." It isolates a slice of life from a critical historical  period, the Montgomery bus boycott.  </P> <P> The film focuses on two main characters, two average Southern wives (one black  and one white) of mid-1950s urban Alabama. The plot is developed around their  intra- and inter-family dynamics.  </P> <P> The key point here is that both of these families are typical for their racial  and social groups in that society. Neither of them is driven sanctimoniously by  high moral principles; they arrive at their final position of resistance and  sacrifice through an evolutionary process.  </P> <P> True, that process and the forces driving it are different for both of these  ladies, but the significant point is that they arrive at the same place --  unwitting heroines in a fight against racism, cowardice and stupidity.  </P> <P> This film does not try to exploit our senses. It appears to me that the makers  of this movie did not want to subordinate the essence and message of their  story to a cliche-driven work full of cheap excitement, as did "Mississippi  Burning."  </P> <P> In "The Long Walk Home," Odessa, played by Whoopi Goldberg, is a  well-developed, sympathetic, noble character. Goldberg is a sensitive artist  who has a deep understanding of the 1950s Southern black woman  worker/housewife. She does not try to re-create the true historical role of  Rosa Parks. That is left for another movie.  </P> <P> Sissy Spacek's character (Miriam Thompson) is not the revolutionary Norma Rae  -- that movie has already been done. Nor is she any of the heroic white women  of CORE and other civil rights organizations who put their lives on the line  driving black demonstrations during that era.  </P> <P> Spacek plays well the part of a typical idle Southern white middle-class  housewife, with no strong ideological position -- no better nor worse than  anybody else in her class or racial group. Her evolution to a role as civil  rights participant is arrived at through pragmatic necessities. The blatantly  stupid, cowardly and racist resistance of her husband and brother-in-law helps  to drive that evolution.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASCOAL: A SPECIALIST IN 'UNIVERSAL MUSIC'  </P> <P> Hermeto Pascoal, as iconoclastic with his thoughts as he is with his music,  doesn't mince words.  </P> <P> Take the lambada. The rotund, white-bearded, albino Brazilian  multi-instrumentalist, who shares the bill with Egberto Gismonti at the  Wadsworth Theatre tonight, has powerful feelings about the latest musical  import from South of the border.  </P> <P> "The lambada? Ha! Let me tell you something about that. To me, the lambada is  worse than a disease. This lambada," explained Pascoal last week via his  interpreter, keyboardist Jovino Santos Neto, "is not even Brazilian; it's from  the Caribbean. To do this music is criminal, because instead of hurting your  body, it hurts your soul."  </P> <P> Pascoal is well qualified to speak authoritatively about Brazilian music, and  improvised music in general, for that matter: his work both sums up and  reflects the remarkable variety of creative elements active in it. On any given  night, he may play ballads, free jazz, Brazilian pop or a symphony on pots,  pans and hubcaps.  </P> <P> "The only label I can apply to what I do," he said, "is 'Universal Music.' In  one moment, you might hear something that you might call classical music; in  the next moment something that you might call Gypsy or Spanish music; in the  next moment some purely Brazilian popular things.  </P> <P> "We see no distinction between all the different styles. We don't want to  specialize in one line; we want to play music that is good music, and absorb  all these different styles and then play them our own way."  </P> <P> Pascoal spent his childhood working in the fields of northeast Brazil with his  father, playing wooden flutes and a beat-up old hurdy gurdy. After discovering  the piano, he wound up in Rio de Janeiro as part of one of the seminal  Brazilian music groups, Quartet Novo. In the late '60s, he moved to the United  States, where he recorded with Miles Davis, Airto Moriera and Flora Purim.  </P> <P> After returning to Brazil in the mid-'70s, Pascoal formed the group which he  has led, almost continuously, ever since. The players in the seven-piece band  he will perform with in Los Angeles have been with him for an average of 10  years each -- remarkable continuity for the sometimes ephemeral longevity of  the music business.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons we've been together for so long is that we never get bored  from playing the same programs," he explained. "We don't even make a song list  before we go on stage, and we never play pieces the same way. Everything is a  surprise, for us and for our listeners."  </P> <P> Gismonti, in marked contrast to Pascoal's romantic renegade, appears as the  ascetic introvert -- dark and inner-focused. His current group includes the  unusual combination of his own piano and guitar, cello, bass and a second  guitarist. A classically-trained concert pianist who once studied with fabled  composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, he brings to his music an intense mixture  of European logic and Brazilian spiritualism.  </P> <P> "We have many kinds of music in Brazil," said Gismonti, "from the very  primitive music of the Amazon jungle to very developed electronic and symphonic  music. The music I do uses all these elements, and there's no name for such a  mixture, even in Brazil. The way the critics describe what people like Hermeto  and me do is to say, 'Oh, that's Hermeto's music,' or 'Oh, that's Egberto's  music.' "  </P> <P> Gismonti has been especially affected by several visits to the Amazon and a  long association with the Xingu Indians.  </P> <P> "The most important thing I learned from the Xingus was to be completely free,"  he recalled. "It is their way, the way they use the music. To them, music is  not just sounds, it is the voice of the spirits.  </P> <P> "Studying European music was important to me to learn about different  instrumentations -- different combinations of instruments. I try to combine  what I've learned from the European information with what I experienced with  the Xingus in the Amazon -- to make myself free to play, to express, the voice  of the spirit."  </P> <P> As much as they may differ in style and manner, Pascoal and Gismonti both  personify the tremendous range and complexity of Brazilian music -- from  Pascoal's carnival-like feeling of celebration to Gismonti's synthesis of  European classical music and Afro-Brazilian rhythms, and from Gismonti's  expression of the Xingu Indians' spirit of music to Pascoal's emotional linkage  of samba and jazz.  </P></p>

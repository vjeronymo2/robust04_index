			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AS MERCURY FALLS, ARMY OF CROP PROTECTORS RISES  </P> <P> There was a time when all farmers could do was talk about the weather. Nowadays  many are doing something about it.  </P> <P> Most growers head for their groves or fields when a freeze alert is issued by  the National Weather Service. As the mercury drops into the 20s, heaters are  fueled and lighted, sprinklers are turned on, and, when available, wind  machines are employed to circulate air and break up pockets of cold that settle  in low-lying areas.  </P> <P> In recent years, the helicopter has entered the fight, providing mobile wind  machines that hover above frost-threatened crops and prevent losses in the  millions of dollars.  </P> <P> Ivor Shier, president of Corporate Helicopters, is a veteran in the cold  control corps. He and his workers have spent two long nights this week in the  Coachella Valley, herding warm air to grapevines and other valuable crops.  Working about 75 feet up, they provide enough circulation to keep frost from  settling but not enough to harm foliage or fruit.  </P> <P> The job is exacting, stressful, tiring and boring, Shier acknowledged. Pilots  must maneuver in the dark, watching for power poles, other helicopters and  changes in temperature and altitude as well as listening to radio instructions  from ground crews.  </P> <P> From dark to dawn Wednesday and Thursday nights, 35 helicopter pilots worked to  thwart arctic cold in the Coachella Valley, Shier said, and the cost was not  low: about $7,000 per helicopter per night.  </P> <P> "We think of ourselves as insurance policies and well worth it," Shier said.  "Without us, they could have lost a crop worth a quarter of a million dollars."  </P> <P> Bill Snodgrass, county assistant agricultural commissioner, said the new  methods of frost prevention all have hefty price tags. The cost of heating  greenhouses, fueling wind machines and continuously pumping water through  sprinklers on cold nights rises as the temperature falls, he pointed out.  </P> <P> The time-tested method of covering plants with burlap or plastic has recently  been modernized in the form of a spray-on coating, an Evergreen Nursery  spokesman said. Both methods seem to have protected the firm's stock from the  record cold, he said, although damage may not appear for several days after a  freeze.  </P> <P> In addition, bacterial applications that promise frost resistance for a variety  of crops are now in the experimental stage. University of California  agricultural extension specialists are working with the most recent frost- and  freeze-protection method.  </P></p>

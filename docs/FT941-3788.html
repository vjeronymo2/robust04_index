			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Suzuki acts to end its 20-year link with Heron Suzuki, the Japanese car, motorcycle and power products group, is taking control of the highly profitable UK import and distribution activities for its vehicles. The operations have been owned and operated for the past 20 years by Mr Gerald Ronson's Heron International. Suzuki, struggling against heavy losses at Santana Motor, its Spanish-based European manufacturing operations, will take control of UK sales and distribution on March 31, when its most recent five-year contract with Heron Suzuki expires. Heron International is seeking rescheduling of interest payments to bondholders after the troubled group's Pounds 1.4bn restructuring last September. Heron Suzuki, known as Suzuki (GB) until a name change two years ago, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m on turnover of Pounds 106m in its year to March 1992, the most recent year for which accounts have been filed. It was profitable throughout the steep motor industry recession at the start of the 1990s, when some of the larger carmakers and importers sank into losses. Last year it sold more than 11,000 cars, leisure four-wheel-drive vehicles and light commercial vehicles. When motorcycles and power products are included, the company has a total of 500 dealers in the UK. Suzuki's clawback comes as no surprise to Mr Ronson or Heron, however. Renewal contracts are typically signed well over a year before they are due to expire, and Suzuki Motor Corporation indicated early last year that it intended to change the relationship with the struggling Heron. A number of proposed alternatives were looked at, including takeover by a separate investor group led by Mr Ronson, before Suzuki decided to assume control itself. Neither side would say what Suzuki would pay Heron for the takeover, but one insider maintained: 'It's not a very substantial sum.' Heron Suzuki's main assets relate to an import-and-distribution centre at Sheerness and a parts centre and administrative offices at Crawley, West Sussex. The company employs 165 people. Mr John Norman, Heron Suzuki's chief executive, said the two sides 'are in the final stages of the legal discussions and negotiations for an orderly transfer of the business by March 31'. The Suzuki takeover is the latest example of a trend by vehicle manufacturers to assume control of import-and-distribution businesses previously run by independents. Nissan has taken control from Mr Octav Botnar's Nissan UK, Volkswagen has taken back its UK franchise from Lonrho, Volvo from the Lex Service group and Fiat has taken Alfa-Romeo back from Inchcape's TKM subsidiary.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Take a rich sprinkling of serious chefs . . .  -Nicholas Lander gathers some tips from top professionals for entertaining throughout the year Philip Britten, The Capital Hotel, 22 Basil Street, London SW3 1AT. Tel: 071-589-5171. Last October I learnt an important culinary lesson the hard way. It is possible and practical to adapt recipes from home to the hotel but you have to be careful which you choose. Our general manager thought that we should serve our own marmalade in the hotel and that, if it were ready for Christmas, we could give it as presents. He even supplied a recipe that correctly called for bitter Seville oranges. That was the first problem. Only Valencias exist in October and they are not as suitable or as appetising as Sevilles. Then, when Sevilles do appear, the season is short and I could not store - let alone make - enough marmalade in January to see the hotel through until the next season. Finally, no-one can agree on how their marmalade should taste or spread: sweet or bitter, how much peel, how thick. Yet this recipe had to suit all needs and would be served at breakfast, a sensitive time of the day. I finally adapted a recipe adapting the solera system that produces sherry, a fractional blending process in this case using orange juice and orange peel from a variety of different oranges and substituting honey for sugar. The final hurdle was pectin, the natural gelling agent found in orange pips and normally extracted by boiling them in a muslin bag. On a commercial scale this was impractical and so I searched for a supplier. A wholesaler found a shop in Paris selling powdered pectin. I was almost there but still the biggest obstacle remained. When the marmalade was ready, the management assembled in front of a table laden with toast, croissants and pots of unidentified marmalade and for an hour we tasted, chewed and marked. Fortunately, mine came out top but toast has never had quite the same appeal.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Anglo Irish talks hit impasse Talks aimed at reaching a lasting political settlement in Northern Ireland ground to a standstill last night after Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds his Irish counterpart, were unable to compromise on how to take forward the peace process, Emma Tucker writes. The UK-Irish summit scheduled to take place at the end of next week has been put off until autumn, when the two leaders will meet informally. During yesterday's talks in Brussels, ahead of the summit to select the new European Commission president, Mr Major was looking for a pledge from Dublin that it would modify the republic's constitutional claim to Ulster. Mr Reynolds has been reluctant to give any firm commitment ahead of the conclusion of an overall agreement between unionists and nationalists.</p>

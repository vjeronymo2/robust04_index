			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MINISTER TESTIFIES IN MCMARTIN TRIAL  </P> <P> A minister who in the early 1980s counseled Manhattan Beach McMartin Pre-School  defendants Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, testified  Thursday that the sessions had nothing to do with child molestation.  </P> <P> "I never discussed with Raymond Buckey sexual problems with children," said Dr.  Frank Richelieu, who described himself as pastor of the Church of Religious  Science, a metaphysical and motivational denomination, and a licensed  practitioner of prayer treatment.  </P> <P> Instead, the Redondo Beach minister testified outside the presence of the jury,  "I've seen Raymond on general matters regarding his direction in life, his  self-image and self-worth, and at one time Raymond was going through a drinking  experience."  </P> <P> Richelieu was subpoenaed by prosecutors, who continue to maintain that the  counseling sessions focused on Raymond Buckey's sexual attraction to young  children.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders reserved a decision on  whether the sessions are protected by confidentiality, or whether they may be  discussed in front of the jury.  </P> <P> Richelieu said that there was "not a word of truth" in a prosecutor's 1987  statement that entries in Virginia McMartin's diaries referring to her  grandson's "problem" was a reference to his alleged sexual proclivity toward  children.  </P></p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Doubled bonus for Tate &amp; Lyle chairman The bonus paid to Sir Neil Shaw, chairman and highest paid director of Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugars and sweeteners group, doubled last year to Pounds 200,000 for the year to September 24. Sir Neil's remuneration, excluding pension fund contributions, increased by 26 per cent to Pounds 456,000, although his salary eased from Pounds 261,000 to Pounds 256,000, according to the annual report and accounts published yesterday. For the year 1992-93, his total remuneration fell from Pounds 375,000 to Pounds 361,000, including a bonus of Pounds 100,000. Last month Tate &amp; Lyle reported record annual profits of Pounds 273.8m, up 23 per cent on the previous year, on the back of a strong performance from US cereal sweeteners and starches. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 13 per cent to 37.1p, while the dividend was 11 per cent ahead at 14.4p. The main factor behind the rise was a turnround at Staley, the US subsidiary, which brought in record results after several years of disputes over working practices at one of its Illinois plants. Just before Christmas the group announced a Dollars 78m (Pounds 50m) expansion project for Staley which will eventually double capacity for both high fructose corn syrup and modified starch. Staley's gains last year masked a downturn in the US sugar profits following record beet supplies. But the group would not give specific figures for sugar, in line with a decision to reduce the data it publishes. Sir Neil said it was detrimental to the business to give more information than competitors, many of which were private companies.</p>

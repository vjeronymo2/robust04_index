			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The state commission of inquiry into the Hebron  massacre will begin its work this morning. Today, the  commission will interview 11 witnesses from the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces]. The first witness is Major General Dani Yatom,  the commander of the Central Command. The military commander of  the Cave of the Patriarchs will also appear before the  commission. Our legal affairs correspondent Mira Amsalem  reports:    The state commission of inquiry known as the Shamgar [named  after Supreme Court justice heading it] commission will start  its proceedings this morning by hearing the testimony of  military personnel. The first witness will be Maj. Gen. Dani  Yatom, the commander of the Central Command. The members of the  commission -- Justice Me'ir Shamgar, the president of the  Supreme Court; Justice El'iezer Goldberg, Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-Zu'bi, Professor Menahem Ya'ari, and former Chief of Staff  Moshe Levi -- will hear the testimony of and interrogate Maj.  Gen. Yatom. Afterwards, apparently today, they will also hear  the testimony of Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, the commander of  IDF forces in Judaea and Samaria. The commander of the Cave of  the Patriarchs will also be interrogated this week. As a rule,  the commission will hold its proceedings four times a week, in  the morning and in the afternoon. Due to the Ramadan fast, the  Arab witnesses will only testify before the commission after the  fast is over, in approximately two weeks.    This week, then, military, police, and Border Police  personnel will give testimony. The witnesses will appear  without legal counsel. If the commission decides that certain  witnesses may be harmed by their testimony, they will be warned  and subsequently permitted to employ legal representation.  However, it may be safely assumed that some of the witnesses  have already received, or will receive, private legal  counselling before testifying to the commission.    The commission's letter of appointment stipulates that it  will investigate findings and reach conclusions as to the facts  and circumstances relating to the massacre. In its search for  the truth, the commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre  may reach the highest levels of the IDF, the Civil  Administration, the Shin Bet, and even up to the defense  minister. The commission has been given the results of the  IDF's investigation into the massacre and additional material  amassed by the attorneys responsible for collecting all relevant  material, Miki Shaqed and Dafna Bienvoll.    The military investigation has already revealed flaws in  security regulations at the Cave; however, this is only one  aspect of the investigation. Beyond clarifying the facts, the  commission must also present its findings as to the  responsibility for the massacre. The commission will try to  answer these most disturbing questions in the form of  recommendations for future implementation and personal  conclusions with regard to actions taken by specific parties in  the past. Did the Shin Bet indeed issue an early warning? What  was the nature of the activities of the members of the Kakh  organization and the murderer Barukh Goldstein? What were the  standard security regulations at the Cave of the Patriarchs and  what were the instructions and regulations governing behavior at  the site? Were the authorities adequately prepared for the  Ramadan fast? And finally, who bears responsibility for all  this?    The commission of inquiry has published notices in the  newspapers calling on all witnesses to the massacre to come and  testify. This is the 11th commission of inquiry established  according to law. Four commissions in the past recommended the  dismissal of senior officials. According to various  assessments, it will take this commission at least two months to  publish its recommendations.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Corporate Italy flounders in the mess left by scandal It is open season on business news in Italy. So deep has the 18-month political corruption scandal run that it is possible to write virtually anything about any company - without the hint of a libel action. Even the most punctilious press officers, once swift to denounce an unflattering headline, are silent. If their companies have not already been implicated, the risk of nasty surprises around the corner is enough to deter any aggression towards the media. In recent months, the scandal has widened to include many of Italy's most famous companies. Fiat has admitted to paying kickbacks at its bus, railway equipment, gas turbine and construction subsidiaries. Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti, has seen his prestige dive. Only days after declaring that the computers group had never paid bribes, he admitted to Milan magistrates that kickbacks had been paid. Most recently, attention has switched to Ferruzzi, Italy's second biggest private company, where political corruption and financial mismanagement appear to have gone hand in hand. Leaked testimony by senior Ferruzzi managers and family members suggests the group, then run by Mr Raul Gardini, who shot himself last month, paid about L135bn (Pounds 56m) to politicians in connection with the Enimont chemicals joint venture. The testimony also suggests Ferruzzi operated what amounted to a parallel set of books to cover vast commodity trading losses, deal with takeover finance and even to subsidise the controlling family's lavish lifestyle. The corruption scandal has focused on contracts with the state. The practice of giving bribes was particularly acute in construction and pharmaceuticals, where the companies involved depended on public sector contracts. However, service industries, such as public relations and advertising, which also won substantial state business, have also been implicated. Earnings at big building groups, including Fiat's Cogefar Impresit subsidiary and Grassetto, controlled by Premafin, have plunged because of the virtual collapse of new orders. The scandals have also affected thousands of smaller companies, often dependent on larger counterparts embroiled in the affair. Many small builders, which would normally act as sub-contractors to the big groups accused of paying kickbacks, are now facing bankruptcy. The pharmaceuticals industry is also in a mess following allegations of bribes to a central committee of academics and civil servants. This body recommended prices and suggested which products should go on the government's list of free medicines. Corruption has tarnished the image of many of Italy's most famous concerns and affected decision-making at a crucial time of domestic recession and depressed export markets. Fiat, struggling with a collapsing domestic car market, floundered earlier this year while some of its senior executives languished in jail and others extended their foreign 'business trips' to avoid interrogation. Morale has been hit. Fiat was forced to overturn its policy of not co-operating with the magistrates investigating political corruption. Having presented itself as 'above' the seedier side of Italian politics, it has been revealed to have played along with the politicians. Its image has also been tainted because its size and prestige should have enabled it to resist the entreaties of rapacious politicians. Meanwhile, the magistrates' strategy of distinguishing between co-operative company executives and those less willing to spill the beans has contributed to a mood of suspicion and intrigue. Some executives have languished in Milan's decrepit San Vittore jail while under interrogation, others have been kept in more salubrious surroundings. That differentiation has occasionally led to a rush to testify when magistrates have discovered a new line of inquiry, as in the recent pharmaceuticals revelations. The fear that a competitor might be more willing to co-operate has induced many executives, who remained silent about kickbacks for years, to tell their stories. The magistrates' psychological tactics have sometimes contributed to an ugly atmosphere within companies. At Ferruzzi, clear signs of internal conflict have emerged in apparent attempts to shift 'responsibility' for the alleged misdeeds from one branch of the controlling family to another. Most surprising, however, is the fact that the scandals have not had much of an impact on the stock market, which has risen almost 30 per cent this year. The bourse's obliviousness is even more striking in view of the arrest this month of Mr Bruno Pazzi, a retired chairman of Italy's Consob stock market watchdog. It is alleged that Mr Pazzi accepted kickbacks and was secretly on the payroll of Ferruzzi's Montedison subsidiary. Investors have attached more weight to the prospect of export-led recovery helped by the cheaper lira, interest rate cuts and potential privatisations. If bourse indices tracked companies' present standing, rather than investors' expectations, they might well paint a different picture.</p>

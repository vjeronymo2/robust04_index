			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Italy names EU commissioners The partners in Italy's right wing coalition yesterday patched up a compromise deal and named their new European Union commissioners. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi yesterday named Mr Mario Monti, a respected economist, and Ms Emma Bonino a Radical Party politician, to fill Italy's two posts. The last-minute appointments, a day before new commission president Jacques Santer is due to meet his team and assign portfolios, ended weeks of political arm-wrestling in Berlusconi's coalition over whom to send to Brussels. The compromise followed two months of indecision. In September broad agreement had been reached on Mr Monti, who is head of Milan's Bocconi University, for one of the economic portfolios. The coalition partners decided that with one 'technician', the other had to be a politician of some weight. The populist Northern League argued that one of their members be the commissioner as the coalition group with the largest number of deputies. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, proposed Mr Francesco Speroni, Minister of Institutional Reform, as their candidate. Mr Berlusconi's,own party Forza Italia, and their main allies the Neo-Fascist MSI National Alliance, were against giving the league this prize when Mr Umberto Bossi, had consistently done his best to embarass the government. As an alternative, Mr Giorgio Napolitano, the former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and a veteran of the communist party and its successor the Party of The Democratic Left (PDS), was also suggested. However, Ms Emma Bonino, who has extensive experience of the European Parliament, was chosen as a compromise by Mr Berlusconi.</p>

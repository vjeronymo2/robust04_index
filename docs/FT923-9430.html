			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Highest German court blocks abortion law GERMANY'S highest court yesterday blocked a liberal abortion law which was due to have come into force at midnight, Reuter reports from Bonn. The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe approved a request for a preliminary injunction stopping the law from taking effect. The action was brought by 241 conservative members of parliament, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the mainly Catholic state of Bavaria. The court will give a final ruling in the autumn on whether the law, which lets women end pregnancies almost without restriction during the first 12 weeks after conception, is compatible with Germany's constitution. Mr Ernst Gottfried Mahrenholz, chairman of the committee considering the injunction, announced the court's ruling yesterday. The decision means that east and west Germany will continue to have separate abortion laws, at least for the time being. Communist East Germany allowed abortion on demand while in West Germany abortion was a crime unless doctors certified that a woman's physical or mental health would be jeopardised by the continuation of the pregnancy. The court said that by granting the preliminary injunction it was not prejudging the new abortion law itself. The decision made 'no conclusions about the prospective result of the main hearing (later this year)', Mr Mahrenholz said.</p>

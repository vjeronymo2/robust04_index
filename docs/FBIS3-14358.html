Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa chaired the Egyptian delegation.    Our radio correspondent has learned that during its first  meeting today, the council adopted a resolution on developments  in the Palestinian issue and the Arab-Israeli conflict. The  resolution expressed regret at the security and military  agreement France signed with Israel, which helps Israel to  occupy Arab lands by force.    The resolution called on the UN Security Council,  particularly the cosponsors of the peace process, to make  efforts to avert the deterioration of the peaceful process due  to aggressive Israeli practices in the occupied territories. It  called for speeding up the implementation of UN Security Council  Resolution 465, which calls for eliminating the settlements and  views them as obstacles to peace. The resolution affirmed that  the establishment of a just and all-embracing peace in the  region depends on Israel's commitment to implementing UN  Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and on enabling the Palestinian  people to set up their independent state with honorable  Jerusalem as its capital.    In the meantime, the Arab League ministerial council voiced  its deep concern at current developments in Yemen. In a  statement issued today, the council appealed to Yemeni political  leaders to double efforts to resolve differences in a manner  that enhances unity and contributes to the establishment of  stability and peace in Yemen. The council pointed out that  unity in Yemen is a national gain and a pan-Arab accomplishment  that should be preserved and enhanced.    In another development, the seven-member Arab committee of  the council held a meeting this evening under the chairmanship  of Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. The meeting discussed ways to find  a peaceful solution to Libya's crisis with the West that  preserves Libya's national sovereignty and respects the  principles of international law, which stress solving disputes  peacefully. The committee has issued a statement to this effect.    The outcome of the committee's meeting will be referred to  the ministerial council this evening. Egypt, Syria, Libya,  Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania are taking part in the  committee's meeting.</p>

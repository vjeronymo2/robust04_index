			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: France Telecom expected to seek industrial links A report by France Telecom, the French state-owned telecoms operator, is expected to recommend the company's legal status be reformed to enable the opening of its share capital to industrial partners. The report, by Mr Marcel Roulet, France Telecom's chairman, is due to be presented to Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry, telecommunications and foreign trade minister, by the end of the week. France Telecom declined to comment on details of the report, but it is thought to support a government proposal to transform the operator into a joint stock company, with its own capital, from its existing status as an 'autono-mous operator under public law'. The change would allow France Telecom to exchange equity stakes with industrial partners and enable the French government to reduce its holding in the operator. The state, however, would be expected to retain majority control. Mr Longuet proposed last year that France Telecom's legal status be reformed, partly to allow it to forge strategic alliances with other telecoms companies and to prepare for the liberalisation of the European telecoms market, which is due in 1998. Resistance to the moves by employees at France Telecom - who feared the reform would lead to privatisation, job cuts and the end of their semi-civil servant status - prompted the postponement of the reform. Mr Roulet has since conducted company-wide discussions to reassure the operator's 154,000 staff. Opening France Telecom's capital would allow the operator to cement its industrial alliance with Deutsche Telekom. The alliance, which focuses on services for large multinational business clients, was extended earlier this year through a separate link with Sprint of the US. The report also discusses the group's financial strategy. France Telecom is pursuing a policy of debt reduction in an attempt to ease financial charges and to free resources for expansion. At the end of last year, total group borrowings were reduced to FFr105.6bn (Dollars 19.4bn), compared with FFr111.6bn at the end of 1992.</p>

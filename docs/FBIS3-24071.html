			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Text of excerpts of statement by Yuriy Luzhkov, mayor of </F> Moscow, selected by Nikolay Andreyev: "Yu. Luzhkov: `Moscow  Without a Market Is Doomed'"]    [Text] As we have  already reported, a few days ago the mayor of the capital gave a  report on the government's work last year and the program for  the present year. I think Muscovites will be interested to read  excerpts from Yuriy Luzhkov's statement.    We cannot boast of the fact that last year industrial  production was stabilized, but the rate of decline has slowed  and it is substantially lower than for Russia as a whole. The  food industry increased production volumes by 4.7 percent. The  extremely large Kreker dry cereal plant has been launched, a  large brewery is near completion, and 12 bakeries and many  sausage shops and small breweries have been built in the  microrayons. The main goal is to bring "food" closer to  residents and employ at least 30 percent of the working-age  population in food processing and other small-scale production.    The capital's government fulfilled the promise given to  Muscovites and had more than 3 million square meters of housing  commissioned, including 1 million in free municipal housing. We  will continue to refuse to consider abandoning people on the  waiting lists, as has been done in many regions of Russia and  the CIS countries, which "bid farewell" to the lists. Last year  26 schools, 30 kindergartens, 12 polyclinics, and 4 hospitals  were opened in the new housing developments.    The capital's government implemented a targeted structural  policy on social protection of those Muscovites who found  themselves in a most difficult position upon the change-over to  a market basis. Spent for these purposes were 93 billion rubles  [R], which were used to support 3.5 million Muscovites:  pensioners, disabled persons, children, war veterans, and other  categories of citizens. This year the social orientation of city  programs will be bolstered even more: in the first stage alone  the city will allocate R450 billion for social needs. We intend  to systematically index compensation payments to Muscovites,  which will allow us not to lower the level of their support and  to prevent tragedies. Unfortunately, we can only dream of  anything beyond that.    I want to emphasize especially that talk of daring decisions  in the field of reforming the economy without supporting those  people who are in a difficult position through no fault of their  own is simply unacceptable and all the reforms are doomed.    In the past year market structures have continued to be  vigorously developed in Moscow. As of now, about 40 percent of  industrial production, 85 percent of transport, and 90 percent  of trade and domestic enterprises at the municipal and city  levels are no longer state-owned. Operating in the capital, not  counting branches, are 350 commercial banks and many business  houses, exchanges, and insurance companies. The small business  sphere produces 15 percent of the city's volume of consumer  goods. All this is the reality of market transformations.  Without them, and I say this with all responsibility, Moscow  would not have survived 1993. We will continue to develop and  qualitatively improve market relations and conduct  privatization, but not in the Chubays way where enterprises are  sold not as objects for expanded reproduction but as ordinary  real estate. Otherwise, it may happen that small groups of  people buy up these enterprises and do not work on production  but sell them at speculative prices, having acquired them  virtually for kopecks. We intend to leave certain elements of  property at the municipal, city level, while privatized property  will be sold, replenishing the federal and capital treasuries.    Public law and order is a painful issue for Moscow. It has  always been a focus of attention of the capital's government.  Not because of our allegations, but by announcement of the  leaders of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, last year  the city did more for the law enforcement organs than in all the  years of Soviet power. About R40 billion were allocated and 40  special purpose integrated objects with contemporary equipment  were built to develop the law enforcement organs'  material-technical base. Much equipment was bought for GAI  [State Automobile Inspectorate] to do operational work, as well  as special devices for operational brigades in the fight against  organized crime. And now, not just in the future, we have a  right to demand of the militsia that they fundamentally change  their work and provide reliable protection of Muscovites and  commercial structures from different kinds of criminals.    We promised last year to put in order and pave 15 million  square meters of Moscow roads, streets, and courtyards with  asphalt, but 3.5 million beyond that has been done. In terms of  volume of road repair, Moscow is at the level of the largest  capitals of the world, but we are justifiably criticized for the  lack of quality, just as we are for the poor job of cleaning up  the city and the work of the law enforcement structures. This  year should be a critical one on these issues.    Although we entered 1994 without a budget deficit, the  economic situation is very bad. The federal government did not  pay its debt of R142 billion to Moscow. The situation is not  clear in terms of tax deductions and compensation payments for  expenditures for fulfilling the functions of a capital city, and  up to this point the embassies, representations, and various  state institutions have not paid the city for land and  buildings. We are asked to pay R3.4 trillion to maintain and  develop the capital's subway system, but even here the federal  government has not kept its promise, putting everything on the  city's shoulders.    Moreover, I recently found out from a solid, reliable source  that Russia's Ministry of Finance aspires to somehow balance the  budget by abolishing all subventions to Moscow for it to perform  its functions as the capital. Just what kind of sense does it  make to try to make ends meet in the budget by ignoring all  expenditures which the state is committed to make both in the  regions and in the capital? Or do the functionaries from the  Ministry of Finance want very much to impress the State Duma?    And the last thing, the food supply of Moscow. Without  relying on anyone, the capital's government and its appropriate  departments established close contacts with many Russian regions  and foreign firms, so that the food situation last year was  calm, just as, we hope, it will be this year.    In short, the course of the Moscow government is the same:  to  develop the market, bolster social protection of Muscovites,  stabilize industry, and augment construction of contemporary  housing while providing free housing to people on the waiting  lists on a mandatory basis.</p>

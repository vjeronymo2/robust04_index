			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Brussels moves on air control THE European Commission yesterday restarted the process of nudging EC member states towards a single air traffic control system and relieving congestion in the skies. Commissioners adopted legislation aimed at harmonising and integrating air traffic control equipment in Europe's 54 control centres. The centres currently use 31 different and incompatible technical systems and 70 different computer languages. Under the Commission's plans, new surveillance, navigation and communication systems would have to conform to a single set of standards developed by Eurocontrol, the 14-nation air traffic control organisation based in Brussels. The Commission has already tried once to persuade member states to harmonise the complex European system. Three directives were produced in 1988, with broadly the same aim, but they were rejected by EC ministers keen to protect sovereignty over their own airspace. Now, according to Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC transport commissioner, the time is ripe for a new effort. 'Little by little, the member states have begun to change their minds,' he said yesterday. 'They now recognise that the Community has an important role to play.' In March, transport ministers from the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) outlined a plan to improve the air traffic control system, and last week European airlines called on the European authorities to act quickly to relieve congestion. But Mr Van Miert made clear yesterday that progress would be gradual and that this directive was only the first step. Delays and cancellations have now become a notorious feature of air travel in Europe, particularly in the summer.</p>

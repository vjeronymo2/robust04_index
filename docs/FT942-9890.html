			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Whitehall shake-up urged for jobs A Whitehall department should be set up to replace the employment and education departments as part of a package of measures to focus education more towards the job market, a report published by a Conservative pressure group said yesterday. The Tory Reform Group paper includes proposals to relaunch the training and enterprise councils in England and Wales - the employer-led bodies which deliver government training schemes. It recommends almost halving the number of Tecs from 75 to 40 and allowing them to replace local education authorities as a source of support for schools. Mr Julian Ayer, author of the paper, said: 'The idea is not to amalgamate the employment and education departments but to let them wither gradually after the formation of this new department.' The other aim of the proposals was to stop the growth of an 'underclass' and create a skilled workforce up to world standards. Mr Ayer said that 20 per cent of the labour force was permanently excluded from work or functionally illiterate and employed in low-skilled jobs which were disappearing. The new Whitehall department, he said, would take in the minister for sport from the National Heritage Department and the prison education service. The Commons trade and industry committee recently suggested that the employment department's responsibilities should be transferred to the trade department. The Tecs, Mr Ayer said, had been given insufficient power to deliver the local training and employment links hoped for when they were established in 1990.</p>

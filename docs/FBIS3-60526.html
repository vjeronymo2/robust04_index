Channa Reddy, has said.    Addressing representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations  and the core group on AIDS control formed by the Tamil Nadu Dr  MGR Medical University at Raj Bhavan today, he said awareness  programmes alone were not enough. They had to be supported by  concerted action from the people. All sections of society had to  be mobilized in a systematic manner to tackle the spread of the  disease.    Universities had a pivotal role to play in the awareness  programmes. The blueprint prepared by the medical University  could serve to coordinate the work of NGOs and other  organizations involved in the field and could cut down  expenditure.    The time limit fixed for awareness programmes should be long  enough for organizations working in the field to bring about the  desired behavioural changes in the individual, Dr Reddi said.  Awareness activities in a particular locality could be for a  period of three years as NGOs then would have time to draw up  their plans and execute them in a better manner.    The Additional Project Director (Technical), National AIDS  Control Organisation (NACO), Dr Shiv Lal, said the blueprint  prepared by the Medical University was well within the national  strategy for AIDS control. The University could supplement the  efforts of State-level organisations.  <H5>  459 full blown AIDS cases </H5>   Of the 19 lakh blood samples screened throughout the country  by NACO till September, about 13,200 were found to be HIV  positive. In about 70 per cent of cases, the transmission was  through the sexual mode, according to studies. There were 459  full blown AIDS cases in the country; of this 152 were reported  from Tamil Nadu. The figures were based on screening blood  samples from among the urban population. The estimated HIV  prevalence in the country, including the rural population, would  be nearly one million. According to the Planning Commission,  migrant labour constituted about 30 per cent of the urban labour  force. This group was vulnerable to the disease and efforts had  to be made on a large scale to educate them.    The Union Government would spend Rs. 222 crores over a  five-year period on AIDS awareness and related projects. 35 per  cent of the outlay was earmarked for the  Information-Education-Communication (IEC) programmes, 30 per  cent for blood safety projects and 10 per cent for Sexually  Transmitted Diseases control and surveillance programmes.</p>

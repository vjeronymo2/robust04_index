			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Warning on smog too late Sir, Michael Skapinker's article, 'Motorists warned over summer smog' (July 4), noted that commuters were asked by the Department of the Environment to avoid using cars last Monday. As a commuter, I heard nothing of this until I read your article - then it was too late. But are such government requests a viable answer to the problem? I think not. The solution can only lie in positive actions by the authorities to reduce the number of vehicles entering urban areas and to limit emissions from individual vehicles by spot testing at the roadside. Ill-timed appeals to commuters to abandon their cars only demonstrate the government's reluctance to face the problem. Jack E Felt, 26 Halford Road, Richmond, Surrey</p>

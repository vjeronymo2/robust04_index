			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDISTRICTING DELAYED INDEFINITELY BY COURT;  </P> <P> COUNTY GOVERNMENT: PANEL OF FEDERAL APPEALS JUDGES PUTS ELECTION FOR 1ST  DISTRICT SUPERVISOR ON HOLD.  </P> <P> A federal appeals court on Thursday indefinitely blocked a dramatic  reapportionment of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and postponed  the November election to replace incumbent Supervisor Pete Schabarum.  </P> <P> In deciding to extend a stay they issued last week, the three-judge panel of  the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the historic voting rights  case raises "difficult and close legal questions" and that the status quo  should remain pending the outcome of appeals.  </P> <P> A U.S. District Court earlier this month had found that the Board of  Supervisors intentionally discriminated against Latinos in the drawing of  district boundaries. The lower court threw out the results of the June primary  election, drew new district lines to create a Latino-majority district and set  a special election for November.  </P> <P> But the appeals court last week temporarily stayed the District Court decision  and, after hearing oral arguments Thursday morning, the appeals court  indefinitely extended its stay.  </P> <P> Latino groups, who brought the suit and were backed by the U.S. Justice  Department, had expected that the court-ordered reapportionment would lead to  the election of the first Latino supervisor in county history. The supervisors  bitterly criticized the reapportionment and had appealed the District Court  decision.  </P> <P> The 2-1 appeals court ruling was seen as a surprise by all parties and angered  the winners of the June primary election in the 1st District who had hoped to  meet in a November runoff.  </P> <P> The appeals court ordered that there be neither a runoff between June primary  victors Sarah Flores and Gregory O'Brien, nor a special election in a redrawn  1st District in November.  </P> <P> "Rather the equities favor maintaining the status quo" pending the outcome of  the county's appeal, wrote Judges Robert R. Beezer and Alex Kozinski.  "Accordingly, the county shall hold no election for supervisor, District 1,  pending further order of this court."  </P> <P> Judge Dorothy Nelson dissented, saying she would have denied the county's stay  request.  </P> <P> The court will hear arguments on the county's appeal in October and could rule  any time after that.  </P> <P> County attorney John McDermott said, "I'm thrilled. Our primary concern was  that there not be irreversible change in the status quo until the merits of the  case could be reviewed. . . . We would have preferred that the Sarah Flores  election go forward, but this is a middle ground that is fair" to all parties.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who attended the hearing, called the ruling a  "mixed blessing." He said he is encouraged by the tone of the judges who  appeared to have a better understanding of what's at stake for voters than the  district court judge, who he accused of "ideological manipulation" of the  electoral process.  </P> <P> Supervisor Schabarum said he thought the ruling is appropriate, adding, "It  appears to me the appellate court is attempting to sort out the extraordinary  mischief" done in the district court.  </P> <P> Richard Fajardo, an attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and  Educational Fund, a plaintiff, said he is considering seeking a review of the  decision by a larger, 11-judge panel of the 9th Circuit or appealing to Supreme  Court Justice Sandra Day O'Conner.  </P> <P> "It seems as if they spread the benefits and the hurt around," he said.  </P> <P> John R. Dunne, assistant attorney general for civil rights, made a rare trip  from Washington to argue for a new primary in November in a redrawn 1st  District. Supervisor Deane Dana also attended the hearing, as did Flores.  </P> <P> Dunne urged the judges to allow a November election in the new, predominantly  Latino district to remedy the "egregious wrong that has been suffered by the  Hispanic community so long."  </P> <P> Attorneys for the Board of Supervisors had asked the appeals court to allow the  Flores-O'Brien runoff to proceed and to stay implementation of a redistricting  plan pending the outcome of the county's appeal of the lower court ruling that  reapportioned the district.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon approved the redistricting plan on Aug. 3,  finding that the Board of Supervisors had diluted Latino voting power by  splitting the community among three supervisorial districts.  </P> <P> If the reapportionment is upheld, Latinos would comprise 51% of the voters and  71% of the population in the new 1st District. Latinos now comprise 25% of the  voters in the district, while 49% of its population is Latino.  </P> <P> The possibility of indefinitely postponing the November election was raised for  the first time by Judge Kozinski from the bench Thursday.  </P> <P> Kozinski suggested that holding no election until the appeal is decided would  prevent candidates from wasting time and money to win an election that could be  nullified.  </P> <P> Flores called the ruling "shocking and deeply disappointing" but vowed to run  no matter when an election is held.  </P> <P> O'Brien said the ruling was "disturbingly ambiguous. . . . It doesn't give  anybody enough to go on."  </P> <P> "They only cancel elections in places like Nicaragua," said O'Brien.  </P> <P> Until he gets a clarification and some idea of when an election might be held,  O'Brien said he will continue his campaign. "I'll be back in the (campaign)  office tomorrow, and I expect everyone else to be here too."  </P> <P> McDermott said the ruling, if upheld, would allow Schabarum, who has said he  plans to retire at the end of his term on Dec. 3, to stay in office until a  successor could be appointed or elected. If Schabarum resigned, his seat could  remain vacant or the governor could appoint a successor who would serve until  an election could be held.  </P> <P> Supervisor Schabarum, who hinted last week that he might run in the new  district, would only say, "I'm on until replaced."  </P> <P> Supervisor Deane Dana said, "I would hope Mr. Schabarum would retire and allow  the governor to make an appointment, but I don't think (Schabarum) will." Dana  said he is certain that Governor George Deukmejian would appoint Flores to fill  any unexpired term.  </P> <P> McDermott said a date for the election to choose Schabarum's successor would  depend on how long it takes the appeals court to decide on the county's appeal.  "It is hard to predict how long it will take to get an opinion out," McDermott  said. "It could be three or four months."  </P> <P> McDermott had argued that it is too late to prepare for a November election in  a new district without jeopardizing the entire November election, including  balloting for governor.  </P> <P> He urged the judges to resolve the legal questions raised by the historic case  "before you interfere in the local electoral process" and let Flores meet  O'Brien.  </P> <P> Thomas Bourke, an attorney for Flores, argued that it would be unfair to call  off the November runoff when Flores stands a chance of becoming the first  Latina and the first woman elected to the board.  </P> <P> "Now, after she has mortgaged her house to run, after she mobilized $400,000 of  support and successfully ran the primary race through completion, she is told  to start over," Bourke said.  </P> <P> O'Brien too said that he must soon make a decision about continuing with the  campaign or going back to work. "At some point my resources will be tapped  out," said O'Brien who has taken a leave of absence from his Superior Court  post to run for supervisor.  </P> <P> In papers filed with the appeals court, the Justice Department had talked about  that problem: "Clearly, both candidates ran this year knowing full well that  the 1981 redistricting plan was under legal attack and could be invalidated. .  . . The inconvenience to these two individuals is hardly harm sufficient to  forestall the long-overdue grant of constitutionally protected voting rights to  citizens of Los Angeles County."  </P></p>

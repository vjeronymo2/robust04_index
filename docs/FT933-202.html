			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Roads spending to focus on upgrades NEW motorway routes through greenfield sites are largely 'a thing of the past', Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told a Freight Transport Association conference yesterday. The government's roadbuilding programme was now largely concentrating on new bypasses and improvements to the existing motorway and trunk road network, he added. 'Our efforts are focused on getting the best from our broadly-completed motorway network by widening and improving the roads that are already there, and investing in technical improvements to help use it as efficiently as possible.' This reassurance came as the British Road Federation, which represents road users, warned that any cuts in the roads budget could threaten 66,000 jobs. The federation says 68 road schemes planned to start between April next year and December 1995 depend on government funding due to be announced in the November Budget.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BY HURTING BUSINESS, EPA DRIVING JOBS OUT OF STATE  </P> <P> In response to the eco-hype in the media:  </P> <P> I've heard nothing but "Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day," and my ears are  becoming numb from all the shouting, and my eyes are growing weary from reading  about it in all the newspapers.  </P> <P> The crackdown on California businesses by the Environmental Protection Agency  concerns me; who are these guys anyway? They are crippling California's  industries with every gnaw and tear of their ever-multiplying inhibitive laws,  causing many businesses to relocate out of state.  </P> <P> What is going to happen to our economy from all this?  </P> <P> I'm all for recycling, water conservation and such to a reasonable degree, but  don't you think the EPA is getting a little too overpowering?  </P> <P> KELLI RADCLIFFE, Lakewood  </P></p>

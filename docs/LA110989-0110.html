			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL CARE SPRAYS CURBED IN SMOG FIGHT  </P> <P> In a dramatic new turn in the war on smog, the state Air Resources Board  imposed unprecedented restrictions Wednesday on antiperspirant and deodorant  aerosol sprays that could result in a ban on products that fail to meet the  standards within five years.  </P> <P> The action marked the first time ever that personal care products have been  regulated because of their impact on smog. In the mid-1970s, the federal  government banned some chemicals in certain aerosol products, but that was  because they contributed to the destruction of the paper-thin stratospheric  ozone layer that protects Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.  </P> <P> While the rule approved here Wednesday would eliminate only a small percentage  of smog-forming chemical emissions, the 6-2 vote could foreshadow air pollution  controls on a wide variety of other personal care and consumer products from  hair sprays to barbecue lighter fluids.  </P> <P> "There is more at stake today than just (deodorants)," ARB Executive Officer  James Boyd told the board. ARB Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless called the decision  a "landmark action."  </P> <P> "It really gets down to impacts that people themselves are going to notice and  going to feel," she said.  </P> <P> Aerosol antiperspirants and deodorants -- which account for 25% of product  sales -- spew up to five tons a day of smog-causing volatile organic chemicals  into the atmosphere statewide -- an amount equivalent to the emissions from a  typical oil refinery. About half of those emissions occur in the four-county  South Coast Air Basin, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San  Bernardino.  </P> <P> Under terms of the new regulation, which will take effect early next year,  manufacturers of aerosol spray deodorants and antiperspirants have until 1992  to reduce overall emissions from their products by 20%. By 1995, those  emissions will have to be reduced by 80%.  </P> <P> However, manufacturers that submit an acceptable compliance plan in 1994 may be  given until 1999 to meet that goal. If they fail to submit a plan, they must  meet the 1995 deadline or remove the product from California's lucrative  market.  </P> <P> The rule also prohibits using substitutes that would contribute to the  depletion of the ozone layer.  </P> <P> In all, consumer and personal care products account for 250 tons a day in  emissions of volatile organic compounds in California -- about half of them in  the four-county basin.  </P> <P> The ARB vote marks a dramatic departure in the state's decades-long war on  smog, which until now has concentrated on reducing emissions from motor  vehicles and industrial sources.  </P> <P> The ARB staff estimated the aerosol regulation will add 25 cents to 50 cents to  the cost of a product. Industry spokesmen, however, placed the cost between 31  cents and $2.36 per can. They said 46 million cans of aerosol deodorants and  antiperspirants are sold each year in California.  </P> <P> Manufacturers were uncertain of the impact of the regulation.  </P> <P> "Their (the ARB's) intention is to ban aerosols. This is step No. 1. The only  reason they aren't putting an outright ban is because there would be a hundred  lawsuits," said George C. Dietrich, president of Diversified CPC International,  an Illinois manufacturer.  </P> <P> Dietrich, who said his company is the largest producer of aerosol propellants  in the world, contended he could be forced to close his Anaheim plant, which  produces propellants for the California market.  </P> <P> "Should that market shift to any degree, we very well could remove that plant  and its employees. This is not to be taken as a threat. It is a business  decision," Dietrich told the board.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meeting the Timetable  </P> <P> Ralph Engel of the Chemical Speciality Manufacturers Assn., said he could not  yet say if his industry could meet the timetable. "I hope so," he said.  </P> <P> Earlier, a string of industry representatives had appeared before the ARB to  challenge the need for the rule, arguing that it would cost millions of dollars  for little or no improvement in air quality.  </P> <P> "We believe the emission reduction is so small that it doesn't warrant this  kind of treatment," Engel said.  </P> <P> But Jennifer Jennings, legal affairs director for the Planning and Conservation  League, urged the board to impose tough limits.  </P> <P> "We're talking about a product form that is environmentally damaging, which is  not needed for health and safety . . ." she said.  </P> <P> The rule finally adopted by the ARB was even tougher than the recommendation of  the board's own staff.  </P> <P> Board members, all of whom are appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian, called for  earlier compliance deadlines than the staff had recommended. "These products  are totally replaceable. . . . This is a good place to take some sort of a  stand to reduce (smog)," said board member Gene Boston.  </P> <P> Brian Bilbray, a San Diego County supervisor recently named to the board,  challenged suggestions that aerosols were needed so that consumers could have a  choice in products.  </P> <P> "I have a problem with a choice that pollutes more," Bilbray declared. "I have  a major problem subsidizing that choice with an (adverse) environmental  impact," he said.  </P> <P> The ARB regulation is aimed primarily at volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such  as butane, propane and iso-butane, which all contribute to smog.  </P> <P> About 30% of the aerosol emissions, about 75 tons a year, come from an array of  personal care products.  </P> <P> In addition to the 25% of Californians who buy their deodorants and  antiperspirants in pressurized aerosol spray cans, another 41% buy sticks, 29%  roll-ons, and 5% buy pumps or other forms.  </P> <P> Manufacturers were expected to have little difficulty meeting the initial 20%  reduction in smog-causing emissions by 1992. But achieving an 80% reduction  from 1989 levels by 1995 poses a more complicated problem.  </P> <P> The ARB staff conceded that work will be required to develop substitutes that  neither contribute to smog, global warming or depletion of the ozone layer.  </P> <P> The new regulation is not aimed primarily at the formula of the product but the  propellant that pushes it out of the pressurized can. Propellants account for  about 80% of the smog-forming emissions.  </P> <P> Each time a product is used, these pollutants are released into the atmosphere  where they contribute to the formation of smog, the state's largest health  hazard in the lower atmosphere.  </P> <P> Smog is formed when the VOCs react with oxides of nitrogen in the presence of  sunlight. Health studies have found that ozone pollution, which makes up 95% of  smog, is responsible for respiratory illness, reduced lung capacity as well as  damage to trees, crops, and building materials.  </P></p>

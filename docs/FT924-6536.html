			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Technology: Japanese blades at the cutting edge Razor maker Wilkinson Sword has turned to Japanese steel technology to give Europe's shavers a safer shave. The dual blade on its Protector shaving system uses non-corrosive steel which is especially hard to ensure that the blade retains its cutting edge. To make sure the blades do not nick the skin, 10 filaments of wire straddle the blades. Wilkinson Sword: Germany, 212 405 230; UK, 0670 713421.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Indro Montanelli: "Chaos, as Expected"] </F>   [Text] Of course, the few words that have been written (at  11 o'clock in the evening) are based on elements that are more  of a horoscope than news. The horoscope refers to a widespread  victory of the Right, or rather the three formations that form  the Right only because they are set against the Left. In this  case, the great defeated one is not Achille Occhetto [secretary  of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] but the center, which  Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI]  had hoped to turn into a force capable of influencing the other  two by being essential to the formation of a majority. Instead  the tri-part "front," as it seems, can make it alone. And  perhaps this is better. Therefore, we will finally see what  this facsimile of the Right is and what its men are worth.    This will immediately give us an appraisal of them if, even  without the absolute majority of the proportional representation  votes but at least the majority of the seats, they can create a  parliamentary majority finally capable of providing a stable  government. Only on this premise can we speak of a Second  Republic. If this premise is lacking, as [Northern League  Secretary] Umberto Bossi's broadsides against [National Alliance  Secretary] Gianfranco Fini appear to foreshadow, this will mean  that we are still in the First Republic: the republic of  transformism and under-the-table maneuvers, and therefore the  republic of frail majorities and paralytic governments that are  based on the market of indulgence toward friends and the  "exchanging of votes" with enemies.    But let us not make any forecasts on the final results that  could still hold some surprises. For the time being let us  limit ourselves to making two simple observations: The first is  the decrease in the percentage of voters despite the extension  of the voting period. We think that this can be attributed to  an election campaign that was based almost exclusively on  reciprocal accusations and defamations; that instead of throwing  light, threw dark upon the minds of the voters, and dissuaded  many who were at a loss and did not know where to turn. The  second is the increase in invalid voting slips. This is the  unavoidable outcome of the confusion created by an electoral  system that was prepared precisely with the intention of  creating confusion. When we foresaw this, they contradicted us.  But LA VOCE was right.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Heathrow tunnel collapse findings due next week Preliminary findings of an inquiry into the collapse of a tunnel under construction at Heathrow airport are expected to be announced early next week, the airport operator BAA said yesterday. The outcome could have significant financial implications for other large transport projects using the new Austrian tunnelling method involved in the collapse at one of two underground stations being built at Heathrow. Work has halted on both stations which will form part of a Pounds 300m rail link between the airport and Paddington station in central London. The existing Terminal Four station on the London Underground remained closed yesterday for safety checks. BAA hopes to reopen it in 10 days. Construction has also stopped at two other London Underground stations, at London Bridge and Waterloo in south London, part of the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee underground line extension. All four stations were using the new Austrian tunnelling method. London Bridge station alone is expected to cost Pounds 76m. This price could rise sharply if it was decided that a more expensive tunnelling technique was required. Waterloo station is part of a Pounds 157m contract which includes constructing a rail tunnel between Green Park and Waterloo and building a new station at Westminster. Only Waterloo station is using the new Austrian method. This technique allows tunnels to be excavated by conventional diggers, rather than by expensive tunnel-boring machines. The walls of the tunnel are then covered with a steel mesh before being sprayed with fast-drying concrete. Two inquiries have been launched into the tunnel collapse. The first of these led by Mr David Williams, BAA technical director, is due to announce its preliminary finding next week. A second inquiry by the Health and Safety Executive will also investigate 'the broader implications for the use of the new Austrian tunnelling method'. It is expected to examine whether the technique, developed for rocky ground, is suitable for soft London clay where it is being used for the first time on a large scale on the Heathrow and Jubilee stations. Questions were raised previously about the suitability of the new method for different ground conditions following the collapse of a tunnel in Munich in September resulting in the death of three people. Engineers investigating the Heathrow collapse will have to consider whether ground conditions were at fault or if design flaws or faulty workmanship caused the failure. BAA and London Underground stressed yesterday that work had halted on only a small part of the Heathrow Express and Jubilee Line projects. More than 3,000 cu m of concrete have been poured into the collapsed tunnel sections to stabilise the ground. Still to be determined is the extent of any construction delay and the effect on the cost of two of Britain's biggest transport projects.</p>

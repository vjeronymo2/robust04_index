			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: North Peko eyes Chile copper NORTH Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining group, has joined with Sociedad Minera Pudahuel (SMP), the Chilean copper producer, to evaluate the El Abra copper prospect in Chile. North is the second Australian company to participate in a joint evaluation of El Abra, offered for tender by Codelco, Chile's state-controlled mining company. About 20 international companies are believed to have registered an interest. In June, BHP, which already operates the Escondida copper mine in Chile, announced it would join with Magma Copper, the US miner, to consider a tender for El Abra. North directors indicated yesterday the company would manage the joint evaluation with a view to lodging a tender by September 20. If successful, SMP, which has experience in leaching copper ores for the solvent extraction process, would have an option to purchase a 5 per cent stake. 'North sees this as a first step in pursuing its long-term strategy in Chile,' directors said. The company has had a team evaluating business opportunities in Chile for about two years. Codelco has indicated it wishes to maintain a significant, but probably no-controlling, interest in El Abra, a relatively low-grade oxide and sulphide copper resource. The prospect was considered uneconomic before the introduction of oxide leaching/solvent extraction technology.</p>

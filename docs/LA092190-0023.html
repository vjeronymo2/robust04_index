			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCKEON, HIS FUTURE SHAKY, TO DELIVER SPEECH TO OWNER  </P> <P> Jack McKeon, Padre vice president/baseball operations, has prepared an  elaborate speech and will address his precarious position at noon today in a  meeting with team chairman Tom Werner.  </P> <P> Sources said McKeon plans to leave the organizational meeting knowing whether  the Padre ownership will retain him or fire him once they find a successor.  </P> <P> "I really don't know what's going to happen in the meeting," McKeon said  Thursday, "but I would think it would come up."  </P> <P> The meeting, scheduled four weeks ago, was designed to discuss the budget and  the club's direction. Yet, with swirling speculation surrounding McKeon's  future, and the club openly interviewing candidates for his job, McKeon intends  to find out if he is wanted.  </P> <P> The Padre ownership group surreptitiously has hired Tal Smith as a consultant  to conduct the front-office interviews. His services originally were sought by  the new ownership group to appraise the club's value, but he was retained when  the Padres decided that they wanted an independent party to recommend  candidates for possible vacancies in the front office. Smith, who will attend  today's meeting, had worked for the Padres for about seven years as a  consultant, but was fired during the winter.  </P> <P> McKeon, who has one more year on his contract that will pay him $400,000, was  toying with the idea of issuing an ultimatum, friends said, but decided that a  speech would be the best approach, and has been preparing it for three days.  </P> <P> In his speech, according to sources, McKeon will review his accomplishments in  his 10 years with the Padre organization, talk about the direction of the club,  and close by asking if the ownership wants him to be part of the future.  </P> <P> It's unknown just how Werner will respond.  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / BT plans to cut costs in rural areas British Telecommunications is extending its use of wireless technology to cut network costs in rural areas. BT has signed a contract with DSC, a US telecomm-unications equipment supplier, for a wireless system to replace traditional copper wires in some rural areas. The move reflects the increasing attraction of radio systems as a replacement for fixed-wire networks at local level. Ionica, a private Cambridge-based company, is piloting a system in East Anglia which it plans to introduce nationally. Mercury, BT's main UK competitor, is engaged in radio experiments. It views the technology as vital to bypassing BT's local network to carry its calls, and predicts that within a few years 'millions' of subscribers will be accessing its long-distance network through local radio systems. DSC's digital radio system, Airspan, will allow BT to carry its full range of services now carried over fixed lines with no reduction in quality. A transmitter-receiver, less than one foot square, will be located at subscribers' premises. The system has a range of 12 miles. Until recently, radio technology in the telecoms industry was largely restricted to paging and cellular mobile services. Suppliers are seeking to exploit its potential, particularly in developing countries and sparsely-populated areas.</p>

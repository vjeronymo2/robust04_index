			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / French growth may give poll boost to Balladur France is set to enter its 1995 presidential election year with its economy already expanding at the pace of 3.1 per cent forecast by the government for the full year. Insee, the official statistics agency, yesterday raised its growth forecast for 1994 from 2.0 per cent to 2.2 per cent and said that by the end of 1994 it expected the economy to be expanding on a year-on-year basis at the rate of 3.1 per cent. The government has already predicated its 1995 budget on real growth of 3.1 per cent, but set this as the average for the whole year, rather than the initial momentum with which the French economy would go into 1995. The growth forecast of Insee, which also said that despite August's slight increase in unemployment it expected to see a modest fall in joblessness over 1994 as a whole, comes as welcome news for the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, in his as-yet-undeclared candidacy for the presidential elections in May. His advisers have recognised a certain risk that the necessity for fiscal discipline to reduce the 1995 budget deficit, plus the recent rise in long term interest rates, might choke off recovery in the French economy. It grew by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter and by 1 per cent in the second quarter. Insee now forecasts 1.4 per cent real growth in the second half of this year, and it believes that French companies have enough cash in hand not to deterred by the rise in long-term interest rates from pursuing their investment plans. Even if, as Insee expects, there is a 'technical slowdown' in French industrial output after the first half's strong growth throughout Europe, it will be limited and amply offset by strong consumer demand. The agency comments that the main surprise has been the continuation of strong car sales after various government incentives earlier this year lapsed. Overall, it forecasts household consumption rising 1.7 per cent in the second half of this year, following the 0.5 per cent increase between January and June. Insee said that the contribution of foreign trade to French growth may soon turn 'negative', as internal demand boosts imports faster than the growth in exports. But the government, which yesterday announced a FFr7.2bn trade surplus for August (up from FFr4.8bn in July), said it was still aiming for a 1994 surplus of around FFr80bn.</p>

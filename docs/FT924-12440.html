			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Peru set to quit rights treaty PERU took the first steps yesterday towards withdrawing from the San Jose Convention, the principal treaty governing human rights in Latin America. The move is designed to pave the way for introduction of the death penalty for convicted terrorists, a sanction prohibited by the convention. Mr Oscar de la Puente Raygada, the prime minister and foreign affairs minister, said Peru 'is confronting an exceptional situation' with regard to the actions of guerrilla groups. The government would prefer to renounce the death penalty clause alone, but if the Organisation of American States were to rule this out Peru would withdraw from the treaty in its entirety, he said. President Alberto Fujimori, who has already established summary trial procedures by secret military court for those accused of terrorism, will seek to short-circuit the relatively prolonged period normally involved in withdrawing from international treaties. Meanwhile, round-ups of Sendero militants are continuing in the capital on an almost daily basis. However, counter-terrorist police chief General Ketin Vidal denied earlier rumours that Mr Oscar Ramirez Durand, tipped to succeed Mr Guzman as leader of Sendero, was among a group of nine key figures arrested at the weekend.</p>

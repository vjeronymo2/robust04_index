			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Europe will be 'richest market in the world' EUROPE will eventually become the richest market in the world with enough clout to demand changes in the American legal and regulatory system, according to a US Chamber of Commerce report. 'A single EC banking market provides Europeans with the leverage to seek changes in the more restrictive US financial services market,' the report says. 'Similar activity has already occurred in other areas, including public procurement and product standards.' Although the single market will be 'a good deal' for US business overall, the future is fraught with dangers of trade and economic conflict. The report, released last month, says the looming failure of the EC to meet its December 31 1992 deadlines, particularly with regard to technical product standards, means US business will be unable to benefit from 'one of the most touted benefits of the internal market programme'. Implementation and compliance with EC legislation by the individual governments 'remains the Achilles' heel' of the exercise. Only 36 of the 134 measures requiring national implementation by the end of next August have been approved by national legislatures. 'The EC countries have been particularly negligent in implementing environmental and agricultural legislation,' the report says. Furthermore the social action programme could force US companies in Europe 'to conform to onerous labour legislation, increase the cost of doing business in the EC and reduce a company's flexibility in management decision-making.' In future the US and EC will compete as 'super economic blocs' without the Cold War to unite them. The Chamber fears for increased bilateral tension if the EC pours subsidies into 'national champions' and 'sensitive sectors' like autos, electronics and steel, and 'America First' attitudes give rise to restrictive US legislation'.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Pained Senate weighs harassment charges FOR the second day running Senator Bob Packwood, the Republican from Oregon, yesterday tried to persuade his colleagues in the Senate to accept a compromise whereby he would hand over some, but not all, of his possibly incriminating private diaries. The Senate ethics committee is seeking approval for a subpoena for all the diaries, dating back to 1969, as part of its investigation into charges that Mr Packwood sexually harassed more than 25 women. Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada, Democratic chairman of the committee, announced last week that extracts perused so far suggested Mr Packwood may also have engaged in other improper but unspecified activities. Mr Packwood's compromise would make available all the diaries relevant to the harassment accusations and to the additional charge, reported in an Oregon newspaper over the weekend, that he tried to persuade lobbyists to hire his former wife. The rest would be turned over to an independent arbiter who would pass on what he considered relevant. Far more notable than the substance of Mr Packwood's offers has been the intense embarrassment, even pain, that his performance on the Senate floor has caused his saddened and grim colleagues. Leaping constantly to his feet to interject, sometimes incoherently and contradictorily, he has given the appearance of a man at the end of his emotional tether. Privately many wish Mr Packwood would simply resign and go away, or that the voters of Oregon would try to recall him. But in a long political career as a quintessential Republican moderate, the senator has always been known as a man to fight his corner, be it politically or personally. He was narrowly returned to a fifth six-year term a year ago. Shortly thereafter the Washington Post published details of the sexual harassment accusations against him. Mr Packwood initially blamed his problems on alcohol but has shown no signs of resigning his seat. In fighting back he has intimated knowledge of extra-marital affairs by other members of Congress. There has been some sympathy for his contention that the ethics committee staff should not be given licence to 'rummage through' his personal papers and some criticism of Mr Bryan for having spoken of possible criminal charges. But the sentiment of the Senate seems clearly behind its own ethics committee and its arguments for a subpoena. Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Maryland Democrat and a committee member, maintained with some force that 'we are not the committee on voyeurism'. Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat, also reminded colleagues that sexual harassment charges against a sitting senator were not to be taken lightly, especially after the embarrassing spectacle of the Senate's grilling of Professor Anita Hill two years ago during the hearings on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SUDDENLY, I SAW GOD SMILING';  </P> <P> FAITH: WHAT DO CHILDREN BELIEVE IN? DR. ROBERT COLES, WHO HAS SPENT 30 YEARS  TALKING TO KIDS ALL OVER THE WORLD, HAS FOUND A PERVASIVE SENSE OF  SPIRITUALITY.  </P> <P> In nearby Lawrence, Robert Coles asked a fourth-grader if God ever gets tired.  </P> <P> Quickly, and with animation, the child responded, "Maybe He does and maybe He  doesn't," then added, "He's God, so He can't get tired."  </P> <P> In Stockholm, Sweden, a 10-year-old boy told Coles he couldn't draw Jesus with  the crayons offered to him. "The Lord is everyone's, so He's not white and He's  not brown or black. He's all the skin colors and the eye colors. It's hard to  imagine Him; that's why I'll just use a pencil."  </P> <P> And nearly 30 years ago, an 8-year-old black girl in North Carolina explained  to Coles how she stayed calm in the face of hostility from segregationists. "I  was all alone, and those people were screaming, and suddenly I saw God smiling,  and I smiled," she said.  </P> <P> Though he had heard many such remarks over the years, Coles only recently  pondered their significance. A Harvard-trained pediatrician and child  psychoanalyst, Coles spent more than 30 years working with children and writing  about them. "The Spiritual Life of Children" (Houghton Mifflin, $22.95) is the  eighth and last of Coles' Pulitzer Prize-winning "Children of Crisis" series.  </P> <P> His more than 50 books have looked at children caught in the racial struggle;  children of migrant workers; children and drugs, and children of poverty and  privilege.  </P> <P> More recently, traveling around the United States and around the world, Coles  has examined the moral and political lives of children. But the spiritual lives  of young people came last, the culmination of these three decades of writings.  </P> <P> The medical profession "tends to regard religion with a great deal of  scrutiny," Coles, 61, explains. "I had to come to terms with that."  </P> <P> On the other hand, because Coles tends to scrutinize his own profession, his  willingness to part with medicine's resistance to spirituality is easy to  understand.  </P> <P> Coles boasts that he does not work in a hospital, has never been in private  practice and has never sent a bill for his medical services. Trained in  pediatrics and child psychiatry, he describes himself as a maverick physician,  a rebel who shuns white coat and tie -- one who, for that matter, shuns any  coat and tie.  </P> <P> Instead, he spends most of his time interviewing children and writing about  them. During his travels, Coles says, he sometimes encounters children who need  medical attention. He often diagnoses them, and sometimes has seen them to a  hospital.  </P> <P> Coles took a literary route to medicine. As an undergraduate at Harvard, an  adviser suggested he take a look at the writings of William Carlos Williams,  the physician-turned-poet. Coles became so enamored of Williams that he wrote  his senior thesis about him and sent it to him, and as a result met Williams.  </P> <P> It was 1950, Coles remembered, and "William Carlos Williams was not what he is  now. He was rebellious. He wasn't tolerated by the literary establishment."  </P> <P> Williams became Coles' model and mentor. The older man took Coles to meet his  patients in Paterson, N.J. Coles went with Williams from house to house,  treating children who otherwise could not have afforded medical attention.  </P> <P> Without the influence of Williams, "I probably would have been a high school  English teacher," Coles said. Instead, he went to Harvard Medical School.  </P> <P> As he began the practice of medicine, Coles continued to turn to Williams for  guidance. His first book, "Children of Crisis I: A Study of Courage and Fear,"  stemmed from his observations as an Air Force physician in the deep South in  1960, when the rocky process of school desegregation was under way. Coles  conducted long conversations with black and white children, and with their  parents, who were involved in desegregating the schools.  </P> <P> When he began to write up his research, Coles said William Carlos Williams was  "the one who told me to listen to the children, and to write for the ordinary  reader." Coles said he still follows Williams' counsel to try "to find the  poetry in everyday expression."  </P> <P> But this advice flew in the face of "what a traditional psychiatric researcher  is trained to do," Coles said. "Extract, abstract."  </P> <P> Instead of setting himself up as a traditional child psychiatrist, Coles set  himself up as a "field worker." He thought he would learn from children by  learning to talk to them.  </P> <P> "I sit in the kitchen and drink Coca-Colas and draw pictures with them," Coles  said.  </P> <P> In recent years, Coles has tried new approaches. He has taught art history to  fourth-grade students in working-class Lawrence, Mass., and in a public school  in Cambridge, Mass.  </P> <P> With a laugh he confirms that he also teaches morals and ethics at Harvard --  in the medical school, the law school and the business school. "I teach at  Harvard," Coles said, smiling. "But I also teach elementary school."  </P> <P> Officially, Coles began doing the "Spiritual Life" research in the mid-1980s.  But when he went back through years of transcripts of interviews with children  around the world, he found a consistent theme of spirituality.  </P> <P> "I've learned so much from these children about the way they integrate their  spiritual lives with their everyday lives -- their academic lives, even their  athletic lives," he said.  </P> <P> A young Islamic Pakistani boy living in England applied his faith in Allah to  his desire to become an airline pilot. Asif, nearly 12, said that if he was  piloting a plane, "I'd know that I'm nearer to Him than I'd be if I wasn't up  there flying. I'd look at the sky; at night, I'd look at the stars. I'd think  of Him. He must walk from star to star."  </P> <P> Thirteen-year-old Avram of Brookline, Mass., was preparing for his bar mitzvah  when Coles talked to him about God. Avram was also studying for two big tests,  one in math and one in history. The Jewish child told Coles that God "really  takes an interest in us, and He really hopes for the best -- that our lives  will work out well. He's not a magician. He gave us our freedom. It's up to us.  But He didn't walk away after he let us be on our own."  </P> <P> An 8-year-old girl, Connie, whom Coles treated in Boston, stunned him with her  comfortable spirituality. "I see Jesus smiling when everyone else is looking  real mean, even me," Connie told Coles.  </P> <P> Coles also learned from the children that, "You don't have to believe in God to  have a spiritual life. A lot of kids who have been avowedly atheist are quite  spiritual.  </P> <P> "There is a gray area between moral refraction and spiritual reflection as  people look for life's purpose," Coles said. "Religion has no monopoly on  spirituality."  </P> <P> After so many years of studying children, Coles said he can still marvel at the  way "certain religious and spiritual values work their way into kitchen table  talk, or advice and punishment." He can still be impressed by "the  pervasiveness of this in the lives of kids, and the yearnings that families  have for some kind of spiritual mooring."  </P> <P> This kind of spiritual anchor helps children through crisis, Coles said. There  was 10-year-old Leah, who saw herself as "a part of Israel" as she lay dying of  acute leukemia. Natalie, an 8-year-old Hopi girl, was calm about her  grandmother's impending death because she knew the old woman would travel to  the mesa, where Natalie believed spirits reside.  </P> <P> "She will leave us for there, and then she'll prepare for us to come there,"  Natalie explained. "I woke up yesterday and realized that I'd been there myself  (in a dream) to visit her." Natalie said she was pleased that her grandmother  would be reunited with her own forebears. "They'll be together there, and we'll  go visit." Natalie said.  </P> <P> Long before their parents may give them credit for it, children seek  explanations, Coles said.  </P> <P> "I think we are the creature of language and awareness. We are the creature who  wants to understand," Coles said. "Children 8 or 9 years old have said to me  that they know they are a dot in an infinite space."  </P> <P> "That kind of awareness prompts us to try to figure it out, and long before  they go to high school and take philosophy classes, children ask and wonder and  reflect about the meaning of life."  </P> <P> They wonder about "the sources of their moral life, the reason for their  behavior, and what they should do, and why -- and everything else that  categorizes a human being," Coles said. "Namely, hoping that there is a  meaning, because I think there is a dark side of us that wonders about  meaninglessness, too."  </P> <P> Coles said this is the last of his books about the inner lives of children.  </P> <P> "I'm tired," he said. "I'm 61 years old. I just feel that it would take me  another eight or 10 years to do another project like this."  </P> <P> And besides, "I just feel that this is a nice way to end 30 years of work."  </P> <P> Coles may be tired of writing about children, but he stressed that he is in no  way way tired of working with them.  </P> <P> "I'm not tired of children," he said. "I'll never be tired of working with  children." And then a big smile. "I'll never stop working with children."  </P></p>

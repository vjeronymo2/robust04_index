It has already included  the creation of the "International Environment Advisor System"  in its initial request for the FY94 budget, which is under  negotiations with the Ministry of Finance. MITI will also expand  on-going cooperation projects for desulphurization technologies  in China. The International Environment Advisor System certifies  and registers "Environment Advisors" among "Managers in Charge  of Pollution Control," designated specialists with knowledge and  technical backgrounds, in the private sector based on their  experience in developing nations and language ability. They will  be sent to developing nations to organize seminars for pollution  prevention and to provide assistance and advice based on  requests from such nations.    Cooperation with developing nations through the dispatch of  experts in environmental issues, such as pollution prevention,  has already been implemented as part of private enterprise's  social contribution. The International Environment Advisor  System is intended to expand such efforts and establish a  governmental system for human cooperation.    The technological cooperation for desulphurization in China  is intended to establish several simplified desulphurization  testing facilities for low- quality coal with a high level of  sulfur to prevent air pollution by coal- burning thermal power  plants. The construction of the first such facility began in May  in Qingdao, Shandong, with the Chinese side recently agreeing to  a second facility to be established in Taiyuan, Shanxi. The  project is expected to be completed by the year 2000, with a  total budget of &yen;7.3 billion.    MITI plans to promote international cooperation further  since  "Environmental issues are not confined to Japan, as in the case  of technological cooperation with China for desulphurization as  a countermeasure to acid rain in the East Asia region"  (Industrial Location and Environment Bureau).</p>

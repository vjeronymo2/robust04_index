			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS MARIACHIS UCLATLAN  </P> <P> It takes nothing away from Richard Vasquez's interesting article on women  mariachis to note one error ("Women Are Spicing Up the World of Mariachi  Music," Aug. 26.)  </P> <P> Los Mariachis Uclatlan was not started by Mark Fogelquist. Donald Borcherdt  founded it in 1961 as a performance study group of the UCLA Institute of  Ethnomusicology.  </P> <P> The founding members included a Javanese guitarron player who spoke no Spanish  but sang so convincingly that Mexican listeners frequently mistook him for a  countryman; a Japanese Imperial Court musician playing violin; an American  elementary school teacher whose singing could give Lola Beltran a run for the  money, and several other Anglos, including the undersigned on violin.  </P> <P> GARRY MARGOLIS, Los Angeles  </P></p>

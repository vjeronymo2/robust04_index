			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DESERT ORCHID DOESN'T LIVE UP TO HYPE  </P> <P> Desert Orchid, the 11-year-old gray regarded as Britain's most popular  thoroughbred, ran out of stamina today in the most-hyped race of his career and  finished third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.  </P> <P> Norton's Coin, a 100-1 long shot, won the steeplechase, the longest-priced  winner in the 66-year history of the event, second only to the Grand National  in prestige.  </P> <P> Toby Tobias, an 8-1 shot, was second, three-quarters of a length behind the  winner. Desert Orchid and jockey Richard Dunwoody were four lengths farther  back. Nine other horses started.  </P> <P> Off at 10-11 odds, Desert Orchid was the hottest Gold Cup favorite in 15 years  as he attempted to become only the sixth horse to win the 3 1/4-mile race  twice.  </P></p>

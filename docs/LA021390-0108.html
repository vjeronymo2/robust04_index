			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES  </P> <P> La Jolla-based Intermark has completed the sale of its Munson Sporting Goods  Co. subsidiary to Dayton, Ohio-based Outdoor Sports Headquarters for an  undisclosed price. Munson, a leading sporting goods wholesaler in the Western  U.S., reported $30.1 million in net sales for the nine-month period ended Dec.  31, 1989.  </P> <P> Outdoor Sports Headquarters, the nation's largest full-service distributor of  hunting, fishing, camping and archery equipment, is a wholly owned subsidiary  of Dayton-based Centuri Inc. Its annual revenue total rose to about $250  million with the Munson acquisition.  </P> <P> "Though Munson has become a pacesetter in its market, we have come to believe  that Munson's best prospects for future growth can be achieved through  assimilation into the Outdoor Sports organization and its commitment to the  industry," Intermark President and Chief Executive Charles R. Scott said  Monday.  </P> <P> In a related development, Intermark on Monday reported that it had exercised an  option to purchase 1 million shares of stock in Triton Group Ltd. The purchase  gave Intermark voting power over 51.6% of Triton's stock.  </P> <P> Intermark is a billion dollar operating/holding company listed on the American  Stock Exchange.  </P></p>

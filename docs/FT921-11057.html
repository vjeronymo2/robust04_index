			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Volatility continues The volatility which has dominated the foreign exchange markets this year shows no signs of abating, writes Simon London. This was clear in the dollar's behaviour against the D-Mark last week. On Monday, the US currency strengthened from DM1.59 to nearly DM1.62 on the absense of concrete exchange policies from the Group of Seven meeting. Many analysts had expected an agreement to moderate any appreciation of the dollar. However, the dollar had tumbled back as low as DM1.5850 by Wednesday as weak consumer confidence figures underlined the deep malaise of the US economy. Yet by mid-week it rallied back to DM1.62 following comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, that US interest rates were unlikely to be cut again. Finally, on Friday, the US unit lost more than 2 pfennigs in 20 minutes on the announcement that German steel workers had voted in favour of strike action in pursuit of higher pay. This underlines that there is no consensus among analysts and traders on three important issues; the prospects for US economic recovery, whether US interest rates will be cut, and when German interest rates will start to decline. This week market participants are hoping that a clearer picture emerges. Today, the US National Association of Purchasing Managers report will be watched closely. US employment data for January, released on Friday, is regarded as a key indicator. Also this week, German industrial production, employment and trade figures are due. Finally, the Bundesbank council holds its regular bi-weekly meeting on Thursday. Here at least there consensus: no-one is expecting an immediate cut in German interest rates.</p>

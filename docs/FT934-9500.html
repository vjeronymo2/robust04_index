			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: German stores join merger queue: A look at the likely marriage of Karstadt and Hertie IT is an open secret that the supervisory boards of Karstadt and Hertie, two of Germany's biggest retail groups, are finalising details of a merger of the two companies. The full story is likely to emerge at a press conference on Friday morning in Frankfurt. A merger would create a new force in German retailing, combining Essen-based Karstadt, Germany's biggest department store chain with sales of DM20.6bn (Dollars 12.1bn) last year and Frankfurt-based Hertie, the third biggest with sales of DM7bn. The group will have turnover of DM28bn and 238 outlets. It will eclipse Kaufhof, Karstadt's Cologne-based rival, as Germany's largest department store chain, but in terms of sales will be smaller than each of Metro, Tengelmann and Rewe, three of Germany's privately-owned retail groups. Both Karstadt and Hertie have the disadvantage of being part of the sluggish department stores sector. This segment of the market, which accounted for almost all of the privately-owned Hertie's turnover last year and 65 per cent of Karstadt's, has been in decline for decades as consumers have switched their preferences to specialty retailers and discount stores. The downturn in consumer spending which is part and parcel of the recession has made matters worse. Hertie derives 30 per cent of its turnover from just six, well-known stores, including the KaDeWe - Kaufhaus des Westens - in Berlin. But these flagships did not give the group any immunity from the long, slow decline of the department store sector and Hertie spent much of the 1980s battling with losses. The group has been making profits for the last five years but the economic downturn has taken its toll and profits dropped to DM16.7m last year from DM56.6m in 1991. While analysts credit Karstadt with being well managed, its dependence on the department stores segment (which accounts for 65 per cent of revenue) has led some brokers to put the group's shares on their sell list. Earlier this year, it said that profits in 1993 would probably fall from the DM224m made last year in spite of a slight increase in turnover. This is in marked contrast to the optimism shown by Kaufhof, Karstadt's arch-rival since both were founded about 125 years ago. Kaufhof is predicting that sales will grow by 10 per cent this year and profits will rise considerably from last year's level - reflecting the group's moves away from department stores into the specialty retailing sector. A fusion of Karstadt/Hertie is unlikely to lead to a sudden spurt in profitably, but it does open horizons for the combined companies. 'The merger will give Karstadt an excellent and rare opportunity for long-term growth in its sector,' said Ms Sabine Blumel at Credit Lyonnais Securities in London. The growth is likely to come from rationalisation as the two groups sort out their stores portfolio so that they no longer compete with one another directly on the high street. In addition, there will be scope for further cost reductions as the combined companies pool their purchasing activities. This will help Karstadt/Hertie compete more effectively with the Swiss-based Metro empire. This controls Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus and Kaufhof among an extensive portfolio of German retail interests and enjoys the purchasing power which comes with having worldwide sales of more than DM70bn, the bulk in Germany. If the depressed background to the department stores sector provides the main catalyst to the merger, the role of Germany's big banks should not be underestimated. Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, and Commerzbank, third biggest, own 25 per cent each of Karstadt. These shareholdings date back to the 1930s when they stepped in to rescue the group from near bankruptcy. Germany's big banks are keen to reduce their controversial holdings in German industry and it seems likely that their stakes will drop to 10 per cent each as part of the deal. The most likely structure for the deal, which may value Hertie at up to DM1.8bn, will involve the banks selling the bulk of their holdings in Karstadt in return for the shares in Hertie, which is 97.5 per cent owned by a charitable trust. The banks will then sell on the Hertie shares in return for cash which Karstadt will probably raise through a mixture of debt and equity finance. However the deal is structured, it will have to be approved by Germany's federal cartel authorities. Analysts say they are unlikely to block it but may force the combined group to sell some stores in Berlin, where it will have a high share of the market.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (13): Good news from Hab River - Cash for power should soon start flowing THIS month's ground-breaking ceremony at Hub Chowki for the Dollars 1.7bn Hab River power project is expected to switch on a burst of foreign investment in electricity generation projects throughout Pakistan. For the government, which has embarked on one of Asia's more ambitious institutional restructuring programmes, and for Pakistan's would-be electricity consumers, this will not be a moment too soon. Pakistan has just 8,312MW of total installed capacity, 6,857MW under the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and the balance under the Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation, both of which are due for shake-up in the 1990s. The figure is far below western standards, which indicate that countries of 100m people or more should have about 80,000MW-100,000MW of electricity supply capacity. According to water and power ministry officials, at least 10 private sector power projects have been on hold during the prolonged talks over Hab River. Negotiations for the 1,292MW oil-fired power scheme had been going on for four years, with the deal having tentatively been wrapped up twice before. This time, representatives of Xenel Industries, the Saudi-based chief sponsoring company for the build-own-operate (BOO) scheme, and of the water and power ministry and WAPDA firmly believe that the agreement formally signed in early July sufficiently allays all fears and clears the decks for an imminent construction start-up, with power from the first of four 323MW units to be generated within 40 months. Because Pakistan opted for an oil-fired power station, the project was subjected to a comprehensive World Bank environmental study, requiring stringent environmental controls to meet the Bank's criteria. Pakistan opted for oil because of its proximity to the Gulf. Under the deal, HubCo will lift 1.5m tonnes of oil a year from the Pakistan State Oil Company in a deal worth Dollars 150m a year. When completed, Hab River will boost Pakistan's power generating capacity by some 15 per cent. It will be Pakistan's first private sector power scheme. The complexity of the financial structures put into place by the private sector and by the World Bank should bode well for other entrepreneurs seeking to take advantage of Pakistan's liberalisation programme. They will now have a formula from which to work in pursuing their own deals. Under BOO, the sponsors will own and operate the project indefinitely. In effect, the Hab River scheme becomes an independent company generating electricity and selling it into the national grid. The managing company being set up to run the scheme is the Hab River Power Group (HubCo). It is the intention of the sponsors for HubCo to have a widely-based public shareholding. It has been registered as a company and share trading will eventually take place on the Karachi Stock Exchange. The project will be financed through the sale by HubCo of electricity, priced at commercial rates, to WAPDA. The notional start price is Rs1.36 (about 5.5 US cents) per kilowatt hour. This has escalator clauses built in to take account of rupee devaluation, inflation and a variety of other factors that could affect electricity prices. The agreement runs for 30 years, considered to be long under normal BOO arrangements (the ideal is between 10-15 years, according to most experts). The most recent impasse was caused by the emergence of Islamic (interest free) banking as a national issue. The imposition of Islamic banking rules temporarily scared off the commercial western banks invited to part-finance the scheme. The breakthrough came recently when the Pakistani authorities and HubCo representatives were able to formulate an implementation agreement guaranteeing the protection of the bankers' investment in the scheme, no matter what happened on the Islamic banking issue, which is now before the national Supreme Court. The two other elements of the tripartite accord were the power purchase accord, covering the commercial tariffs at which HubCo will sell power to the national grid, and the fuel purchase agreement, covering deliveries by the Pakistan State Oil Company of imported oil needed to run the power station. All those involved in the talks agree that the deal would not have been possible without the World Bank, which helped structure the deal and created some innovative forms of specialist finance to kick-start the agreement. These included the Private Sector Energy Development Fund (PSEDF), set up to provide seed finance at long-term commercial rates (but with up-front grace periods) to private sector interests seeking to invest in the project. The PSEDF will provide about one-third of the commercial bank financing. Another facility is the the Enhanced Co-Finance Operation (ECO), another World Bank invention specifically for Hab River, which will help protect the commercial banks against sovereign risks in case of failure by the government to comply with its side of the bargain. As it now stands, commercial bank financing aims to supply about Dollars 630m to the project. The banking consortium comprises the Bank of Tokyo, Credit Lyonnais of France, Citibank UK, and Sakura Bank of Japan. Union Bank of Switzerland was involved in the consortium, but last week confirmed it was withdrawing because of 'a strategic decision not to invest in fossil-fuelled projects'. Other elements of the financing include a Pakistan bond issue of Dollars 100m; HubCo and others equity investment totalling Dollars 243m; local equity of Dollars 188m and offshore backing from aid agencies breaking down as follows: PSEDF (Dollars 415m); Japan Export Import Bank Dollars 120m); World Bank (IBRD) Dollars 240m; Japan's Miti Dollars 70m; Sace of Italy Dollars 200m; France's Coface Dollars 41m and the Commonwealth Development Corporation Dollars 12m. In addition to Xenel, the prime sponsor, co-sponsors will include Mitsui &amp; Co of Japan and British Electricity International of the UK. Mitsui also will be the prime contractor, while BEI will operate and maintain the complex. The US firm of K&amp;M is the engineering consultant and was prime mover in the contract negotiations. Other key equipment subcontractors are Campenon Bernard of France (civil engineering); Ansaldo of Italy (turbines), and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries of Japan. The deal has enabled HubCo to confirm the appointment of Mr Kenneth Fergusson as HubCo chief executive officer, under the chairmanship of Mr Mohammad Alireza, who is also chairman of Xenel. Mr Fergusson, born in 1938, spent the early part of his career with ICI and RTZ, studied at Imperial College and Harvard Business School and was director-general of the European Transonic Windtunnel in Germany and a managing director of the London Dockland Light Railway.

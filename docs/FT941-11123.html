			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Financial Times Round The World Ski Expedition: Tales from the mountaintop During January Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker skied 312 miles; 354,650 vertical feet, or 67.17 vertical miles, measured using altimeter watches and a mileometer provided by Snow and Rock. They drove 5,000 miles. Actor and director Clint Eastwood enjoys the mountain air. Lunching at Sun Valley, Arnie noticed a pair of steel-blue eyes boring into him from the next table. Eastwood heard that Lucy was from Provence and let loose a stream of what could be called Foreign Legion French, and then apologised. 'That's the only French I know,' he said. Two FT readers were anxious to meet Arnie and Lucy at Teton Village, Jackson Hole. They received several messages from David and Margaret Esau, who had combed the resort. They later discovered they were staying in the next room. Resorts visited: Wyoming: Jackson Hole. Idaho: Pebble Creek, Pomerelle, Sun Valley, Soldier Mountain, Bogus Basin, Brundage Mountain. Oregon: Mount Bachelor, Mount Ashland, Mount Hood Meadows, Timberline. California: Heavenly, Squaw Valley, Mount Shasta. Washington: Ski Bluewood, Stevens Pass.

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIDING THE NEWLY FREE  </P> <P> Re the "Europe Braces for Hungry Hordes" Commentary Dec. 3: I'd like to commend  Robert Hunter for his concern and insight into the plight of Soviet and East  European refugees and citizens.  </P> <P> With the breakdown of the Soviet economy and the opening of Eastern Europe,  Western European nations are facing the very serious possibility of  ever-increasing floods of migrant workers and refugees.  </P> <P> Since World War II, the United States has consistently fought for the growth of  democracy and human freedom throughout the world. Now that most of Eastern  Europe has taken that first step, is the United States going to "blink" in its  commitment to help them reach their goals? Is the U.S. going to allow these  people to starve before they have a chance to enjoy the fruits of democracy?  </P> <P> It's time to show the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe some "openness" of our  own and to assure them of our continuing commitment to human life and  democracy.  </P> <P> LINDA C. CURRAN, Fountain Valley  </P></p>

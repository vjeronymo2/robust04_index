			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the statute, 3-year exclusivity is awarded if the application or supplemental application contained reports of new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and were essential to the approval of the application or supplemental application (see section 505(j)(4)(D)(iii) and (j)(4)(D)(iv) of the act). The legislative history indicates that 3-year exclusivity is for investigations requiring a considerable investment of time and money and that are necessary for approval of important innovations (see 54 FR 28872 at 28899). Thus, FDA interprets ``new clinical investigation'' as a clinical investigation whose data have not been relied upon by FDA to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a previously approved drug for any indication or safety in a new patient population and do not duplicate the results of another investigation relied upon by FDA to demonstrate a previously approved drug's effectiveness or safety in a new patient population. An applicant is not limited to recently conducted clinical investigations; a clinical investigation that provides a ``new'' basis for drug approval can qualify for exclusivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 102. Two comments recommended revising the rule to address transfers of new drug exclusivity between an applicant and all predecessors in interest, including licensors, assignors, joint venture partners, or other parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New drug exclusivity is not a property right, but is rather a statutory obligation on the agency. This statutory obligation is based on data and information in an approved application. Although an applicant may purchase an application or rights to data and information in an application (i.e., exclusive rights to a new clinical investigation), from which exclusivity would flow, there is no property right to exclusivity itself that can be transferred separately and apart from the application or data upon which exclusivity is based. The agency does, however, permit the submission or approval of an ANDA when the holder of the exclusivity permits FDA to receive or approve the ANDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA notes that joint venture partners differ from licensees, assignors, etc., because joint venture partners share in developing a drug product. Consequently, FDA suggests that joint venture partners carefully consider how they will seek approval of an application and define their rights and interests in the application to avoid questions regarding applicability of the exclusivity provisions of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, FDA has revised the definition of the phrase, ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant,'' to construe a party who has purchased exclusive rights to a study to have ``conducted or sponsored'' the study. This change will enable a party who has acquired exclusive rights to a study to seek exclusivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 103. Four comments asked FDA to create a mechanism that would determine whether a study was ``essential for approval'' either before an application would be submitted or before the study began. Proposed &sect;314.108(a) stated that ``essential to approval'' with regard to an investigation ``means that the application could not be approved by FDA without that investigation, even with a delayed effective date.'' The proposal, however, did not discuss the procedure by which FDA would determine a study to be ``essential to approval.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA declines to accept the comments. FDA cannot determine whether a study is essential for approval until the application is approved. Research goals and objectives often change during clinical investigations. For example, the results from a study designed to support a new indication could generate interest in a completely different indication. The product ultimately approved may be a different product from that characterized in the original application. It is also possible that newly available data in the public domain will obviate the need for the study prior to approval. Thus, FDA will decide whether a study is essential for approval at the time of approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has, however, amended the definition of ``essential to approval'' to delete the reference to a delayed effective date. This change is necessary because the agency no longer regards an application with a delayed effective date as being approved. Instead, FDA considers such applications as being tentatively approved (see 57 FR 17950 at 17953).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 104. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(2) would provide 5 years of exclusivity for a new chemical entity if a drug product containing the new chemical entity was approved after September 24, 1984, in an application submitted under section 505(b) of the act. One comment said FDA should deny 5-year exclusivity to any section ``505(b)(2) application for a new chemical entity that relies upon one or more investigations that are essential for approval of the application but which were not conducted or sponsored by the applicant * * *.'' The comment explained that a 505(b)(2) applicant could assemble literature demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a drug product marketed before 1962 (when the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was amended to require new drugs to be safe and effective for their intended uses) or 1938 (when the Food and Drugs Act was amended to require new drugs to be safe for the conditions of their intended use) and, under the rule, seek 5 years of new drug exclusivity. The comment said granting exclusivity to such drugs would be inconsistent with statutory intent and the legislative history.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the statute, a drug product may qualify for 5 years of exclusivity if its active moiety has not been previously approved in any other application (see section 505(c)(3)(D)(ii) and (j)(4)(D)(ii) of the act). For some drug products marketed before 1938 or 1962, the active moiety will have been the subject of an approved application (under prior versions of the act or as part of a combination product approved under the act), so the active moiety will be ineligible for 5-year exclusivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also notes that the statute provides 5-year exclusivity for applications approved under section 505(b) of the act and that such applications are submitted by persons who wish to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce ``any new drug.'' (See section 505(a) and (c)(3)(D)(ii).) The term ``new drug'' is defined in section 201(p) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)). Drug products with active ingredients marketed before 1938 or 1962 may be ``new drugs,'' especially where there has been a change in the product's labeling, composition, or manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Products falling within the definition of a ``new drug'' must be approved under section 505(b) of the act and, as a result, may qualify for 5-year exclusivity under the language of the act and consistent with legislative history.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 105. One comment said that FDA should provide 5 years of exclusivity for a single enantiomer of a previously approved racemate. The comment asserted that FDA approval of a racemic drug mixture covers the mixture rather than the enantiomers that compose the mixture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency declines to revise the rule as requested by the comment. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the agency's position is that ``a single enantiomer of a previously approved racemate contains a previously approved active moiety and is therefore not considered a new chemical entity'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28898).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

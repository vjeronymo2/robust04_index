			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "State Shifts Gears </F> To Boost Motor Market"]    [Text] The Chinese Government has decided new policies  which aim to improve the domestic motor market.    The moves range from tax shifts on retail sales of  domestically-made cars to new tariffs on imports.    A policy that for years has allowed foreign-funded  enterprises to buy duty-free foreign cars will be withdrawn.    In addition, controls on institutional car buying, initiated  by the Ministry of Finance in the 1970s, have been eased.    The ministry said the controls have been lifted to help  saloon car makers.    The new tariffs are already effective, but regulations on  the  shifts of saloon car consumption taxes, which constitute  two-thirds of the retail car price, are unavailable now.    And an official from an automobile trading firm believed the  moves would have a major effect but she said it was difficult to  predict how situation will develop as the motor market was still  in a recession that began in July.    The recession, a result of the government's tight-credit  policy and anti-corruption drive, is likely to continue until  the second half of this year, said industry experts.    A senior official with the China Trade Centre for Automobile  Imports said imports of foreign-made cars and vans, would  certainly be down on last year's 400,000.    The official believed tough central government measures  would  stop the smuggling of foreign-made cars.    Customs stations are now required to confiscate smuggled  vehicles unconditionally instead of simply imposing fines as  they did before.    The Ministry of Public Security, the General Administration  of Customs and the State Administration for Industry and  Commerce issued a joint notice that no driving licence be given  to car owners without documents from the firm where they bought  the car.    In 1993, 100,000 cars and vans were smuggled into the  mainland.    Business Weekly has learned the government approved the  duty-free sale to foreign-funded firms of a third of the 15,000  cars and vans it bought last year.    The cars made by the US's General Motors, Ford and Chrysler,  are now the last batch of duty-free cars being sold to  foreign-funded firms.    In 1993, 80,000 foreign-built cars and vans were sold to  foreign-funded enterprises duty-free, compared with 50,000 in  1992.    This preferential policy is to be cancelled partly because  some overseas-run firms profiteered by selling duty-free  vehicles to domestic customers.    And some foreign-funded firms were set up for no other  reason  than to deal in duty-free cars.    The new policies are also likely to help improve the  country's motor pricing system.    Just now a Chinese-made car sells for twice the price of the  same car made overseas on the domestic market.    However, the official said price reform in China was  complicated.    As the controls on institutional car purchases are lifted,  sales of cars are expected to rise.    However, as the tight-credit and anti-corruption programmes  continue, enterprises' purchasing power will remain low and  government departments and institutions will lay out little cash  in the short term.</p>

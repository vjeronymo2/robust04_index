			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TEACHING AMERICA' LESSONS  </P> <P> Teach for America is a valuable program that should be pursued.  </P> <P> Despite the many arguments against the program, the advantages outweigh the  defaults.  </P> <P> Some critics argue that the cost is too much. Like any business, one must  invest in order to succeed. Others have disapproved because of the inexperience  of the teachers. This may be true, but a with all new teachers, time will ease  the tensions and facilitate the teaching process.  </P> <P> As a student, I believe that the earlier people finish their educations and  enter the professional fields, the more zeal and love they (will) have for  their jobs.  </P> <P> KATHIE H.

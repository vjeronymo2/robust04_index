			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Reuters boosts Visnews stake REUTERS, the news and infor-mation group, is on the verge of taking 100 per cent control of Visnews, the international television news agency. The company, which bought NBC's stake in Visnews in July, is now buying the BBC's residual 11 per cent stake. The purchase, and Reuters' involvement in last week's offer for Independent Television News, are signs of the information group's increasing interest in visual news. Reuters has taken a strategic decision to add moving pictures to its text-based services. The group believes it can run the Visnews business more profitably with full control. 'We think that by locking Visnews into Reuter bureaux we can beat everybody in international television news,' says Mr Mark Wood, Reuters' editor-in-chief. Increasingly, Reuters correspondents are going to find themselves doing pieces to cameras as well as filing conventional written stories. 'We must have video reporting as part of our normal reporting activities,' added Mr Wood. It may not be too long before dealers using Reuters services will not only have, for example, the words of the Bundesbank president from a press conference but also live television coverage on the same screen. The information group also wants to get move financial television but has not yet clearly identified how that can be done. In the main, Reuters plans to be a wholesaler rather than retailer of television news - providing news to broadcasters rather than being the broadcaster itself. Last week's offer for ITN, which would involve a Pounds 30m cash injection to deal with a property deficit, would give Reuters a 20 per cent stake. If Reuters does not become an ITN shareholder, consideration would almost certainly be given to setting up a rival when this becomes possible in 1995. A rival service to ITN could draw on the strengths of Visnews and both London News Network, the seven-day television news service for London, and Good Morning Television, the new breakfast station.</p>

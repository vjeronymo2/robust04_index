			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Audi earmarks DM800m to equip plant for new small car Audi, Volkswagen's executive car division, is to spend around DM800m (Pounds 312m) on equipping its main plant at Ingolstadt to make a new small car. The production facilities, due to open in mid-1996, are expected to turn out 100,000 vehicles a year. The Bavarian site was awarded the production contract after a group-wide competition in which the Seat works in Martorell, the Skoda factory in the Czech Republic - both offering far lower labour costs than in Germany - and VW's plant in Brussels were also short-listed, the company said yesterday. Ingolstadt's advantages included lower start-up investment costs and greater flexibility, Audi added. The local workforce had also accepted changes in working practices and reduced benefit payments which alone would save DM150m a year. 'We have proved Audi can make top-quality cars at competitive costs,' claimed Mr Herbert Demel, who was named board spokesman last Friday after the sacking of Audi chairman, Mr Franz-Josef Kortum. Mr Demel said he expected the company to break even this year following losses in 1993 estimated at more than DM200m. The new car, the Audi-A, based on the VW Golf chassis, is an integral part of a plan laid by VW group chairman Ferdinand Piech, who was head of Audi until the end of 1992, to widen the brand's product range. Cheaper than the current bottom-of-the-range Audi 80, it is intended to attract younger buyers to the marque, which at present sells mainly to the over-40s. Mercedes-Benz, the motor vehicle arm of the Daimler-Benz group, increased car sales by 53 per cent in January compared with 7 per cent growth for the market as a whole, the company's chief executive said, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.</p>

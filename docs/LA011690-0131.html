			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CBS TO AIM AT YOUNGER VIEWERS  </P> <P> The newly appointed president of CBS Entertainment says the network must  overhaul its antiquated prime-time lineup to rise out of last place in the  ratings.  </P> <P> Jeff Sagansky, who joined CBS two weeks ago from his position as president of  Tri-Star Pictures, said the schedule appeals to viewers "well over 45" years  old and that the network "is programming too narrowly in that direction."  </P> <P> "I don't think the network can be just a narrow casting vehicle," Sagansky said  Monday night.  </P> <P> "We do need more comedies," he said. "The question is which night do you open a  comedy night on?"  </P> <P> Sagansky confessed that CBS is in worse shape than NBC was 10 years ago, when  that network was a distant third. Sagansky said one of the obstacles to CBS'  comeback is that the television marketplace is more competitive than in the  past.  </P> <P> One of the network's top priorities is re-establishing contacts with some of  Hollywood's more dynamic producers, he said, adding that he would offer fresh  talent the chance "to do the show that they've always wanted to do."  </P> <P> Sagansky, whose record at Tri-Star included such flops as "Lock-up" and hits  like "Steel Magnolias," said the network's struggling "Pat Sajak Show" would  undergo several changes beginning in February but is in no immediate peril of  cancellation.  </P></p>

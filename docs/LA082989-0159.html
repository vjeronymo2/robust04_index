			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UNREST CUTS CHINESE TOURISM IN HALF  </P> <P> Foreign tourism to China plummeted in July to nearly half the level of July,  1988, but made a modest recovery from June following the bloody crackdown on  the democracy movement, a report in the official English-language China Daily  said today.  </P> <P> The country earned $2.2 billion last year from tourism, but analysts expect the  industry will finish this year earning only half that figure. The peak summer  season has been largely written off.  </P> <P> Major hotels are operating at or below 50% occupancy, with some as low as 20%.  The National Tourism Administration said only 80,000 foreign nationals entered  the country in July, a 47.5% drop from July, 1988, but a modest 11.3% increase  over June, the newspaper reported.  </P></p>

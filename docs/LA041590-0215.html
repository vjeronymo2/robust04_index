			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIBBS IS DRIVEN TO REACH GOAL OF COMPETING IN AN INDY 500;  </P> <P> AUTO RACING: BLACK DRIVER WILL TAKE FIRST STEP WHEN HE DRIVES IN LONG BEACH  RACE. HE ALSO WILL BE MAKING HISTORY.  </P> <P> Willy T. Ribbs is not going to the Indianapolis 500 this year -- except perhaps  as a spectator -- but he says that it's only a matter of time, and getting the  right equipment.  </P> <P> The way Ribbs looks at it, when he takes the green flag on Sunday in the Toyota  Grand Prix of Long Beach, the Indy car race through the streets of that seaside  community, it will have the same significance for blacks in auto racing that  Jackie Robinson had for baseball players when he made his first major league  appearance on April 15, 1947.  </P> <P> "Auto racing history will be made in Long Beach," Ribbs said. "I don't know  where Jackie Robinson made his debut (Ebbets Field in Brooklyn), but I'll be  making mine in Long Beach. I will finally be making it to the big leagues. I  think I've earned it.  </P> <P> "I'm fully aware of the implications of being the first black in Indy cars, but  that's not what it's all about. I'm going in with the same attitude Jackie  Robinson had, and that's to be a winner. It doesn't matter if I'm black, white  or purple, the object is to win."  </P> <P> Ribbs, 34, will drive a year-old, Judd-powered Lola, No. 25, for the  Raynor-Cosby Racing Team in Long Beach. The only other serious black Indy-car  candidate since the sport evolved in 1909 was Benny Scott of Long Beach, who  had hoped to use the L&amp;M Continental series as a springboard to Indy in  1973 but never made it after his under-financed team quit.  </P> <P> "Indy will come later, when we get the kind of a car we need to be  competitive," Ribbs said. "The team only has an '89 chassis and on an oval,  with the new rules, it doesn't cut it against the new '90 models. On a road  course, or a street course like Long Beach, the difference is not as  pronounced."  </P> <P> The highest finishing year-old Lola in Sunday's Indy car opener at Phoenix was  10th. It was driven by rookie Scott Goodyear of Canada. The first six finishers  were 1990 cars, all powered by Chevrolet engines.  </P> <P> Ribbs tested nearly for 1,000 miles on the one-mile oval at Phoenix before he  and team manager Kim Green decided to skip oval races this season and  concentrate on the 11 road races on the Championship Auto Racing Teams  schedule.  </P> <P> "The longer we ran, the more we found we couldn't be ready in our older car,"  Ribbs said. "When Bill Cosby and the Raynor team made the announcement last  November that we were going to Indy, we all felt that we would have a 1990 Lola  to work with, but it didn't work out that way."  </P> <P> With Cosby, TV's highest-rated personality, coming aboard as a part-owner, it  was assumed that sponsors would scramble to sign up with the Raynor team.  Especially when word leaked out that Cosby would throw in a commercial --  rumored to be worth in the neighborhood of $1 million -- for the sponsor-to-be.  </P> <P> So far, though, no sponsor has been found, and the lack of one has caused  Raynor to postpone its order of a new chassis, which costs about $300,000.  </P> <P> "We did expect the Cosby name to be magic," Green said. "But we got started too  late in the year for major corporations to juggle their budgets to accommodate  us. To properly plan for the future, we need a multi-year program, and that  means 1991 and beyond.  </P> <P> "At the present moment, we're a good team, but we're small and we can't do the  development work the richer teams can. The difference in first place and 10th  place today might only be less than a second, but measured in money, it can be  in the millions."  </P> <P> Preparing for a tight, street course such as Long Beach's 1.67-mile, 11-turn  seaside circuit is difficult because the track will not be open until shortly  before practice early Friday morning. Ribbs did his preparation at West Palm  Beach, Fla., on a fairgrounds track where the International Motor Sports Assn.  holds sports car races.  </P> <P> "We put in three days at West Palm and came away quite satisfied with our  progress," Ribbs said. "The most important thing in preparing for a street race  is compromising the car, getting it so it will respond quickly -- without  sliding up against a wall -- and turn equally well in both directions."  </P> <P> Ribbs has done his homework on road courses for 14 years since he earned a  racing license at the Jim Russell school at Willow Springs Raceway. He has  raced and won in Formula Ford, Formula Atlantic, Trans-AM, IMSA GTO and IMSA  prototypes, but at Long Beach he will be racing a 750-horsepower Indy car for  the first time. Already, he is impressed with the difference.  </P> <P> But Ribbs, remembering a practice at Phoenix last month, is still learning to  handle the car.  </P> <P> "We were testing a softer spring combination and we went too soft and the car  bottomed out on the pavement," he said. "That sent it into a spin in the middle  of the second turn. It hit on the left side and it wouldn't have been so bad,  but it put a hole in the tub.  </P> <P> "It wasn't the first time (to hit a wall), and it won't be the last."  </P> <P> This is actually the second time that Ribbs, a flamboyant second-generation  driver from San Jose -- his father, Bunny, was active in Sports Car Club of  America races on the West Coast -- has been at the center of an Indy-car  campaign.  </P> <P> In 1985, heavily sponsored by Miller beer and promoted by boxing's Don King,  Ribbs went to Indianapolis with a car owned by Sherman Armstrong. With no prior  practice, Ribbs was thrown into the rookie orientation program and, after about  50 laps and a top speed of 172.215 m.p.h., he climbed out of the car and  announced that he would not continue.  </P> <P> "The car was no good, but that was only part of it," Ribbs said. "The car  wasn't as bad as the people involved with it. The whole thing was a disaster  from the word go. It was one of the smarter decisions I've made to walk away  from the whole deal."  </P> <P> Ribbs heard the not-so-veiled criticism from the old-timers at the Speedway,  who said that the concrete walls and the speed had thrown fear into the young  black man's heart.  </P> <P> "Let them say what they want, it was just a question of making a professional  decision," Ribbs said. "I've never let my emotions control a decision in my  racing career. If I'd been all emotional about getting to Indy, I'd have stayed  around and struggled, but that was not the way to handle it.  </P> <P> "Arie Luyendyk had driven the car for Provimi Veal and didn't like it, so they  sold it to Armstrong. Jim Trueman, who helped me more than anyone else when I  was getting started, warned me that it was a Mickey Mouse deal but I thought  with Don King aboard, it would turn into something. I was wrong.  </P> <P> "After I walked away from it, Armstrong closed his garage and left. He knew no  one could make it run."  </P> <P> This year's decision to skip Indy bears no relation to the earlier  disappointment, Ribbs said.  </P> <P> "If we had a new 1990 car, like most of our competitors have, we would have  been at Phoenix and we would be going to Indianapolis. But we don't, so we want  to do the best with what we have and that means concentrating on road-course  races.  </P> <P> "The Raynor team, Kim Green, the team manager, and the entire crew, all the  engineers, everyone, have been great to work with. I think the future with them  is great."  </P> <P> Green, an Australian who came to the United States in 1981 to work with his  brother Barry on the Paul Newman Can-Am team, has been Raynor's chief mechanic  since November, 1987, and recently was promoted to team manager. Barry holds  the same role with Bobby Rahal's car on the Galles-Kraco team.  </P> <P> "In a lot of street- and road-track situations, we feel that Willy can make up  the difference between the old and the new car," Green said. "We all know that  the ones with the Chevy engines have a decided advantage on any circuit.  Realistically, our goal at Long Beach is to be right there at the tail end of  the Chevies, but at the front end of the Judds and Cosworths."  </P> <P> Ribbs has driven three times in Formula Atlantic races in Long Beach, but never  on the course being used for Indy cars. When he drove, the course included a  stretch along Ocean Boulevard, up the hill from the current track, which is all  down on the flat area next to the marina.  </P> <P> "I enjoy street races, but more important, having Long Beach as the site for my  first race is something special to me," Ribbs said. "It is the granddaddy of  all Grand Prix street races in America and with all that tradition, it has a  tremendous attraction about it."  </P> <P> Ribbs became the team driver for Raynor, a garage door company in Dixon, Ill.,  after the owners, Ray Neisewander Jr. and his son, Ray III, decided they needed  an American driver to market if they expected to attract major sponsorship from  other corporations. Derek Daly, an Irishman who is driving for the Nissan GTP  team in IMSA, had driven for Raynor for three years and had 11 finishes in the  top 10 in 43 starts.  </P> <P> "Derek helped us become a contending team, but we felt we it was important to  have an American in the car," Green said. "We were definitely against getting a  'buy ride,' a driver who got the ride because he brought a lot of money.  </P> <P> "We wanted a young driver, someone with a lot of potential. We tested John  Andretti, Mario's nephew, and Robby Unser, Bobby's son, at Memphis and were  impressed by both of them.  </P> <P> "Willy T. heard we were looking for a driver and he approached us, mentioning  that Bill Cosby was interested in becoming involved. We took Willy to Memphis  and put him through the same test as the others. All three were very good, but  after a lot of discussion we felt that a better program could be built around  Willy.  </P> <P> "Things haven't completely fallen into place yet, but they certainly will, and  when they do we expect to have a front-running team."  </P> <P> Cosby got interested in Ribbs when he was watching TV one day in the summer of  1988 and saw this exuberant black driver dancing on the roof of his Trans-Am  car at Sears Point Raceway.  </P> <P> "A couple of years ago, after I'd won a race at Brainerd (Minn.) when I  finished on a flat tire, I got so carried away that I jumped up on the top of  the car and did a little Sugar Ray Leonard shuffle," Ribbs said. "I got so much  attention from it that I did it every time I won a race. I was just lucky that  Bill (Cosby) caught my act from Sears Point.  </P> <P> "He called me the next day and said he'd watched me and asked me about my  career. We got to be good friends and the next thing you know he was helping  put together the Indy-car team with Raynor.  </P> <P> "Six months ago, he hardly knew a thing about racing, but he keeps in touch  every day and now, when we talk, I'm amazed at how much the man knows about  chassis set-up and engines, everything about the car."  </P> <P> </P> <P> FACTS AND FIGURES  </P> <P> THE COURSE  </P> <P> On the streets surrounding Shoreline Village and the Downtown Marina in Long  Beach.

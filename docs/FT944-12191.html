			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg weakens De Beers fell by a net R2 at R96.50 after an earlier loss of R3. Dealers said that the group was under pressure from a court trial in the US where General Electric Co is alleged to have conspired in 1991 and 1992 with a De Beers affiliate to fix prices of industrial diamonds. The stock, they said, was also being hit by speculation that the Central Selling Organisation's marketing agreement with Russia was coming under pressure. The broad market lost ground as the lower bullion price and weak world markets made their effect felt. The overall index came off its low for the day to end 15 down at 5,708, industrials slipped 29 to 6,578 and golds shed 16 to 2,208, also off the day's worst. Anglos were marked up by R1 to R237. Engen dipped 50 cents to R34.50 ahead of its annual results, while Sasol lost 75 cents at R34.75.</p>

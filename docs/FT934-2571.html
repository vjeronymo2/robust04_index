			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Russian Elections: Westernmost outpost torn between business and the military - The Germans' return brings mixed feelings The people of Kaliningrad were yesterday voting to an agenda more polarised than elsewhere in Russia, thanks to the city's unique history and location. Cut off from the world for 50 years, and now cut off from Russia by three borders, the former cold war fort has offered a stark example of the power struggle between a rising business class and a declining military elite. The residents of Russia's westernmost district, for centuries better known as East Prussia, are sharply split between pro-reform parties advocating an aggressive turn to the west, mainly Germany, and conservative groups hankering for a reconstituted Soviet Union. Around 200,000 military personnel live among the city's population of just 1m, offering a strong constituency of support for Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party. 'Power is in the hands of enemies and with them you can only talk through the barrel of a gun,' grunts an older military officer strolling down the main Lenin Prospect, giving voice to the anxieties that have been putting Mr Zhirinovsky's party into third place in local polls. But Kaliningrad has also developed a clear liberal tint in the last two years: Mr Boris Yeltsin got less than 40 per cent of the presidential vote in 1991 but over 60 per cent, which was higher than the national average, in April's referendum. That shift, according to local politicians, has been caused by the opening of Kaliningrad to German tourists visiting the ancient city which they know as Konigsberg - destroyed first by war and then by Soviet bulldozers - as much as by the proximity of the west itself. The arrival of the tourists has brought around Rbs1.2bn (Dollars 923,000) in direct investment. 'Peoples' mind-set has changed faster than in other regions,' claims Mr Nikolai Tulaev, who retired as a navy captain to run in the elections on the Russia's Choice list for the State Dunma, or lower house of parliament. A poll by the Kaliningrad Sociological Centre last week showed his party running neck-and-neck with Yabloko, another reformist group, at around 14 per cent of the vote. The region's liberally-inclined administration hopes the new parliament will get Moscow to loosen the bureaucratic noose while, simultaneously, increasing subsidies. Reform groups see the first step, needed to let Kaliningrad develop its so far disappointing free economic zone, as having already been taken. Custom duties were eliminated this year, although export quotas on amber, oil and fish - the region's staple products - reflect what local officials call cumbersome meddling from the centre in the periphery. 'Give us less money, fewer products, but give us economic rights,' says Mr Tulaev. 'We'll make the money ourselves.' Such an attitude contrasts sharply with the interest of the city's conservative forces, which seek a strengthening of central control. Focusing on Kaliningrad's significance as Russia's last western war prize, Mr Zhirinovsky's supporters identify their mission as explicitly rejecting any German designs on the city, and, more symbolically, on maintaining the glory of the past. 'Strengthening defence is our number one concern. Kaliningrad must stay a strong Russian bastion in the west,' says Mr Defermoev Dovzhenko, the Russian Communist party candidate, who rejects pressure from neighbouring states and reformers to demilitarise. Mr Dovzhenko is even ready for 'Nato agitation', he says. Both sides blame much of the city's economic hardship on the region's appendage status. Disputes over transport rights with its troublesome neighbour, Lithuania, have slowed the trickle of much-needed supplies, such as oil. But stores are full of expensive consumer goods brought from Poland. Drug abuse and organised crime have left the police flustered, with Kaliningrad the area hub for stolen cars. The younger generation sees salvation to the west: Berlin is closer than Moscow. 'Yes, it's better here than in Russia,' said Svetlana Lekismnaya, a 19-year-old student, 'but I've never been there.' But for the older generation, and especially war veterans who captured Konigsberg in 1939, the prospect of increased German involvement plays to their fears: indeed, the Communist party has been renamed the Patriotic Party in Kaliningrad. Mr Dovzhenko, its constituency candidate, blames 'the threat of re-Germanisation' on 'the fall of the USSR'. Such voices are loud. But Ms Olga Krupina, director of the Immanuel Kant Museum, hopes reason will win out in the German philosopher's former home: 'The elections are needed to wipe out the old ideology.'</p>

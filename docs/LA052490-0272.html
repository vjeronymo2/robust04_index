			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MEARS FASTEST IN FINAL INDY PRACTICE  </P> <P> Rick Mears got back to the head of the pack today as the 33 drivers in the  Indianapolis 500 made their final on-track adjustments for Sunday's race.  </P> <P> The three-time Indy winner, who lost the spotlight this month to defending  champion and teammate Emerson Fittipaldi and last year's second-place finisher,  Al Unser Jr., drove his Penske-Chevrolet to a fast lap of 222.750 m.p.h. in  racing trim.  </P> <P> Fittipaldi -- who won his first Indy pole with a four-lap qualifying average of  225.301, breaking Mears' year-old record of 223.886 -- was right behind at  221.593. The Brazilian driver was followed by Michael Andretti at 220.496.  </P> <P> Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands, the other front-row starter, was next at  220.135.  </P> <P> The only other driver over 220 m.p.h. was 1969 winner Mario Andretti, Michael's  father and fellow second-row starter, at 220.097. Geoff Brabham, who will start  on the inside of the seventh row, was strong at 219.855, with Unser at 219.593.  </P> <P> All starters, along with first alternate Salt Walther, made it onto the 2  1/2-mile oval during the two-hour "Carburetion Day" practice -- the only time  between the end of qualifications and the start of the race that cars are  allowed on the track.  </P> <P> There were no crashes or spins during the final practice.  </P></p>

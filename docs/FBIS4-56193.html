			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patricia Munoz] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the Secretariat of Fisheries [Sepesca]  said Mexico has not ruled out the possibility of resorting to  NAFTA to settle the tuna embargo imposed by the United States on  the country, which has caused economic damages estimated at  approximately $50 million to date. It reported 70 percent of  the national fishing cooperatives have gone into debt to balance  their financial situation, and 60 percent of them have been  forced to restructure their debt with the banks.    This past year, the number of cooperative boats in the  Pacific has been reduced 25 percent and the number of private  fishing boats has also been reduced by an equal percentage. By  contrast, the number of foreign investment projects in this  sector is increasing, particularly as regards to the development  of aquiculture and fishing in territorial waters.    Juan Jose Moreno Sada, Sepesca federal delegations  coordinator, and Geronimo Ramos, director of International  Fishing Affairs, made the aforementioned statements at a news  conference, in which they also announced the 94 International  Fishing Fair, from 8 to 12 June at Boca del Rio, Veracruz.    Moreno Sada explained there is an encouraging outlook in the  fishing sector, because the recovery of this economic activity  began in 1993. That year, production increased 3 percent,  basically from the reactivation of shrimp fishing and higher  domestic consumption of tuna. In 1994, this sector is expected  to maintain its rate of growth and exports, which total about  $500 million, will grow by 20 percent throughout the year,  reaching $750 million in the next three years.    He said fishing cooperatives are steadily recovering and may  even be capitalized because 310 of these companies have received  financial backing to support their reactivation. Of the $250  million the fishing cooperatives owed to date, $150 million have  been restructured, leaving only 40 percent of the credits to be  renegotiated.    The importance of this lies in the fact that the bread and  butter of approximately 300,000 families comes from fishing  cooperatives, and that last year the number of boats in this  sector declined from 600 to 450, namely one out of five boats  stopped operating.    Geronimo Ramos, director of International Fishing Affairs,  addressed the difficult topic of the tuna embargo. Regarding  this topic, he said Mexico has worked hard to reduce the  accidental death rate of dolphins, to the point it reached a  statistical rate of "zero." This is because in the last few  months, a 0.4-percent dolphin accidental death rate was achieved  for tuna fishing, thereby achieving international standards in  tuna fishing; however, the elimination of the U.S. embargo has  not been obtained.    Asked if Mexico will resort to NAFTA to negotiate the  elimination of this commercial sanction against the country,  Ramos answered that the authorities have not ruled out resorting  to Chapter 20 of the Treaty regarding the solution of  controversies to settle this problem.    Meanwhile, the official explained that enormous interest by  foreign businessmen to invest in the fishing sector has been  observed. He stated there are currently a $100 million in  projects to be made in the country with U.S. and European  capital.    The modification of the fishing law promoted two years ago  paved the way for opening the possibilities for private capital  participation and investments have flowed. For instance, this  year there are projects involving such Spanish companies as  Costa Brava, Nueva Galicia, and O'Farril Valenciana, the  investors of which are particularly attracted to aquiculture  projects and fishing in territorial waters, especially in Baja  California Norte and Sur, and in southeastern Mexico.</p>

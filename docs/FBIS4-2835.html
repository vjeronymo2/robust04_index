			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The personal safety  and property of Taiwanese tourists on the Mainland are protected  by law, said the Mainland-based Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) here today.    In response to an April 7 letter from the Taiwan-based  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), ARATS said that Taiwan  Affairs Office of China's State Council had already made clear  its stand on the matter and on the handling of the boat fire  tragedy.    The boat disaster claimed 32 lives, including 24 Taiwanese  tourists, on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 31.    ARATS said in its letter of reply that Taiwan compatriots  coming to the Mainland to visit relatives, travel, for  investment or other activities, have their personal safety and  property protected by the law.    The Mainland departments concerned are doing all they can to  find out the cause of the incident, according to the letter.    It urged SEF to handle the matter in a rational and  cool-minded manner, so as to avoid a setback in relations  between the two associations and the two sides of the straits.    It said that there had been several incidents involving the  loss of lives and property of Mainland compatriots and Taiwan  compatriots contemporaneous with past contacts between Taiwan  and the Mainland. ARATS has been following the matter closely  and is prepared for talks on the matter after necessary  preparations.    ARATS said it was willing to listen to the opinions of SEF  and will forward them to the Mainland departments concerned.</p>

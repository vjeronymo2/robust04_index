			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bernard Matthews tops Pounds 11m Bernard Matthews, the turkey products group which has been hit by weak prices in recent years, appears to be back in full flight with annual pre-tax profits rising sharply from Pounds 3.34m to Pounds 11.3m. Sales were 35 per cent higher at Pounds 195m for the 52 weeks to January 2. Acquisitions contributed Pounds 28m of the sales increase, leaving continuing businesses 16 per cent ahead. Mr Bernard Matthews, the founder and chairman, said the improvement was largely due to a recovery in prices for whole turkeys and a greater focus on frozen and added value products, such as dinosaur shaped turkey meat. 'The market for whole birds improved significantly during 1993,' said Mr Matthews. 'We lost several million pounds on that in 1992 and have recovered from that in 1993.' Bernard Matthews had also decreased its dependence on whole birds from 18 per cent to 10 per cent of total sales through acquisitions and new products such as cooked meat. The group suffered substantial start-up losses in France, where it has invested between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m in advertising its frozen products. Mr Matthews said this business was now trading profitably, excluding advertising costs. Germany was progressing and the group was 'extending its distribution of value added products'. Mr Matthews said his company, which made two acquisitions last year, remained in an 'aggressive mood'. Further buys could not be ruled out. Last year the company bought Hungary's leading turkey company for Pounds 2.5m and Turners Turkeys from Unigate for Pounds 18m. The purchases contributed Pounds 2.06m to total operating profit of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 3.91m). Debt rose from 9 per cent of shareholders' funds to 12 per cent as a result of the acquisitions. Mr Matthews said the company remained well placed for further acquisitions. However, he stressed any deals would be funded internally. 'This company is not in the rights issue business,' he said. The final dividend is increased to 1.4p (1.25p) for a 2.5p (2.25p) total, payable from earnings up by 4.63p to 6.27p.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (11): Athens roof for the arts - Classical Music CLASSICAL MUSIC lovers, long a beleaguered minority in a country whose best-known composers are associated with the bouzouki, now have a concert hall to be proud of. The Megaro Mousikis, a white marble cube overlooking a main Athens avenue, has taken almost 40 years to complete, and its German-designed acoustics are said to compete with any symphony hall in northern Europe. All the same, last month's opening was a modest affair. Almost nothing was done to mark the occasion. The Moscow Soloists, a chamber-sized ensemble led by Yuri Bashmet, a viola player, launched into Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 without a trace of inauguration night nerves. It was the audience who looked awed, as much by the surroundings as the music. Until now, concert-going in Greece has required stoic dedication. It usually means perching in the precipitous tiers of an ancient theatre on a hot summer night with someone's knees pressing into the small of your back. Moonlight and history do not necessarily compensate for the thin quality of sound wafted from far below. 'Modern Athens never had a roof for the arts. This is what the Megaro will provide,' says Mr Christos Lambrakis, the owner of Greece's largest newspaper group. As chairman of the Friends of Music, which persuaded the state to provide a site for the Megaro but repeatedly ran out of funds for construction, he convinced the former socialist government to come up with most of the Dr19bn (Dollars 10.5m) needed to complete the project. Music is one of the areas where Greek cultural tradition has kept its distance from the west. Folk music followed eastern rhythms; in cities the equally oriental sound of the bouzouki held sway. The bouzouki used to be inextricably linked with rebetika, harsh songs about drugs and violence in the Greek underworld. It was made respectable by composers Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hadjidakis, whose scores for the films 'Zorba the Greek' and 'Never on Sunday' brought a softened version of rebetika to a much bigger audience. Yet Greece occasionally produced classical musicians of the stature of Maria Callas or Dimitri Mitropoulos, the conductor, who became household names like the bouzouki singers. In recent years classical music has gained ground rapidly, helped by the success of a new generation of performers with an international reputation. But would the potential Greek audience be large enough to support a concert hall seating 2,000? Mr Lambrakis suspected not, so the Megaro was redesigned as a multi-purpose building when work on its concrete skeleton resumed in 1986 after a seven-year gap. 'Greece is obviously not the kind of country that can provide large subsidies for the arts. We have to try to ensure that we can pay our way,' he says. The original design by a German architect, Heinrich Keilholz, was radically overhauled to provide additional facilities for staging opera and theatre and to accommodate advances in acoustic technology. The acoustics were designed by Prof Helmut Muller, whose research was used in construction of the Opera de la Bastille in Paris. 'It would have been too expensive to demolish the concrete shell, so we had to work within the constraints of the original frame of a building which had a much less ambitious purpose. This presented a great challenge to the civil engineers,' says Mr Rolf Krogmeyer, an architect who worked on the Megaro at the start of his career and found himself unexpectedly recalled years later. The result is a hexagonal shaped hall with tiered boxes rising from both sides of the stage. Behind the stage is a huge organ, concealed by a wooden screen. The organ is a gift from Siemens and the Greek and German governments. The suspended ceiling, panelled in American red oak, can be set in four separate positions to accommodate the variations in sound reflection that are needed for the full enjoyment of different kinds of performance: opera, theatre, chamber and symphony music. 'Nowadays, acoustics dictate the shape of a concert hall. To achieve clarity of speech you must be able to shrink the space but for the sound of a symphony orchestra to be appreciated, it must be enlarged again,' Mr Krogmeyer says. For theatre and opera, two towers rise from the basement and a lighting grid descends to form a conventional proscenium arch. The front of the apron stage drops away to make room for an orchestra pit. The basement contains an asymmetrical chamber music hall, not yet finished, which will seat an audience of 500. Beside it is a self-contained recording studio with thick concrete walls set on steel springs to eliminate vibrations from passing traffic. The main hall is also equipped to serve as a conference centre with translation booths for 10 languages. 'It's designed so that you can hold a congress into the afternoon and then be able to set up for a concert in the space of three hours,' Mr Lambrakis says. Looking further ahead, the aim is to encourage young Athenians to become regular concert-goers. As a start, Mr Lambrakis intends to fit the courtyard outside the Megaro with a giant screen for simultaneous projection of performances going on inside. 'There would be no entrance charge. We'll be helping young people to experience classical music through a medium they're familiar with.'</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Brazilian reforms debate resumes Brazil's stalled constitutional review finally resumed yesterday and the first proposed amendments, including changes to the presidential term, could be voted on today. The review, which had been on hold since October because of a corruption scandal in Congress, is likely to make significant changes to the country's creaking political system. But amendments to modernise the economy are more controversial and face considerable opposition. Mr Nelson Jobim, the review's co-ordinator, has prepared the first tranche of proposals from an original list of 18,000 suggestions. His proposals include a cut in the presidential term from five to four years and allowing holders of executive positions to seek re-election while still in office. At present, leaders have to resign six months before elections while presidents and governors cannot hold the same office in consecutive periods. This system, designed to reduce the advantages of incumbency, has usually weakened the last year of an elected official's term. 'They only govern for two years, the rest of the time they are learning to govern or politicking for the next elections,' according to Mr Jobim. Other proposed changes include an end to Brazil's compulsory voting laws and stricter rules to prevent congressmen switching party affiliation mid-term. Congressional immunity, which is extremely broad and has allowed some congressmen to escape criminal charges, would in future only extend to guaranteeing freedom of speech and association. Analysts agree that all these changes would make small but important changes to the way Brazil is governed. Brazil's monthly inflation rate edged through the psychologically important 40 per cent mark in the period between December 16 and January 15, according to one of the main organisations which track price rises.</p>

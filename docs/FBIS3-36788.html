			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No One Knows the Price of the Signature..."] </F>   [Text] Lithuania failed to be first among East and Central  European countries to sign the "Partnership for Peace" [PFP]  program. The Romanian foreign minister already signed this  agreement on Wednesday [26 January] and ensured the possibility  for his country to be first to settle in the Supreme  Headquarters of Allied Powers in Europe [SHAPE] -- an office  building specially provided for states not belonging to NATO.  The Lithuanians secured a nook for themselves in this  two-storied house on Thursday, when President A. Brazauskas put  his signature under the agreement. However, history will include  us in the list of the "first ones" because Lithuania surpassed  all former USSR republics with its determination.    Observing the haste with which Lithuania rushed to sign the  PFP program, one may suspect that it was afraid of missing an  office in the SHAPE -- the first one is the winner. There even  was no time to find out the price of this nook situated 65 km  away from Brussels, and all additions -- maneuvers, humanitarian  and peacekeeping missions, conferences, and so on. Article 6 of  the PFP program reads that "states themselves finance their  participation in the PFP activities and share duties in  organizing maneuvers in which they themselves participate." The  president himself recalled this fact at the signing ceremony.    The situation is laughable: No one knows the price of  anything or what we will do in the PFP program, nevertheless, we  want to be the first everywhere with the political and sport  zeal typical of the Lithuanians.    The president's adviser D. Trinkunas claimed yesterday that  His Excellency knew only the approximate price of the PFP,  because his office did not make any estimates, and National  Defense Ministry [KAM] employees had to inform A. Brazauskas  about everything.    Meanwhile, E. Bajariunas, chief of the KAM International  Relations and Agreements Department and a member of the  government working group on the PFP, stated that there were no  accurate estimates because countries participating in the  program would themselves finance all events. According to him,  Lithuania will participate in the PFP as much as the budget  allows, because neither the KAM nor the Foreign Ministry has any  finances assigned to this program for this year.    Remembering the facts that 130 million litai this year  (about  $33 million) has been earmarked for KAM, and that according to  some officials, the PFP will cost Lithuania at least $10 million  a year, there is no doubt that the KAM will fail to finance this  program.    True, the figure $10 million also seems to be concocted,  because according to V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas  [parliament] National Security Committee, a company of "blue  helmets" would cost Lithuania from $30 to $40 million.  Certainly, one may expect assistance from neighboring  countries, particularly from Scandinavia. However, they will  hardly agree to cover such expenses. The notorious "armored"  bicycles from Sweden's military aid have caused enough laughter  throughout the world, and it would be high time to feel the  ground under one's feet while dreaming.    Nor is there any reason to expect that Lithuania will find  in  its budget sufficient resources to participate in joint NATO  maneuvers. There is a 165-million-litai deficit hole agape in  our "state coffers" as of today.    "We do not yet imagine how much our participation in the PFP  program will cost us," claimed the president at the 10 January  press conference.    Many changes were expected after A. Brazauskas' visit to  Brussels. Judging by the president's official statements and  media reports, however, financial issues passed in oblivion, as  fits an intelligentsia's company.    "We really have enough finances for summit visits,"  maintained E. Bajariunas and added immediately: "I am joking."  However, this joke reminds us of reality very much.    Certainly, Lithuania can refuse joint maneuvers,  peacekeeping  and humanitarian missions, and other costly integral parts of  the program. It is incomprehensible then, however, why we had  to sign this document at all. It is the participation in joint  military operations that can open the road to NATO in the future.    As an officer responsible for SHAPE's ties with Lithuania  has  reported, NATO countries will arrange almost 200 drills and  training courses this year. Lithuanian representatives have  been invited to 40 of them....</p>

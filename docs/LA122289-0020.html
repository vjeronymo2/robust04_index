			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Top 200 Art Collectors: Real estate developers lead the list of the world's top  200 art collectors, which includes a retired New York postman. The list, which  will appear in the January issue of ARTnews magazine, includes 114 Americans,  12 Japanese and 12 Englishmen. New York and California have more collectors  than any country, with the exception of the United States. Almost all the  collectors buy art with money they made themselves, reported compiler Richard  Walker, a contributing editor of ARTnews. Only 22 collectors on Walker's list  rely on inherited funds or money acquired through divorce. One of the  least-known of the self-made collectors is former New York City postman and  investor Herbert Vogel who, with his wife, Dorothy, has assembled a leading  collection of contemporary art, currently on a tour of museums across the  nation. Another is Joel Wachs, the Los Angeles city councilman, who parlayed a  $10,000 investment into an outstanding collection of post-World War II art.  CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> POLICE GIRD FOR CONFRONTATIONS OVER ABORTIONS  </P> <P> Police and protesters headed for a showdown as militant anti-abortion  demonstrators and pro-choice activists marshalled their troops and completed  their war plans on the eve of what promises to be three days of tense  confrontations at Southern California clinics.  </P> <P> Crusaders on both sides of the abortion issue were to begin fanning out before  dawn today to family planning clinics. Locations in many cases were kept secret  until the last minute to stymie police -- and the other side.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sit-Ins, Pickets  </P> <P> Members of the New York-based Operation Rescue anti-abortion organization,  moving a national campaign to the Los Angeles area, said they will stage  sit-ins and put up pickets at three to five clinics each day to prevent women  from obtaining abortions.  </P> <P> "Operation Rescue is going to have to obey the law," Mayor Tom Bradley said  Wednesday in pledging that police will arrest demonstrators who interfere with  patients. "The public needs to know that we're not going to permit someone to  come into this town, violate the law, disrupt this community and think they're  going to get away with it."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department, stung by charges that it has been too  lenient on Operation Rescue members in the past, promised to keep clinic doors  clear of rallying demonstrators who illegally try to block them.  </P> <P> Police opened an emergency operations center downtown to coordinate security  efforts and planned to set up command posts -- complete with field jail units  -- wherever protests spring up. Extra officers will be on patrol or on standby  in Los Angeles and in other suburban cities and will be deployed as needed,  police spokesmen said.  </P> <P> Four City Council members also announced that they will attend demonstrations  to guarantee that police safeguard the clinics. "Operation Rescue is kind of  like the Ayatollah Khomeini approach to public policy," Councilman Richard  Alatorre said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Arrests Made  </P> <P> The Police Department came under fire last month when Operation Rescue staged  protests that forced two clinics to close, yet no arrests were made. Members of  the City Council two weeks ago demanded -- and finally received -- assurances  that police will enforce trespassing and other laws to keep anti-abortion  demonstrators at bay. A federal court on March 2 ordered demonstrators to  remain 15 feet from clinic entrances.  </P> <P> Several clinic operators and pro-choice organizations, in meetings leading up  to this week's events, questioned whether some police leaders were sympathetic  with the anti-abortion forces, especially since several top commanders,  including the department's second in command, Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon,  are fundamentalist Christians.  </P> <P> Vernon, who is in charge of security operations during the days of protest,  said anti-abortion activists will not be allowed to break the law. "I'm going  to uphold the laws of this city," Vernon said in an interview.  </P> <P> Operation Rescue has stood out among anti-abortion groups because of its  militant, '60s-style tactics. On Wednesday, the Right to Life League of  Southern California, one of largest such groups in the nation, said it  understood Operation Rescue's frustration and the "sense of urgency to end this  American holocaust" but said it could not support its methods.  </P> <P> In another attempt to place a last-minute obstacle in the path of the  anti-abortion forces, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California  filed civil contempt charges against Operation Rescue in federal court on  Wednesday. The ACLU contends that Operation Rescue has defied the court order.  </P> <P> Demonstrators have disrupted health care services at various clinics in Fresno,  Chico, San Diego and Oakland and have "terrorized health-care clinic clients  and flagrantly disregarded the law," Carol Sobel, ACLU attorney, charged during  a press conference.  </P> <P> A hearing in U.S. District Court is set for April 24, and the suit will be  amended to include the names of those arrested during this week's  demonstrations, she added. The suit names Operation Rescue and its Southern  California organizers, Jeff White, Joseph Foreman and Randy Adler, and 100  other unnamed people.  </P> <P> "We believe they need more than a $25 fine and a slap on the wrist," Sobel  said. "If they face losing their homes and jobs they will think twice about  what they are doing."  </P> <P> But Operation Rescue has ignored thousands of dollars in fines as a result of  similar incidents throughout the country.  </P> <P> Operation Rescue leaders, meanwhile, held what they billed as a press  conference in a hotel in Orange, near their headquarters. Rather than answer  questions, however, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry displayed what he  said was a 19-week-old fetus that had been aborted.  </P> <P> "Ask the dead baby your questions," the 29-year-old former car salesman told  startled reporters before he and his entourage rushed out.  </P> <P> The organization is predicting that about 3,500 of its members -- many flown in  from other parts of the country -- will join the demonstrations, designed to  coincide with Holy Week.  </P> <P> The organization, made up mainly of religious fundamentalists, has justified  its sometimes illegal tactics by contending that it is "saving lives and will  only obey higher laws."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tension High at Clinics  </P> <P> On the eve of the planned protests, tension was high at the approximately 90  clinics in Southern California. Many clinic directors reported that their  clients have been frightened away from scheduled appointments out of fear of  confronting Operation Rescue picketers.  </P> <P> At the nine clinics run by Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles, the staff has  been calling all clients with scheduled appointments to let them know of the  possible confrontations, and to give them the option of rescheduling.  </P> <P> "A few have rescheduled but the majority (have) not," said Janice Sinclaire,  Planned Parenthood spokeswoman. "More often than not, the women have gotten  very angry because their right to privacy and health care is at stake, and they  say they will not be stopped."  </P> <P> Pro-choice forces promise to be out in numbers to escort women trying to enter  clinics and discourage Operation Rescue operatives.  </P> <P> "It's siege mentality. Isn't it sick?" said Patricia O'Neil, associate director  of the Feminist Women's Health Center in the mid-Wilshire area. "How would the  public react if this were happening in a cancer clinic? The public would not  tolerate it."  </P> <P> In scores of sit-ins around the country during the last year, including  Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia and Sunnyvale, Calif., Operation Rescue claims  20,000 arrests of its members, straining courts and jails in each targeted  city.  </P> <P> Los Angeles county and city officials are bracing for what a flood of arrests  will do to already-overburdened facilities.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, arrested demonstrators will be booked at field jail units,  temporary processing posts that are not designed to actually hold people. Some  will be released and others, including those who refuse to give their real  names, will be jailed.  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: C&amp;W alert The revival of rumours that Cable and Wireless could be considering a flotation for its Mercury telecoms subsidiary triggered a strong rise in C&amp;W shares, largely at the expense of its two UK telecoms rivals, BT and Vodafone. Dealers said the Mercury flotation story was one that cropped up regularly and had been circulating in the market late last week. They also pointed out that C&amp;W shares had underperformed the market by almost 11 per cent since the turn of the year, as part of a general underperformance by UK telecoms. BT shares have underperformed by some 15 per cent since the year-end. Adding to C&amp;W's woes have been the marked weakness of the Hong Kong dollar, which is linked to the US currency, and the steep decline in the Hong Kong stock market. 'C&amp;W were due a bounce and the press reports have given the market an excuse to do it,' said one trader. The stock closed 8 up at 444p. BT fell 7 1/2 to 364 1/2 p and the partly-paid 8 1/2 to 245 1/2 p. Vodafone, unsettled by press comment, slipped 7 1/2 to 537 1/2 p.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (12): The wind has been stirring again - Manchester and the North-West / Probably the best that can be said about the north-west is that things are no longer static and trends are certainly not going down As Graeme Wood, a partner in the Manchester office of property consultants King Sturge, puts it: 'The economic pendulum never swings as wildly in the north-west as it does in the south-east.' Nothing bubbled in north-west England in the late 1980s so nothing burst in the recession. Even the largest concentration of newly-built offices - in Manchester's former docklands at Salford Quays and Trafford Park - left a relatively minor but manageable oversupply problem when compared with London. The north-west found itself not so much in a deepening trough as in the doldrums. This year, the wind has been stirring again as the regional economy has picked up. Indeed, as DTZ Debenham Thorpe's Manchester office points out, the region's gross domestic product grew by 2.7 per cent last year compared with the UK's 2 per cent - a faster pick-up than any other UK region. Demand in property markets, which always lags, was bound to show itself this year. Although there is an underlying pent-up demand, however, take-up is patchy. Partly this is because industry and commerce is still unsure about recovery, limiting companies' confidence to move, but it is also the result of a shortage of good, modern space to move into. North-west England has a surfeit of old space in commercial, retail, and industrial markets, much of it unlettable. Alan Murch, managing director of Richard Ellis's regional practice, says 205,000 sq ft of office space came on the market in central Manchester in the first half of this year and take-ups or purchases totalled 157,000 sq ft. But this is in a local market that started 1994 with 1.3m sq ft of office space available. The figures suggest a reasonably quick take-up of good, air-conditioned space, but a continuing struggle to let a large rump of old offices. So, while there is optimism that the shortage of good space will drive a steady trickle of new developments, what to do about the old space is going to remain a problem, particularly when incentives to persuade businesses to relocate were tied to temporary subsidies of rentals in their old premises while they were being marketed. Office rentals betray the underlying reality. Although the top headline rent for the region - in Manchester's professional services core - has been at Pounds 21 a sq ft for a couple of years, DTZ Debenham Thorpe's research paints a gloomier picture. Its 1994 review puts the figure at Pounds 14.50 in 1990, rising through Pounds 20.50 in 1991 to Pounds 21.50 in 1992, but falling back through Pounds 18.50 to Pounds 17.50 this year. In Salford Quays - outside the Manchester core but only 10 minutes away - the net rate being paid for modern space with air-conditioning is less than Pounds 8, once incentives and special deals have been stripped out. People contemplating a move within the Manchester core, but not in such a hurry they cannot force prices down, say they do not expect to pay more than Pounds 16 net in the next year. Salford Quays' prices are proving attractive, especially since Manchester Ship Canal, now a subsidiary of Peel Holdings and one of the main developers, decided to break down some of its unlet properties into 50,000 sq ft or smaller packets, instead of waiting for big, single users wanting 120,000 sq ft at a time. British Nuclear Fuels is taking 50,000 sq ft, relocating some functions from Warrington and Preston. Halliwell Landau, an expanding Manchester law firm, has moved some functions out of the Manchester core to 'the Quays'. Robert Hough, ship canal chairman, says Quay West, the company's flagship office block, is now 90 per cent let. Of other developments in the old docklands, there appears now to be about 600,000 sq ft still unlet, but this compares with 1.5m sq ft less than 18 months ago. Mr Hough, however, points to an uncomfortable truth. Although low interest rates should encourage development, higher net rents will be needed to improve yields enough for anyone to do it. This in turn will require much more confidence generally throughout industry and commerce to persuade more people to move and so drive demand. With DTZ Debenham Thorpe estimating best office rents in Chester and Warrington at about Pounds 11.50 and at Pounds 11.00 in Liverpool, there does not appear much basis for optimism until the economy is much stronger. The industrial scene is even less encouraging. Roger Shufflebottom of Manchester's The Elliott Partnership says: 'Yields have dropped to unprecedented levels over the last nine months, with less than 7 per cent quoted in one case.' He says that after little activity in 1991 and 1992, there has been a slow increase in design-and-build industrial and warehousing projects for specific end-users. There has been hardly any speculative development - and then only in traditionally 'safe' areas near motorway junctions, such as Warrington and Trafford Park. But even these sites proved not as attractive as developers hoped, Mr Shufflebottom says, although - according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe - Warrington's average industrial rents have this year climbed back to their 1990 level of Pounds 4 a sq ft. Chester at Pounds 3, Liverpool at Pounds 3.30, Preston at Pounds 3.60 and Manchester at Pounds 3.85 have yet to recover the pre-recession levels. Probably the best that can be said about the north-west is that things are no longer static and trends are certainly not going down. But for the market to be healthy, there are still too many bargains about for industrial and commercial tenants who can afford them, and too little certainty of good long-term profits for developers to chance their arms.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Qantas/BA The Australian government's decision to privatise Qantas early next year could be finely timed. There is an international appetite for airline shares at present which will be given added edge by only 10 per cent of Qantas's stock being offered to foreign investors. Qantas has been restructuring with a vengeance following its merger with Australian Airlines. The industry background is also growing more favourable. The head of the International Air Transport Association yesterday forecast 'massive gains' for the industry in 1995 as traffic promised to rise ahead of new capacity. But there will be considerable nervousness ahead of the sale given the fragility of financial markets. The Australian stock market has fallen 8 per cent this year. By delaying the sale until 1995, the Australian government has left itself no room for manoeuvre if things turn really ugly. Other airlines, such as Lufthansa, which are stacking up to be privatised, will be watching closely. If Qantas cannot be successfully sold then other airlines have no chance. British Airways, which has already secured a 25 per cent shareholding, will be keen to aid the issue's success to validate its investment. Qantas's privatisation should also enable BA to forge closer links with a more commercially-minded carrier. BA is still aiming to plug a hole in its global alliance by linking up with a carrier in the north Pacific. That could benefit Qantas, too. But BA will have to proceed warily given the worries swirling around its involvement with the troubled USAir.</p>

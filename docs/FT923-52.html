			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pact disappointment hits coffee market COFFEE PRICES fell sharply in London yesterday as the market registered disappointment at the lack of definitive progress towards a new international coffee agreement at talks in London scheduled to end today. The London November robusta contract closed at Dollars 774 a tonne, down Dollars 23 on the day, after recovering from an earlier low of Dollars 763. In New York the December arabica contract was off by 1.40 cents in late trading at 53.85 cents a lb. Analysts believe the markets will head downwards again if today's final communique from the International Coffee Organisation is as anodyne as they expect. On Monday last week the markets shot up on optimism over the ICO talks, and the London robusta contract reached Dollars 816 a tonne. 'We have seen this euphoria at the start of each ICO meeting,' said Ms Judith Ganes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. 'And then as the meetings turned sour, the market quickly reversed course and tumbled to new contract lows.' It appears that nine days of talks will end with only one concrete sign of progress - a proper definition of the 'universal quota' - and that was agreed last Tuesday. Such an export quota system would be the foundation of any pact, but problems remained of defining controls and 'selectivity' - which would allow consumers to import the type of coffee they want. The principles of export control regulation have been broadly agreed in principle, and proposals on selectivity were being discussed late last night. But this was not likely to satisfy the markets, which were looking for definite progress towards a new pact, according to Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker. The ICO will meet again in December, but between now and then there is little chance of substantive negotiations behind the scenes. The US, the biggest consumer, has the Presidential elections coming up, and Brazil, the biggest producer, has presidential troubles of its own.</p>

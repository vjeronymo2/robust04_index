			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Threat of more rail strikes recedes THE THREAT of further strike action on British Rail receded last night as Aslef, the train drivers' union, settled its dispute with BR management and the main rail union, the RMT, agreed to resume talks today. The RMT will not call a third 24-hour stoppage this week and has told BR it wants to take part in 'intensive discussions'. BR, welcoming the move, confirmed fresh talks would be held today in London. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's personnel director, said: 'I hope that the RMT's willingness to reopen the dialogue means they will now demonstrate the sort of flexibility needed to end this damaging and fruitless dispute.' Aslef said it had reached a 'satisfactory' position with BR over its national agreement. Mr Derrick Fullick, Aslef general secretary, said BR had agreed to honour all national agreements incorporated in individual contracts of employment, including transfer and redundancy arrangements in the approach to privatisation. Mr Watkinson said of the Aslef settlement: 'This is welcome news for our passengers and freight customers. Settlement was achieved not by last Friday's strike, which was damaging and pointless, but by the two sides working out the best solution for both of them in an atmosphere of mutual goodwill.' The RMT has been attempting to get assurances from BR that there will be no compulsory redundancies and no further use of outside contractors. The union says there has been a softening in management's position over the past few days. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the union was 'going to test BR's good faith' in the talks. If management wanted a negotiated settlement 'all the elements are there', he said.</p>

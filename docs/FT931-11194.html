			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Kohl fails over subsidies for east THE German government is to press ahead with draft legislation to implement its planned solidarity pact for east Germany, after Chancellor Helmut Kohl failed to reach agreement on sharing the burden yesterday with the premiers of the 16 federal states. The battle over how to finance the soaring cost of subsidies to east Germany has now been postponed to a full-scale conference between the central government and the federal states, scheduled for March 11 and 12, the two sides announced last night. In spite of the recognition that there are profound differences between them, and the government's insistence that it will now press ahead with its own plans for a supplementary budget, and longer term spending cuts, there was relief at the willingness to keep negotiating on an overall agreement. The need for both the central government and the states to agree on a comprehensive package of budget cuts in the west, in order to finance subsidies in the east, was undoubtedly underlined by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the German Bundesbank, who attended yesterday's talks between Mr Kohl and the 16 state premiers. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of the state of Saxony, in east Germany, and a Christian Democrat such as Mr Kohl, said everyone accepted the need to agree a package. He said that they were not simply arguing over dividing up budget cuts, but over a complete new system of public spending in the country. The tussle is focused on a budget gap of DM110bn (Pounds 46bn) calculated for 1995, the year when a new division of taxes, and financial subsidies to the poorest regions, has to be agreed between central government and the states in both east and west. Until then, subsidies to the east are being borne by the German Unity Fund, largely financed by borrowing on the capital markets. The new system will then dictate the distribution of funds between east and west for the foreseeable future. The decision to table draft legislation in the cabinet on March 4, the day after Mr Kohl returns from a trip to the Far East, is influenced by the government's determination to maintain the pressure on all the parties to the proposed pact, and not allow it to be delayed by the complex debate over burden sharing. There is growing confidence in government circles that a reasonable compromise can be reached in the ongoing wage talks with public sector workers, which reopened in Stuttgart yesterday. A settlement of around three per cent, compared with a current inflation rate running still above four per cent, would be a great relief to both central and state governments. Arbitration also starts in the east today on the dispute between engineering workers and employers on long-term wage contracts: the employers are fighting to delay payment of a 26 per cent pay rise, due on April 1, and equalisation of eastern and western wages from April, 1994. Reasonable wage deals on both fronts would be seen as a crucial contribution to the so-called 'solidarity pact,' in exchange for which the government is ready to prolong its subsidies of eastern manufacturing industries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Giuliana Chiappe] </F>   [Text] Loan assistance granted by the Venezuelan Central  Bank [BCV] rose 1,000 percent from early January to mid-March of  1994. The loans granted totaled 342.013 billion bolivares on 18  March.    According to the latest report on weekly indicators, the BCV  statements show the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection  Fund [Fondo de Garantia de Depositos y Proteccion Bancaria--  Fogade] received most of that amount, or 308 billion bolivares,  to be granted in turn for financial assistance to Banco  Hipotecario de Occidente and seven banking institutions having  problems of liquidity. The BCV has loaned 35.435 billion  bolivares directly to commercial banks in the form of  anticipated payments, discounts and securities borrowing, and by  regular methods of loan assistance. During the second week of  March, mortgage banks required 270 million bolivares, whereas  financial corporations did not require direct aid.    During the previous week, the nominal increase was 29.698  billion bolivares, because by 11 march the BCV's loan assistance  was 312.314 billion bolivares; 35.085 billion bolivares went to  commercial banks, and 276.959 billion bolivares went to public  institutions, a segment in which Fogade is included.    At the start of January, the BCV's outlook for loan  assistance was totally different. By 1 January granted loans  totaled 29.073 billion bolivares. Banks had barely needed 23.128  billion bolivares, whereas public institutions needed 5.945  billion bolivares.    The financial crisis, heightened by the closure and  intervention of Banco Latino, absorbed 1,000 percent more than  the figure registered in January. More precisely, the aid went  up 1.076 percent.    Requests for money in general decreased during the week of  18  March, in relation to the week of 11 March, as BCV officials  reported when they explained the results of their studies on the  institution's activities during the past period:    "BCV's actions were aimed at lending credit aid, directly  and  through Fogade, to institutions that have problems of liquidity,  although to a lesser degree than during the preceding week."  <H5>  Regarding Other Operations </H5>   The BCV concentrated on selling zero coupon bonds [bonos  cero  cupon] and did so in record amounts for the ones with the  regular 91-day validity and even, for the first time in 1994,  for the ones valid for 184 days. Furthermore, it placed  Government Treasury notes into private operations.    Liquidity during the week studied by the BCV increased by  1.3  percent, due to a 1.4-percent increase in cash deposits  [depositos a la vista] and a 2.8-percent increase in savings.    The monetary base increased .7 percent due to the "incidence  of expansion" created by Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation's  internal financial effort and the financial institution's credit  aid, "all of which was not compensated in the base absorption  carried out by the institution through open market operations  and the sale of foreign exchange."    Commercial banks' acquisitioning and placing of assets  increased at the same 1.3-percent rate during the week.  Concerning investments, clients preferred cash deposits, which  increased 3.4 percent.

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Journalist questioned on Berlusconi scandal leak Fresh controversy has blown up over illicit payments on football player transfers allegedly made by the Fininvest group, owned by Italy's aspiring politician Mr Silvio Berlusconi. The row has been simmering since last Wednesday when Tv5, one of Fininvest's three national television channels, announced that Milan magistrates had sought authorisation to arrest six senior Fininvest executives. The arrests were allegedly connected to the payment of undeclared sums on the transfer to cup-winning AC Milan of Turin's prize player 'Gigi' Lentini in 1992. Milan magistrates immediately claimed the news had been deliberately leaked and took possession of a copy of the Tv5 video of the announcement. They suspected the news was made public to avoid high profile arrests of persons linked to Mr Berlusconi at a sensitive moment in the campaign for the March 27 general elections. Yesterday, the magistrates interrogated a Tv5 journalist about the leak, a day after a Milan judge declined a request for the arrest of the six Fininvest officials. It was later announced that the journalist was formally under investigation for aiding and abetting. The officials included Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, the head of Publitalia, the advertising arm of Fininvest, and the organisational core around which Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia political movement has been built. Mr Dell'Utri is part of Mr Berlusconi's inner circle and is widely credited with having helped persuade Mr Berlusconi to enter the political ring. Mr Berlusconi himself has claimed he and Fininvest are being persecuted by the Milan magistrates in a political vendetta. However, yesterday the magistrates let it be known they were continuing their investigations into the transfer operations of AC Milan. A former head of Turin football club has alleged that at least L6bn (Pounds 2.43m) was paid through foreign banks to secure the Lentini transfer  - on top of the sum officially declared.</p>

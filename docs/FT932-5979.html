			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Negotiating the barriers  -Charles Batchelor continues a series answering questions on the European single market The Growing Business Page's Single Market Q&amp;A series is intended to allow readers to raise issues prompted by the formal launch of the single European market on January 1 1993 In theory the barriers have come down in Europe but in practice doing business across borders can be complex and time consuming. FINDING COMPATIBLE QUALIFICATIONS Q: We are consulting civil and structural engineers engaged in several design projects in Germany. In order to obtain the necessary building permit approval we have been using a local German consultant to sign our design documentation. However, if we could establish that the various engineering qualifications were compatible within the EC then we would not need to employ the middle-man and would be more cost efficient. What is the relationship between the German Dipl. Ing. degree qualifications and the British Chartered Engineer status? A: The German Dipl. Ing. is an academic qualification obtained after at least three years of study. In Britain, the title of Chartered Engineer is gained on the successful completion of a degree (accredited by a nominated institution of the Engineering Council), as well as two years training and two years relevant experience. To obtain building permit approval in Germany a British engineer would have to prove a theoretical qualification - at least three years of study and at least two years of practice in the required field. The engineer would then apply to the regional Architektenkammer (chamber of architects) which would verify documentation and include the engineer on the official list of architects. Once on the architects list the engineer should be able to obtain approvals from the Bauordnungs amt (office for building regulations). Each German Land has its own building regulations, so British engineers must apply to the chamber of architects in the Land where they want to work. However, once an engineer has been recognised in one Land there should be no problem in obtaining recognition in another. Freedom to work anywhere in the EC is one of the basic rights laid down by the Treaty of Rome. The first general directive (89/48/EEC) on the freedom of establishment of professionals was adopted in 1989. It applies to any profession regulated in some way by the state and for which at least three years full-time education and training at university or equivalent level is required. Among professions covered are lawyers, accountants, teachers, engineers and physiotherapists. COMPENSATION FOR RELOCATION Q: Is there any EC legislation governing the allocation of monetary compensation to staff as part of a relocation package. I am an American national, the head office of my company is in Holland and I will be moving from the Far East to Austria. A: No EC legislation has been proposed in this area. In the situation outlined it is probable that the Dutch parent company has general employment policy guidelines in line with EC employment law. However, those guidelines would have to conform to Austrian labour law. Austria is not a member of the Community. GUIDE FOR WINE IMPORTERS Q: I wish to import wine from France. Is there a reference book containing the names and addresses of growers/negotiants in France? What are the VAT implications on the purchase and export of wine for commercial purposes? Does a current list of wholesale wines exist? A: A reference book titled Grappe lists the producers/negotiants by wine-growing region and covers all of France. This appears to be the most complete publication of its type and is published by Vininfo at 30 Quai des Chartrons, 33000 Bordeaux, at a cost of FFr680 (Pounds 80). Vininfo also offers the information in computerised form, charged at FFr1.40 per address. French VAT is payable at time of purchase in France if the producer is not registered for VAT in the UK. Otherwise, VAT is payable on importation into the UK. There does not appear to be a centralised list of current wholesale prices covering all French wines. However, the Bordeaux vineyard publishes an annual list of average prices per barrel for each wine-growing region. In addition, the Burgundy/Macon vineyard compiles a list of wholesale prices for different vintages. For these lists contact: Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bordeaux, 1 Cours du XXX Juillet, 33075 Bordeaux. Tel: 56 00 22 66. Fax: 56 00 22 77. Comite Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bourgogne/Macon, Maison de la Saone et Loire, 389 Ave. du Mal de Lattre de Tassigny, 71000 Macon. Tel: 85 38 20 15. General information on the labelling, bottling, packaging and documentation of wine imported into the UK is available from the Wine and Spirit Association of Great Britain at 1 Queen Street Place, London EC4R 1XX. Tel: 071 248 5377. PENSIONS POSE PORTABILITY PROBLEM Q: I am looking for clarification of the position of someone with a UK company pension who wishes to work in another EC member state. Is it possible to take out a pension in one member state while working elsewhere in the Community? It seems strange that the funds paid in by individuals to pension schemes can be used by pension companies and invested across the Community while the individuals providing these funds do not have the same freedom. A: No, it is not possible to maintain a pension taken out in one member state if you move permanently to work in another. This continuation of pension contributions is not prevented by EC legislation but by national legislation. For example, UK tax law states that, unless you are taxable in the UK on your earnings, pension contributions are disallowed. However, if you maintain your taxable status and residency in the UK then you can continue to contribute. This refers to both company and private pensions. Although there is a movement towards finding a solution to the restrictions you mention, there has been very little development in terms of harmonisation and the portability of pension schemes throughout the Community. This is mainly because of the diversity of pensions schemes that exist in the member states and as a result national legislation prevails. If you are moving permanently to one of the member states, it might be possible to arrange for a transfer of your UK pension rights to a scheme set up by your new employer. However, this would depend on the structure of your existing pension scheme. The same applies to private pension schemes. It is only possible to transfer your pension if a complementary system exists in the country you move to. If, however, you are posted temporarily by your employers to work in another member state it is possible to remain in the UK company pension scheme for up to 10 years. If you move abroad permanently and you are no longer paying UK income tax nor earning as a resident of the UK, the simplest course of action would be to allow your UK company scheme to continue to grow tax free. A number of UK pension providers offer off-shore pension plans to expatriates. In the UK there are no restrictions on the investment of pension funds within the Community. However, restrictions of this kind of operation do exist in other member states. A draft directive on the investment of pension funds across the Community is currently being considered by an EC Council working party. SEEKING INFORMATION ON SOURCES OF FUNDING Q: We are looking for information on EC sources of funding for companies for research and development programmes, training and business development. A: There is such a wide range of EC programmes in these areas that it is best to refer to one of the detailed publications available. A Guide to the European Community Grants and Loans, compiled by Tony Reid, Eurofi PLC, Guildgate House, Pelican Lane, Newbury, Berkshire, RG13 INK. Tel: 0635 31900. 340 pages. Price Pounds 140. Finance from Europe: A Guide to Grants and Loans from the European Community, compiled for the London Office of the European Commission. Currently being revised. 32 pages. Free. These can be examined at your local European Information Centre and at many business libraries. Previous features in this series appeared on May 4 and March 9.

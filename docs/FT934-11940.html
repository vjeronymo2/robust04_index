			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (12): New focus of attention - Emerging markets / Equities INVESTMENT in the world's emerging equity markets has, like the markets themselves, been booming in recent months. One of the driving forces behind the rally has been a realisation that economies in those countries designated as having emerging markets - Latin America, China, India and many countries on the Pacific Rim - are forecast to grow faster than the developed world. Interest has also been aided by the increasing number of emerging market funds available to investors, as well as by the growth in privatisation issues from emerging markets and, in some cases, the liberalisation of controls on direct investment. Mr Lee Chautin, of Baring Securities emerging markets team, notes that in the past month or so the performance of emerging markets has been phenomenal. As a result, record highs have recently been attained in a number of the markets, including Turkey, Manila and Jakarta. Among Latin America's emerging markets Brazil has shown the strongest gains so far this year - according to data compiled by the IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank - and equities there have registered a rise of more than 90 per cent in dollar terms since January 1. Mr Chautin says that a significant factor behind the rally in the world's emerging markets has been US investors focusing their attention on this area. 'We have been seeing US institutional money coming in for the first time, rather than just specialist funds, with mainstream pension funds beginning to allocate assets,' he says. This change of investment attitude is reiterated by Mr Dan Smaller of Lehman Brothers. 'A lot of US money has been directed into Europe, and from there to the smaller European markets. There has been good buying in Greece and Portugal, particularly on falling interest rates'. The Greek equity market has remained positive in spite of dipping after the general election was called. The victory by the socialist's, and the subsequent return to power of Mr Andreas Papandreou, has not altered investment prospects. Mr Smaller said that the market still remained one of the cheaper emerging markets and that the smooth transition of power underlined support for the market. While one of the new government's actions was to cancel the planned privatisation of OTE, the Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation, which had been estimated to raise some Dollars 1.2bn, analysts expect an alternative privatisation programme to be put in place. Turkey has had a phenomenal run so far this year with the market having advanced by more than 140 per cent in dollar terms in the year to September, according to the latest emerging markets index issued by Baring Securities. Further gains are forecast for Turkish equities as domestic interest rates are reduced and the government reins in the budget deficit. The growth in privatisation issues, including the sale of the government's stake in Tofas, the car assembly division of Fiat of Italy, will inevitably arouse overseas interest. The Tofas sale, which is expected to raise around Dollars 500m, will be the largest international offering by a Turkish company. The favourite method for investment in Latin American markets, especially among US investors, has been, and to a large extent, continues to be through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), which are freely traded on the US stock exchanges. There are some 34 Latin American companies listed on Wall Street and Telebras, Brazil's state-owned telecommunications group, is due to join the list this year. Trading in ADRs by foreign investors can exert a tremendous influence on the domestic markets: for example, it is estimated that around 50 per cent of Mexico's daily volume is conducted by foreign investors in New York trading, particularly in Telmex, the telephone group. However, Mr Chautin of Baring Securities believes that ADRs do not offer enough diversification to enable the construction of a proper portfolio. He comments that while ADRs are a simple way for US institutions to get involved in emerging markets, there are not enough of them to get a spread of the market. On the other hand, says Mr Smaller of Lehman Brothers, ADRs do offer investors the pick of the best companies, backed up by first-rate research by analysts. 'Nevertheless, it is true to say that while the investor will get a good idea of a market, the small gems nestling there may not be dug out,' he adds. Direct investment in an emerging market is an alternative, if a much more risky approach. India has seen some direct investment, comments Mr Peter Bristowe of HG Asia, but funds remain the most popular method, with a number of new ones having been launched this year. The Indian authorities liberalised foreign portfolio investment late last year; but it was not until this August that foreign money was seen coming into the equity market in a serious fashion, and triggering a market rally. Indonesia has also been enjoying a good rally and is completely dominated by foreign investors, says Mr Bristowe. Investment opportunities here are relative easy, with few restrictions on the repatriation of capital gains or dividends. Activity from overseas has also been encouraged by reports that the government may increase the limit on foreign ownership of listed shares, at present at 49 per cent. The satisfactory economic background has provided an incentive while the relative currency stability has seen interest rates fall from around 23 per cent to 12 per cent. Inflation has fallen, while less dependence on oil exports and development of manufacturing exports has provided a strong backdrop, says Mr Bristowe. China's fledgling equity markets, in Shenzhen and Shanghai, have excited enormous interest this year, with foreign capital being directed into China plays quoted in Hong Kong and other Pacific Rim markets. A large number of China funds have been launched, with a target of up to Dollars 1bn; but, comments Mr Bristowe, most of the cash remains locked up with institutions reluctant as yet to enter the B share markets, particularly given that these shares are trading at a discount to those available to local investors. However, most analysts consider that any investment in China must be taken on a long-term view, forecasting that within five years the country's equity markets will be the dominant force in the region.</p>

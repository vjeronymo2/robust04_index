			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTLAKE BOATERS MARK THE 4TH WITH USUAL BALLOON  BARRAGE  </P> <P> The water balloon warriors of Westlake Lake enjoyed their annual pitched battle  Tuesday, celebrating Independence Day by declaring their independence from a  rule against their annual ritual.  </P> <P> Residents of the island in the lake, which straddles the Los Angeles -- Ventura  County border -- largely ignored a decision by their homeowners association to  prohibit the Fourth of July tradition, in which revelers in boats exchange  volleys of water balloons hurled by hand or with special launchers.  </P> <P> The Westlake Management Assn. said the ban was necessary because of fears that  someone would be injured.  </P> <P> "Thank God we live in a democracy," said a breathless and dripping-wet Mary  Jacobs, who organized a petition drive protesting the ban. Jacobs said two  security officers hired to prevent water balloon combat gave up after  half-hearted efforts to enforce the ban.  </P> <P> "They had the Gestapo out here, but it didn't matter. There's two or three  hundred people out there throwing water ballons. This is the most wonderful  birthday party for our nation," she said.  </P> <P> Rod Hansen, homeowners association president, also expressed satisfaction,  saying the ban was mainly aimed at powerful, slingshot-type launchers devised  by some water balloon buffs, and no such launchers were seen this year.  </P> <P> "It's OK as long as it's within reasonable limits," he said. "Everything seems  to be under control."  </P></p>

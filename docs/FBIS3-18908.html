Last year  alone exports to this region increased by 11.9 percent, while  overall exports went down.    Even though Japan remained the most important market in the  Far East despite its recession and the resulting decline in  Austrian exports, deliveries to most other Far Eastern countries  also increased. Thus, last year exports to South Korea went up  by 50 percent, those to China and Thailand by about 40 percent,  to Indonesia by 24 percent, to Hong Kong by 11 percent, and to  Taiwan and Singapore by almost 7 percent. Heavy losses had to  be accepted in India, however,  <H5>  Prospects for the Future </H5>   Despite the increase in exports, the share of the Far East  in  Austria's total exports is rather modest with 5.3 percent. In  1989 it was, however, just 4 percent. Egon Winkler, head of the  Foreign Trade Department of the Economic Chamber, told DIE  PRESSE that this region is still underrepresented compared with  comparable states, such as Denmark, Sweden, or the Netherlands.    However, there is the hope that the exports to the Far East  will continue to rise this year and in the coming years despite  the potential membership in the European Union [EU], because,  after all, this is economically the most dynamic area of the  world, which has also contributed to the success of domestic  exports. However, it was also the losses in Austrian exports to  the EU that made the Austrian companies get more interested in  the Asian market.    Winkler stresses that the programs of his organization have  proved their worth in the Far East. The number of Austrian  companies in the Far East is rising constantly: At the moment  there are about 800 such companies.    In 1993 imports from the Far East declined by 2.1 percent,  the share in overall imports is 9.15 percent. The Austrian  trade balance deficit, however, is gigantic: Exports are only  half as high as imports.</p>

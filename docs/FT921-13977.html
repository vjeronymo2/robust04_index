			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Letter: An exhortation to spend Sir, I agree with Michael Keevill (Personal View, January 16) that the construction industry needs a kick-start. He suggests that the way to achieve this is for government to permit local authorities to spend more of their capital receipts from the sale of council houses. However, according to the prime minister in a letter to the British Constructional Steelwork Association on December 16, the fault lies with the local authorities. He states: 'Local authorities have considerable scope to increase investment in new construction without any change in the current rules. Last year, they reported the availability of some Pounds 3.5bn of capital receipts, but spent only 62 per cent of that amount.' Local authorities take note - the prime minister is urging you to spend] Derek Tordoff, BCSA, 4 Whitehall Court, Westminster, London SW1A 2ES</p>

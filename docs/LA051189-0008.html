			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN AND TAKEOVERS  </P> <P> Jones' column overviewing the takeover of a lumber mill and subsequent disdain  for the employees and rape of the environment is typical of the results of  LBOs.  </P> <P> History does not support that LBOs result in more efficient and competitive  companies benefiting employees, stockholders and the general economy. Were that  the case, our country would begin building better quality products and  generating more innovative ideas for the marketplace through research and  development.  </P> <P> The real motivation for LBOs is greed. But this greed is not limited to the  Milken variety of predator. They take full advantage of the greed of senior  executives who create golden parachutes while many employees lose their jobs,  pensions and insurance. The stockholders' greed is evidenced by their desire  for short-term profits. It is time we stopped hand-wringing about the rape of  our industries and begin taking action.  </P> <P> ESOP is one method of getting involved as the lumber company employees hope to  accomplish by buying back their company. Stockholders should profit on their  investment but why not help by getting more involved. Ask questions about the  company's ability to compete by turning out a better quality product. Is it  making a long-range commitment to R&amp;D rather than an excessive concern with  next quarter's earnings?  </P> <P> ROBERT COSTES  </P> <P> West Hills  </P></p>

Wicks is the President and Radiation Safety Office for Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc. (WIX), Evanston, Wyoming. WIX holds License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30 and 34. The license authorizes the licensee to possess sealed sources of iridium-192 in various radiography devices for use in performing industrial radiography in accordance with the conditions of the license. The license was suspended by NRC Order on June 16, 1994, and remains suspended while a hearing requested by the licensee is pending. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The suspension of License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 was based on the results of NRC staff inspections and Office of Investigations (OI) investigations of WIX conducted in April 1993 and in January and March 1994. These inspections and investigations identified numerous violations of NRC's radiation safety requirements, including some violations that were found to have recurred after being identified in previous inspections and some which were found to have been committed deliberately by Mr. Wicks and other employees of WIX. These violations were described in inspection reports 030&hyph;232190/93&hyph;01 and 030&hyph;32190/94&hyph;01 issued on May 12, 1993, and were the subject of an enforcement conference held April 1, 1994 in Arlington, Texas, during which Mr. Wicks was given the opportunity to provide additional information concerning each violation. In Investigation Report 4&hyph;93&hyph;017R, issued August 2, 1993, OI found three deliberate violations and in Report 4&hyph;93&hyph;049R, issued July 8, 1994, OI found four deliberate violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on its review of all available information, the NRC concludes that Mr. Wicks violated the provisions of 10 CFR 30.10 which prohibits individuals from deliberately causing a licensee to violate NRC requirements and from deliberately providing materially incomplete or inaccurate information to the NRC or to a licensee of the NRC. Specifically, as discussed below in more detail, the NRC concludes that: (1) Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to send an employee's thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) in for immediate processing after he learned of a radiography incident that occurred on July 31, 1993, a violation of 10 CFR 34.33(d); (2) Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to perform an evaluation of the same employee's radiation exposure after becoming aware of the incident, a violation of 10 CFR 20.201; (3) Mr. Wicks deliberately provided inaccurate information to NRC investigators about the July 31, 1993, incident and his follow-up to the incident, a violation of 10 CFR 30.10; and (4) During March, April, and July of 1993 and January 1994, Mr.Wicks deliberately failed to ensure that calibrated alarm ratemeters were provided and used by WIX radiography personnel, a violation of 10 CFR 34.33(f)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first three violations above are directly related to the July 31, 1993, radiography incident. That incident, which was reported to Mr. Wicks on the date it occurred, by the two WIX employees who were involved in it, involved a radiation source in a radiographic exposure device not being properly returned to its shielded position before the device was moved by one of the employees. This resulted in the self-reading pocket dosimeter of one of the employees, a radiographer's assistant, going off-scale, indicating that the radiographer's assistant received a radiation exposure beyond the range of the pocket dosimeter. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  When the pocket dosimeter of someone engaged in radiography is discharged beyond its normal range, NRC regulations in 10 CFR Parts 34 and 20, respectively, require: (1) That the licensee send the individual's TLD in for immediate processing to determine the individual's radiation exposure; and (2) that the licensee perform evaluations as necessary, whether or not a TLD reading is available, to determine the individual's radiation exposure and to ensure compliance with NRC exposure limits. In this case, the NRC concludes that Mr. Wicks deliberately did neither and that he has not been truthful in providing information about this incident to NRC personnel and others. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Later reenactments of the incident resulted in an estimate that the radiographer's assistant received 6 rems, and exposure in excess of the NRC occupational quarterly limit of 3 rems in effect at the time of the incident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the NRC began its investigation of this incident in January 1994, Mr. Wicks had no record of the radiographer's assistant's exposure for the day or month in question. Mr. Wicks stated during the investigation and at the enforcement conference that after learning of the incident he sent all TLDs worn by company personnel during the month of July 1993 in one package to Landauer, Inc., the company that processes TLDs for WIX, and that he included a note requesting immediate processing of the TLD worn by the radiographer's assistant. However, a representative of Landauer, Inc., stated to NRC personnel that while it had received TLDs from WIX for other employees for the month of July 1993, it had no record of receiving a TLD for the radiographer's assistant for that month and no record of receiving a request from Mr. Wicks for expedited processing of any TLDs sent in for that month. In fact, exposure records for the month of July 1993 and quarterly records for the months of July&hyph;September 1993 which were mailed by Landauer to WIX and retained by WIX contain no information regarding the radiographer's assistant's exposure for the month of July 1993 (her exposure records for all other months are available). <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Wicks claims that he was unaware of this fact until the NRC questioned him in January 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

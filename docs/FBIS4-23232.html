			<p>BFN     [Text] ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in  Liberia] leader, Alhaji Koromah, says the dissolution of  Liberia's warring factions by the Liberian State Council is  illegal. Mr. Koromah told newsmen in Monrovia that the Cotonou  Peace Accord provides for the dissolution of the NPRA [National  Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] Government and the Interim  Governrment of National Unity, and not the factions to the  Liberian conflict. He said the Council of State is a creation  of the warring factions, and its chairman cannot take unilateral  decision to dissolve the factions. The ULIMO leader called on  the State Council to reverse its decision on the dissolution of  the warring factions.    State Council chairman, David Kpomakpor, recently announced  the dissolution of the warring factions.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCOUNT BROKERS  </P> <P> As a full-service, full-time real estate broker in California who has  successfully worked in the field for 20 years, I have seen discount broker  stories before: 1966, 1979 and now 1989. All that David W. Myers' story tells  me is that we have reached another peak in a bull market, and we are less than  a year from seeing sales fall sharply and prices either stabilizing or  declining slightly for a while.  </P> <P> In a rapidly rising market, it is easy to find a buyer and very difficult to  price or value property so as to maximize the seller's investment income.  Brokers are the surest way for a seller to protect himself as they give  properties the widest exposure to the greatest number of buyers.  </P> <P> The statement that brokers' costs have not risen as much as prices of homes  reflects a naivete about even the cost of newspaper advertising, which has  almost doubled over the past five years. And brokers are taking many, many more  ads to get the job of selling resale homes done. During the same period, the  number of documents and the responsibility of brokers assigned by the Internal  Revenue Service and the state has grown 500%.  </P> <P> Lastly is the matter of liability assumed by all brokers in doing the right job  for the consumer. When a buyer or seller uses a broker who is a so-called "full  service" company he has the comfort of knowing that in good times and bad,  whenever he has a problem or a mistake has been made, he has a place that is  still in business to look to for satisfaction.  </P> <P> The discount brokers seem only to last one cycle, so they are fair-weather  companies only. Look at the names today, none is the same as 1979. In real  estate, like all other things, you get what you pay for.  </P> <P> JAMES R.

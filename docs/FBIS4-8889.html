			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Piotr Winczorek, under the "Observations" </F> rubric]    [Text] It is not a very good idea to change the  constitutional powers of the president in the area of appointing  people to governmental posts. It is not good to propose such a  notion as a result of a dispute concerning the filling of the  post of finance minister. It is not a good custom to shape the  law, especially the Constitution, according to current political  needs.    The president's reaction to this idea was quite violent. He  announced that an attempt to implement this idea might end up in  earlier-than-scheduled parliamentary elections. However, before  such elections can take place, the present Sejm and Senate must  first be dissolved. In the legal state defined by the Small  Constitution, it is possible to discontinue the term of the  parliament only in a limited number of cases.    The Sejm may be dissolved by its own resolution reached by  the majority of two-thirds of the votes of the deputies. If we  look at the present composition of the Sejm and the desire of  the Sejm's majority to work until the end of the four-year term  of office, it will become clear that it is very unlikely for  this condition to be satisfied.    The Sejm may also be dissolved by the president:    --If, within three months from the submission of the budget  bill, it is not passed. The 1994 budget law was passed in the  allotted time, and it was signed a few days ago by the  president. The possibility of taking advantage of this chance to  dissolve the Sejm may appear only in more than a year.    --If the Sejm passes a no-confidence vote against the  government and, at the same time, does not appoint a new prime  minister.    --If, after various possibilities of establishing the  government, envisioned by the Small Constitution, are exhausted,  the Sejm does not do this with the majority of two-thirds of the  votes.    --If the Sejm, after all the possibilities of establishing  the government are exhausted, refuses to support a government  established by the president for a period of six months. In  such a case, it is obligatory for the president to dissolve the  Sejm.    It is easy to see that, as long as the present government of  the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish  Peasant Party exists, the possibilities mentioned in the last  three points are out of the question.    Because these are all the possibilities of dissolving the  Sejm and the Senate, defined by the Small Constitution, the  answer to the question of how earlier-than-scheduled  parliamentary elections can legally be held should be given by  those who can see such a possibility.</p>

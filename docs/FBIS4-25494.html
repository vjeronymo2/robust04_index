			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] At the provincial help-the-poor and development  working meeting, which closed on the afternoon of 5 June,  provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng urged leading cadres at  all levels to deepen their understanding, strengthen leadership,  and fulfill the great task of helping the poor through  development.    During the meeting, in light of local conditions,  representatives from all parts of the province held earnest  discussions on how to implement the province's help-the-poor  plan for this year and eliminate backwardness in the poor areas  as quickly as possible and offered good suggestions and opinions.    Present at the meeting were leading comrades including Yin  Kesheng, Cai Zhulin, Wang Hanmin, Yao Xiangcheng, Huanjie  Cailang, Mao Yuanbiao, Bai Ma, and Liu Guanghe, and Han Yingxuan  [provincial CPPCC chairman].    At the meeting, Ying Kesheng put forth concrete measures to  organize implementation of the province's help-the-poor plan for  this year and made an important speech on how to do a good job  of carrying out this year's help-the-poor work.    In his speech, Yin Kesheng said: Historic achievements have  been made in the economies of both our province's rural and  pastoral areas since the drive of reform and opening up to the  outside world was carried out. Nevertheless, hamstrung by  historical, geographical, and other elements, 1.19 million  peasants in our province still have problems of food and  clothing. The 1990's are crucial to our province in pursuing  the goal of the second-step strategy. Paying close attention to  the work of helping the poor through development is part and  parcel of the goal. Thus we should understand and approach the  work from the level of the overall situation of the national  economy. While encouraging the areas which have relatively good  conditions to continue to maintain the momentum of rapid  development, we should help the poor areas speed up the pace of  their development and construction to boost the province's  economic strength, promote common prosperity and progress among  all nationalities, and maintain social stability. He pointed  out that the work of helping the poor through development is a  social systems engineering undertaking. We should correctly  handle the relationship between taking stopgap and radical  measures and between long-term and immediate interests, be good  at grasping the principal contradiction, and concentrate forces  on improving basic conditions for production and enhancing the  ability of poor areas to develop themselves. [passage omitted]    Yin emphasized that implementation of the help-the-poor and  development plan is a task which has a strong policy, social,  and mass character. We should attach greater importance to the  work of helping the poor through development than we did in the  past. Party committees and governments at all levels should put  the work on the agenda as an important task. Principal party  and government leaders should personally take up the job, take  the overall situation into account, and make overall plans. The  provincial party committee and government decided to introduce a  prefectural, city, and county principal administrative leader  responsibility system in implementing the province's  help-the-poor plan for this year. [passage omitted]    Vice Governor Ma Yuanbiao presided over the current meeting  and set requirements for the transmission and implementation of  the spirit of the meeting.</p>

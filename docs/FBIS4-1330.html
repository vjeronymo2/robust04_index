			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 25 SAPA -- Eight Conservative Party  [CP] city councillors from Pretoria have joined the Freedom  Front [FF], FF spokesman Stephan Maninger said on Monday. This  was part of the "overwhelming support" the FF and its leader  General Constand Viljoen were attracting countrywide from CP and  National Party [NP] members, he said in a statement.    Over the weekend two senior CP MPs, Tom Langley and Dries  Bruwer, defected to the FF. Mr Bruwer is also president of the  Transvaal Agricultural Union. Last week 11 CP-controlled town  councils pledged support for Gen Viljoen.    In a seperate statement Mr Maninger dismissed as "devoid of  all truth" rumours that the FF was considering forming a  coalition with the NP. The policies of the FF and the NP were  "world's apart" and such a coalition could never happen because  the NP was already in a de facto alliance with the African  National Congress, he said.    The rumours had originated from the rightwing broadcaster  Radio Pretoria, Mr Maninger said. Critising the radio station,  Mr Maninger said Radio Pretoria had in the past broadcast the  opinions of individuals as facts. He accused the radio station  of biased reporting, saying that the broadcaster did not "even  tolerate differing views anymore".</p>

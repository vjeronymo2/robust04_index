Japanese sources said the talks between a nonpartisan group  of eight Japanese parliamentarians, who arrived in Taipei on  Tuesday, and 18 Taiwanese counterparts would continue.    Japan occupied Taiwan from 1885 to 1945. Before and during  the war it forced people in Taiwan to deposit part of their  monthly salaries in postal savings accounts.    According to a Japanese Government estimate, the postal  savings deposits, postal annuities and unpaid salaries totaled  452.4 million yen, owing to some 2,547,000 people.    Japan has voiced its intention to refund the unpaid money  from the fiscal 1995 state budget beginning in April 1995.    But many Taiwanese hope to link the unpaid money to  indexing,  saying the value has risen by about 4,500 times from 1943 on the  basis of Japanese public servant salaries.    Sources said the issue is to be handled the same way the  government repaid the savings of Okinawa residents deposited  before the war. The government reimbursed 94 million yen in  savings to the residents, adding 339 million yen to the  principal as indexing.</p>

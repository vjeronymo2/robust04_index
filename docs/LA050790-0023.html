			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TALMI SHOWS SKILL AT TRYING CONCERT  </P> <P> Now that Yoav Talmi is about to take over the long-vacant helm of the San Diego  Symphony, he appears eager to flesh out his identity on the podium. Aspiring  music directors are ever eager to please, but Talmi is beyond the stage of  putting his best foot forward.  </P> <P> Friday night at Copley Symphony Hall, Talmi bounded on stage to dazzle his  ample audience with a rousing -- almost raucous -- rendition of Smetana's  Overture and "Dance of the Comedians" from his opera "The Bartered Bride." The  usually mild-mannered Israeli conductor made a point of saber rattling with a  pair of light-hearted works that readily respond to that approach, although  Talmi's breakneck tempo pushed the orchestra just beyond its ability to  maintain a tight ensemble.  </P> <P> In the Prokofiev First violin Concerto, however, the maestro's task was not as  simple. The mercurial, asymmetrical Concerto is elusive under the best  conditions, and Talmi had to cope with a soloist who did not appear to have the  work confidently in his fingers. The symphony drafted American violinist Mark  Kaplan late Monday after the scheduled violinist Nigel Kennedy canceled due to  illness.  </P> <P> Kaplan started with a sterling, well-focused sound and graceful line, but the  formidable technical demands of the Scherzo kept the soloist scrambling for  notes. To his credit, Talmi stayed with Kaplan and coaxed a sympathetic  response from the orchestra. But the Concerto's abundant humor and  tongue-in-cheek parody of concerto conventions rarely emerged from this overly  earnest endeavor.  </P> <P> There probably is not much more that can be added to the interpretive lore of  Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony ("Pathetique"), but this hoary relic remains  sacred to a certain stripe of orchestra aficionado. Talmi preferred to err on  the side of calm elegance, and he demonstrated that he knows how to let out all  the stops without destroying the work's basic contours. The Symphony proved to  be the orchestra's finest hour of the evening, especially in the waltzing  second movement. Only the finale "Adagio lamentoso" lacked the pathos that is  usually the work's emotional talisman.  </P></p>

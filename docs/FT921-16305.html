			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Correction On October 26, under the heading 'Inheritance tax and Pets', we said the donor's estate would be liable for payment of inheritance tax if the seven-year period was not achieved. We omitted to say that the primary liability falls on the donee, and that the liability of the donor's estate is confined to where the tax remains unpaid for more than 12 months after the end of the month in which the death occurred. The Capital Taxes Office will not necessarily pursue the personal representatives for the donor in such circumstances. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

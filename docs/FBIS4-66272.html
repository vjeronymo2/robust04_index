			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shan Shan (1194 1194) of the Scientific Research </F> Bureau under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences:  "Consolidated Report on Symposium Discussing Theory and Practice  of Modern Enterprise System"--Responsible Editor: Xiao Da (2556  6671)]    [Text] To carry out the guidelines contained in the  decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, transform China's state-owned enterprises into  companies, and establish a socialist modern enterprise system in  our country, the Institute of Industrial Economics under the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences sponsored a "Symposium on  Theory and Practice of Modern Enterprise System" in Beijing from  30 November to 3 December 1993. Attending the symposium were  factory directors and managers from nearly 40 medium-sized,  large-, and extra large enterprises around the country and  economics scholars in the capital.    Proceeding from reality, the entrepreneurs summed up the  experiences and lessons obtained in recent years in conducting  enterprise reform and exchanged their views on how to build a  modern enterprise system in our country. The economists  expounded the essence and the prime importance of building such  a system from both the theoretical and practical viewpoints.  They also discussed such questions as theoretical and practical  difficulties in building China's modern enterprise system as  well as ways, methods, and strategies to be adopted to transform  existing enterprises. One salient feature of this symposium was  that economists and entrepreneurs got together to discuss an  important issue on economic reform. Highlights of the symposium  follow:  <H5>  I. Contents and Essence of Modern Enterprise System </H5>   The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  decided unequivocally that the reform of our state-owned  enterprises should be oriented toward the modern enterprise  system. What is the modern enterprise system? What are covered  by this system? But what is its essence? These were priority  and principal questions studied and discussed by the  participants in the symposium. As can be seen from their  discussions, the modern enterprise system is very comprehensive  in nature, and divergent views existed on the tasks of building  such a system in our country.    1. The modern enterprise system has come into being to suit  the needs of meeting the needs of the market economy. It basic  components are: a) a legal-entity system whereby enterprises  themselves are responsible for their profits and losses; b) an  enterprise leadership system characterized by vertical  delegation of power; c) a standardized financial and accounting  system; d) an enterprise income distribution system which  benefits all concerned, and e) an enterprise personnel and  labor system whereby employment is based on two-way choice  between the employer and employee. To build such a modern  enterprise system, China must conduct thoroughgoing reforms in  the above-mentioned five areas.    2. Tasks for building a modern enterprise system in China  should include: a) Institution of a scientific property rights  system. This requires the entrepreneurial management of the  departments that deal with enterprise property rights. These  departments should be able to reflect and adjust the property  rights structure based on the given ownership. b)  Rationalization of the enterprise organization. China's  enterprise reform has developed from the implementation of the  policy of granting power to enterprises to the stage of  instituting a new enterprise system. Companies are the most  typical, advanced and effective form of enterprise organization  under the condition of the market economy. c) Improvement of  enterprises' internal systems, aimed at switching their function  from pure production management to all-round operational  management. d) Transformation of enterprises' internal  management systems, including the legal system, leadership  system, unemployment insurance system, income distribution  system, cadre and personnel system, and labor employment system.    3. The following objectives should be achieved in building  the modern enterprise system: Enterprises should be relieved  from the status of affiliation with government departments so as  to truly separate enterprise management from government  administration. They should become legal entities responsible  for their own profits and losses and acting as the mainstay on  the market. Their organizational and managerial systems should  be scientific and standardized. And there should be a real  change in the government functions in relation to enterprises.  To this end, the modern enterprise system should contain the  following: a) a criterion for regulating the relationship  between the government's administrative department and  enterprises; b) a criterion for regulating the relationship  between enterprises and the departments controlling and managing  state assets; c) a criterion for regulating the relationship  among owners, managers, and employees; and d) a criterion for  regulating the relationship between investors' ownership and the  property rights of legal entities.    4. The core of the modern enterprise system is the  legal-entity system, that is, the system widely practiced in the  world that treats companies as legal entities. It consists of  many elements, including the systems for property rights,  accounting, organization (types of enterprises), and management  (organizations and departments). In essence, it has the  following characteristics: On the one hand, the state holds the  ultimate ownership of the property of state-owned enterprises,  thus ensuring their public ownership. On the other hand, the  enterprises, based on the property rights of the legal entities,  are truly independent commodity producers and managers  responsible for their own profits and losses, and they function  as the mainstay on the market. The system of companies as legal  entities serves as a link between public ownership and the  market economy.    5. The key to instituting the modern enterprise system is to  recognize the legal entities' property rights and the investors'  rights of investment. The characteristics of the system in this  respect are: clearly defined property rights, explicitly  specified authority and responsibility, separation of government  administration from enterprise management, scientific management  methods, and suitability to the needs of the market economy.    6. The modern enterprise system has been created to meet the  needs of the market economy. Therefore, it has the following  characteristics: a) All enterprise activities are centered  around the market. Enterprises base their production on supply  and demand in the market and are the mainstay in market  activities. b) Enterprises really operate on their own; they are  no longer belongings of the government. c) All enterprise  activities are based on profit-making. Enterprises themselves  are responsible for their profits and losses and exercise  self-restraint. d) Through the market mechanism, enterprises  compete with each other on an equal basis and achieve  self-improvement. Successful enterprises prosper, while those  which fail in the competition are eliminated.  <H5>  II. Questions To Be Resolved and Measures To Be Taken in </H5> Transforming State-Owned Enterprises Into Companies and Building  the Modern Enterprise System    1. Question of understanding. Although the decision of the  14th CPC National Congress unequivocally points out that  building a modern enterprise system represents the direction  that all enterprises should keep to, and most people understand  in varying degrees the need for transforming state-owned  enterprises into companies, some still take a negative or  skeptical attitude toward this question. They equate the  implementation of the shareholding system and the reform of the  enterprise system and the property rights system to a change of  the ownership system. According to these people, implementing  the shareholding system and reforming the property rights system  are acts of privatization. This is incorrect. It should be noted  that the ownership system embodies the essence of the relations  of production. It deals with property relations in the  perspective of property ownership. The shareholding system, on  the other hand, deals with property relations from the  producers' standpoint. The new enterprise system is aimed at  creating an effective form of the state-owned sector of the  economy. The focal point is to change the ineffective state  asset management under the old system and design an enterprise  system compatible with the market economy. There is no such  question as using the new enterprise system to change the  socialist ownership system.    2. Rationalization of property rights relations and  establishment of a new property rights system for state-owned  enterprises. The state may, through entrusted management, enable  enterprises to hold legal-entity property rights to state  assets. This clarifies the state-enterprise relationship with  respect to property rights. At the same time, the state should  undertake limited responsibilities on the state assets used by  enterprises.    3. Definition of property rights. While transforming  enterprises into companies, how to scientifically classify and  define property rights is a central question in building the  modern enterprise system. In principle, the ownership of state  assets belongs to the state, while enterprises possess all the  legal-entity property rights resulting from the investments made  by investors, including the state. However, the concept of  ownership by the state is too generic and is apt to create a  situation of no specific representative of the owner. For this  reason, some participants in the symposium made the following  suggestion: State property rights should be divided into  different levels; that is, the owners should be diversified and  the property rights held by different levels of government.  According to our present government financial system, four  levels of government can hold property rights, i.e., the  central, provincial, prefectural, and county levels. Defining  the property rights according to the principle that whoever made  the investment has the property rights and receives the returns  will help solve the problem of no definite state asset owner. As  to more specific and complicated questions, such as how to  define the property rights to new fixed assets resulting from  technological-upgrading investment using enterprises' own funds  or loans, some clear-cut provisions should be worked out. In  this regard, some participants suggested that a concrete  analysis be made of the technological-upgrading funds. If the  principal and interest on the loan have been repaid, they said,  the related assets may be treated as shares held by the legal  entity. If the enterprise cannot pay back the loan, the related  assets should become investment by the state or the bank  concerned.    4. Appraisal of assets. In transforming state-owned  enterprises into companies, a key task is the appraisal of their  assets. State assets should be appraised by independent  intermediary service organizations. In doing this, it is  imperative to minimize administrative intervention, seek truth  from facts, keep to the "Provisions Governing State Asset  Appraisal," and take into account both tangible and intangible  assets. Appraisal of tangible assets should be based on their  replacement value. The original inventory should be treated as  shares held by the state, while additional assets should be  turned into shares held by the legal entities. Land may be  appraised in accordance with the State Land Management  Regulations and the current land market price. Intangible assets  should be transferred according to law with attention to  protecting the creditors' due interests. As for patents and  proprietary technologies, consideration should be given to such  factors as the scope of application and approved duration of  technical secrecy so that the appraisal will fully reflect their  effective value.    5. Management of state assets. In addition to defining  property rights and appraising assets, how to manage state  assets is also a very important question in transforming  state-owned enterprises into the shareholding system. A  suggested solution is to establish a sound three-tier  organizational structure for the control and management of state  assets: a) Establishment of a state asset administrative  department to ensure the effective utilization and appreciation  of state assets. b) Establishment of intermediary organizations  for managing state assets, such as investment companies, holding  companies, and enterprise groups. This way enterprises engaged  in production and other operations will not be linked directly  to the government's administrative departments, thus ensuring  the separation of enterprise management from government  administration. c) Management of state assets in the same way as  financial management with attention to preserving their value  and ensuring their mobility.    6. Need to choose the right forms of stockholding in  transforming state-owned enterprises. In line with China's  actual conditions, the following forms may be adopted according  to the types of investments: a) Companies wholly owned by the  state. In general, this form is suitable for enterprises making  special-category products or producing armaments. b) Stock  companies with control shares held by the state. In most cases,  this is suitable for backbone enterprises in the fields of  pillar and basic industries. c) Stock companies with shares held  by both the state and the enterprises as legal entities.  Generally speaking, this is suitable for enterprise groups and  enterprises with diversified investments. d) Stock companies  with shares held by their employees. e) Stock companies which  are Sino-foreign joint ventures.    7. Appropriate solution to problems left by enterprises. a)  Debts. Although state-owned enterprises have undergone reform,  in general their economic returns remain at a low level, and  most of them are debt-ridden because the fundamental question of  property rights has not been well resolved. According to  estimates by the department concerned, industrial enterprises  contained in the state budget are laden with working-fund loans  and special-purpose loans, totaling 800 billion yuan. If all  their profits were used to repay these loans, it would take 18  years to clear up the debts, calculated at the 1990 interest  rate. The interest alone amounts to tens of billions of yuan a  year. In view of this, some participants suggested that, in the  transformation of the enterprises into companies, debts between  legal entities be treated as shares given by the debtors to the  creditors. b) Social welfare burdens. First, most state-owned  enterprises have the problems of being overstaffed and a growing  number of retired personnel of whom to take care. Statistics  show that about 20 percent of their personnel are superfluous,  and another 20 percent are retirees. In addition to establishing  as soon as possible a social insurance system and an old-age  insurance system to solve these problems, some participants  suggested that, when appraising the enterprises' total assets, a  proper amount of money be set aside as a settlement assistance  fee to guarantee the livelihood of the laid-off and retired  employees. At the same time, the laid-off and retired employees  are encouraged to engage in the tertiary trade to support  themselves. Second, enterprises are now providing social  welfare benefits to their employees. This entails great  difficulties, numerous problems, and remarkable contradictions.  The work involved is extremely comprehensive and complicated. To  provide such benefits to the employees not only brings numerous  problems to enterprise management, but also creates  contradictions between the enterprises and the government. It  was suggested that, after the enterprises have been reorganized,  their non-business facilities, such as dependent schools,  clinics, mess halls, and housing agents, be operated by the new  companies under a special program, and that a fee be charged for  the use of these facilities. This will not hurt the  shareholders' interests and, at the same time, satisfy the needs  of the employees. Third, enterprises are burdened with  unreasonably exacted fees. It is expected that this problem will  be radically removed after the enterprises have been transformed  into companies, their legal-entity status has been gradually  clarified, and the reforms in the government's functional and  other departments have developed in depth. At this time, it is  imperative to strictly enforce the state regulations on banning  unwarranted exaction of fees so as to lessen the enterprises'  burden and facilitate their transformation into companies.    8. Establishment of a new management system within  enterprises. After transformation into companies, state-owned  enterprises should deepen the reform of their labor, personnel,  income distribution, management, and leadership systems,  optimize their structure, and quicken the change of their  operational mechanism so that they will have a higher labor  productivity, better product quality, and lower production  costs, all of which are prerequisite to success in market  competition. First, with regard to the reform of the labor  employment system, there are two major tasks: Enterprises should  gain the power--namely, the power to hire employees. The  government should build the market--that is, cultivate and  transform the labor market. In this regard, some participants  suggested a labor employment system based on two-way free choice  between enterprises and employees and a combination of regular,  contract, and temporary workers. In most cases, the contract  worker system should be used, while, in a few special cases, the  temporary worker system may be adopted. The above-mentioned  three kinds of workers have different pay scales, but their  status is not unchangeable. In addition, efforts should be made  to improve the employees' performance evaluation system and the  social security system. Second, it is necessary to modernize our  enterprise management -- from the management mentality to the  ways and means of management -- and to build a high-efficiency  and quickly reactive enterprise organizational structure. In  reforming enterprise management organization, the difficulty  lies in how to separate supplementary units from main units, how  to settle the surplus employees, and how to avoid double  taxation after the separation of supplementary units and the  formation of new enterprises. Third, a modern enterprise  financial and accounting system should be established in  compliance with the requirements set forth in the "General  Financial Guidelines for Enterprises" and the "Guiding  Principles for Enterprise Accounting." Fourth, it is necessary  to standardize the activities of enterprises and accelerate the  transformation of their internal operational mechanism. Fifth,  the leadership system in enterprises should be reformed. Under  the modern enterprise system, enterprises should have the power  to manage their financial affairs, make operational decisions,  and direct and supervise their production and other operations.  Because of this, there should be a multilayered leadership  system based on vertical delegation of power, consisting of the  shareholders' meeting, board of directors, board of supervisors,  and managerial group. These organizations should exercise power  of major policy making, power of supervision, and power for the  formulation and implementation of policies on day-to-day  business. Meanwhile, the modern enterprise leadership system  should adhere to the principle that the party plays a core role  in the ideological and political work within enterprises. Also,  it should carry forward the role of the workers' congress in  democratic management of enterprises. Party committees, trade  unions, and staff and worker representatives should get involved  in the work of the boards of supervisors and directors so as to  enlarge the scope and enhance the substance of democratic  management of enterprises.    9. Acceleration of all supplementary reforms and improvement  of enterprises' external environment. a) We should change the  government's economic management function and, instead, set up a  macro-regulatory and control system relying mainly on indirect  means: To this end, we should, first of all, deepen the price  reform and form a pattern whereby the price is determined by  supply and demand. Second, we should have a unified tax system  so that enterprises can compete on the market on equal terms.  Third, we should make all-out efforts to cultivate the market  and form an integrated, open, and orderly market system so as to  provide enterprises with a sound market environment. b) We  should set up and develop various kinds of intermediary  organizations and institute a system which requires these  organizations to undertake certain responsibilities. c) We  should create an environment for implementing the legal system  so that there are laws for enterprises to follow in conducting  their economic activities. This work includes the perfection of  the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law. Meanwhile, we should form a  property rights market and optimize the allocation of resources  in society. c) We should build a multilayered social security  system and improve the old-age and unemployment insurance  systems. The social security system should start as a  rudimentary welfare program, and its scope should be gradually  expanded to include medical, housing, and education benefits. As  to the financial sources for the insurance systems, the state,  enterprises, and employees are required to share the burden in a  reasonable way.  <H5>  III. Ways and Means for Transforming State-Owned Enterprises </H5> Into Companies    1. Different views exist on the possibility of turning  state-owned enterprises into companies: a) The transformation of  state-owned enterprises into companies is due to the following  reason: The organizational form and operational mechanism of  wholly-state-owned enterprises cannot meet the needs of  development of the market economy, and a general expansion of  enterprise power is not a radical solution to the longstanding  problems. Transformation of enterprises into companies will  enable them to build sound mechanisms for promoting production  and sales and for motivating, developing, and restraining  themselves. Such transformation will also be an effective way to  form a correct relationship between the state and enterprises.  Now, in our country, the development of the multiple-ownership  system, diversification of principal investors and  beneficiaries, and expansion of lateral cooperation among  enterprises have provided favorable conditions for developing  stockholding enterprises. For this reason, we should turn  state-owned enterprises into companies and speed up their  transformation toward the shareholding system. ) It is rather  difficult to transform large and medium-sized state-own  enterprises into the stockholding system. Without proper  solutions to the questions concerning asset appraisal, property  rights, and employees' social welfare benefits, the shareholding  system is only an exploratory, trial system, and most  state-owned enterprises cannot be changed into companies.  However, we may "copy the system to change our mechanism." That  is, we may copy the company's system, including its legal-entity  status and internal management organization, to achieve the  objective of transforming our enterprises' operational  mechanism. To do this, we should continue to base the work on  the "Law Concerning Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole  People" and "Regulations on Transformation of Operational  Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People."  We should give state-owned enterprises decision-making power  with regard to management, grant them the status as legal  entities, and establish as soon as possible an enterprise  organizational system modeled on the management structure of  companies.    2. Scope of transformation to companies (shareholding  system): (1) Shareholding is a good system for developing the  market economy and optimizing the ownership structure. Stock  companies can sever the link between the government and  enterprises and achieve the goal of separating ownership from  the power of management. They are the most suitable form of  enterprise organization for the development of the market  economy. Therefore, all-out efforts should be made to popularize  stock companies and make them the principal type of enterprises  in China. Nonetheless, not all enterprises can be switched to  the shareholding system. For this reason, state-owned  enterprises should be transformed into the following different  organizational forms: Enterprises of unitary ownership by the  public with their capital owned by the central government or a  local government at a certain level. Enterprises of multiple  ownership by the public (which have been transformed into stock  companies) with their capital owned jointly by the central and  local governments or by different local governments. Enterprises  with the government holding control shares--in these enterprises  the government shares play a leading role. And enterprises with  the government holding regular shares--in these enterprises the  government acts merely as a regular shareholder, not as a  controlling shareholder. (2) Relatively speaking, the  shareholding system is suited to those large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises which have to face competition in doing  their business and which should reorganize their production  elements. Therefore, we should define a proper scope for the  implementation of the shareholding system.    3. How to transform enterprises into companies. Most  participants said that the majority of China's enterprises  should be transformed into limited-liability companies. Specific  comments were as follows: a) Transformation of state-owned  enterprises into companies is to change the "factory-type"  enterprises owned solely by the state and managed directly by  the government into "company-type" enterprises with multiple  investors and managed by the enterprises themselves. For most  enterprises, the type of company to be adopted is the  limited-liability company. This type of company has many  advantages: Its capital can be pooled quickly, and its operation  is relatively simple. The transformation is easy and not costly.  Its activities can be easily standardized. A small number of  enterprises with heavy renovation or expansion tasks or  requiring large amounts of funds for production and construction  may be turned into limited-liability stock companies. In  general, however, state-owned enterprises should not be  transformed into wholly-state-owned limited-liability companies  so as to avert the appearance of flipped-plate companies [fan  pai gong si 5064 3654 0361 0674; referring to government  institutions that have been turned into companies but illegally  use previous government connections for profiteering], which  will be a new obstacle to the in-depth development of the  reform. Methods to avoid this are letting legal entities buy  each other's shares, converting debts into shares, soliciting  foreign investors, and absorbing capital from society as  investment. b) The purpose of transforming our state-owned  enterprises into companies is to correct a drawback of these  enterprises, namely, the unitariness and abstractness of their  property rights, and to separate government administration from  enterprise management through the diversification of property  rights and the clarification of relations of property rights.  Therefore, in the transformation of enterprises into companies,  only a few of them should be turned into companies of sole  proprietorship, while most should become limited-liability  companies or limited-liability stock companies with diverse  investors. The choice depends on the enterprises' internal and  external conditions. In foreign countries, big enterprises are  generally limited-liability stock companies, while most small  and medium-sized enterprises are limited-liability companies. In  China, we should try to limit the number of companies of sole  proprietorship when transforming our state-owned enterprises  into companies. To do this, we should let legal entities become  shareholders and encourage them to buy each other's shares. c)  Judging from China's actual conditions, it will be impossible to  turn all state-owned enterprises into listed stock companies.  Most enterprises should be transformed into either  limited-liability companies (including Sino-foreign joint  ventures) or wholly-state-owned companies. d) One of the  significant reasons for proposing a modern enterprise system is  to treat wholly-state-owned companies as a company category and,  in a certain sense, distinguish them from stock companies. Under  the present circumstances, however, wholly-state-owned companies  are viewed as a kind of limited-liability company rather than a  separate category. Compared with state-owned enterprises,  whole-state-owned limited-liability companies represent a leap  from unlimited-liability enterprises which are not legal  entities to limited-liability enterprises which act as legal  entities. The transformation of big and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises into limited-liability companies may be carried out  as an intermediate step. In the future, however, most of them  should be turned into stock companies or openly listed stock  companies.    4. The question of legal entities as shareholders and legal  entities holding each other's shares. Following views were  expressed at the symposium: a) In transforming state-owned  enterprises into companies, we should let legal entities hold  shares and especially hold each other's shares. Participants  holding this view deemed it necessary to stress the need for  companies as legal entities to possess shares in order to  diversify the share ownership. According to them, state-owned  enterprises should possess each other's shares so as to nullify  the ultimate-ownership mechanism and give prominence to the  rights and interests of those who actually manage the  enterprises. Over time, the pertinent government departments'  authority over the enterprises will gradually become nominal,  and the enterprises will be able to operate on their own. b)  Reasons for promoting legal-entity shareholders in the  transformation of enterprises into companies: One is to change  the original meanings of the ownership systems. Since  legal-entity shareholders represent thousands upon thousands of  individuals, shares held by legal entities mean shares held by  the masses. As a result, the original "pure private ownership"  will become something close to a "social ownership." Capitalist  ownership will no longer be a pure private ownership system. A  similar diluting effect will be exerted on the socialist  ownership system as well. The second reason is to greatly weaken  the shareholders' rights and boost the managers' rights. The  third reason is that with legal-entity shareholders, management  will not be easily dictated by individual shareholders'  shortsighted activities aimed at seeking dividends. c) Some  entrepreneurs expressed a different view about letting legal  entities become shareholders and hold each other's shares.  Letting them hold each other's shares, they said, may be a very  effective way for enterprise transformation in the future. But  under the current circumstances where most enterprises are  suffering losses in varying degrees and experiencing capital  shortage and financial difficulty, how can they buy each other's  shares? This is impractical at least at this time, they added.    5. In discussions, some theoreticians and entrepreneurs  noted  that, in the transformation of enterprises into companies, a  not-to-be-slighted question is that the reform of Chinese  enterprises' property rights must be accompanies by the  establishment of an entrepreneur system. History has proven that  managerial professionals constitute an inevitable social stratum  whether in feudal or capitalist society. This stratum makes  perfect the model of separation of management and ownership. The  birth and formation of the entrepreneur system is not merely of  importance to management science. Rather, its importance to  economics outweighs its importance to management science. The  entrepreneur system constitutes an integral part of the modern  capitalist property rights system. When a consensus has been  reached on reorganizing the property rights related to our  state-owned enterprises, the next question to be understood by  all is that our institution of the enterprise legal-entity  system must be closely integrated with the formation of an  entrepreneur system.</p>

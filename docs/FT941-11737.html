			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Canada goes in search of its Nafta cousins  -Bernard Simon on a flurry of getting-to-know-you exercises with trade deal partner Mexico The Mexican navy broke with tradition last month. The newest house in its officers' compound in Mexico City is not the usual locally-made, cement-block structure, but is built around a wood-and-polystyrene frame imported from Canada. Nascor, a Calgary-based homebuilder whose biggest shareholder is MacMillan Bloedel, the big west coast forestry group, hopes the prototype model built for the navy marks the start of a stream of orders from Mexico. Wooden houses, the Canadian company claims, are not only quicker to put up than cement ones, but also more resistant to earthquakes and hurricanes. Nascor is one of dozens of Canadian companies drawn to Mexico by a flurry of getting-to-know-you activity which accompanied the talks leading up to the North American free trade agreement, implemented on January 1. The three Nafta partners, the US, Canada and Mexico, are often likened to a sandwich, with two thin slices separated by a giant filling. The US is both Canada's and Mexico's biggest trading and investment partner. But the two junior partners have in the past had little in common. Two-way shipments between Canada and Mexico totalled only CDollars 3.6bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in 1992, less than 2 per cent of US-Canada trade. The tangible impact of Nafta - such as the gradual elimination of customs tariffs and relaxed investment rules - has yet to be felt. But the mere prospect of liberalisation has been enough for Canadians and Mexicans to forge a multitude of new links. SHL Systemhouse, an Ottawa-based computer systems company which already has several contracts in Mexico, last month became the first Canadian company to hold a board meeting in Mexico City. Among the mushrooming areas of official co-operation, Mexican officials have visited the bureau of competition policy in Ottawa to improve their skills in reviewing mergers and takeovers. At least five Canadian ministers will be in Mexico City later this month for the annual cabinet-level review of bilateral relations. Evidence abounds of a spurt in trade and investment flows. According to Statistics Canada, Mexico's exports to Canada grew by 23 per cent in the first ten months of last year to CDollars 2.86bn. The biggest increases were in shipments of motor vehicles (Mexico's biggest single export to Canada) and furniture. Mexican investment in Canada remains minuscule. One of the few examples is Targa, a Mexico City construction group, which joined a group of Quebec entrepreneurs a year ago to rescue Artopex, a Montreal-based office-furniture maker whose products Targa distributes in Latin America. The partners have subsequently sold Artopex, but have kept the land on which its factory is located. They are also examining at least three construction joint ventures in Mexico and El Salvador. Investment flows have been stronger in the opposite direction. Bank of Nova Scotia two years ago bought a small stake in Inverlat, one of Mexico's largest financial service groups. Mr Paul Friser-Frederiksen, who is in charge of Royal Bank of Canada's Mexican business, identifies 10 key areas of opportunity for Canadian business: agri-business, transport, petroleum, telecommunications, environmental services, mining equipment and services, industrial machinery, consumer products, financial services, and computer systems. Canadian businessmen suggest that simply not being American often gives them an edge against US competitors. In particular, Canadians are more accustomed to working in a second language, which may explain why a high proportion of trade and investment deals between the two countries involve Quebec companies. Quebecois also make up more than half the Canadian tourists to Mexico. Ms Sandra Fuentes, Mexico's energetic ambassador in Ottawa, says she is trying to encourage Canadian companies to participate in ventures in Mexico which can employ the 5,000-6,000 seasonal labourers who work on Canadian fruit and vegetable farms each summer. She cites a Quebec-based company which has invested in a Mexican cucumber-processing plant. The relationship is not entirely smooth, however. Ms Fuentes makes no secret of her frustration with Canadian non-governmental groups, which have complained loudly about Mexican human rights policies in the wake of the recent peasant uprising in Chiapas. Canadian aboriginal groups were quick to take up the cause of the Mexican rebels. Canadian officials, for their part, express doubts about the ability of the Mexican legal and administrative structure to adapt to the disciplines of a comprehensive trade agreement with two of the world's most developed countries. A guide to business in Mexico, published by Royal Bank and the department of foreign affairs, recently cautioned that 'people like to name drop, and can promise you the world while they are leading you down the garden path. There are people who deliver on their promises, but always check, double check and triple check'.</p>

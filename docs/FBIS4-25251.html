			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Foreign Firms Compete To Bid for More </F> Than 20 Underground Railway Projects"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 1 Jun (LIEN HO PAO) -- Following the  expansion of the underground railway systems in Beijing,  Shanghai, and Tianjin, over 20 large and medium-sized cities,  including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Changchun, Chengdu, Nanjing,  Qingdao, and Lanzhou have recently sought cooperation with  foreign firms in preparation for the construction of underground  railways.    The Guangzhou underground railway project has been under  preparation for a long time. Construction of the 18.45-km No. 1  line began at the end of last year. The whole project is  expected to be completed by 1998. It will be the city's biggest  ever investment in urban construction. The total investment is  estimated at over 10 billion yuan. The No. 1 line requires  about $1 billion of investment, half of which is foreign  capital. Equipment for the 16 stations is being imported from a  number of countries and is worth a total of $440 million. In  order to minimize the impact on surface communications and the  public's life, an advanced method, quality structure [zhi gou  6347 2845] construction, was adopted. An invitation to tender  for the Guangzhou underground was held. Nine companies from  Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the Republic of  Korea signed up for the bidding. They included Balfour Beatty  of Britain, CMC of Italy, Holtzmann [huo er zi man 7202 1422  5417 2581] of Germany, Maeda Construction Limited of Japan, and  Matiquer [ma di ke er 7456 5530 0344 1422] of France.    The right to supply 15 mechanical and electrical systems  required by the No. 1 line attracted great interest from foreign  firms, which engaged one another in competition: Last November,  Germany's Siemens took the lead and became the supplier of five  equipment systems, including rolling stock and vehicle-related  equipment; the United States' (Puller) [pu le si 2528 2867 2448]  and (Kelly) [kai li 7030 0448] and Britain's Balfour Beatty and  General Electric Company (Hong Kong) Limited became the  suppliers of six equipment systems, including emergency alarms,  cold-water generating units, overhead contact nets, and fans.  Japanese firms beat their rivals to supply two systems.  Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and Hitachi became suppliers of  escalators for the No. 1 line. America's Cobic [kou bi ke 1379  3024 0344] Automatic Ticket Seller &amp; Checker Group became the  supplier of automatic ticket vendors. So far, suppliers for 13  of 15 equipment systems have been designated.</p>

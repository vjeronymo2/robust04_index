			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Change of view - Ballot Box Peter Mandelson's exile to the north-east, where he is fighting to become MP for Hartlepool, is not preventing him from playing kingmaker, a role he pursued vigorously when in charge of Labour's communications strategy. Mandelson's regular column in The People yesterday had kind words for Harriet Harman, a Labour health spokesman, and Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, who Mandelson bizarrely thinks emerged 'entirely unscathed' from a drubbing on the minimum wage with a nursery owner on the BBC's Election Call. Even more striking is Mandelson's plaudit for Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, whose soaring reputation Mandelson quietly helped contain in the late 1980s, when the Kinnock entourage thought the MP for Dagenham over-ambitious and loose of tongue.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Nissan UK launches price war NISSAN UK, the former distributor of Nissan vehicles, has launched a price war against Nissan Motor, the Japanese vehicle maker, Kevin Done writes. Nissan Motor took control of its UK distribution operations on January 1 after removing the franchise from Nissan UK following a legal battle. Nissan UK, the privately owned company controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, still has considerable stocks of new Nissan vehicles. It is offering a base model for an on-the-road price of Pounds 5,595, which it claims is more than Pounds 700 below the cheapest model sold by Nissan Motor in the UK. Nissan Motor is seeking to prevent Nissan UK from using the Nissan name and logo in marketing vehicles.</p>

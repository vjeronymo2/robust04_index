A second Los  Angeles-area center will be opened in Beverly Hills in 1991, company officials  said.  </P> <P> The center features customer service representatives, detailed marketing  materials, exhibit-style photographs, audiovisual displays, conference  facilities, refreshments and even a tea room. It is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  weekdays.  </P> <P> Properties to be featured include single-family homes in planned communities  throughout the state, luxury condominiums, office buildings, retail shopping  centers, high-technology facilities, investment-grade real estate and  joint-venture opportunities.  </P> <P> Among the $250 million in properties throughout the state are projects in  downtown Los Angeles, Agoura Hills, Brentwood, Huntington Beach, Marin County,  Rancho Palos Verdes, Santa Clarita, Santa Monica, Sunnyvale, Westwood and  Westlake Village.  </P> <P> Haseko Corp. of Japan is a publicly traded $3-billion company that was founded  50 years ago.

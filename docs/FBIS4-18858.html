			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, April 11 (CTK) -- Although Austria is now  surrounded by democratic states, near its borders lies a region  of latent instability and uncertainty, whose spread could be  prevented by cooperation in the Central European region,  Austrian President Thomas Klestil told CTK today.    He said he was mainly referring to local military conflicts  in Austria's vicinity, and other phenomena threatening  stability, such as uncontrolled mass migration, international  crime, drug trafficking, and threats to the environment by, for  example, transit freight transport or nuclear power plants.    "That is why Austria is highly interested in further  strengthening of security and stability in Central Europe,"  Klestil said.    He also said he favored the closest possible Austrian-Czech  relations. In view of Austria's forthcoming membership in the  European Union (EU), Klestil said he supported the EU's future  extension to Central Europe's post-communist countries. "Austria  ranks among the resolute advocates of the quickest possible  expansion of the EU to the east," he said, adding that if a  referendum on Austria's joining the EU has a positive result,  Austria would, as a EU member, "defend the interests of all  these countries."</p>

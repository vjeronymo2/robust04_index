			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Tradition revived in W Sussex REAL ALE enthusiasts Mr Stephen Lowson and Mr John Ryan have revived the brewing tradition in Arundel, the picturesque West Sussex town, Philip Rawstorne writes. In 1992, 50 years after the closure of Arundel's last brewery, they started commercial beer production at a site on a nearby industrial estate. Mr Lowson says: 'Demand for real ale was growing, but nobody was making a local brew. We saw the opportunity to get into a niche market and took it.' They bought their equipment second-hand from a northern brewer. 'But starting up was quite expensive,' Mr Lowson says. 'We spent Pounds 30,000 on 600 casks alone.' But he adds, 'We are now operating at about 75 per cent of capacity, producing about 400 gallons a day, and supplying about 60 pubs in the area.' The partners are now expanding into pub ownership.</p>

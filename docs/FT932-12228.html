			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: Gala performance of Love in the Country There will be a gala performance of Love in the Country, with music by Anthony Bowles, at the Duke of York's theatre in St Martin's Lane, London, on Sunday May 2. Meanwhile, the show is having a try-out at the Almeida in Islington until Saturday, writes Malcolm Rutherford. Bowles was the musical director of many West End successes including Evita and Irma la Douce. He died in March before the development of his prime work was completed. Love in the Country was first performed at LAMDA in 1970 when Bowles was a teacher there. The story is loosely based on Daphnis and Chloe in the Isle of Lesbos. The book is in rhymed couplets and, like the lyrics, written by Mike Alfreds, his long-time collaborator. Most of that is surprisingly weak. The music, however, is pretty and clever throughout. In the last 20 minutes the show takes off in a glorious display of wit. If the Almeida performances can be treated as extended rehearsals, there may be something to look forward to at the Duke of York's.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua has begun his visit  to Canada by saying his country can't grow in the next century  without help. Speaking in Vancouver, Mr. Zou urged a business  audience to invest more in China, especially in the transport,  energy, agriculture, communications, and mining sectors. Trade  between Canada and China is worth more than $4 billion a year.    Prime Minister Jean Chretien will visit China in November,  becoming the first Canadian leader to do so since the 1989  massacre of pro-democracy activists in Beijing. Mr. Chretien  has said that human rights questions should not deter closer  trade links between the two countries.</p>

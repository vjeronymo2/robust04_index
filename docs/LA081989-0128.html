			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RUSH TO GLORY;  </P> <P> FORMER TITAN JENKINS HOPES TO FILL NEED FOR STEELERS' DEFENSE  </P> <P> A.J. Jenkins, the Pittsburgh Steelers' ninth-round draft from Cal State  Fullerton, would like to help cure the team's pass-rushing problems.  </P> <P> "I sure hope I can do something," Jenkins said. "I'm going to do the best job I  can because I know the pass rush is a real important part of the game."  </P> <P> Jenkins, 6-feet-2 and 237 pounds, had 12 1/2 sacks in his two seasons at  Fullerton. As a sophomore at Merced Junior College, he had 16 sacks in one  season.  </P> <P> Jenkins registered his first National Football League sack, and the team's only  one, with 38 seconds remaining in the Steelers' 21-14 exhibition loss to the  Washington Redskins.  </P> <P> The Steelers desperately need Jenkins to pressure opposing quarterbacks,  particularly with two starters, Gerald Williams and Keith Willis, hampered by  injuries.  </P> <P> "A.J. likes to rush the quarterback," defensive line coach Joe Greene said.  "When he's in pass coverage, he sees a lot of things that are going on. He's a  very instinctive ballplayer. He has a lot of talent, but he's still  inexperienced.  </P> <P> "But I think he is going to help us, not only in the pass rush, but overall. He  has some great pass-rushing possibilities. But it's an injustice to consider  him the answer to our pass rush."  </P> <P> Jenkins, a defensive end at Fullerton, has been moved to right outside  linebacker by the Steelers.  </P> <P> Linebackers coach Dave Brazil said the position switch was a dramatic one at  first for Jenkins.  </P> <P> "He had never covered the pass in his life," Brazil said. "But he's picked  things up and he's been doing it pretty well. He's on schedule."  </P> <P> Jenkins also is pleased with his progress.  </P> <P> "I think I need to touch up some things on my down tight end position at  outside linebacker," he said. "I got blown off the ball a little bit (against  Washington). I'm working on that now. But for the most part, I've been happy  with my play at outside linebacker."  </P> <P> The Steelers have found a way to utilize Jenkins' pass-rushing skills. He lines  up at right defensive end in the team's nickel defense.  </P> <P> "He's a good pass rusher and has good pursuit. He has good instincts, too,"  Brazil said.  </P></p>

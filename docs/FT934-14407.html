			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Sharesave options I HAVE two questions concerning sharesave schemes. 1. If the company becomes subject to a takeover, are the sharesave scheme shares included in the bid? 2. For capital gains tax purposes, are you deemed to have purchased the shares at the beginning or the end of the scheme? 1. Not necessarily. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets IR97 (SAYE share options) and IR98 (SAYE share option schemes: explanatory notes). 2. The shares are deemed to be acquired on the day on which the options are exercised. The cost of the options themselves (which is usually fairly small) is indexable from the day they were granted; the cost of exercising the options is indexable from the day they are exercised. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares); the pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction) might also be useful. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

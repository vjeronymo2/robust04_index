			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / US tackles N-fuel dispute with Europeans The US is seeking to resolve a nuclear fuel dispute that has shaken its relations with operators of European reactors and has threatened the country's credibility in nuclear non-proliferation negotiations due next year, reports George Graham in Washington. After five years of foot-dragging by successive US administrations, a draft Department of Energy report has recommended that the US should immediately take back spent nuclear fuel from nine European research reactors, some of which could be forced to shut if they were unable to dispose of some of their used fuel. The US stopped taking back the fuel in 1988. In the view of Europeans, it thus reneged on a decades-old bargain by which the European research reactors agreed to convert from high-enriched uranium, which could be used to make bombs, to low-enriched uranium. If the US were seen not to be keeping its side of the nuclear bargain, that could seriously weaken its efforts to persuade other countries to renew the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is due to be reviewed at an international conference next year. US and European officials say they are confident that remaining objections by some environmentalists - and from the state of South Carolina, where the spent fuel would end up - can be resolved by the end of March under an accelerated procedure to assess the environmental consequences. 'In general, we are feeling very confident that we will be able to initiate the spent fuel acceptance that is proposed in the environmental assessment,' says Mr Charles Head of the US Energy Department. This would allow shipment of up to 448 fuel elements to begin this summer after a five-year gap, relieving the reactor operators' short-term problems. However, a longer-term solution will require the completion of a full environmental impact statement. This is a bureaucratic obstacle course expected to drag on at least until the end of 1995. Meanwhile, some reactor operators are growing increasingly irritated at US unreliability. 'They haven't kept to any time limits,' complains Dr Klaus Singer, director of Denmark's Risoe reactor.</p>

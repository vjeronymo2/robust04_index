			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Musiyenko report: "Askar Akayev: Russians Do Have </F> a Future in Kyrgyzstan"]    [Text] The press conference held at the close of his  official visit to Moscow by President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan  was devoted to one of the most troublesome problems facing this  republic -- the exodus of the Russian-speaking population. Over  100,000 people -- 10 percent of those for whom Russian is their  first language -- have left since the collapse of the Union,.    "I still consider the main aim and the main thrust of my  policy to be the quest for and the strengthening of interethnic  accord; and we must do everything within our power -- the  possible and the impossible alike -- to halt the migration  process," A. Akayev declared.    As he noted, teaching given in the Russian language in  schools and higher educational establishments has been  maintained in full in Kyrgyzstan, as has the training of  teachers specializing in Russian. Moreover, a Russian Slavic  University, where students from other Central Asian republics  can study, was opened here recently -- the first and as yet the  only one of its kind in the CIS. It is equally important,  however, to solve the socioeconomic problems of Russians working  at industrial enterprises, too. As A. Akayev announced, during  his visit to Moscow he presented an entire package of agreements  to B. Yeltsin, thanks to which the usual provision of plants and  factories with orders from Russia would be maintained. And if  there is work, there will be a comfortable standard of living  for families. According to A. Akayev, these proposals "met with  complete mutual understanding and support on the part of the  Russian Federation president."    But nevertheless, joint efforts by all Commonwealth  countries  are required in order to regulate migration processes, A. Akayev  stressed. Kyrgyzstan submitted a draft multilateral agreement  on protecting the rights and interests of national minorities  back in 1991. But, alas, after it was amended, all that  remained of it were empty declarations. In A. Akayev's view, it  is worth returning to the draft of this document at the next  meeting of CIS heads of states. Its basic provisions are as  follows: First, adequate representation of national minorities  in the state administration system; second, refusal to  countenance discrimination against persons who do not speak the  national languages of the new independent states; and, finally,  a solution to the problem of dual citizenship.</p>

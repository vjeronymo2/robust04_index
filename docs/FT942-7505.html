			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BTR gives directors up to 17% more pay Directors of BTR, the industrial conglomerate, have received basic salary increases for this year of up to 17 per cent. And it has emerged that an unusual guarantee has been given to chief executive Mr Alan Jackson: his salary cannot be cut. A clause in Mr Jackson's contract states that his annual pay review 'shall not result in payment of salary less than that paid during the 12-month period preceding such review'. The rises took effect on January 1 and so did not feature in the 1993 annual report, published last month. BTR, which holds its annual meeting in London tomorrow, reported a 19 per cent rise in pre-tax profits last year to Pounds 1.28bn and increased its full-year dividend by 13 per cent to 12.25p. The consensus City forecast is for a 12 per cent increase in profits this year. Ms Kathleen O'Donovan, finance director, has the largest increase. A Pounds 30,000 - or 17.6 per cent - pay rise takes her basic salary to Pounds 200,000. Mr Jackson has received an 8.4 per cent rise, taking his annual pay to ADollars 1.23m (Pounds 600,000). His service agreement is with BTR Nylex, an Australian company in which BTR has a 60 per cent stake. Mr Norman Ireland, BTR's chairman, will be paid Pounds 213,830 this year for a three-day week, slightly less than received by Sir Owen Green, the previous chairman, in his final year. Mr Michael Smith earns a basic salary of Pounds 281,000 and has a contract which guarantees him a three-year notice period. This remains in place despite recent moves by institutions to limit notice periods to one year. Mr Robert Fairclough, whose salary has been increased from Dollars 705,000 to Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 500,000), has a similar clause but his contract runs only until September 1996. There is also likely to be shareholder concern over a Dollars 3.5m payment made to Mr Edgar Sharp, formerly president of BTR Inc, the main US subsidiary. About Dollars 1m of this was paid to Mr Sharp before December 31 1990, with the rest going into a pension trust which he was eligible to receive from January 1 this year. The company said that the payment 'has been paid in accordance with his contract'. Mr Sharp is to remain with BTR as a non-executive director after his contract ends in June. BTR declined to comment on the rises yesterday.</p>

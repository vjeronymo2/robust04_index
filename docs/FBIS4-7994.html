			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 7 (AFP) -- Croatian authorities  Thursday ordered the evacuation of all residents within a  2.5-kilometre (1.5- mile) radius of a major munitions dump  licked by giant flames and rocked by five straight hours of  explosions.    Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, who announced the evacuation  order, dubbed the blasts in the depot in Sesvete, about 12  kilometres (seven miles) outside Zagreb, a "disaster." He said  he had no information on casualties but that the government was  without news of some of the staff working at the depot.    Valentic, who also announced that a special crisis cabinet  had been set up to deal with the emergency, gave no details on  the cause of the blast but dismissed the possibility of sabotage.    An AFP reporter at the scene some five hours after the  blasts  began at 2:00 p.m. said three fires were blazing, sending plumes  of smoke into the sky, while shells continued to explode at the  depot.    Earlier, shells exploded every few seconds, according to  eyewitnesses near the depot and nearby residents were told to  take refuge in their cellars and not to panic.    A radio appeal was broadcast calling on the capital's  emergency fire service personnel to help deal with the blaze.  Sesvete police told AFP they expected people had been injured.    Traffic was stopped in the whole of the surrounding region,  and schoolchildren and their teachers abandoned classes to flee  the area.</p>

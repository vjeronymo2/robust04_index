			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Treasury put gloss on projections MR NORMAN LAMONT told Treasury economists to put a more favourable gloss on official projections for the UK's growing public sector deficit, published a month before the April general election. In an internal note, the chancellor told officials to recalculate their projections for the public sector borrowing requirement in the five years to 1996-97, to reduce them, if possible, to zero by the end of the period. This led the Treasury to publish projections for the cumulative deficits in the three years to 1996-97 that were roughly Pounds 30bn below the original figures worked out internally. Mr Lamont's initiative was designed to ensure that the Budget statement published in March, which also contained the latest Treasury forecasts, would not include figures about government deficits that would unsettle financial markets and the public. Details of the manoeuvrings will intensify pressure on Mr Lamont to clarify the degree to which Treasury economists provide analysis free from political pressures. Mr Lamont's future is in some doubt after the pound's suspension from the exchange rate mechanism and his lacklustre reception at last week's Tory conference. Seven months after Mr Lamont moved to cut the Treasury's PSBR projections, he is attempting to trim back next year's public spending because of renewed fears over rising state borrowing triggered by the recession. The chancellor put pressure on his officials in a note drafted about a week before the Budget statement on March 10. The note was sent on Mr Lamont's behalf by Mr Jeremy Heywood, his principal private secretary. After Mr Lamont's request, the Treasury settled for a compromise, in which the PSBR projection for 1996-97 was set in the Budget statement at Pounds 6bn, above Mr Lamont's zero target but less than the initial estimate of Pounds 16bn.

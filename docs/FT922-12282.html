			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / UK Company News: Avonmore buys meat plants AVONMORE FOODS, the Irish dairy and food products group, has paid IPounds 5.5m for four meat processing plants owned by the collapsed United Meat Packers Group. The acquisitions mark Avonmore's first venture into Irish beef processing and will give it an estimated seven per cent of the republic's market. The plants, at Sligo, Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen, in the west, and at Camolin, in the south-east of the country, have a combined slaughtering capacity of 4,750 cattle and 27,500 sheep a week. Avonmore's chief executive, Mr Pat O'Neill, said the company intended to invest up to IPounds 8m to modernise the plants and bring them up to EC standards. A fifth UMP plant, at Charleville, County Cork, has been bought by the privately-owned group, Dairygold, for IPounds 4m. One further plant remains to be sold. UMP, owned by Pakistani businessman, Mr Sher Rafique, was put into receivership in February with debt of over IPounds 60m, owed mainly to overseas banks. The receiver, Mr John Donnelly, of Deloitte &amp; Touche, was under strong pressure from unions, farmers and the Irish government to make a quick sale to protect as many as possible of the 600 jobs at the plants. Most of the employees are expected to be re-hired as the plants are brought back into production over the next few weeks. The government was also keen to see plants sold to strong public companies, which it hopes will bring some stability to an important but fragmented industry. Much of the country's beef-processing industry is still in private hands and is severely under-capitalised. Further rationalisation may result in the aftermath of the UMP collapse. The purchase of the four plants is Avonmore's second strategic acquisition in just over a week following the purchase of UK processor, Barretts and Bairds, 10 days ago. Avonmore is also expected to announce soon the purchase of Williams Group, the Irish family-owned milling and malting company.</p>

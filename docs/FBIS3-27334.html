			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent in Hong Kong: "Recent </F> Transfer of Military Brass Involved Some 100 Senior Officers"]    [Text] In mid-December last year, some 200 senior officers  of the PRC military gathered at Beijing's Jingxi Guest House to  participate in a secret meeting convened by the CPC Central  Military Commission [CPCCMC] (said to be an enlarged session of  the Central Military Commission.) At the meeting, CPCCMC First  Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing announced an order that had been  signed by CPCCMC Chairman Jiang Zemin: A transfer of the  leadership tier of the PLA's seven military regions, as well as  of the Navy and the Air Force was to be conducted in a big way.  (Please refer to the attached table for the new list of senior  officers.)    According to a well-informed figure, in the recent transfer  of PRC military brass, some 100 PLA senior officers were  involved, and both the scope of the reshuffle and the number of  generals involved has been rare in the PRC military over the  past 10 years.    Western military observers in Beijing believe that the  recent  reshuffle was the boldest action involving high-ranking militry  personnel taken since Jiang Zemin succeeded Deng Xiaoping as the  supreme commander of the Chinese military, and it was aimed at  ensuring Jiang Zemin's firm control and command of military  power from both the organizational and personnel framework.    The recent great change in the PRC high-ranking military  personnel was quite unusual; it did not follow past practice,  which was characterized by briefings beforehand. Jiang Zemin  had no military background, and very few historical connections  with the military; how could he be so bold on this most  sensitive issue of the high-ranking tier of the military? It  has been learned that Deng Xiaoping masterminded the scheme  behind the scenes.    The Chinese people's army all along has been the pillar on  which the CPC has maintained its rule. Since Jiang Zemin had  become the CPCCMC chairman -- the No. 1 man of the Chinese  military -- he had suffered from a lack of confidence in command  and control over the Army. Under the pressure of the internal  and external situations in September 1989, Deng Xiaoping  resigned, and allowed Jiang Zemin to succeed him as "the supreme  commander" of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. On 12  November 1989, when Deng Xiaoping met the military brass  participating in the enlarged session of the Central Military  Commission, he expressed the hope that Jiang would "genuinely  control the Army, and would do a good job of it, at that" in the  presence of the commanders of the three services, whereas he  required the Army -- especially intermediate- and senior-ranking  officers -- to be subject to the command of the Central Military  Commission with Jiang Zemin as the core.    Over the past few years, Jiang has been working hard at his  office as CPCCMC chairman, doing his best to have a hand in Army  affairs, and playing the role of the "supreme commander" to the  three services, but it was not easy for Jiang Zemin to have  genuine command and control over the Army, owing to his lack of  experience and prestige. He was helpless and had to seek Deng  Xiaoping's advice on running the Army on the eve of the  convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central  Committee. It has been learned that the experienced and astute  Deng Xiaoping personally gave him the instruction that it was  imperative to achieve a flow of military brass, and that none of  them should stay too long at a post in the same locality, saying  that Mao Zedong and Deng himself had resorted to this effective  approach when they ran the Army.    In the wake of Jiang Zemin taking "the Central Military  Commission" office, there was instability in the Army's thinking  owing to the aftermath of the "4 June" incident; Jiang Zemin did  not dare take any great action in the personnel framework. Even  when Deng Xiaoping removed the Yangs from their military offices  [Yang Shangkun, former president and formerly permanent vice  chairman and secretary general of the CPCCMC; and his  half-brother, Yang Baibing, former director of the PLA General  Political Department and former member of the PRC Central  Military Commission], Jiang Zemin resorted to comparatively mild  methods to handle the cases of those senior officers who had  followed the Yangs, and refrained from taking extreme measures.    Now it had been five years since Jiang Zemin took command of  the three services, and Deng Xiaoping believed the time was ripe  for Jiang to conduct a major reshuffle of high-level military  leading bodies in a big way. At the same time, the measure also  could be used to test whether or not the top echelon of the  military was obedient to Jiang Zemin's leadership, and whether  or not Jiang Zemin had "complete command over the whole Army."  Jiang followed Deng Xiaoping's instructions.    To ensure the political stability in mainland China after  Deng Xiaoping and to remove hidden dangers, the influences  nurtured by the Yang brothers have been purged mercilessly  during the recent military brass reshuffle. Yang Shangkun was  in the office of Central Military Commission vice chairman and  concurrently secretary-general for many years, and his brother  Yang Baibing all along had had a grip on the power to appoint  senior officers at and above the division level since he had  taken office as director of the PLA's General Political  Department in 1985. In the wake of the 4 June incident, one of  the two brothers was first vice chairman of the Central Military  Commission, and the other was the commission's secretary-general  and concurrently PLA General Political Department director,  responsible for the routine work of the Central Military  Commission. The two brothers would hesitate at nothing, and  they built up their own influence within the Army in a big way.    The recent transfers have resulted in eliminatng the Yangs'  men through selection. For example, Lieutenant General Zhang  Gong, former political commissar of the Beijing Military Region,  first was transferred to the office of political commissar of  the Chengdu Military Region -- a demotion after the 14th party  congress; he was transferred again during the recent reshuffle,  and was replaced by Lieutenant General Zhang Zhijian, former  commander of the Beijing Garrison, who was chosed personally by  Jiang Zemin.    The surfacing of some new faces among the PRC military brass  in the recent reshuffle is another point that catches people's  attention. For a long time, problems in the top echelon of the  PRC military -- such as aging, low educational background, and  making decisions on personnel affairs according to  qualifications and seniority -- had been very difficult to  change, and were not in conformity with the CPC goal of  achieving army modernization.    In the wake of the recent transfer, at the military region,  Navy, and Air Force leadership level, two or three deputies  below the age of 50 have been equipped, and a number of new  faces in the prime of life have come out in the open. For  example, the deputy commander of the Air Force, who formerly was  commander of the Wuhan Airborne Corps and who made his debut  recently, is only 44 years old. These new faces at the top  echelon of the military all have been regarded as absolutely  reliable politically, and they have a tertiary educational  background, as well as rich experience in commanding troops.  They should be regarded as the Chinese military's "stars of  tomorrow." In two or three years, they will be chief  responsible persons of various military regions.    With Deng Xiaoping's behind-the-scenes backing, Jiang  Zemin's  recent transfer of the military brass has been completed  already, and the military brass who participated in the secret  meeting at the Jingxi Guest House had quietly accepted the  accomplished fact of the "great change and transfer," while  expressing their support for the decision by Jiang Zemin, "the  Central Military Commission chairman," one after another. This  has eased Jiang Zemin's mind.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Current Chief Officers of PLA's Seven Military Regions, Navy, Air Force, and |  |Military Institutes                                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |New Post                 |Name                     |Explanation              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Beijing Military Region  |Lt.

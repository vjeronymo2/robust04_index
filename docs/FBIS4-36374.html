			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Linda Sherzer -- italicized passages in English; </F> speakers identified by on-screen caption]    [Text] Palestinian leaders in East Jerusalem today accused  Israel of violating their rights by restricting their political  presence in the city. Our correspondent Linda Sherzer reports  from a meeting that took place at Orient House today:    [Begin recording] [Sherzer] When foreign consular officials  came to Orient House for a briefing from the Palestinians  regarding the situation in the city, they were told that,  excluding Foreign Minister Peres' letter on Jerusalem, Israel is  trying to undermine the Palestinian status in the city. At the  same time, they denied claims that Orient House has become a  colony of the autonomy directorate.    Are you effectively running the autonomy from these  offices in East Jerusalem?    [Faysal al-Husayni] No, no, no, not at all.    [Sherzer] Despite the Israeli warnings that it might shut  down Orient House and other Palestinian institutions, al-Husayni  and his colleagues are determined to strengthen their status in  the city. In a meeting at Orient House last night, the  participants decided to recommend that a special fund be set up  to support the Palestinian status in the city, mainly through  constructing residential buildings on waqf-owned land.  Al-Husayni seeks to establish a special council on Jerusalem  affairs and will devote himself to this issue alone. It was  further declared that institutions such as this represent all of  the Palestinians, not only the residents of Jerusalem.    [Mahdi 'Abd-al-Hadi] No Palestinian National Authority  can maintain its credibility, its future, and its -- what you  call it -- law and order position without its linkage to  Jerusalem. And you cannot close the file of Jerusalem by  telling us: this institution yes, this maybe, and this is  questionable. It is not a question of institution. It is a  question of life and death for us. [end recording]</p>

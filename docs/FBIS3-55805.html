			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 11, BNS - Estonia and Lithuania  announced today they were ready to start cooperation with NATO  under the "Partnership for Peace" plan.    Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar at a press conference  today  indicated Estonia was interested in the "Partnership for Peace"  program. He said the country was going to prepare its formal  position on the issue within the next few days and submit it to  NATO.    He said the document which must bear the signatures of the  president and the prime minister had been drawn up already.    "We wish to start negotiations with NATO on future  cooperation on the first opportunity. We wish to fill the  agreements to be signed with a concrete content," the Estonian  prime minister said.    The issue of Estonia's membership in NATO was also discussed  by the parliamentary foreign Affairs Commission today.    The commission ruled to draw up a draft resolution for the  parliament, seeking the president to write a formal application  for Estonia's membership in NATO. The draft resolution was  approved by the parliament's 9-member Foreign Affairs Commission  with 6 votes to 2 and one abstention. The adoption of the  resolution now depends on a vote in the parliament.    "The idea that remained in the atmosphere at the discussion  was that we were late with our application for NATO membership.  Unlike in Latvia, there is even no institution in Estonia to  have expressed support to Lithuania on the country's entering  its application for NATO membership. The prevailing tone in the  commission was that the process of becoming a member in NATO has  to be set off to express our political attitude," said Tiit  Made, member of the Foreign Affairs Commission.    He said the commission's attitude toward the "Partnership  for  Peace" plan was mainly positive. The commission is to take the  issue for discussion again on Jan. 24, when the text of the  partnership plan is to be more closely examined.    "It was found that early membership in NATO was not a  realistic prospective and that 'Partnership for Peace' provides  the possibility to move forward step-by-step. Also NATO has to  maneuver politically while accepting new members, in view of  Russia's attitude," Made said.    Made in his interview with BNS also criticized the  inactivity  of the Foreign Ministry in expressing interest toward NATO and  supporting Lithuania's application.    Toivo Klaar, head of the political department at the  Estonian  Foreign Ministry, said Estonia's attitude toward the adoption of  the "Partnership for Peace" program was positive and that the  country was going to use every opportunity for cooperation with  NATO and other countries involved in the partnership program.    Klaar said the partnership program provided an "excellent  opportunity for integration with NATO, for working closely with  the alliance and moving toward the final goal, a member's status  in NATO," he said.    Commenting on the NATO leaders' decision not to grant  security guarantees to the countries under the program, Klaar  said that these things "are not yet the way we liked."    But he pointed out as important that consultations can be  held in case the security of the NATO partners is threatened.    "The great potential that NATO has, the power that stands  behind it, and the consultations -- already this by itself can  be a guarantee of peace," he said.    He said the Baltics as well as the Central European  countries  of the so-called Visegrad group -- Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and  the Czech Republic -- both had their best points for integration  with NATO.    "The Visegrad countries have bigger armies and more  experience. At the same time the fact that our armies are small  and young allows us to build them up from the very beginning on  patterns suitable for NATO," Klaar said.    He pointed out as an important step Estonia's decision to  purchase of arms of the NATO standards from Israel, as well as  the Baltics' decision to set up a common Baltic peacekeeping  battalion, which can participate in peacekeeping operations  together with NATO units in the future.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> METER PLAN ADVANCES  </P> <P> A plan to install 607 parking meters along major streets in the city's business  area was tentatively approved by the Culver City Council on Monday pending  public hearings on the proposal.  </P> <P> The meters, planned for commercial and retail areas of Washington, Sepulveda,  Culver, Venice, National and Robertson boulevards and Washington Place, are  intended to raise money for the city and increase available parking for local  businesses by making it easier to enforce one- and two-hour limits, according  to a staff report.  </P> <P> If the meters are installed, the city can expect to earn about $220,000 from  the meters and violations fines, according to the report.  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 1 to approve the plan. Councilman Jim Boulgarides, who  favored an alternative plan that would install almost 1,400 meters, voted  against the measure.  </P> <P> Public hearings on the parking meter plan have not yet been scheduled.  </P></p>

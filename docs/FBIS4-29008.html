			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia has reiterated the need for appropriate and  acceptable mechanisms to relieve coastal states of the onerous  responsibility and burden of keeping the Straits of Malacca safe.    Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said it is  patently unfair to expect the littoral states to use national  funds to underwrite what is, by and large, an international  responsibility. He adds, however, that the littoral states,  Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand do not wish to  adopt any unilateral decision regarding the management of the  strait, one of the busiest waterways in the world.    He was delivering a keynote address at an international  conference on the Straits of Malacca organized by the Malaysian  Institute of Maritime Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. The two-day  inaugural conference attended by about 180 participants will  discuss matters pertaining to the (?risk) management,  navigational, and environmental problems of the strait.    Datuk Abdullah said there was a need for cooperation to  secure a safer navigation and a cleaner strait regime because  many of the potential risks and problems associated with the  strait were the results of externalities. The problems are  created by ships in transit as well as multiple use of the  waterway. He pointed out that the three states are facing the  situation where the international shipping community use the  strait on a free of charge basis while the littoral states have  to bear the financial burden to keep the strait clean and safe.</p>

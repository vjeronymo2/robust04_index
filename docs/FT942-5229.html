			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Architecture: On show at the RA - the tip of a fascinating iceberg / Colin Amery reviews work at The Summer Exhibition Architecture is at the centre of things at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition this year. Not only do the striking exhibits extend into the Central Hall so that they are the first things a visitor sees, but they also occupy a key room that is on everyone's route through the exhibition. This strong presence of architecture cannot be unconnected with the fact that the new president of the Royal Academy is Sir Philip Dowson - from the well known architectural firm of Arup Associates. He has clearly brought a discerning influence to the selection of exhibits and made them representative, not just of the work of the architect academicians, but of the state of architecture in Britain today. There are 18 architect academicians, including one honorary foreign one  - Jorn Utzon - the architect of the Sydney Opera House. All the leading architects of the current generation are members: Sir Norman Foster, Sir Richard Rogers, Richard MacCormac and Michael Hopkins, and Edward Cullinan. The older generation is also there: Sir Philip Powell, Sir Denys Lasdun, Sir Leslie Martin and Colin St. John Wilson. The annual opportunity to exhibit the work of these leaders, mixed in with a cross section of the work of current practice, does give a clear picture of the profession at work. It is an opportunity for the public to see architecture at work - and as large numbers do flock to the Summer Exhibition it is an opportunity the profession should seize energetically. This year the standard is high but, as is the case every year, the visitor is not helped by the pedestrian display and the lack of information about the exhibits. It is not as easy to exhibit a work of architecture as it is to show a painting or a sculpture. You are not looking at the real thing, only a representation at a small scale in model or drawing form of a full-scale building. This needs interpretation and architects (or is it the Academy?) resolutely refuse to do this. The result is that what you are shown at the RA is just the tip of a fascinating but nearly incomprehensible iceberg. The first architectural exhibit to catch the eye is what looks like a peepshow on the left hand wall of the Central Hall. Look into the illuminated box and you will see the maquettes of the work of the artists who worked with the architect, Richard MacCormac on the new residential building for St. John's College, Oxford. You are looking at miniature versions of an engraved glass wall and a sculpted iron screen. It is intriguing but makes little sense without some representation of exactly how they were used in the buildings. A beautiful model of elegant steel staircases by Eva Jiricna does, however, stand alone, because it is immediately comprehensible and can be enjoyed in exactly the way you would enjoy a glimpse inside a futuristic dolls house. Models convey information quickly and effectively - the model of a proposal for new Thames Bridge by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava - is of such clarity and elegance that you wish it could be slung across Thames at Bankside tomorrow. Another brilliant model of a scheme that looks very promising indeed, is the eye-shaped building for Ruskin Library at the University of Lancaster. Even in model form it does have a sense about it of the stones of Italy - a fragment of Venice reinterpreted for the campus. A less comprehensible model, but one that does work as a tortured work of art is the representation by Daniel Libeskind of his extension to the Berlin Museum with its controversial Jewish Museum. The model has an uncanny resemblance, presumably intentional of a shattered Nazi swastika. Sir Norman Foster has also designed what he calls, a 'Centre de la memoire'  -a tribute to victims of the Nazis in the town of Oradour-sur-Glane in France. It is sublimely simple and less tormented than the Libeskind work for Berlin. A circular pool reflects the sky and is surrounded by a curved wall carved with the tragic victims' names. Anyone doubting the ability of Sir Norman to achieve an architectural triumph in the most minimal way, only has to leave the Summer exhibition and take the glass lift to the Sackler Galleries in the Academy itself. Perhaps less profound but equally elegant is the little school in France, the Lycee Albert Camus at Frejus that is shown in photographs. British architects working abroad would be a good subject for the next Royal Academy architectural exhibition. It is a tribute to British talent and living proof that architecture is an international art that so many good architects from the UK now work worldwide. Offices for the Max Planck Institute in Munich by John Partridge, a stadium in Johannesburg by Arup Associates, a competition design for the the new Royal Library in Copenhagen by Paul Koralek (did it win? We are not told), and a monorail station at Wuppertal in Germany are only some of the examples shown in this year's show. Of course they can all be reached from Britain via the Channel Tunnel. A painting by Brendan Neiland and a model by the architects Grimshaw and Partners of their Waterloo Terminal show the high quality and architectural excitement we can expect when the trains start their subaqueous journeys. This year's Royal Academy Summer Exhibition is a demonstration of the high quality of work that is being achieved by British architects. I hope that the architect President with his ambitious plans for an Architecture Centre in what is currently the Museum of Mankind, will start closer to home and make the small changes to the architectural display at the Summer Exhibition that will make it immediately more accessible. The projects need clear displays and careful captions, architectural models do not work when hung as pictures, and photographs of buildings do help. Over to you Sir Philip ...</p>

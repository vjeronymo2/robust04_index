			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / PM cancels Seville trip to deal with 'business' MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday cancelled an official visit to Spain, 24 hours before he was due to fly out, in a move which heightened nervousness in the City and at Westminster over the depth of the government's economic difficulties. The prime minister's unusual step put further pressure on the pound, which fell to a new low in the exchange rate mechanism, at one point dropping to within a tenth of a pfennig of its floor. It also provoked fresh speculation at Westminster that the government has serious problems in reaching agreement on the 1993-94 public expenditure round, due to be discussed by the newly formed chancellor's committee on Thursday. Downing Street insisted that the eleventh-hour decision to postpone Mr Major's visit to Seville's Expo 92 exhibition had nothing to do with sterling but was to meet the pressure of business on his diary. Officials said the new system for managing public expenditure was 'new territory' for the government which warranted close attention from the prime minister. They also added that he would be using the empty space in his diary to examine the spending implications of the new Council Tax and plans for the new BBC Charter. The explanations were widely greeted with scepticism. One Tory MP, Mr Richard Shepherd, warned that the impression was that the government was 'losing control of the economy.' Labour seized on the cancellation as a tacit admission by the government of the dire state of the economy. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said: 'It is a sign that they have been driven to accept, as we have been urging on them for many, many weeks, that this situation is extremely serious.' Independent observers suggested Mr Major may have calculated that it was better to risk market unease at the cancellation of the trip than to be absent abroad when the economy was under intense pressure. With the Treasury continuing to insist that the government will use any means necessary to maintain sterling's ERM position, an interest rate rise cannot be ruled out. Some MPs recall the humiliation for the Labour government in 1976 when Mr Denis (now Lord) Healey, the chancellor, was forced to return from Heathrow to tackle an economic crisis.

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: BAGHDAD;  </P> <P> FLURRY OF ARAB SUMMITRY  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah is scheduled to visit Baghdad and Cairo  this week, continuing a flurry of high-level Middle East diplomacy aimed at  clearing the way for an emergency summit and the strongest show of Arab unity  in decades.  </P> <P> The main obstacles: a long-standing rift between Syria and Iraq and the  seven-year-old feud between Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser  Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad, who has supported PLO rebels bent on  ousting Arafat.  </P> <P> Syria has refused to attend a summit in Baghdad and proposed a meeting of Arab  League foreign ministers in Tunis to decide on an alternative site. Arafat  wants a summit to discuss the massive emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel.  </P></p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (12): Untiring exporter to Europe FOUR YEARS after it was established, Technic Group has won an award for its success in exporting high quality re-tread tyres to EC countries and Scandinavia. The company exports 80 per cent of its output and its largest single EC market is Germany. Its founders, Mr Phil Blood and Mr Tony Farmer, are the joint managing directors. The tyres are produced for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles only. All are made to the same specification as those produced as original equipment, ensuring that Technic products meet European regulations. The company's turnover has grown from Pounds 1.8m to almost Pounds 13m, while output has risen from 3,000 to 27,500 tyres a week. The company employs 130 people and production is centred on a five-acre site near Burton-on-Trent. This year, production is set to increase by 30 per cent and 40 more employees will be taken on.</p>

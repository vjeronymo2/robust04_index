			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Questions and comments concerning the procedure codes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be addressed to: Patricia E. Brooks, Co-Chairperson;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee; HCFA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Coverage and Eligibility Policy; Rm. 401 East High  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rise Building; 6325 Security Boulevard; Baltimore, Maryland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21207.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM code changes that have been approved will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become effective October 1, 1994. The new ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM codes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are listed, along with their proposed DRG classifications,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Tables 6a and 6b (New Diagnosis Codes and New Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Codes, respectively) in section IV of the addendum to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule. As we stated above, the code numbers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their titles were presented for public comment in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both oral and written comments were considered before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codes were approved. Therefore, we are soliciting comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only on the proposed DRG classification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the Committee has approved the expansion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM codes to require an additional digit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid code assignment. Diagnosis codes that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced by expanded codes, other codes, or have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleted are in Table 6c (Invalid Diagnosis Codes). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invalid diagnosis codes will not be recognized by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GROUPER beginning with discharges occurring on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1994. The corresponding new or expanded codes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are included in Tables 6a and 6b. The committee did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delete any procedure codes effective for October 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revisions to diagnosis and procedure code titles are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tables 6d (Revised Diagnosis Code Titles) and 6e (Revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedure Code Titles), which also include the proposed DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assignments for these revised codes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. DRG Refinements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For several years, we have been analyzing major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refinements to the DRG classification system to compensate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals more equitably for treating severely ill Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients. These refinements, generally referred to as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity of illness adjustments, would create DRGs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically for hospital discharges involving very ill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients who consume far more resources than do other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients classified to the same DRGs in the current system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach has been taken by various other groups in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refining the DRG system, most notably the research done for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Yale, the changes incorporated by the State of New York into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its all patient (AP) DRG system, and the all-patient refined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (APR) DRGs, which are a joint effort of 3M/HIS and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our preliminary work on these refinements is finished,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and we have prepared a paper available to the public for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment that describes our proposed severity DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification system as well as the analysis upon which our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal was formulated. Briefly, our approach was to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop a list of secondary diagnoses that have a major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect on the resources used by hospitals in treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients across DRGs and to evaluate the need to create DRGs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for major CCs on a DRG-by-DRG basis. The following is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of our methodology:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Our first step, similar to the process used by Yale,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was to collapse the current paired DRG groupings (DRGs with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and without CCs). We also evaluated the current DRGs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine if any of them could be combined. Based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, we eliminated 24 DRGs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Our next step was to evaluate individual diagnosis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codes to determine if the presence of the diagnosis as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary condition resulted in increased resource use for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals across all DRGs. We analyzed how the presence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the secondary diagnosis affected resource use compared to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other secondary diagnoses that have been classified as non-CC, CC, or major CC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Although our final decisions of the CC designation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary diagnosis were primarily data driven, we did make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some designations based on other factors. Specifically,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of the data, we did not designate a diagnosis as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major if it is indicative of poor quality of care or is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prone to hospital upcoding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The U.S. is due to announce sanctions against Japan next  week  over a trade dispute on the phones, and the sources said its  latest position means it expects the volume of sales of  Motorola-type cellular phones to increase to about 240,000 in  the cellular service area extending from Tokyo to Nagoya.    The U.S. Government says Japan has violated a 1989 cellular  phone trade accord, and is scheduled to unveil by Thursday of  next week a list of Japanese products subject to U.S. import  sanctions if no settlement is reached by then.    At present, the U.S. cellular phone maker Motorola Inc. is  holding talks with its Japanese partner Nippon Idou Tsushin  Corp. (IDO).    IDO has reportedly offered to accept a Motorola demand to  install 159 Motorola base stations for relay of cellular phone  transmissions, while Motorola is said to have withdrawn a demand  that IDO buy 225,000 Motorola phones.    IDO offers both Motorola systems and those made by Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) for its cellular phone  service in Tokyo-Nagoya area. According to U.S. figures, IDO  had signed up 308,000 NTT-type cellular phone subscribers as of  the end of last year, and Motorola a mere 12,900 subscribers.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Jordan raps union 'barons': AEEU chief urges one member, one vote for Labour party MR BILL JORDAN, president of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, yesterday accused senior colleagues in other unions of being 'barons' involved in 'a conspiracy to protect their privileged position' in the Labour party by opposing the principle of one member, one vote. He said: 'It really is time that certain union barons started to look at the real interests of the Labour party rather than trying to protect privileges that have had their day.' Mr Jordan added that the time had come to introduce a system of one member, one vote and replace the current system, which gave trade union block votes a powerful voice in selecting Labour candidates and electing the party leader and deputy. He said: 'Labour voters and individual party members will no longer put up with conspiracies to defend interests. To fail to realise this is to hand a weapon to the government.' Mr Jordan added that Labour did not have the time to delay reform. 'It is a nonsensical situation to have an internal wrangle inside the party over this when we should be concentrating our energy on opposing an unpopular government.' he said. The AEEU leader poured scorn on the proposal by Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMBU general union, to introduce a new form of associate membership in the Labour party to allow trade union levy payers to participate in the election of Labour parliamentary candidates. Mr Jordan said the registered supporter's proposal would be impractical. Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, said the idea was 'codswallop'. Mr Paul Gallagher, leader of the AEEU's electrical section, said: 'We see a fudge, a cop-out. The individual party members are being treated in an insulting way by being told 'you cannot have a decisive say in electing Labour candidates'.' But the AEEU criticism seems unlikely to make much difference to the outcome at this autumn's party conference, where trade union block vote opposition to the introduction of one member, one vote seems likely to carry the day.</p>

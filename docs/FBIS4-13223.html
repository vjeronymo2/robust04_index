			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 18 Apr (INA) -- Deputy Prime Minister Tariq  'Aziz has said those who planned and carried out the aggression  against Iraq, those who took part in it, as well as those who  have imposed the embargo on Iraq, want the Iraqis and others who  believe in Arabism in the Arab world to abandon their belief in  their principles and their adherence to their cause. They also  want to bring the nation to its knees and make it surrender to  their will and wishes.    Addressing delegations taking part in the Baghdad meeting of  Arab journalists, organized by the Iraqi Journalists  Association, 'Aziz said: This meeting in Baghdad boosts the  morale of all of us and sends a signal to imperialist forces and  those collaborating with them that their hopes and aspirations  will not be achieved.    'Aziz added: The meeting in Baghdad at this time in  particular and in this holy month has a special importance and a  great symbolic meaning because it takes place after years of the  aggression and the unjust embargo against Baghdad, which still  represents a bright center of patriotism and nationalism and a  bulwark that believes in the nation's issues that have a bearing  on its destiny.    Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz added that the basis of  any  political or diplomatic activity is steadfastness and adherence  to patriotic and nationalistic principles. He pointed out the  major reasons for the change in the international position on  the question of the unjust embargo against Iraq, attributing  this primarily to the steadfastness of Iraq and its leadership  and their firm adherence to national and pan-Arab principles.    The deputy prime minister added that the aggression against  Iraq did not bring Iraq to its knees, as the enemies had planned  and dreamed. The embargo has also not made the leadership and  the people of Iraq abandon the national and pan-Arab principles  in which they believe and for which they have struggled. He  underlined in this regard the reconstruction campaign, which has  not been a purely technical process. He said the reconstruction  process was launched by a decision from the leadership.  However, the people took part in making this decision and  implementing it. This means that the entire population rejects  the threat of former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and the  U.S. scheme and is sending a clear message in this regard.    Tariq 'Aziz added: The reconstruction process is a great act  of jihad, which remarkably demonstrated the creativity of the  Iraqis and reflected the people's resolve to reject aggression.  This also reflects the strong relationship and harmony between  the leadership and the people.    Tariq 'Aziz added: Steadfastness, success in reconstruction,  and the strong relationship between the leadership and people  are all behind the aggression states' reconsideration of their  positions and their listening to Iraq. The steadfastness of the  Iraqis made all the facts come out in the open. The strong  relationship between the leadership and the people has become  clear for all, including the enemies.    In his comprehensive conversation with Arab journalists,  Tariq 'Aziz reviewed developments in the international arena and  the national and pan-Arab constant principles in Iraq's policy,  whether before or after the aggression. He said Iraq sticks to  its option to live.    He further explained the current split in the Security  Council toward many issues, saying this points to the decline of  U.S. hegemony. This means that the forces that have faith in  their central causes are gaining more ground.    'Aziz also discussed the material and historical losses of  some countries that took part in the aggression and the embargo  against Iraq, saying these countries have started to feel that  they have lost more than the bribes and rewards they gained, and  this is an important fact.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Far East strength pays off - How Fleming is bucking the trend Turbulent world markets have been unkind to the investment banking industry this year, although Robert Fleming Holdings appears to be bucking the trend. Yesterday Fleming said its pre-tax profits rose by 6.3 per cent to Pounds 97.4m and that, moreover, its investment banking division's profits were off only slightly from last year's level. Investment management, which includes a US-based joint venture with mutual fund company T Rowe Price, contributed to the group's earnings stability with a 16 per cent profits rise. Significantly, much of the asset growth came from retail products, especially in the US, where investors are increasingly keen to buy non-domestic investment funds. Mr John Manser, group chief executive, attributes the group's ability to withstand the current tough markets to two key factors. 'Our businesses are very well spread. We are in both retail and wholesale markets and we have a good geographical spread. We operate in 32 markets and not all of those do the same thing at the same time.' And, perhaps most critically, Mr Manser says: 'We have strength in the Far East through Jardine Fleming.' Jardine Fleming, the investment bank owned jointly with Jardine Matheson, had post-tax profits of Dollars 111m (Pounds 67.6m) for the six months to June 30, a 44 per cent increase on last time. Mr Manser says the firm's strategy, unlike that of some of its competitors, is to grow globally through joint ventures, such as that with Jardine Fleming, rather than to try to set up new operations with a high cost base. 'We would rather have a smaller part of a bigger whole than a larger part of a smaller whole.' He said the group's resilience partly reflected its success in integrating the business generated from London into its joint ventures around the world. These also include a 50 per cent stake in leading Australian stockbroker Orde Minett and a South African joint venture with Martin and Co. The structure allows decision-making to take place at the local level, where management is likely to be better informed about conditions. 'It relieves the strain on management,' he says. 'Running a global business from a single spot will eventually overwhelm the management.' There are only two key decision-making committees within Fleming; a seven-member body at the Group headquarters in London and a similar-sized group at Jardine Fleming. 'There is a strategic issue here,' says a securities analyst with a rival investment banking firm. 'The strategy of being in a niche business and being risk averse is likely to be more successful long-term than the integrated houses, who are taking a risk-based approach.' And, perhaps most significantly for the current round of earnings, Fleming has no market making capacity in UK equities and little of it within Europe. Instead, it has concentrated on its role as an agency broker, although it is building selected distribution and research capacity for European shares. However, Fleming is not entirely risk averse, according to its competitors. It has been strikingly aggressive about bidding for capital markets business, particularly in the privatisation field. According to Euromoney Bondware, an industry database, Fleming and its Jardine Fleming venture were the leading bookrunner for Asian equity and equity-linked deals in 1993 and 1994; and according to Acquisitions Monthly, it ranks third in advisory business for UK public takeovers so far this year. Earlier this autumn, Fleming drew gasps from some of its competitors for agreeing to act as global coordinator for a Dollars 900m international distribution of warrants for newly privatised Pakistan Telecom. Pakistan asked a group of banks to bid for the business - whose most recent accounts were two years old - without a due diligence review. 'Of course we had some reservations about that fact but from our analysis, in relation to other Asian telecom companies, we felt it was good value,' a Fleming official explained. While many competitors backed out, Fleming took the business on, although shortly after it had distributed the warrants the price fell sharply. This reflected a correction of information which had appeared in the domestic prospectus which had been misinterpreted by foreign investors.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Riding the cyclical swing Sir, 'Is there anything that governments can do to reassert control of the business cycle?', asked your leader, 'Slow-motion economics' (September 4). Would that they got rid of the cursed thing instead] Mr Eddie George, the new governor of the venerable (but less old than the business cycle) Bank of England, has called for three years of output growth faster than the rate of inflation. That would be a good start, exceeding more than half the normal length of a cyclical upswing, and go a long way to ensure that the subsequent output growth too was sustained. Can we have perpetual motion in one country when others still cling to their old cyclical ways? Let the Old Lady and the new chancellor jointly show the way. Gill Sturdy, 881 Nether Street, North Finchley, London N12 8AD</p>

This invitation was made by Iranian Foreign Ministry Under  Secretary Mohammad Javad Zarif, who did not rule out that this  committee could become a nucleus for a security alliance  grouping all states situated on the Gulf. Well-informed sources  have said that the Iranian invitation is addressed for the time  being to the six GCC member states but could include Iraq later,  specifically after its present problems are settled.    The Iranian official said that such a committee would enable  the region's states to discuss all their problems and analyze  the threats to their joint security.    Diplomats believe that the Iranian proposal is aimed at  splitting the "Damascus Declaration," which includes the GCC  states, Egypt, and Syria.    Iran proposed the idea in the past but the proposal  collapsed  because of the Iranian-Iraqi dispute.    Observers believe that this proposal may face the same fate  as a result of the disputes between Iran and a number of states  in the region, especially the United Arab Emirates, which claims  sovereignty over three islands currently occupied by Iran.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 9  June.    Argentina's balance of trade for the first four months of  1994 produced a deficit of $2.4 billion, 380 percent greater  than the deficit in the same period last year, according to  Indec, the Institute of Statistics and Census. The figures  published yesterday show that April's deficit was $556 million,  which is slightly less than the deficits of $714 million, $525  million, and $609 million in January, February, and March  respectively.    Meanwhile, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said yesterday  that the deficit wasn't worrisome, as one has to consider the  `vigorous investments being carried out and the growth that this  brings.' Cavallo said, however, that the deficit `will give rise  to a lot of pressure from many sectors to restrict imports,'  although he made it clear that the government would not go back  on its liberalization policies.    On the positive side, the Indec statistics also show that  activity levels are growing, the investment rate is up, the  consumption rate is down, and the national savings rate is  increasing. The figures also show that the export of  manufactured goods is increasing. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES  HERALD in English 7 Jun 94 p 7)    According to data supplied by Indec, the trade balance  deficit since April 1991, when the convertibility program was  launched, amounts to some $5 billion. Between January and  December 1991 a trade balance surplus of 3.7024 billion pesos  was achieved; for the April to December 1991 period the surplus  was 2.655 billion pesos. The trade balance deficit for 1992 was  2.8735 billion pesos; in 1993 3.6658 billion pesos; and 1.1133  billion pesos during the first two months of 1994. (Buenos  Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 6)    Inflation in May was 0.3 percent, bringing the annual rate  for the year ending May 31 to 3.4 percent, the Indec census  bureau said yesterday. Inflation last month was due mainly to  the 4.5 percent rise in electricity and gas prices, which had a  strong influence on the final figure. Prices have risen 0.8  percent so far in 1994.    According to the same statistics, wholesale prices in May  went up by 0.6 percent, while construction costs were up by 0.3  percent.    As to retail prices, housing costs increased by 1.6 percent  while health costs were up 0.8 percent, a rise caused mainly by  the 1 percent rise in the cost of medicines. The price of  housing equipment was up 0.6 percent, clothing was up by 0.5  percent, education 0.3 percent, and general goods and  communications rose by 0.1 percent.    The cost of food and beverages, which are usually a large  part of a family's expenditure, were unchanged from the previous  month, although the prices of some products went up: oranges up  10.6 percent, bananas up 4.2 percent, fresh cheese up 3.8  percent, and eggs up 3.4 percent. These were offset by a drop  of 0.5 percent in meat prices.    After 38 months of convertibility, prices have gone up  generally by 54.2 percent. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in  English 4 Jun 94 p 7)    A group of Petroleum Industry Chamber, CIP, entrepreneurs  today informed President Carlos Menem that global petroleum  industry investments in Argentina would total more than $15  billion through the year 2000. CIP President Jorge Brea  indicated: "Investments totaled $1.1 billion per year between  1986 and 1990. Investments will total $2.1 billion per year  between 1991 and 1995, and $2.3 billion per year between 1996  and the year 2000." Brea also told Menem that following  deregulation, crude oil production in Argentina grew from 28  million cubic meters in 1990 to a record 34.6 million cubic  meters in 1993.

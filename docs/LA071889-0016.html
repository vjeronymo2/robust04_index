			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JURY PONDERS ON LIFE OR DEATH FOR LUCAS  </P> <P> A jury Monday began deciding the punishment of convicted murderer David Lucas,  but stopped after two hours and will resume its deliberations today.  </P> <P> The San Diego Superior Court jury is deciding whether Lucas, 34, a carpet  cleaner from Spring Valley, should be put to death or sentenced to life in  prison without parole for the murders of two women and a small child.  </P> <P> The jury heard closing arguments Monday in which the prosecutor called Lucas "a  butcher" who had "a lust for death."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Williams told jurors that Lucas deserves the death  penalty and said the state of California should abolish it if someone like  Lucas doesn't merit it.  </P> <P> He urged the jury to get into the "battle between good and evil" by asking that  someone like Lucas who committed "the ultimate acts of evil" be executed.  </P> <P> "We know this lust for death will sit with Mr. Lucas for the rest of his life,"  said Williams.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Executions Described  </P> <P> Responding, Lucas' attorney Steve Feldman urged jurors to spare him and  described in detail the execution process in San Quentin State Prison.  </P> <P> He said the act of execution, involving Lucas "writhing" for 15 minutes while  suffocating in the gas chamber, was "more cold-blooded than any of the murders  Mr. Lucas has been convicted of."  </P> <P> Staring coldly at Williams, the defense attorney urged the jury not to satisfy  the prosecutor's "lust for killing David Lucas."  </P> <P> Feldman cited remarks made by anti-death proponents, including Mother Teresa,  Pope John Paul II and Benjamin Franklin.  </P> <P> "Mr. Lucas is not in the category of the irredeemable," Feldman said.  </P> <P> He cited testimony by Lucas' family members who begged the jury last week to  spare him.  </P> <P> "Mercy, mercy, the noblest of human emotions . . . which distinguishes us from  the animals," Feldman said.  </P> <P> Lucas was convicted June 21 of the first-degree murders of University of San  Diego student Anne Swanke, 22, on Nov. 20, 1984 and of Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and  her son, Colin Jacobs, 3, on May 4, 1979. He was also found guilty of  attempting to murder Jodie Santiago-Robertson, 34, of Seattle, in a June 8,  1984, attack.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FEENEYS SAW 'SISTER MARY' AS CHALLENGE;  </P> <P> ARTS FUNDING: COSTA MESA COUPLE, PERHAPS THE PLAY'S MOST VOCIFEROUS FOES, SAY  THEY'RE ONLY DEFENDING THEIR BELIEFS.  </P> <P> "We're not activists at all," says Ernie Feeney. "We're just concerned  citizens."  </P> <P> Despite that humble claim, the Feeneys -- Ernie and husband John -- have  single-handedly pushed Costa Mesa into the national debate over censorship and  public funding of the arts.  </P> <P> The Feeneys have lived in Costa Mesa for 25 years, and say they have been  active in city matters for about seven years. It is the arts issue, however,  that suddenly has boosted them to prominence. The Feeneys, who are Catholic,  say they are acting in defense of their beliefs.  </P> <P> "Our whole thing with the arts has not been the obscenity issue. It has been  the religious issue," Ernie Feeney said. "I will defend my faith."  </P> <P> That pledge is what provoked the Feeneys in June to protest a flyer distributed  by South Coast Repertory urging support of the besieged National Endowment for  the Arts.  </P> <P> "I got a copy of the flyer and they give a full-fledged, unconditional  endorsement to the NEA," John Feeney said at the time. "In doing so, they gave  an endorsement to things like submerging an image of Jesus Christ in vats of  urine," a reference to the now-famous Andres Serrano photograph "Piss Christ,"  which helped set off the NEA controversy.  </P> <P> The events the Feeneys set in motion culminated in the adoption of an addendum  to the city's cultural arts grants agreements, requiring recipients to pledge  not to use city money for "obscene matters" or "religious or political  activities."  </P> <P> John and Ernie Feeney are nothing if not organized, a fact demonstrated by  Ernie's campaign against the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse production of  Christopher Durang's satire, "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You."  The Feeneys have branded the play as "anti-religious bigotry."  </P> <P> They are tenacious city watchdogs who -- for people who represent no  certifiable constituency -- have developed an uncanny knack for pushing buttons  and getting their view across at City Hall.  </P> <P> The Feeneys knew all about Durang's satire of parochial education well before  they first got wind of the Costa Mesa production in a Sept. 6 newspaper  listing, one day ahead of the play's opening. "Sister Mary," which debuted in  1979, has outraged a number of Catholic activists, which resulted in a  well-publicized 1982 controversy in St. Louis.  </P> <P> Ernie Feeney wasted little time before swinging into action.  </P> <P> She got tickets for the play's opening night and invited along Jo Ellen Allen,  a Corona del Mar resident and, more important, president of the California  chapter of Eagle Forum, conservative columnist Phyllis Schlafly's "pro-family"  organization. Feeney is a member of the group, which has been active in arguing  against reauthorization of the NEA.  </P> <P> Feeney obtained from the city a copy of the playhouse's cultural arts grant  application, along with a copy of the charter agreement between the city and  playhouse and a copy of the company's 1990 season announcement -- which listed  the comedy "Born Yesterday" as the season opener.  </P> <P> By the following Monday, she had aired her views on the play in the press and  had contacted two members of the City Council, Sandra L. Genis and Mayor Peter  F. Buffa, who were sympathetic when the Feeneys had earlier pushed for new  restrictions on city arts grants.  </P> <P> As TV cameras rolled at Tuesday's council study session, Feeney addressed the  council and the city arts commission, piggybacking on a scheduled report that,  ironically, called for increased city arts spending. Feeney, flanked by Allen  and husband John, was armed with information packets for the press and even  brought a visual aid, a doll of "Sesame Street" character Ernie that she said  was used to represent the Christ child in "Sister Mary."  </P> <P> The Feeneys, who first became active in city matters when they joined in  complaints over noise from the Pacific Amphitheatre, attend all of the council  meetings or watch them on cable TV. Ernie Feeney also attends each study  session. (John Feeney is a salesman, Ernie does not work outside their home).  </P> <P> Their objection to the production of "Sister Mary" stems from the fact that the  playhouse receives city tax dollars, and they reject the argument that no city  funds were spent directly on this production.  </P> <P> "I think they need to remember that our tax money is still subsidizing them,"  Ernie Feeney said. "In essence what they're doing is making us buy a ticket to  their production."  </P> <P> The bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange added his voice to the  Feeneys, in response to a Times editorial critical of the city's stance, by  lambasting the play as an "unremitting travesty of Catholic ritual, tradition  and values, with its particularly cruel caricature of Catholic sisters." Bishop  Norman F. McFarland continued, " . . . a serious injustice is added to the  insult when such religious bigotry is supported with tax dollars."  </P> <P> While "Sister Mary" co-producer David Sharp has said that the play's  controversial nature was not discussed during its selection, Ernie Feeney said  she believes the play was chosen expressly to challenge the city's new arts  grant restrictions.  </P> <P> "I rather take it as a slap in the face. I take their whole intent as a  challenge," she said. "They're making their statement, and they left us no  choice but to respond to their statement."  </P></p>

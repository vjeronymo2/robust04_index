			<p>BFN     [Text] The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] is  calling for an immediate investigation within the State Council  that some transitional ministers are planning an attack on NPFL  positions. Recently, intelligence reports revealed that some  LNTG [Liberia National Transition Government] ministers had a  meeting in Guinea, in an attempt to destabilize the ongoing  peace process. The report said these ministers are financing  armed groups to attack Nimba and Bong counties from Guinea. The  NPFL said any attack out of Guinea will meet with reciprocal  action.    In a letter to Guinean President Lansana Conte, NPFL leader  Charles Gankay Taylor urged him not to allow his territory to be  used as a springboard for launching attacks on Liberia. He said  any covert assistance by Guinea to armed groups attempting to  derail the peace process in Liberia, will amount to a violation  of international law and an encroachment on the territorial  integrity of Liberia. President Taylor said the brotherly  relations between Guinea and Liberia will continue, and a few  power-seekers and unpatriotic citizens of Liberia should not be  allowed to destroy the lives of peoples of the two countries.</p>

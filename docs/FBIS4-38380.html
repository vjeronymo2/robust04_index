			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- Disagreements over the  location of the Russian Embassy in Seoul have lately become one  of the main irritants in relations between Russia and South  Korea, Russian high- level sources said on the eve of South  Korean President Kim Yong- Sam's official visit to Moscow  beginning on June 1.    The sources said that the South Korean Embassy in Moscow is  located in the prestigious quarters of the city in an excellent  building, while the Russian diplomats have been provided with a  building in a poor condition on the outskirts of the city.    Additionally, the South Korean authorities have confiscated,  without ample enough grounds, according to the Russian side, the  territory previously occupied by the Russian Embassy. "This  question has a very disappointing side," a high-ranking Russian  diplomat said.    After South Korea established diplomatic relations with  China, the Russian officials recalled, China received the  building of the former Taiwanese Embassy in the centre of Seoul  without any problem. Vietnam was provided with the building  previously occupied by South Vietnam and only Russia has been  denied the right to the building which, officials said, had been  its rightful property since the end of the 19th century.</p>

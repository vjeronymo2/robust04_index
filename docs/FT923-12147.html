			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Managed retail arm clips Gibbs Mew Despite an improved performance from its brewing and wholesaling activities, annual profits at Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based group, showed a 6 per cent decline. The pre-tax line at this USM-traded brewer of Bishop's Tipple strong beer amounted to Pounds 633,000 (Pounds 673,000) for the 12 months to March 28. The downturn reflected an 'extremely difficult trading environment' in the managed retailing arm, according to Mr Peter Gibbs, chairman. The brewing side achieved trading profits of Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 1.64m) on sales of Pounds 17m (Pounds 15.2m). Managed houses profit, however, fell to just Pounds 24,000 (Pounds 160,000) on sales of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.7m). The contribution to profits from property disposals from the tied estate fell sharply - from Pounds 724,000 to Pounds 188,000 - reflecting the depressed property market. Nevertheless, the 75 per cent owned Bridger Properties offshoot reduced its pre-tax loss to Pounds 289,000 (Pounds 417,000). After a reduced tax charge, earnings per share edged ahead to 11.89p (10.97p). A recommended final dividend of 3.75p maintains the total at 6.75p.</p>

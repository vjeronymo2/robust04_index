			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Competition for Midland It would be easy to dismiss Lloyds' hope of acquiring Midland as forlorn. Brussels has cleared the rival suit from the Hongkong Bank and Mr Michael Heseltine yesterday referred the Lloyds proposal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Still, it is too early to write off the UK clearer's chances. Lloyds must have always known that referral was probable. Its determination to stay in the fight suggests it reckons to stand a good chance of winning the MMC debate. Indeed, the competition issues are not as clear as many in the Hongkong Bank camp suppose. The bid is unlikely to be disallowed simply on the basis of a concentration of branches in West Glamorgan, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire. The MMC is not compelled to give a straight answer. Lloyds may decide to accept any conditions it imposes. Other banks are already quietly expressing interest in acquiring Midland branches. Lloyds acknowledges possible problems in the small business sector, but here it is clearly willing to meet the requirements of the competition authorities. Midland investors must thus still allow for the possibility that an offer from Lloyds will eventually become firm. That will make things difficult for HSBC. The objections to its offer - that large banking conglomerates rarely perform well and that part of the price will be paid in loan stock of uncertain liquidity - still hold. HSBC will almost certainly have to consider improving its offer by providing an underwritten cash alternative to the loan stock. But it cannot easily increase it. The dilution could hit its own share price, wiping out any extra value it tried to create. Lloyds is not yet condemned to look elsewhere, however much this might disappoint investors who have pushed up the Royal Bank of Scotland by 8 per cent this month in anticipation of it becoming an alternative target.</p>

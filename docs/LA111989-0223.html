			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' CROSS-COUNTRY;  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK IS SECOND IN 4-A FINAL  </P> <P> After a nerve-wracking week, Mel Silva looked refreshed, rejuvenated and very  much relieved after watching his Saddleback High School boys' team run to a  second-place finish at the Southern Section 4-A cross-country championships  Saturday at Mt. SAC.  </P> <P> Although Camarillo, the 4-A's top-ranked team, came away with the title after  placing five runners in the top 16, good for 56 points, Saddleback defended its  No. 1 ranking among Orange County teams. The Roadrunners had 103 points; San  Clemente was third with 118.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley finished sixth (166), Santa Ana seventh (168), two-time  defending champion Dana Hills ninth (189) and Villa Park (263) 12th.  </P> <P> "I was very nervous, very, very nervous," Silva said. "I told the kids,  'Maintain on the hills, and just attack on the downhills.' That's what they  did."  </P> <P> Last Friday in the Southern Section preliminaries, San Clemente, the county's  No. 2-ranked team, edged Saddleback, 62-96, to win its heat. But Saddleback was  running at that time without one of its top five, sophomore Joey Heredia, whose  father died last week.  </P> <P> Saturday, Heredia rejoined the team, placing 32nd overall after teammates Eddie  Salinas (10th, 15:32), Rob Price (15th, 15:45) and Albert Ochoa (25th, 16:21.  Elias Gil (34th, 16:32) rounded out the Roadrunner top five.  </P> <P> "Joey wanted to run this race real well for his dad, and the whole team wanted  to help him out that way," Silva said.  </P> <P> "Our kids . . . they're . . . they're . . . they're so tough."  </P> <P> And they're not finished yet. Saddleback, which before Saturday had never run  in a Southern Section final, qualified for Saturday's state championships at  Frenso, as did San Clemente. The two schools will represent the Southern  Section along with Camarillo, Hart and Agoura in the large schools division.  </P> <P> In the race for the best county individual, Dana Hills' Daniel Niednagel and  San Clemente's Mike Farrell again staged their one-on-one duel, with  Saddleback's Salinas trying to keep them both in check.  </P> <P> Going into the race, Niednagel had a 2-1 edge on Farrell this season. Saturday,  Niednagel placed seventh overall in 15:24, two places ahead of Farrell (15:30).  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Niednagel, it wasn't quite fast enough for a berth at the  state meet, which he could have earned as an individual had he been among the  five fastest overall runners in the state's large schools division (enrollment  1,600 and up).  </P> <P> "Of course I want to go to state, but the season's been so long," Niednagel, a  junior, said.  </P> <P> Said Farrell who, unlike most of the top 10 finishers, started the race  conservatively, at mid-pack: "I was trying to work my way up. I had my eye on  him (Niednagel). I should've beat him, but he just got away from me today. . .  . I'm not disappointed, though. He just had a better race than me."  </P> <P> And besides, Farrell's going to Fresno.  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Laguna Beach, led by David Crain (ninth, 16:05), placed fourth in the 2-A  division and will advance to the state meet in the small schools (under 700  enrollment) division. . . . Trabuco Hills' Mike Cowdrey (sixth in 16:00) also  qualified, as did Mark Gonzales of La Habra, 10th in the 3-A race in 16:07.  Gonzales' teammate, Tim Mahon, placed 11th, narrowly missing a state qualifying  berth. . . . In the 1-A, Whittier Christian was third and Santa Margarita  seventh.  </P></p>

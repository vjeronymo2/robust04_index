			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The term ``Walla Walla Sweet Onion'' should be defined to specify the commodity covered by the proposed order and to which the terms and provisions of the marketing order would be applicable. The record indicates that a ``Walla Walla Sweet Onion'' may be any of a number of onion varieties grown in the production area, rather than one specific variety of onion. However, testimony indicated that onions acquire special characteristics when grown in the proposed production area. This is due in part to the low sulfur content of the soil. Further, according to testimony, the term ``Walla Walla Sweet Onion'' has a specific meaning in the onion trade, and consumers perceive Walla Walla Sweet Onions as a unique commodity distinct from other onions. For these reasons, the term ``Walla Walla Sweet Onion'' should be defined to mean all varieties of the genus and species Allium cepa,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> except sweet Spanish types, grown in the proposed production area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide for the possibility that other types of onions that have characteristics similar to what is now known as the ``Walla Walla Sweet Onion'' may be grown in the production area in the future, the committee should be authorized, upon approval of the Secretary, to add those types of onions to the types included under the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Walla Walla Sweet Onion.'' This would be accomplished through informal rulemaking procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition should include dry onions, onions grown for transplanting, and salad onions. The definition in the order as originally proposed also included onion seed. However, testimony indicated that regulating seed was not necessary, as the intent of the proponents is to define Walla Walla Sweet Onions as only those sweet onions grown in the production area. Accordingly, if onions are grown outside the proposed production area from seed produced within that area, the resulting onions would not be true Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Testimony indicated that this is because of the soil and climate unique to the Walla Walla River Valley, comprising designated parts of Walla Walla County, Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon. Accordingly, the term ``seeds'' should not be included in the proposed definition of Walla Walla Sweet Onions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The term ``handler'' is synonymous with the term ``shipper'' and should be defined to identify the persons who would be subject to regulation under the order. Such term should apply to any person, except a common or contract carrier transporting Walla Walla Sweet Onions owned by another person, who first performs any of the activities within the scope of the term ``handle'' as hereinafter defined. The definition identifies persons who would be responsible for meeting the requirements of the order, including paying assessments and submitting reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Common or contract carriers transporting Walla Walla Sweet Onions owned by another person would not be considered as handlers, even though they transport Walla Walla Sweet Onions, because such carriers do not have control over the Walla Walla Sweet Onions being transported. Nor are they the persons who cause the introduction of such Walla Walla Sweet Onions into the stream of commerce. The only interest of a common or contract carrier in such Walla Walla Sweet Onions is to transport them for a service charge to destinations determined by others.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Growers who handle their own Walla Walla Sweet Onions or Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown by others would be considered handlers under the order. Any person who purchases Walla Walla Sweet Onions from growers and performs any other handling function such as grading and packing such Walla Walla Sweet Onions would be a handler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``handle'' should be defined in the order to establish the specific functions that would place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Walla Walla Sweet Onions in the current of commerce within the production area or between the production area and any point outside thereof, and to provide a basis for determining which functions are subject to regulation under authority of the marketing order. ``Handle'' and ``ship'' are used synonymously and the definition should so indicate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The record indicates that the term ``handle'' should include the acts of packaging, loading, transporting or selling Walla Walla Sweet Onions. However, the term ``handle'' should not include the transportation, sale or delivery of field-run Walla Walla Sweet Onions to a handler within the production area or to a handler outside the production area but within Walla Walla County, Washington, or Umatilla County, Oregon, to have such onions prepared for market. In this case, the onions have not yet been prepared for market nor are they in their existing condition being transported to market. Most sellers and buyers do not consider them as yet suitable or appropriate for commercial transactions and, as such, they have not yet entered the stream of commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our province has put the prices of residents' basic  daily necessities and services under overall control beginning  early May.    In light of our province's actual conditions, in addition to  the 20 items of goods and services whose prices and charges  should be subject to overall price control as stipulated by the  State Council, that is, wheat flour, polished long-grained  nonglutinous rice, polished round-grained nonglutinous rice,  edible plant oils, meat, eggs, milk, salt, sugar, soy sauce,  detergents, coal for domestic use, liquefied petroleum gas, gas  for domestic use, rents, running water charges, tuition fees and  extras, child-care fees, medical care fees, and in-city public  transport fares, the provincial government decided to put the  prices of medicines under control. Price bureaus of various  prefectures, autonomous prefectures, counties, and cities are  encouraged to work out lists of additional specific items to be  put under price control and report them to local governments for  implementation.    Since the prices of our province's 21 items subject to price  control have mostly been liberalized, to ensure the active  control of commodity prices by means of price control, the  provincial government has worked out specific stipulations on  the division of authority over and measures for price control.  It is learned that price control over the 21 items of  residents' daily necessities and service charges has been  carried out in different ways in accordance with the degree of  impact on residents and the existing price management. These  are mainly monitoring and guiding the trend of commodity prices  by regulating the filing system, collecting information about  commodity price changes and promulgating rules and regulations,  providing information for macrodecisionmaking, introducing  buying and selling price differential control and wholesale and  retail price differential control to the circulation links of  some commodities, and applying moderate administrative  intervention in the behavior of increasing the prices of some  commodities by introducing a report-for-approval system at the  provincial and city levels or adopting interim price limiting  measures.    The provincial government stressed: Price control should be  carried out at the same time as the enterprises' decisionmaking  power to set their own prices is respected. All producing and  operating enterprises should properly handle the relationship  between reform, development, and stability. In setting their  prices, they should take it as a prerequisite to maintain market  and social stability and rigorously standardize their own price  readjusting behavior. At the same time, they have the duty to  report readjustments of the prices of residents' basic daily  necessities and service charges to their superior price  departments for approval and recording in accordance with state  stipulations. Subordinate governments also have the duty to  report readjustments of the prices of basic daily necessities  and service charges to their superior governments.</p>

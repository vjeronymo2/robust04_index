			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Shake-up of Tecs called for by CBI THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday criticised the government for being too prescriptive in the detailed running of Training and Enterprise Councils, while failing to give them strategic leadership. The CBI's criticisms are contained in a policy document on employer-led Tecs, which administer government-funded training programmes in England and Wales. The report expressed broad support for Tecs, which spend Pounds 2bn of public funds, but highlighted up to 50 areas where the CBI believed there was need for reform. Proposals included: A review of the contracts between the government and Tecs, and simplification of the administrative requirements Tecs imposed on suppliers. Funding of Tecs through an intermediary council, rather than directly by the department of employment. A clearer government statement of the role of Tecs. More local accountability, with codes of practice.</p>

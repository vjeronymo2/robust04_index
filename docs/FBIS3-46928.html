			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The curbs on the circulation of THE ECONOMIST  magazine will be lifted from the 15th of this month when it is  degazetted as a declared foreign newspaper. The magazine was  gazetted in August last year for refusing to print a reply from  the government. The reply was sent by Singapore's high  commissioner in London to rebut a letter which Mr. J.B.  Jeyaretnam [former opposition MP] wrote to the magazine about  his 1986 criminal conviction. At the time of gazetting, THE  ECONOMIST had a circulation of 7,500 copies here. The government  had then said it would reduce the circulation progressively. A  statement from the Ministry of Information and the Arts said  with the degazetting, THE ECONOMIST will not need to appoint an  authorized distributor. It will also not be required to have  all its copies marked with stickers.</p>

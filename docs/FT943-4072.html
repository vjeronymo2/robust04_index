			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Costain Costain continues to spring nasty surprises. Admittedly, its profits plunge was not as bad as it looks since last year's Pounds 68.1m pre-tax result benefited from a Pounds 68.5m profit on disposals. But the US mining operations, which were supposed to be the engine of growth, are now in loss  -and the decision to sell these businesses raises the question of where the group goes next. Shareholders have stumped up Pounds 160m in rights issue money over the last three years, but the group's market capitalisation is not even worth that amount and the outlook remains glum. On the positive side, the continuing disposals programme will finally end fears that the group was in danger of being strangled by its debts. The balance sheet is more or less repaired. Margins at the rump contracting businesses are poor at 1.3 per cent, but Costain claims they are better than most in the industry. Nevertheless, the group does not have the scale or financial muscle to participate in the high-margin lead-contracting business for large-scale private finance initiatives. Elsewhere, the contracting market is unlikely to improve for at least a couple of years. Probably the best option would be for Costain to be absorbed by another construction company. Such deals do not have a good record, but they can work if the differing cultures can be successfully welded.</p>

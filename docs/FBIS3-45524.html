			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Year-end Economic Commentary" by Wu Jincai (0702 6930 </F> 2088): "Market-Orientation -- New Challenge for State-Owned  Enterprises in the New Year"]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Dec (XINHUA) -- At the end of the year,  large- and medium-sized enterprises are faced with the severe  test of how to gear themselves towards the market in 1994. In  the coming year, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises  can occupy a favorable position in the overall economic  situation only by continuing their efforts to gear towards the  market and to readjust the industrial structure and product mix  in accordance with the market's needs .    The year 1993 witnessed strong growth in China's industry  and  economy. But problems in economic performance did not show a  marked turn for the better. Where do the problems stem from?  Many personages in economic circles believe the fundamental  reason for the low economic performance of China's many  "quick-profit" enterprises lies in the enterprises themselves.  Take enterprise funds as an example. An outstanding problem is  long-term expansion of fixed asset investment, which results in  excessive input for enlarged reproduction taking the place of  the need for simple reproduction. Since 1993 -- the second half  of the year in particular -- China's banks have done a great  deal of work and have achieved marked results in providing funds  on a priority basis to meet the needs of key large- and  medium-sized enterprises in production. But an excessive fixed  asset investment scale, over-rapid growth rates in industrial  production, and decreasing product sales rates are still  fundamental reasons for the shortage of funds for enterprises.  This thorny problem, which continually troubled us in the  1980's, is still worthy of our concern. Judging from some  circumstances in 1993, phenomena began to arise again -- such as  some enterprises failing to organize production in accordance  with market demand, having no ready markets to sell their  products, having poor transportation conditions to ship  products, and defaulting on commodity payments -- which caused  enterprises to overspend their three kinds of funds [funds  occupied by ready commodities of state-owned enterprises, funds  on commodities which have been shipped from factories, and funds  from receivable and prepaid accounts], therefore stifling the  circulation of large amounts of funds. In some localities,  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises experienced  increasing losses. They used bank loans for other purposes; they  found it difficult to replenish their circulating funds. Such  overt and covert losses also caused losses in funds.    When we analyze the situation of enterprises on the basis of  these causes, we cannot help reexamining the old issue that our  enterprises must speed up the restructuring of their industrial  operations as well as their product mix. This is because  shortages of working funds caused by piling up of unsold goods  has been a longstanding problem, the solution of which lies in  studying market changes; in readjusting the product mix and  output according to market needs; and in carrying out projects  to curb production, reduce stockpiles, and promote sales. In  this sense, it is still strongly realistic for us to stress  every year, every month, and even every day that our enterprises  must work hard to achieve higher economic returns through  improving their management and operations. According to  personnel within financial circles, under the credit policy of  "giving preferential treatment to five types of business,  tightening funds for five other types of business, and never  lending money to eight types of operations," they will continue  to ensure that working funds and funds for upgrading technology  will be available for those profitable enterprises producing  marketable goods. We must use financial pressures to force  unprofitable enterprises to speed up dealing with their losses.    Deficits by state enterprises are a problem which has never  been effectively resolved, and it is obstructing normal economic  operations. The national economy as a whole cannot possibly be  revitalized unless the burdens created by growing deficits and  by increasingly larger numbers of unprofitable enterprises can  be cast off. Statistics show the deficits incurred by the  nation's industrial enterprises which conduct business  accounting independently totalled 44.157 billion yuan in 1992,  and the problem was even worse for industrial enterprises whose  accounting was part of the state budget. People certainly will  pay closer attention to this problem in 1994. The experiences  gained by some formerly deficit-ridden enterprises show that to  deal with this problem, enterprises must find their own ways to  gain market access through reform.    In terms of the principle for developing a socialist market  economy, the problem of unprofitable enterprises must be  resolved through competition in the market where poorly operated  businesses will be replaced by efficiently managed businesses,  and resources in society will be rationally distributed.  However, in real economic life many state enterprises are still  alive and insolvent enterprises still manage to function only  because they have local government protection and "blood  transfusions" from banks. This being the case, we must find a  way out for these enterprises, beginning with distributing  resources rationally through the market. Under the market  economic system, all enterprises must go through a test in which  the poorly operated businesses will be edged out by their  efficiently operated counterparts. Deficit-ridden enterprises  in particular must rely on themselves to upgrade their  technology, improve their management, and develop popular goods  which the market needs. Those enterprises unable to reverse  their deficit status will no longer have government protection,  and they should no longer be kept alive with "blood  transfusions" from the government or from banks.    While the magnitude of problems encountered by state  enterprises is unprecedented, the strategic role played by state  enterprises cannot be shaken owing to China's economic  realities. During the course of building a new, socialist  market economic system, the need to build a modern,  scientifically managed enterprise system -- which is in line  with requirements of the market economy, which clearly outlines  property rights and responsibilities, and which separates  enterprise operations from government control -- has been placed  on the agenda; enterprises must make new moves toward operating  themselves autonomously, assuming sole responsibility for  profits and losses, seeking development on their own, and  exercising self-restraint. Next year China will introduce a  series of measures governing reforms in planning, investment,  banking, financial operations, foreign trade, and social  security. These measures will create an environment favorable  for large and medium-sized state enterprises to improve their  operations. This will be a new starting point for state  enterprises to move toward a market economy. How to adapt  themselves to market mechanisms and generate profits and wealth  from various angles and at all levels will be a new challenge  for large and medium-sized state enterprise during 1994.</p>

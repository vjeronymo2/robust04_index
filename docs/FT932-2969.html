			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Murdoch expands into Asian broadcasting MR RUPERT Murdoch yesterday signalled his intention to become a significant force in Asian broadcasting with the announcement that his News Corporation is to pay HKDollars 1.85bn (Dollars 238.8m) for a 22 per cent interest in Television Broadcasts (TVB), one of Hong Kong's two domestic television companies and a leading producer of Chinese language movies. News Corporation will acquire 11 per cent of TVB from each of the company's two controlling shareholders - Sir Run Run Shaw and Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok. On completion of the deal, which needs Hong Kong government approval, Sir Run Run will have 23 per cent of TVB and Mr Kuok 21 per cent. Mr Murdoch said the three-way partnership in TVB 'will create the premier Asian company engaged in terrestrial and satellite television broadcasting'. Sir Run Run said the addition of News Corp's expertise in international programming and satellite broadcasting to TVB's record of success in Chinese language programming 'paves the way for the future growth and expansion of TVB'. Mr Murdoch, who sealed the deal on a visit to Hong Kong last week, has made no secret of his wish to participate in Asia's growing broadcasting industry, especially in China. Fox Television already sells US movies on the Chinese mainland and earlier this year Mr Murdoch visited Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders. He has expanded his print media interest in the region. Through the South China Morning Post he has acquired a Chinese language newspaper in Hong Kong and a 15 per cent interest in the Bangkok Post, Thailand's leading English-language daily. Underlining his ambition to publish on the Chinese mainland, he has registered the masthead North China Morning Post. Over the past year Mr Murdoch has had talks with Mr Li Ka-shing's Star Television about equity participation in the satellite network, but they proved fruitless. TVB recently entered into an agreement with Turner Broadcasting, Home Box Office, Entertainment Sports Programming Network, Australian Broadcasting Corp and Discovery Channel to lease satellite space on Palapa, an Indonesian-owned satellite. TVB said Mr Murdoch's role in the consortium had not been decided. TVB will supply Chinese language programming for one channel. Unlike Star, which currently broadcasts five 'free-to-air' satellite channels, the TVB consortium will transmit encoded programming for subscribers only. Analysts viewed Mr Murdoch's purchase of 22 per cent of TVB as only the beginning. Mr Murdoch is seen as the likely buyer of Sir Run Run's shareholding should he decide to reduce his holding further.</p>

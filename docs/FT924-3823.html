			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Reagan: a smile and a call to arms OXFORD students queued for hours yesterday to hear Mr Ronald Reagan, former US president and former actor, give his views on the world scene. It was hard to decide which of his former roles was more prominent on the day. His theme was that success in conquering the old enemy of communism must now be followed by success in conquering the host of smaller but no less deadly challenges facing younger generations. He singled out Bosnia and Somalia as current trouble spots that should be sorted out by the deployment of arms, preferably through a strengthened Nato force. 'Our multilateral organisations must declare ethnic cleansing and the slaughter of civilians by military forces unacceptable. And we must be prepared to put weapons behind our words,' he said. The speech was a cunning mix of political proposals and jokes. 'I am delighted to be with you today. At my age I'm delighted to be anywhere.' The former president is 81. Mr Reagan said his dream was for countries to unite 'to impose civilised standards of behaviour on those who flout every measure of human decency'. He condemned Serbia as a 'tinpot tyranny' and said the Serbs must be given an ultimatum to stop attacking civilians or face being bombed themselves. In Somalia, as US troops prepare to move in to safeguard the distribution of relief supplies, he said it was 'morally imperative' that the UN should intervene militarily. He called for a standing UN force - an army of conscience - that was fully equipped and prepared 'to carve out human sanctuaries' by force if needed. At the end, presented with an oar in Oxford's dark blue, Mr Reagan took his curtain call, beaming. It had been a good performance.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PATTY HEARST ENJOYS NEW ROLE AS ONE OF 'ODD PEOPLE' IN 'CRY-BABY'  </P> <P> When John Waters approached Patricia Hearst Shaw two years ago at the Cannes  Film Festival to be in his next movie, she thought it was a joke.  </P> <P> Then the script for "Cry-Baby" arrived in the mail.  </P> <P> "I thought, 'Oh, no, he was serious,' " said Hearst, who was recently in  Baltimore promoting the film, whose credits simply refer to her by her  well-known maiden name. In the film, she has a small part as a street-crossing  guard who is the wife of a school bus driver, played by David Nelson, and the  mother of a juvenile delinquent, played by former teen porno star Traci Lords.  </P> <P> "I knew he cast odd people," said Hearst, who lives in Westport, Conn., with  her husband, Bernard Shaw, an executive with the Hearst Corp., and two  daughters, Gillian and Lydia. "And I loved 'Hairspray.' So I read the script,  and I thought it was really funny, and I thought it would be a lot of fun to  do. It's not like being asked to be in 'Halloween.' I wouldn't even think about  that. But to be in one of John's movies, it was like, 'Wow, OK.'  </P> <P> "It was a chance to do something totally different that maybe would surprise  people. (It would be) something really silly, and I thought it would be neat."  </P> <P> Hearst describes her meeting with Waters after he sent her the script.  </P> <P> "I realized I was in big trouble because there were all these people, like the  casting director and the producers, on a sofa, and there's all these pictures  of actors and actresses scattered all over the floor," she said, "and I  thought, 'Uh-oh. This is like a casting call.'  </P> <P> "So we talk, and he says, 'You look too young. I don't know how we're going to  make you look older.' And I'm thinking, 'I saw "Little Big Man." I know what  they can do to make me look older.' So I say, 'Oh, well, thank you.'  </P> <P> "And then (Waters) says, 'Can you read for me?' And I go, 'Huh?' because I read  this thing like once. I just didn't think this was what I was going to be  doing. And so I do a horrible, horrible reading and walk out thinking, 'Well,  there's just no way.' And two days later, they call me and say I got the part."  </P> <P> Arriving on the set in Baltimore was strange at first.  </P> <P> "You could see (the other actors) looking like, 'Jeez, can you believe he hired  somebody who doesn't know anything about this?' They were worried because it's  their careers," she said.  </P> <P> Said Waters: "I think she probably had fun. It was like going to a different  world -- a safe, different world, a different world that ended her up in Vanity  Fair."  </P> <P> Did she think she would be exposing herself to a press that would be dredging  up her past again?  </P> <P> "I just don't know what could possibly be dredged up anymore that hasn't been,"  said the San Francisco newspaper family heiress. "There seems to be enough  other things to talk about. I don't know; I'm not that worried about it. I know  I'm tired of it. It's been 15 years, and I've moved on, and to me, it's just  old news."  </P> <P> The "old news" started in February, 1974, when the then-19-year-old student was  kidnaped from her Berkeley apartment by members of the Symbionese Liberation  Army, a revolutionary group that held her hostage. Two months later, she  announced in a taped message that she had repudiated her former life, joined  her captives in their political struggle and had taken the name Tania. She  later participated in a bank robbery and a shoot-out at a sporting goods store.  </P> <P> After going underground for 1 1/2 years, she was arrested, put on trial,  convicted of bank robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony  and sentenced to seven years in prison. In 1979, then-President Jimmy Carter  commuted her sentence after she had served 23 months in a federal prison.  </P> <P> "She had a bad lawyer (F. Lee Bailey)," said Waters, who attended her trial in  1976 as a fan of criminal trials. "He made her plead the Fifth Amendment, which  always makes you look guilty. Even I could have gotten her off."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan on Friday [27 May]  hailed the U.S. decision to extend China's most-favored-nation  (MFN) trade status as a favorable development to the  Asia-Pacific region.    "Japan welcomes the latest decision as it believes  U.S.-China  relations are very important to the Asia-Pacific region," Chief  Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference.    U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a major shift in his China  policy, announced Thursday he has decided to extend China's MFN  status despite continuing "serious human rights abuses" in China.    The top Japanese Goverment spokesman said Washington has  informed Tokyo in advance of its decision to extend China's MFN  status through diplomatic channels.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said at a separate news  conference that he welcomes the U.S. decision.    He said Japan will continues to press China to improve its  human rights record.</p>

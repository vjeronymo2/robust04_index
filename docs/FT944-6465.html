			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges give sterling the benefit of the doubt The pound traded steadily yesterday ahead of the important parliamentary vote last night on the EU Finance bill, and the UK Budget today, writes Philip Gawith. Markets appeared to take the view that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would weather his current difficulties. Sterling closed in London at DM2.4453, from DM2.4366 on Friday, and Dollars 1.5632 from Dollars 1.5631. Market activity was generally very subdued, with UK investors sidelined ahead of the Budget, and a preponderance of US data at the end of the week. One market theme was the reversal of last week's shift between bonds and equities. Yesterday equities were firmer, while interest rate markets lost ground. The longer dated contracts of Eurodollar interest rate futures shed 10 to 15 basis points. The dollar ended  1/2 pfennig firmer at DM1.5643, from DM1.5591, but easier at Y98.575 from Y98.765. In New York it closed at DM1.5665 and Y98.675. In Norway the krone firmed as opinion polls indicated a possible 'yes' vote in the referendum on EU membership. It finished at NKr4.36/DM, from NKr4.384 on Friday. The Italian lira benefited from talk of it possibly re-entering the European exchange rate mechanism, and closed at L1,031 per D-Mark from L1,038. In Israel, the shekel weakened against the dollar, but gained against other currencies when short-term interest rates rose by 1.5 percentage points to 16.3 per cent. The shekel closed the daily tender at Shk3.053 to the dollar, from Shk3.049. The basket of foreign currencies traded at Shk3.3965 per basket, from Shk3.3984 on Friday. Most of the movement in sterling occurred during Asian trading, but traders said it was significant that there had been no attempt to sell pounds during European trading. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, commented: 'Sterling/D-Mark recovered well, thanks to the perception that Major is going to win the vote. The market has taken the view that he will still be the prime minister at the end of this week.' He said that if politics were removed from the equation, sterling had the potential to improve another 2 to 3 pfennigs. Mr Cocker predicted that sterling would probably benefit today from a rally in gilts assuming, as widely predicted, that the Budget will reveal a sharp fall in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. Analysts said the reversal of fortune in equity and bond markets reflected a reappraisal of the likelihood of another US interest rate rise this year. Mr Cocker said that while underlying sentiment towards the dollar had clearly improved, he found it difficult to predict it moving much higher at the moment. 'The interbank market is sitting a little bit long of dollars, and there does not seem to be a desire on the part of external buyers to buy dollars.' He added that the dollar was likely to trade in a fairly narrow range ahead of the jobs report on Friday. 'In employment week, you rarely see the dollar do much in the first few days, unless other factors come into place.' In the longer term, many analysts are bullish about the dollar. Goldman Sachs concluded a recent review, saying: 'Current interest rate differentials are probably wide enough to support the dollar against the yen and D-Mark. And the dollar is likely gradually to appreciate further as Federal Reserve officials tighten monetary policy further over the next several months.' Goldman Sachs added: 'We continue to forecast a yen/Dollars exchange rate of Y103 and a DM/Dollars rate of DM1.57 on a six-month time horizon.' Mr Mike Rosenberg, manager of international fixed income research at Merrill Lynch, took a more cautious view. He argued that the Fed is still 'behind the curve' in combatting inflation, 'and as long as that remains the case, the dollar is still at risk of moving lower again'. He added, though, that the recent rise in US rates has bought the Fed some time. 'If the Fed uses that time wisely, and gets back on the curve, the dollar will eventually bottom and ultimately move higher; until then, it is too early to be talking about a fundamental turn in the dollar's value.' In its daily money market operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 250m shortage at established rates. Three-month LIBOR eased to 6 1/16 per cent from 6 1/8 per cent.</p>

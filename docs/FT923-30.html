			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (7): Products taking time to materialise - Steven Sonsino finds the debate over the viability of the pen computer market is continuing IMAGINE a nightnurse coming to the last patient on his rounds. He checks his notes for the correct prescription and dose, administers the drug and then signs a chit for the store keeper in the morning. This chit, however, is not a scrap of paper. It is a blank form held on disc on the nurse's notebook computer. He fills it in, by ticking boxes on the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, and then he signs it - all with a cordless electronic stylus. The system recognises the electronic signature, prompts the nurse to fill in all the necessary details and files the chit away in its memory. The system also recognises the way in which the nurse signs his name - how much pressure he uses on the screen and how fast he moves the stylus - as an additional security check. Back in the office, the off-duty nurse docks his notebook computer with the office PC, which automatically transmits the night's data to the stores computer over a mile away. This, in turn, updates the weekly purchase requisition forms, for the pharmaceuticals suppliers, as well as the patient records system, for the hospital consultants. Then it prepares the morning's rounds lists, for the day nurses. Much of the technology for achieving this high-tech healthcare exists today, including the hardware and software behind the pen computer system at its heart. The LCD screens are those used in laptops and portable PCs. The power supplies and hard disc memory drives - up to 120Mbyte in one pen computer system - are also the same. The only difference is the lack of the keyboard, which has lead to the machines being christened 'sans clavier' in France: systems without keyboards. This name is perhaps more appropriate than the US-inspired 'pen computers', as the tyranny of the keyboard is truly at an end, says Mr Carl Billson, general manager of Tangent Associates. 'The thing that distinguishes these machines from existing products is their ease of use,' he says. 'You've generally got a larger screen and you're not forcing people to enter data in a specific sequential order. It's intuitive.' Tangent, a software house and pen computer specialist, one of only a handful in the pen computing arena, has been working on techniques for collecting physical numerical data for four years, ever since it evolved as an industrial consultancy from the Loughborough University of Technology. But, like others in the data logging and collection sphere, Tangent sees its work with rugged Husky portables and with Psion Organisers as little more than history now. Its work on the Freestyle pen computing projects, the exploratory development of industrial pen computing, sponsored in part by the Department of Trade and Industry, points the way forward. 'The total budget for Freestyle 2 is Pounds 0.5m. About a third will come from the DTI and the rest from us and our business partners in industry, says Mr Billson.' Tangent's main target customers in industry include the public utilities and local authorities, whose engineers and auditors may need to update maps of street lighting and underground sewage channels, for instance. The company is currently presenting pen computing to a range of potential clients. But customers for the pen computer concept will also include business men and women, more familiar perhaps with the Filofax or the laptop computer, but hungry for the latest executive toy. In spite of much hype from vendors, it has taken time for products to materialise. The palm-sized GridPad-SL from Victor Technologies was for nine months virtually the only pen-based system on the market. Now there are more powerful 386-based machines available, Samsung's Pen Master 386L, for instance. Also available is a 640x200 screen system from Poqet, the Fujitsu subsidiary, and the low resolution EH10 from ATS in Manchester. This rugged industrial machine uses a 320x200 resolution touch screen from Hitachi. Another pen computer manufacturer in the north of England is Eden, which has licensed its 386-based VPi-386 machine to Trigem among others. The first 386-based pen system, however, was System 3125 from NCR, supporting 4Mbyte of RAM and a 20Mbyte hard disc. Reports from software developers which have signed non-disclosure agreements with manufacturers suggest that there are other developments on the way. Among developments worth watching are a 286-based system with digital voice recording from one US company and a Risc-based machine from EO Europe of Cambridge. IBM is also interested in the technology, so watch for offerings from that camp, too, and from Apple, whose Newton system is due to be launched in Spring 1993 at less than Dollars 1,000. What Apple envisages is computers from wristwatch to whiteboard-size, so it needs consumer electronics know-how to crack those markets. With this in mind, it becomes clear why Apple has licensed Newton technology to both Sharp Electronics and Toshiba. It has also approached other Japanese consumer electronics companies looking for buyers. Expect Sony to be on the shortlist, for its strengths in screen technology and Walkman marketing. With a band of hardware vendors of this calibre offering one-off systems prices ranging from Pounds 1,100 to Pounds 2,500 in the UK, buyers can soon expect power performance enhancements, increasing disc size and rapid improvements in screen technology. Colour screens and higher resolution should also become widely available. Software standards, too, will remain flexible for a while. Outside the Newton environment two contenders exist for a standard operating system: Microsoft's Windows for Pen Computing, with support from more than 120 software vendors including Borland and Corel, and PenPoint from GO Corporation. But the debate is not simple: IBM is working on a version of the OS/2 operating system for pen environ ments. So the pen market is going to be vendor-driven for some time and it is here that the biggest questions arise. Market research figures, for instance, and vendor estimates of sales vary enormously, but they tend to be high. One report suggests that 4m pen computers will have shipped by 1995. Compare this with GridPad's sales in 1991-92, which were estimated at around 40,000 units by Dream IT, a US market research firm. 'The whole pen market has been bedevilled by hype and over-hype,' says Mr Billson of Tangent. 'Excessive predictions were made on sales and these haven't borne fruit.' While Mr Billson attributes this in part to a lack of choice for developers and buyers, there are other issues, he says. 'Apple, for example, has announced Newton. They've announced release dates and so on, but who knows whether they're doing that to create an element of FUD - fear, uncertainty and doubt - in the market.' Fear in the market may restrain buyers and developers from committing heavily to other products, he says. Apple, however, stands by its position and the predictions for the market that Mr John Sculley made earlier this year. The market will be worth Dollars 3,000bnby the turn of the century, he said. 'This might seem a surprise,' says Mr Ajaz Ahmed for Apple UK, 'but the figures are based on Apple surveys which show that computers and communications products are going to merge. And the merger between them is going to be the Personal Digital Assistant, or Newton.' And the reasons Apple announced Newton in May of this year? 'Simply to help developers generate products for the environment and to reduce the volume of speculation about what we were doing,' he says. So the debate about the viability of the market will continue. What is clear, though, is that the technology for pen computing does exist. 'It's not vapour-ware,' says Apple's Mr Ahmed. The only hurdle, therefore, seems to be the application itself and whether sceptical buyers see a real use for these systems in the workplace. Don't write off the keyboard yet.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bankbench move on MPs' salaries A CROSS-PARTY alliance of senior backbenchers has proposed an amendment to the treatment of MPs' salaries which is likely to be accepted by the Commons in spite of the government's plan for a pay freeze. The proposal, which will be debated by MPs this afternoon, is that for pension purposes, MPs should be treated as if they had a 1.5 per cent pay increase from January instead of a freeze. That would depend on them making extra pension contributions to cover the cost of the higher pension to which they would then be entitled. Labour MPs also plan to use the debate to highlight the extent of outside business interests among Tory backbenchers.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Russian life 'tough but bearable': Living standards after two years of reforms A majority of Russians regard life as 'tough but bearable' after nearly two years of stop-go market reforms and months of economic crisis. That is the attitude of 58 per cent of the population, according to a survey published yesterday. But 28 per cent say they live in 'intolerable poverty', and only 1 per cent believe they are now 'very well off'. The All-Russian Centre for Public Opinion Research found that 9 per cent of 3,977 Russians polled were optimistic or rich enough to argue that 'things are not as bad as all that'. The polling was carried out across the country by the organisation which forecast last December's election victory of ultra-nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Asked to evaluate their material situation, 33 per cent of those polled said they were badly off, 7 per cent thought they were 'well off' and 51 per cent said their situation was 'average'. In recent years, Russian industry has suffered severe job losses, with factories closing or laying off workers. The population has also had to contend with continuing food shortages and rapidly rising prices. The survey coincided with attempts yesterday by Russian officials to persuade the International Monetary Fund that reform was still on course and the economy under control. An IMF delegation was in Moscow to clarify Russia's market reform plans since the shift in political direction after December's elections. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, who faces a credibility problem after pledging to fight inflation by non-monetary means, is believed to have warned officials they will be sacked if the IMF does not disburse a new loan of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn). Russian officials have told the IMF that the government will drive inflation down to 10 per cent a month by the end of this year, from about 20 per cent. They argued that Moscow was still committed to achieving financial stabilisation, despite the resignation of its most ardent proponents in the Russian government. The IMF has publicly expressed confidence that the Dollars 1.5bn, the second tranche of a facility to help countries switch from communism to capitalism, may be forthcoming. Privately, however, officials said yesterday they were concerned about granting new money when it was still unclear whether or not Russia would stick to its budget promise to control spending and inflation.

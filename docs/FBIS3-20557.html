The bureau not only helped work out the  election strategies, but also sent out its staff to directly  supervise and help [the Kuomintang] candidates in election.  According to information from a staff member of the Bureau of  Investigation, Hsiao Tien-tsan who was a National Policy Advisor  to the President once asked the Bureau of Investigation to  dispatch a deputy department chief named Chang to help him in  Chiayi County run for the legislature.    During the Yuen Ch'eng-chang era, the Bureau of  Investigation was also involved in elections, since Yuan used to  work for the Garrison Headquarters. Meanwhile, in order to  strengthen its ties with the Kuomintang Headquarters, the bureau  led by Yuen Ch'eng-chang started to print the "Daily Situation  News" which was dispatched to party and government leaders  everyday by the bureau's code office. When Weng Wen-wei was in  charge of the bureau, he also followed Yuen's practice. Some  changes took place only after Wu Tung-ming took over the bureau.    During the early days when Wu took over the bureau,  there were not many changes as compared with his several  predecessors. Wu only followed what Weng Wen-wei did by not  sending people out to keep an eye on election campaigns and help  candidates win the election. However, his appraisal of the  situation in the election had become more accurate in each  passing day because of his rich experiences in the past. During  the election campaign for the Second National Assembly, the  appraisal of the situation in election made by the Bureau of  Investigation was praised by Li Teng-hui.    As for the appraisal of the situation and the collection  of information on elections, Chen Chung-hsin, head of the Bureau  of Investigation's First Department, pointed out that the Bureau  of Investigation "no longer made any election appraisal since  the founding of the Second National Assembly." However,  Legislator Ts'ai Shih-yuan said that "Wu Tung-ming's words were  good up to the election of the Second Legislature." It is  understood that whenever an election took place in the past, a  joint office was set up for the bureau's First Department which  was responsible for the collection of information, its Third  Department which was responsible for political intelligence and  its Fifth Department which was responsible for working out plans  to take actions to form a command post for the election. This  practice ended prior to the election of the Second Legislature.  No such joint office was set up during this year's election of  county magistrates and mayors.    Nevertheless, Chang Chi-ping, head of the bureau's  P'ingtung Station was drawn into the cloud of suspicion for  helping candidates to win the election this year.    Usually the Bureau of Investigation very seldom  investigates and handles cases except devoting itself in  gathering information on elections. However, the bureau's  Pingtung Station interviewed and searched Chu Heng-wei, head of  the Department of Urban Planning of the Pingtung County  Government seven days prior to the election day this year,  turning its interference during the last week of the election  into a major event which affected the ballot.</p>

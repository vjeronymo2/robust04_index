There was no such  meeting, and the government does not expect any break in  relations, the minister told the Caracol network in reference to  a report published by the newspaper EL TIEMPO.    President Cesar Gaviria de-emphasized the issue and said  there is no evidence of a guerrilla summit in Havana.    Minister Villegas also commented on the implementation of  security operations during the elections, saying that they are  going smoothly without major problems despite certain incidents.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Nigeria reduces petrol prices Nigeria's military government has reduced last week's increase in the petrol price from N5 to N3.25 a litre in a deal with labour unions which ends the week-long general strike, reports Paul Adams in Lagos. After meeting senior government officials, the Nigeria Labour Congress said it recognised the need for some increase in fuel prices but argued that N5 per litre was too high. The unions will continue to negotiate for transport allowances to offset the big rise in fares by transporters since fuel prices went up.</p>

Like Christian Democrats; Unless  League Wins, It Is Finished'; Maroni and Future of Pole of  Freedoms" first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Milan -- The official watchword is: victory for the  pole of freedoms; we will govern with [Forza Italia leader]  Silvio Berlusconi. Then there is the issue of what will happen  to the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] and the Center Union,  regarded as mere slaves, and the problem of the National  Alliance, rejected by Umberto Bossi [Northern League Secretary]  and Roberto Maroni [League lower house floor leader], but  desired by Berlusconi, who sees Gianfranco Fini [Italian Social  Movement (MSI) and National Alliance (AN) leader] as the  antidote to the federalist toxins of the League. According to  Bossi, if the pole does win, Maroni must be prime minister.  Maroni himself commented: "This will be decided by the voters  in the proportional quota, but note that the League believes  that the vote in the north deserves some consideration." As far  as Berlusconi is concerned, it is a simple matter: He will be  prime minister.    So, leaving aside official stances, it is no coincidence  that  some people within the League are hoping for a defeat for the  pole for freedoms, which would hit Berlusconi hard (he has  staked everything on the premiership) and boost the League as  the country's only opposition force, confining the Democratic  Alliance to a subordinate role. When Bossi said, "We will  perform the role performed by the PCI [Italian Communist Party]  and later the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] in previous  parliaments," he was issuing a strong political indication of  the League in opposition to a government composed of left-wing  forces, but performing a role of stimulus and supervision. To  do what the PCI or the PDS has done means, despite being in  opposition, claiming the speakership of the lower house, the  chairmanship of prestigious parliamentary committees -- in other  words, establishing its status as the only real opposition force.    [Passalacqua] Mr. Maroni, what will happen if the left-wing  forces win?    [Maroni] Achille Occhetto [PDS Secretary] will have an  absolute majority, throw out [Communist Renewal leader] Fausto  Bertinotti, bring in Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian  Popular Party, PPI] and Bindi [PPI Venice regional secretary],  and we will be in opposition.    [Passalacqua] What will Berlusconi do?    [Maroni] He will not have the strength to resist; he cannot  be in opposition; he is convinced that you can change things  only if you are in power. He does not have our background; he  does not have the background that Bossi has, having stayed in  the Senate alone, undaunted.    [Passalacqua] What will happen to the pole of freedoms?    [Maroni] It will be destroyed, it will disintegrate. Each  will go his own way. But the blueprint remains.    [Passalacqua] What does that mean: that you will inherit  Forza Italia?    [Maroni] The pole must be granted credible prospects. If  that does happen, we will have a parliament that will last at  least two years. Then it will be necessary to form a liberal  democratic party under the banners of federalism and liberalism.  A party that will stand united and compact in the next  elections. Call it what you like, but it will be a united party.    [Passalacqua] Will it be called the Northern League?    [Maroni] If you want a clever remark, it will be called the  liberal democratic party, section of the Northern League.    [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi?    [Maroni] The only path open to Berlusconi is to accede to  government. But this is not the only path open to Bossi and,  with him, Bertinotti and Fini: They are people who have engaged  in opposition and who can do so again.    [Passalacqua] Are you saying that unless Forza Italia scores  an overwhelming victory it will not last long?    [Maroni] Forza Italia is like the DC [Christian Democratic  Party]: It can only exist if it can distribute power as it  wants, if it can rationalize power. Not so, with us.    [Passalacqua] Let us consider another hypothesis -- a  victory  by the pole of freedoms. What will happen to the National  Alliance? Will it be in or out?    [Maroni] Officially, it will be out.    [Passalacqua] Please clarify that.    [Maroni] It is a mess. Is there a possibility that the  pole will win and gain an absolute majority without the National  Alliance? In that case, the people will decide who will be  prime minister.    [Passalacqua] What if the National Alliance were to prove  decisive to forming a majority?    [Maroni] It will still be possible to govern, using the  votes  of the National Alliance's elected representatives that are not  declared MSI members. A clear sign from Berlusconi on the  subject of federalism will be enough. If the first item on the  government's agenda is a constitutional reform to open the way  to federalism, then we are willing to implement it even with  Fini.    [Passalacqua] What if, as it is likely, nobody gains an  absolutely majority?    [Maroni] The hypothesis is that there will be another  election; a government will be formed for six months. The  political program will be a new electoral law -- a plain  single-candidate system and the direct election of the prime  minister.    [Passalacqua] This may be the hypothesis, but what do you  think?    [Maroni] I am working to ensure that the League accedes to  government.    [Passalacqua] What if you were able to choose?    [Maroni] Again, not entirely seriously: My favorite scenario  is that nobody will win, because it would be fun for me. But  what I hope for is that the League, together with Forza Italia,  will gain an absolute majority.    [Passalacqua] If that happens, you will be put forward for  the premiership...    [Maroni] Do you want to know who will be in my team? If I  were prime minister, which is not what I want, I would appoint  Marco Formentini super-minister for the economy, Vito Gnutti  industry minister, Francesco Tabladini environment minister,  Forza Italia's Antonio Martino finance minister, and Gianfranco  Pagliarini budget minister. What about foreign affairs? Marco  Pannella. Defense? Franco Angioni. Justice? I would have to  think about that, but Mino Martinazzoli is not to be discounted.  Interior Affairs? For a year it would be delegated to the prime  minister's office, during which time all the secret services  would undergo a thorough cleansing.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other populations throughout the species' range are still in danger of extinction, to varying degrees, by taking. Penalties for illegal exports and enforcement activities will help ensure that illegal skins or products do not enter into commercial trade. Because crocodiles of the Australian population cannot be distinguished from saltwater crocodiles of other populations and from other endangered crocodilians once made into manufactured products, the Service is proposing a special rule to strengthen the implementation of the CITES skin-tagging program (see description presented later in this notice).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed reclassification to a threatened status and adoption of a special rule allowing commercial trade under certain conditions would not end trade controls for the species. The species remains on Appendix II of CITES with export permits required, and the special rule would require adherence to the CITES marking scheme for crocodilian skins, among other things discussed later in this document when provisions of the special rule are described. Trade in legally harvested saltwater crocodile skins, meat, and products, when controlled as specified in the special rule, will provide an incentive for conserving the species without posing significant risks to wild populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E. Summary of Criteria To List the Papua New Guinea Populations as Threatened by Similarity of Appearance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Papua New Guinea population of the saltwater crocodile is not listed at present under the ESA. In determining whether to treat a species as endangered or threatened due to similarity of appearance, the Director must consider the criteria in section 4(e) of the ESA. Section 4(e) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1534(e)) and 50 CFR 17.50(b) set forth three criteria in determining whether to list a species for reasons of similarity of appearance. These factors and their applicability to populations of the saltwater crocodile in Papua New Guinea are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The degree of difficulty enforcement personnel would have in distinguishing the species, at the point in question, from an endangered or threatened species (including those cases where the criteria for recognition of a species are based on geographical boundaries).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The different populations of saltwater crocodile are morphologically indistinguishable. It is impossible to distinguish the different geographical populations as live animals, skins or finished products. Thus, Papua New Guinea saltwater crocodiles, their parts and products cannot be distinguished as to origin by law enforcement personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The additional threat posed to the endangered or threatened species by loss of control occasioned by similarity of appearance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary threat to other saltwater crocodile populations is the difficulty of identifying skins and products by geographic region as discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The probability that so designating a similar species will substantially facilitate enforcement and further the purposes and policy of the ESA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The populations of saltwater crocodiles in Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea are listed on CITES Appendix II and are traded in international commerce. The Indonesian population, although listed as endangered by the United States, is traded among other CITES parties subject to a CITES export quota. International protection has not resulted in complete cessation of illegal trade in other populations. Only specimens and parts and products from Papua New Guinea (and under this proposal, from Australia) may be imported into the United States. Designation of the Papua New Guinea population as threatened by similarity of appearance will help the United States to control illegal trade of other protected saltwater crocodile populations. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing crocodiles from the Papua New Guinea population from other populations of saltwater crocodiles and from other endangered crocodilians once made into manufactured products, the Service is proposing rules to strengthen the implementation of the new CITES skin tagging program (see description presented later in this notice).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Special Rule for Nile and Saltwater Crocodiles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A.

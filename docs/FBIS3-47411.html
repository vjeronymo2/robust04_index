			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang is unlikely to  agree to resume talks with Tokyo on normalizing diplomatic  relations because the North Korean leadership has a bad  impression of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet, the  YOMIURI SHIMBUN said Wednesday.    The daily quoted informed sources as saying that Pyongyang  sees the Japan Renewal Party (JRP), the main force in Hosokawa's  coalition government, as a lackey of the United States.    Further sullying Pyongyang's impression of the Japanese  leadership was the failure of the Social Democratic Party (SDP),  which had been friendly with North Korea, to form a coalition  with the JRP.    YOMIURI quoted the sources as speculating that this is the  reason Chochongnyon (Federation of pro-Pyongyang Korean  Residents in Japan) did not attend the SDP national convention  on Tuesday.    Negotiations between North Korea and Japan, suspended in  Nov.  1992, and exchanges between parties of the two nations were thus  unlikely to resume in the near future, the article said.    It quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying that it was  an unexpected situation because the JRP and SDP had close  relations with Pyongyang.    The two parties paved the way for the Pyongyang-Tokyo talks  on normalization of ties after Shin Kanemaru, vice chairman of  the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), visited  Pyongyang in the autumn of 1990.    YOMIURI said that its sources were two SDP and JRP officials  who had met with senior North Korean officials in charge of  diplomacy since the Supreme People's Assembly renewed the North  Korean leadership last month.    They said that the North Korean leadership considers  relations with Japan "below zero," compared to inter-Korean  talks or to its negotiations with Washington.    They quoted a Pyongyang official as saying that the Hosokawa  government was worse than its LDP predecessor and the SDP cannot  be considered friendly to the Workers' (Communist) Party.    This official called JRP Chairman Ichiro Ozawa a puppet of  the United States, which he said dresses in the clothes of the  United Nations, the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Paying the price of a loss of focus: TI's Pounds 482m bid for a UK aero-engineer Since Mr Christopher Lewinton took charge of TI Group six years ago, he has briskly reshaped one of the pillars of British engineering. Now Mr Lewinton, TI's chairman and chief executive, is hoping to repeat the trick, with a hostile Pounds 482m bid for the Dowty Group, another British engineering group which has known better times. Dowty rejected the bid yesterday, as it rejected Mr Lewinton's three offers of a friendly merger last year. But staying independent will not be easy. The late Sir George Dowty founded the company in Cheltenham in 1931 in frustration at the British government's failure to recognise home-grown innovation. He had invented a suspension system for landing gear but neither the Royal Air Force nor his employer, the Gloster aircraft company, believed it would work. Only after Kawasaki of Japan bought the idea did a red-faced RAF begin using the system. Dowty parts flew in every RAF aeroplane in the Second World War. The impetus for the company's growth, however, came from an application of the same technology: hydraulic pit props. Aviation was still close to the company's heart: in 1958 it bought the propeller business of Bristol Aircraft and Rolls-Royce, and built a successful aerospace business. In recent years, however, it has lost its way. Last December, it announced that interim profits had collapsed from Pounds 38m to Pounds 10m and that its earnings would not cover the dividend. The news confirmed the damage caused to the company by recession in the aerospace industry. It also underlined the weaknesses of Dowty's attempted diversification into information technology and electronic systems. Dowty began looking vulnerable to takeover. In the event, the bid has come from TI. Yesterday, Mr Lewinton argued that the two companies fitted well together. TI already has a substantial aviation business, making engine rings. If the bid goes through, the Dowty name would live on within TI as part of a strengthened UK aerospace industry, he said. 'Dowty is a lovely name - probably better than TI.' Dowty's diversification had sapped management time and short-changed shareholders, he said. 'We are taking a company back to its core origins and away from diversification.' TI would dispose of the information technology division, which has turnover of Pounds 180m and which Dowty already says it is trying to sell. It would also get out of most of the electronics systems business, which control engines for aircraft and missile systems. In total, businesses with total revenues of about Pounds 300m would probably be sold. This is the sort of restructuring Mr Lewinton has overseen at TI. He sold the group's Raleigh bicycles subsidiary and its household goods division soon after taking over in 1986, and focused the business more on tubing, from which its original name, Tube Investments, had stemmed. TI's market capitalisation (less new shares from rights issues) has grown from Pounds 330m in 1986 to Pounds 1.1bn; Dowty's has fallen from Pounds 479m to about Pounds 340m over the same period. For TI, says Mr Lewinton, a Dowty acquisition would be more of the same: in effect, two 'bolt-on' acquisitions and a divestment programme. 'I always thought that if we could have a group with an aerospace, an industrial and an auto arm then we were going to win,' he says. Combining the aerospace divisions would create a business under the Dowty name with sales of Pounds 400m, four times TI's current level of aviation revenues. There would be big head office savings at TI's headquarters at Abingdon or at Dowty's in Cheltenham. Dowty's polymer business, which has sales of Pounds 100m, would be brought together with TI's John Crane International, which makes mechanical and gas seals. The linked businesses would have sales of Pounds 400m. TI's third leg would remain the Bundy tubes operation in the US, which has sales of a little less than Pounds 400m and which is now the group's strongest business. A successful takeover would leave TI diversified away from the UK in the way that Mr Lewinton, who has dual British and US nationality, quickly sought after taking the helm. After disposals, North America would account for about 40 per cent of sales, just above the current level, and the UK would shrink to 20 per cent. TI says the deal would have a broadly neutral impact on earnings in 1993, the first full year after the acquisition. It would dilute earnings this year, the company says, but not by enough to hinder dividend growth. Mr Bruce Ralph, Dowty's chief executive, gave an immediate, 'emphatic' rejection of TI's overtures. Stockbrokers' analysts however, compared Dowty's position to that of Hawker Siddeley, caught out by a bid from BTR last year. Trapped at the bottom of the cycle in two industries heavily hit by recession, Dowty's plans for rationalisation risk being seen as too little too late. For watchers of the aerospace industry, now undergoing the most severe conditions in 40 years, TI's bid was not surprising. The industry has already consolidated, and may have further to go. Worldwide, there are only three main airframe makers: Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus. There are three aero-engine makers: Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric of the US; and Rolls-Royce. In avionics, there are four big competitors: Honeywell and Rockwell Collins in the US; Smiths Industries in the UK; and Sextant of France. But two of these, Rockwell and Smiths, are in talks about close industrial co-operation. Such concentration was likely to spread through the industry to the component makers. As one analyst said yesterday: 'TI brings more to Dowty than BTR brought to Hawker Siddeley - TI is actually buying something that makes strategic sense.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DOWTY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Founded 1931 by the late Sir George Dowty. 1958 acquired propeller business from Rolls-Royce and Bristol Aircraft. 1987 created information technology division making modems and VDU terminals. 1991 lost crucial contracts with Fokker and Boeing for landing gear.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TI  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Formed 1919 from amalgamation of two tube manufacturers. By 1939 it was the largest maker of precision steel tube in the world. 1967 turned to consumer goods after nationalisation of steel interests. 1986 sold Russell Hobbs; 1987 sold Raleigh and other cycle interests; 1988 acquired Bundy Corp, the US tube manufacturer.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: FT analysis, Datastream  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

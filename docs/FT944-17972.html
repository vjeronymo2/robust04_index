			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (18): Eximbank asserts US drive for exports - Exports and aid / The wiles of Wall Street are being applied in the fight for emerging markets The chairman of the US Export-Import bank, Mr Kenneth Brody, is taking increasingly assertive steps to win export markets for the US. In particular, the former investment banker is attempting to counter other governments' practice of tying aid to export contracts with developing countries. Using a Dollars 150m 'war chest' - the Tied Aid Capital Projects Fund, which with leverage can raise up to Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m - Eximbank is attempting to head off other countries' offers with its own, matching promises of tied aid. 'I believe American jobs are created by American exports,' said Mr Brody. 'The way to get there (to an elimination of tied aid) to is to show the other countries that their tied aid offers won't get them any benefit.' The programme has infuriated US rivals who are accustomed to a US government operating above the commercial fray. For years, Republican administrations preached to their industrialised competitors the joys of unsubsidised financing. This resulted in 1992 in an agreement by countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to reduce the use of tied aid. The pact established a notification process requiring governments to inform the OECD 30 days before making tied aid offers. During that period other governments can challenge the proposed offer as ineligible under the OECD pact. Rules prohibit tied aid to upper income and upper middle income developing countries which are ineligible for World Bank loans of 17 and 20 years. This excludes Brazil, Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan and Venezuela. The rules eliminate some commercially viable projects, which could attract standard commercial loans because they can quickly generate sufficient revenues to service the debt, and they create tied aid 'free zones' in Mexico, central and eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, five other former Soviet republics, and the Baltic. The pact has slowed but not ended the practice, however. Last year, tied aid funding fell to Dollars 6.9bn from Dollars 15.5bn in 1992. But US officials, noting an increase of tied aid offers in the first four months of this year, fear it may be rebounding. Until April, Eximbank only acted if the US believed its rivals violated the rules of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Under its new policy, it matches offers even if no rules are broken. Since then the bank's board has approved nine tied aid offers and turned down one out of concern about its military aspects. In its half yearly report to Congress it claimed success in deflecting foreign tied aid offers for many commercial projects, including manufacturing facilities, power plants, power transmission lines and equipment, hydropower plants, and telephone equipment. Eximbank insists it offers tied aid financing only after foreign offers have been relayed to the OECD and have cleared multilateral consultation procedures. The bank's plan is to reserve most US tied aid to challenge foreign offers which would lock in a long-term commercial advantage for competitors to US companies and for deals which would allow US companies to exploit early market penetration opportunities. When foreign tied aid offers are on the table conditionally or informally, but the OECD has not been notified, the US will issue a Tied Aid Letter of Interest, promising to match the competitor's terms. The letter can be converted into a tied aid preliminary commitment when a foreign offer is passes through the OECD procedures. On occasions it has received advance word that competitors are planning to offer tied aid and rushed in with a 'no aid common line.' Where this is rejected, Eximbank indicates to US companies that it would look with favour on a request for a matching offer. It will also contact the rival government to indicate its plans to match. The level of concessionality and the risk involved in a tied aid offer discourages Eximbank bidding. 'Our board would not want to match pure grants,' an official says. 'We're not in the business of totally giving things away.' Under Mr Brody's leadership, which has brought the chutzpah and wiles of Wall Street to Exim Bank, its total lending, guarantees and insurance could reach Dollars 15bn for the second year in a row. He has re-organised the bank for its role as a key player in a US export drive, pushed project finance to new heights, boosted US firms in the 'emerging markets' and promoted foreign sales of US environmental products.</p>

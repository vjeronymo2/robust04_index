			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Renault and Volvo move to end their cross-shareholdings France's Renault and Volvo of Sweden are negotiating to dismantle their cross-shareholdings in the wake of the collapse last year of plans to merge their car activities. French officials said it was necessary for state-owned Renault to 'regain its freedom of action', although they declined to confirm reports that the cross-shareholdings would be unwound as part of the privatisation of Renault, scheduled for the second half of this year. Volvo is also understood to be anxious to dismantle the cross-shareholdings, established in 1990, to give it freedom to seek long-term co-operation with other motor manufacturers, which it needs to help it bear the high cost of model development. Under the terms of the 1990 alliance, Renault retains 25 per cent of Volvo's car activities and 45 per cent of the Swedish group's truck operations. Volvo holds 20 per cent of Renault group and 45 per cent of RVI, the company's truck and buses operation. The agreement, designed as a precursor to a full merger, prevents both from forming alliances with other vehicle groups. Negotiations on unwinding the alliance have accelerated since a new board took office at Volvo last month following the resignation of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, former chairman and architect of the Renault deal. Renault and Volvo have already dismantled several industrial projects and ended joint purchasing and design operations. Earlier this month, Renault sold more than half of its 8.3 per cent stake in AB Volvo, the Swedish group's parent company. Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said in a radio interview yesterday that the separation was progressing smoothly. He compared it to a divorce between 'two well brought up people. Both are withdrawing, calmly, politely and systematically.' Volvo is likely to reduce its shares in Renault at the time of the French group's privatisation, and may further cut its stake following the sale. Renault would gradually reduce its shares in AB Volvo on the stock market. But both the French and Swedish sides said a divorce had not been worked out and it was not clear how long the process would take. Volvo is anxious to achieve full value for its Renault investment and is concerned not to rush an agreement. Lex, Page 20</p>

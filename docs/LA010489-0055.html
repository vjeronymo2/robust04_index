			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CS FULLERTON LOSES TO NEW MEXICO STATE, 65-60  </P> <P> When Cal State Fullerton's Mark Hill hit a 3-point shot that cut New Mexico  State's lead to 59-55 with 1:46 remaining Tuesday night, the situation looked  good for Fullerton.  </P> <P> But there was a problem. The Titans, who had come from 13 points behind, had  committed only 4 team fouls.  </P> <P> Before Fullerton sent New Mexico State to the free-throw line, 53 seconds  passed. The Aggies then made 6 of 6 shots from the line in the final minute,  scoring a 65-60 victory before 1,603 fans at Titan Gym in the the Big West  Conference opener for both teams.  </P> <P> The foul situation presented a dilemma for Fullerton:  </P> <P> The Titans could try for a steal, all the while letting time run off the clock.  </P> <P> Or they could foul quickly to reach 7 team fouls, putting New Mexico State  closer to the bonus, when it would have to go to the line. But with every foul,  the Aggies got a new 45 seconds on the shot clock.  </P> <P> "We got caught in a catch-22," Coach John Sneed said.  </P> <P> In the end, Fullerton (5-5) rode the fence, trying for a steal for the first  few passes and then fouling.  </P> <P> The Titans had no luck either way. The Aggies protected the ball and hit their  free throws, including 4 straight by Jimmy Taylor.  </P> <P> The loss overshadowed a career-high 26-point performance by Hill, who tied a  school record by making 6 3-pointers.  </P> <P> Hill made 8 of 12 shots, including 6 of 9 from 3-point range. He also made 4 of  6 free throws as he led the Titans in scoring for the second game in a row.  </P> <P> Cedric Ceballos, who averaged 25 points in his first 7 games, finished with 12.  He scored 2 and 16 points in his previous 2 games.  </P> <P> Center John Sykes, returning after a 1-game suspension for unspecified reasons,  scored 14 points, making all 6 field-goal attempts.  </P> <P> The victory was the third in a row for New Mexico State, which is 8-3.  </P> <P> Willie Joseph led the Aggies with 20 points, and Johnny Roberson added 15.  </P> <P> "We had lost 3 and they still came back to play tough tonight," Sneed said.  "That's a good sign."  </P> <P> Fullerton took a 7-4 lead on a 3-pointer by Mark Hill, but the Aggies went on a  13-0 run to go ahead, 17-7, and led, 34-26 at halftime.  </P> <P> A 3-pointer by Taylor and a short jumper by Joseph at the start of the second  half gave New Mexico State its biggest lead, 39-26.

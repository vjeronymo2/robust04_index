			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Lord King likely to step down at BA A LONG-EXPECTED top management transition at British Airways will be announced tomorrow at the airline's annual general meeting when Lord King, BA's 75-year-old chairman, is likely to indicate his intention to step down. But Lord King, who was brought in by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, 12 years ago to reshape the airline and privatise it, is expected to maintain close connections with the BA by becoming its honorary chairman for life. Lord King is expected to indicate at the annual meeting his intention to relinquish his post as chairman this year or next. In spite of his appointment as honorary life chairman or president, the move will mark an end of a significant era in the history of the UK flag-carrier. Under Lord King, BA was transformed from a loss-making state-owned carrier popularly known as 'Bloody Awful' into one of the world's most profitable and successful private airlines. BA recently reported a 120 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 285m for the financial year ending March, bucking the trend in the airline industry, which has seen many leading carriers reporting heavy financial losses because of the recession and the air travel slump caused by last year's Gulf war. The airline is currently negotiating an alliance with USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier, as part of its efforts to strengthen its global presence and competitiveness. Lord King recently said his airline was interested in forging alliances with carriers in the US, Europe and Asia. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, is widely expected to take over as chairman. Lord King recently indicated BA was not looking outside the company for his successor. Sir Colin has also been deeply involved in the restructuring of BA. Many in the industry believe that one reason for BA's success is the strong management team led by Lord King and Sir Colin. However, Lord King's departure as chairman is likely to lead to other changes at the top of the company. Apart from the appointment of a chairman, BA is likely to appoint a chief operating officer to flank the chairman and chief executive. One candidate is Mr Robert Ayling, the company's former secretary and legal adviser who recently made his mark as head of marketing and operations.</p>

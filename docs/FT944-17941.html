			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Brussels aims to reduce set-aside land The amount of land European Union farmers are obliged to take out of production would be reduced from 15 to 13 per cent, under a proposal approved yesterday by the European Commission. The decision has to be ratified by member states, but the big farm lobby, with France as its champion, had been pushing for at least such a reduction in fallow land. The decision will be welcomed by farmers across the Union, who regard the obligation to 'set aside' land as iniquitous, and whose organisations had forecast that up to a third of European farmland would be left idle. The move is confirmation that the 1992 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is biting. That reform was meant to cut subsidised overproduction through price reductions of up to 30 per cent over three years, and mandatory 'set-aside' of land. The reform envisaged that the amount of land to be laid fallow would go up or down, depending on whether output was near target. The 1994-95 marketing year, the second year of the reform, has seen EU cereals output drop significantly to around 162m tonnes, an increase in set-aside from 4.5m hectares to 5.9m hectares, and a drop in grain stockpiles from 33m to 14m tonnes. 'The combination of CAP reform and a strong world market has resulted in cereals' prices being higher than those foreseen or desired,' said Mr Rene Steichen, EU farm commissioner. Reflecting the sensitivity of the issue, he added: 'It would be totally unacceptable to producers if EU policymakers were to insist on a level of set-aside beyond that which is strictly necessary.' A combination of reform and drought has led to grain shortages in the European Union market and a strong world market price. Thus, the CAP is well in line with the reform's planned output cuts, but perilously above forecast price levels. The latter has important implications for the EU's ability to meet commitments to cut subsidised exports under the Uruguay Round world trade agreement, due to come into force in the farm sector next summer. With EU grain prices now about 25 per cent above world levels, the Union is still paying out the export subsidies which the Uruguay Round will gradually cut back. But the set-aside reduction would boost grains output by about 4m tonnes, weakening prices and the cost of inputs for livestock and poultry.</p>

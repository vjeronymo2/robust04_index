			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Slaughters tops takeover league SLAUGHTER AND MAY has emerged as the leading legal adviser to those involved in public takeovers in the first six months of 1993. The City firm of solicitors advised companies or financial advisers in seven deals worth Pounds 654m, says Acquisitions Monthly magazine, which has ranked firms of lawyers by the value of the takeovers in which they acted as advisers. The biggest contribution to Slaughter and May's total came from Airtours' failed Pounds 283m bid for Owners Abroad. The firm acted for Barclays de Zoete Wedd, financial advisers to the bidders. The bid dominated the first half of 1993 and had a disproportionate effect on rankings, the magazine says. Herbert Smith, which acted for Owners Abroad, rose from sixth overall in 1992 to second on the strength of its involvement. Linklaters &amp; Paines, which ranked fourth, acted for Airtours. The magazine has also produced a league table of legal advisers involved in private takeovers. Slaughter and May emerged as the leading legal adviser in private deals, ranked first for its involvement in 20 deals worth a total of Pounds 1.7bn. The biggest contribution to its total came from its role as adviser to Mercury Communications in the sale of 20 per cent of its shares to BCE of Canada for Pounds 480m. Clifford Chance, the UK's largest law firm, which finished 11th in the public deals table, was placed second for its involvement in 20 private deals worth Pounds 1.27bn. As well as acting for NewCo on the Pounds 402m buy-out of Gardner Merchant, Clifford Chance was involved in the Pounds 345m sale of Del Monte Foods International to Royal Foods of the UK and South Africa's Anglo American Corporation. One of the noticeable features of the private deals table is the presence in the top 15 of two large regional law firms. The magazine says that the presence of Leeds-based Dibb Lupton Broomhead in sixth place and Manchester's Addleshaw Sons &amp; Latham in 13th shows that regional firms are posing a threat to the traditional dominance of mergers and acquisitions work by the large City law firms.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEGAL ADVISERS TO FINANCIAL ADVISERS OR COMPANIES INVOLVED IN UK PUBLIC TAKEOVERS JAN-JUNE 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Law firm                       No. of deals      Value (Pds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1   Slaughter and May                    7                654  2   Herbert Smith                        8                492  3   Freshfields                          7                435  4   Linklaters &amp; Paines                  6                398  5   Ashurst Morris Crisp                 9                320  6   Nabarro Nathanson                    4                269  7   Norton Rose                          5                266  8   Allen &amp; Overy                        6                202  9   Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn                2                129 10   Simmons &amp; Simmons                    2                117  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ranked by value of transactions based on completed and failed offers for UK public companies and including only those advisers involved in two or more transactions.

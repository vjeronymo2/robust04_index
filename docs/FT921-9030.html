			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television The BBC continues its coverage of the Winter Olympics. Four titles are due to be decided today: women's 1000m speed skating, team ski-jumping (what wonderful mental pictures), luge doubles (two up, or perhaps down, on a toboggan), and women's biathlon relay. There is also the first chance to see the French ice dance couple, Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay, in whom the British are being encouraged to take an interest since they are trained by our very own Christopher Dean, who is also married to Isabelle. There is, of course, desperately little British interest in these games. But there is 100 minutes coverage on BBC2 at 6.00 and 50 minutes on BBC1 at 11.55. ITV brings back Surgical Spirit with Nichola McAuliffe again playing the bossy but oh so feminine surgeon, a character which I find about as believable as all those macho child-minding men which wishful feminist writers keep inventing (8.00). The third anniversary of the death sentence on Salman Rushdie is taken by Arena as an occasion to consider the value of freedom of expression (9.30 BBC2). What a pity the book at the centre of this controversy is so indefensibly turgid.</p>

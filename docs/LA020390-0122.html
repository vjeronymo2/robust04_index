			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PICTURE IT: SOVIET TV NEWS TO AIR IN ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: VIEWERS WILL GET TO SEE HOW FREE GLASNOST REALLY IS. COUNTY'S PBS  STATION WILL SHOW THE GOVERNMENT-PRODUCED PROGRAMS BEGINNING FEB. 12.  </P> <P> The Soviets, or at least their television news broadcasts, are coming to Orange  County.  </P> <P> KOCE Channel 50, the county's Public Broadcasting Station, announced Friday  that it will air "Vremya," the Soviet Union's official, government-produced  nightly newscast, weeknights at 11:30 beginning Feb. 12 for a two-week trial  run.  </P> <P> A spokesman for WGBH in Boston, which is coordinating the broadcasts, said they  will be delivered by satellite to about 30 U.S. markets the same day they are  aired in the Soviet Union and will carry English-language, voice-over  translations.  </P> <P> The WGBH official thinks the number of channels carrying the program may grow,  but at this point, KOCE may be the only place where Southland viewers can catch  Vremya. Spokesmen for KCET in Los Angeles, KPBS in San Diego and KVCR in San  Bernardino all said that there is now no room on their stations' schedules to  accommodate the program.  </P> <P> Vremya -- which means "time" in Russian -- is said to be the most-watched  newscast in the world, seen by 150 million people each night in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> "We feel this is an opportunity to experience the Soviet Union and the world  through their eyes," said Roberta Smith, KOCE's programming director. "With all  the monumental changes taking place in the Soviet Union, it should have quite  an impact on the viewers to see how the Soviets view themselves, uncolored  through the U.S. press. It's a fascinating window."  </P> <P> Although some may consider it an anachronism, or an outrage, for a Soviet news  broadcast to be shown in such a bastion of conservatism as Orange County,  Armando Ruiz, president of the Coast Community College District Board of  Trustees which holds KOCE's license, is not concerned.  </P> <P> "This is going to be an opportunity to provide a service to the community and  have the community react to that," Ruiz said. "(Channel 50 is) a public  service, which does not advocate anything, but just shows programs for the  educational value they have."  </P> <P> Vremya is being made available free to PBS stations by International Video  Broadcasts Inc. in Fairfax, Va., which has an agreement with the Soviet,  state-controlled television network for exclusive U.S. rights to its  broadcasts. The program is translated into English by Soviet nationals working  for IVB.  </P> <P> The effort to distribute Vremya in the United States began 18 months ago,  according to Alan Foster, executive producer of WGBH's news department. Seeking  alternative, late-night programming for PBS stations, Foster sought to obtain  foreign news broadcasts.  </P> <P> "(When) I began on the trail of Vremya, I learned that IVB had secured the  rights," Foster said. "I tried again six weeks ago and found that IVB also had  trouble finding buyers. I told them that if they could give us translated  programs on a quick turnaround, I could deliver a core group of stations."  </P> <P> (Among the buyers IVB had been able to find on its own was KSCI, a Los Angeles  UHF independent which aired Vremya for two weeks last month. "The response was  terrific," said Rosemary Fincher Danon, KSCI's general manager. "The cards and  letters -- and quality of the cards and letters -- we received were far beyond  what we had hoped for. The comments showed that really well-read people were  watching out of a sincere interest in international politics.")  </P> <P> Foster said he informed public television stations nationwide via Teletype  Thursday that Vremya was available, and by Friday had added eight stations to  the original list of 22.  </P> <P> The key to Vremya's future on U.S. television, after the two-week trial, is  finding a corporate sponsor. "We're looking for someone who's altruistic enough  -- or has the self-interest -- to spend the money to have the Soviet view come  to us and see how free glasnost really is," Foster said.  </P> <P> Foster said Vremya will look like U.S. newscasts. "In the same way the Soviets  are coming around to embrace aspects of capitalism, their television is also  reshaping," he said. "Vremya is quite a bit more sophisticated than it was six  months ago. When the Soviets have a breaking story or an internal crisis, we  might see some footage Western sources don't have."  </P> <P> Foster rebukes suggestions that the show could be propaganda. "As long as you  know where it's coming from, there's no way information can be dangerous. To  those who still feel belligerent to the Soviets and still consider them  enemies, it's important to know how the enemy thinks. Understanding people from  another superpower makes the world a safer place."  </P></p>

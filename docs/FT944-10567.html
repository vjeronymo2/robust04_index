			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / EU in Pounds 77m aid for Palestinians The European Union yesterday signed an agreement with Palestinians for aid and loans worth up to Dollars 124m (Pounds 77m) in 1995 and strongly defended its record on assistance to Palestinians. Mr Juan Prat, European Commission director general, who signed the agreement with Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestinian self-rule authority, in Gaza also warned the EU would not fund Palestinian running costs after June next year. Mr Prat said the EU had spent Dollars 61m this year and made grants worth Dollars 1.1bn since 1987 in development assistance and support to Palestinian refugees. The EU is the biggest single donor to Palestinians and the 1995 aid package is part of the EU's Dollars 620m five-year programme of grants and loans from the European Investment Bank. Among projects supported by the EU are paying salaries of the 10,800 Palestinian policemen; a Dollars 50m project to build 1,200 housing units; construction of a 230-bed hospital; upgrading of the sewage and solid waste systems; and funding Palestinian universities and colleges. Mr Prat said donors faced a dilemma. While they wanted to fund visible projects that immediately demonstrated to Palestinians that peace brought concrete changes in living standards they were being forced to fund salaries and running costs.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON  </P> <P> An El Cajon man convicted of killing a 2-year-old girl was sentenced Friday to  25 years to life in state prison.  </P> <P> Matthew LeSure, 29, was convicted Feb. 24 of first-degree murder in the June  13, 1988, slaying of Sara Toussant, whose beaten body was found in a trash bin  near the apartment where the girl lived with her mother and LeSure, her  mother's boyfriend.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Terry O'Rourke added five years to LeSure's sentence  because LeSure was convicted of robbery in 1982. O'Rourke recommended that  LeSure never be granted parole. A parole board could release him after 15  years.  </P> <P> The dead girl's mother, Katherine Minnifield, told the judge at the sentencing  that she would vigorously oppose LeSure's release even after 15 or 20 years.  </P> <P> "I think he should have gotten the chair," Minnifield said after the hearing.  During the hearing, she said, "Matthew LeSure has murdered my little Sara. He  has caused me unbearable pain."  </P> <P> The girl's natural father, Jeffrey Toussant, a sailor stationed in San  Francisco, also appeared at the sentencing. "I think he should have gotten  life," he said afterward.  </P> <P> LeSure told police he and the girl went to a park, and he fell asleep,  discovering when he awoke that Sara was gone. The girl's body was found the  next day by someone looking for cans in a trash bin. An autopsy showed that she  had been beaten, although she was still apparently alive when LeSure put her in  a plastic bag and left her.  </P></p>

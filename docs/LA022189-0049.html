			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A search was called off for two boys swept away by a riptide while playing in  the surf north of Morro Rock, authorities said. Steve Dooty, 17, and  Christopher Cabral, 13, were surfing on boogie-boards about 50 to 75 yards from  shore Sunday when they disappeared, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said. The  father of the two boys, who are believed to be stepbrothers from Dinuba, was  watching them, but "lost sight of the boys and was unable to locate them,"  Officer Manuel Silva said. "Moments later their boogie-board washed ashore  without the boys."  </P></p>

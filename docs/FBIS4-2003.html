The fourth meeting maintained: Over the past year, the  Qinghai Provincial People's Government has conscientiously  implemented the spirit of the Eighth Qinghai Provincial CPC  Congress and the spirit of the First Session of the Eighth  Qinghai Provincial People's Congress. It has successfully  mobilized and organized the people of all nationalities in  Qinghai to emancipate the mind, quicken the pace of reform and  opening up, overcome difficulties, work hard, and live a plain  life. The result has been that Qinghai has enjoyed rapid  economic growth, political stability, nationality solidarity,  and social progress and has basically accomplished the tasks and  attained the goals outlined at the First Session of the Eighth  Qinghai Provincial People's Congress.    The fourth meeting said: The Qinghai Provincial Government  Work Report has realistically summed up the Qinghai Provincial  Government work in 1993, has pointed out the existing problems,  and has analyzed both the difficulties hampering Qinghai's  economic growth and the favorable conditions under which Qinghai  will tide over the difficulties. The Qinghai Provincial  Government Work Report is bound to exert a positive impact on  such aspects as improving and strengthening the people's  government work and mobilizing the people of all nationalities  in Qinghai to grasp opportunities, stand up to new challenges,  and make concerted efforts to strive for new victories.    The fourth meeting pointed out: The year 1994 is the fourth  year of the Eighth Five-Year Plan as well as a crucial year for  pushing ahead with the province's comprehensive reform and  making some major breakthroughs in this connection. The Qinghai  Provincial Government Work Report has charted a clear-cut  guiding ideology, has outlined explicit tasks, and has worked  out efficient and feasible measures that are commensurate with  the realities in Qinghai. This year, as the province is bound  to undertake arduous and urgent reform tasks, the people's  governments at all levels in Qinghai should strive to further  heighten understanding, expeditiously build a socialist market  economic structure, meticulously organize people to actively and  properly handle problems and contradictions that crop up in the  course of reform, and see to it that all sorts of reforms will  go ahead smoothly.    They should also attach great importance to agriculture and  animal husbandry, should vigorously develop township and town  enterprises, should raise funds through all possible channels,  should increase inputs in resource exploitation and  infrastructure construction, should make constant efforts to  readjust and optimize the market-oriented economic structure,  should improve the quality of economic operations, should step  up macroeconomic regulation and control, should place price  hikes under control, and should make sound arrangements for the  masses' livelihood.    The fourth meeting stressed: Social stability is an  important guarantee for reform and development. Therefore, the  people's governments at all levels throughout the province  should firmly adhere to the principle of firmly grasping two  major aspects of work simultaneously as well as consolidate and  develop the political situation of stability and unity.    The fourth meeting finally called on people of all  nationalities in Qinghai to unite closely, further emancipate  the mind, forge ahead, open up new vistas, and strive to  accomplish all tasks in 1994 under the leadership of the Qinghai  Provincial CPC Committee!</p>

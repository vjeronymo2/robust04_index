			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER TERESA REELECTED BY ORDER  </P> <P> Nobel laureate Mother Teresa, who five months ago announced her retirement  because of ill health, was reelected Saturday as head of the Missionaries of  Charity order she founded in 1950, a church official said.  </P> <P> The results of the election suggested that the 80-year-old Roman Catholic nun  has decided to continue to work among the impoverished people of the teeming  Indian metropolis of Calcutta, ignoring medical advice to curtail her  activities.  </P> <P> Sisters of the organization greeted her reelection by holding a special prayer  to mark the occasion. "We are exceedingly happy because of the mother's  reelection. She is our mother, and we are her children," one sister said.  </P> <P> Vicar-General Francis Gomes, a representative of the Archbishop of Calcutta,  said that Mother Teresa was reelected in a secret ballot by 103 delegates  representing 3,046 Missionaries of Charity nuns from around the world.  </P></p>

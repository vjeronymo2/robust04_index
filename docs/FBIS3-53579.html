Room for U.S. maneuver in this regard is  limited in view of Washington's knowledge of the nature of  previous Syrian stances. These called for total and  unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights before  taking one step on the path of normalizing relations with the  Zionist enemy.    There is not the least doubt that Syria holds winning  political cards. Although Clinton is likely to give President  al-Asad other privileges, setting forth numerous options,  Damascus will not discard its winning cards in the hope of  obtaining such privileges, because Syria knows that developments  in the region cannot be predicted or relied upon. Discarding  its winning cards under such circumstances is not in line with  Syria's national interests. Hizballah in Lebanon is now stronger  than before. Every plot hatched by the Zionists and agents to  remove it from the political arena and from the battlefield have  failed, because Hizballah is now part of political life; its  representatives have won seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The  Damascus-based 10 Palestinian factions opposed to the  Gaza-Jericho agreement continue their activities.    Official Zionists circles themselves have stressed that the  Zionist forces will not completely withdraw from the Golan  Heights even if stability were to return to the region and even  if ties were to be established between Damascus and Tel Aviv.  Even when we consider all these factors, it cannot be ruled out  that the Geneva summit may reach important and fateful results  as did the Bush-al-Asad summit. Anyway, the final say regarding  Jerusalem and Palestine will be determined by the Islamic  peoples in the region, primarily the Palestinians.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons Now that Allied-Lyons' joint venture with Carlsberg is finally up and running, it is worth pausing to consider the implications for the beer market as a whole. Carlsberg-Tetley is the industry's third force after Bass and Courage. With this critical mass comes a relatively good fit. Allied is strong in the on-trade with strength in the midlands and north; Carlsberg is strong in off-trade in London and the south-east. That should help raise market share. But how quickly, and, apart from the long-suffering regional brewers, at whose expense? Much depends on the rationalisation that must now follow. Closure of seven depots with a loss of up to 100 jobs can hardly be the end of the story. There must be more cost-savings both in marketing and in production - although Allied has already made an independent start with the closure of its Romford brewery. Without greater efficiency, Carlsberg-Tetley can hardly expect to take share away from the likes of Bass, at least in the off-trade. That will take time. The initial impact on Allied's earnings may be small. A strong third player could eventually hurt Courage which is still wrestling with a hotch-potch of brands following its deal with Grand Metropolitan. More intriguing will be the effect on Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The former has suffered from the recession in the south-east but has a new marketing-orientated chairman in the form of Sir Michael Angus. The latter boasts efficiency and strong brands, but lacks critical mass and broad distribution. If Carlsberg-Tetley is right, these are both prerequisites of success.</p>

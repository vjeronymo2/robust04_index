			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary notes that the requirement to establish a standard for this area applies only to those accrediting agencies whose accreditation permits the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 602.26(b)(11)&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Record of student complaints received by, or available to, an agency <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Section 496(a)(5)(K) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address the record of student complaints received by, or available to, an agency concerning an institution or program it accredits. It is the Secretary's view that the purpose of this requirement is to enable an agency to focus its evaluation of the institution or program on the matters that gave rise to the student complaints when the agency undertakes its next evaluation of the institution or program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 602.26(b)(12)&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compliance with an institution's program responsibilities under Title IV of the Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Section 496(a)(5)(L) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address an institution's compliance with its program responsibilities under Title IV of the Act. It is the Secretary's view that an institution's failure to comply with its Title IV responsibilities should be a factor in an accrediting agency's determination as to whether that institution should continue to be accredited by the agency. The Secretary recognizes that accrediting agencies do not have the responsibility, expertise, personnel, or time to evaluate, on a routine basis, whether the institutions they accredit are in compliance with their Title IV responsibilities. On the other hand, agencies may not ignore information provided to them regarding the lack of compliance of those institutions. Accordingly, the Secretary proposes that, in assessing an institution's compliance under this standard, the agency relies on documentation forwarded to it by the Secretary. The Secretary wishes to make it clear that this section of the proposed regulations does not require accrediting agencies to review an institution to determine whether the institution is fulfilling its responsibilities under the SFA programs, as, for example, by verifying that an institution is calculating Pell distributions properly. Rather, the Secretary expects agencies to use the information provided by the Secretary on the institution to trigger a review of the institution for compliance with agency standards if the documentation provided by the Secretary indicates a problem that is related to one or more of the agency's standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that the requirement to establish standards for this area applies only to those accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 602.26(b)(13)&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The institution's practice of making refunds to students <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Under section 484B of the HEA, an institution participating in the SFA programs must have a fair and equitable refund policy. An institution's refund policy is judged to be fair and equitable if it provides a refund in an amount of at least the largest of the amounts provided under ``(1) the requirements of applicable State law; (2) the specific refund requirements established by the institution's nationally recognized accrediting agency and approved by the Secretary; or (3) the pro rata refund calculation'' described elsewhere in section 484B. To permit an institution to satisfy the fair and equitable refund requirement using this criterion, the Secretary proposes not to recognize an accrediting agency unless the agency has a refund policy that provides for a fair and equitable refund to a student of tuition, fees, and other institutional charges. Thus, the Secretary's recognition of an agency means that the Secretary has approved that agency's refund policy. Non-Federal negotiators objected to the inclusion of this requirement in the proposed regulations on the grounds that section 496(g) of the HEA explicitly states that the Secretary may not establish standards for accrediting agencies that are not required by section 496. The Secretary believes, however, that the inclusion of a requirement for a standard addressing an institution's refund policy in the proposed regulations is necessary to comply with section 484B of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 602.26(c)&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Time limit on correcting deficiencies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;602.26(c), the Secretary proposes that, when an institution or program fails to meet an agency standard, the agency may permit the institution or program a period, which may not exceed 18 months, during which time it must take corrective action to bring itself back into compliance with the standard. The agency is free to set the time frame for coming into compliance at less than 18 months. If the institution or program fails to bring itself into compliance during the specified period, the agency must take adverse action, unless it finds that the time frame for achieving compliance should be extended for cause. Of course, the agency may take adverse action against an institution or program, either immediately or in less than 18 months, without offering the institution or program the opportunity to take corrective action if the agency believes that the adverse action is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that the 18-month time frame is necessary to ensure that institutions and programs make serious efforts to improve the quality of their offerings and to ensure that accrediting agencies take adverse actions when institutions fail to make those efforts. Accordingly, the Secretary anticipates that extensions beyond 18 months for cause will not be routinely granted. Additionally, the Secretary anticipates that for violations that are easily correctable, the appropriate period will be significantly less than 18 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must take action not only if it determines that an institution or program is not in compliance with a standard but also if it determines that an institution or program may currently meet the standard but is unlikely to be able to continue to meet the standard. The Secretary invites comments on this possible addition to the section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

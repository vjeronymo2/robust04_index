			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSTAL SERVICE FACING ITS WORST DEFICIT EVER;  </P> <P> BUT OPERATING HOURS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE CUT,  POSTMASTER SAYS  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service will suffer its worst deficit ever next year -- more  than $1.5 billion -- but Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank plans no cutbacks  in post office operating hours or delivery schedules.  </P> <P> Frank said he is confident that an ambitious cost-reduction program, heavily  dependent on automation, can keep the postal system's finances under control  until the next rate increase, expected in 1991.  </P> <P> Operating hours at local post offices were reduced from March until September,  1988, generating criticism in many communities. But Frank said that he will not  approve similar measures this year or next despite the fiscal crunch.  </P> <P> "We're not going to do that, absolutely not," Frank said in an interview this  week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Won't Alter Deliveries  </P> <P> Saturday service also is sacrosanct, according to the postmaster general.  Reducing deliveries to five days a week "is not a possibility," Frank said.  </P> <P> "We handle 530 million pieces of mail a day," he said. "If we cut out Saturday,  we would have to handle a billion on Monday, and we just couldn't do it. We  couldn't deliver them, handle them and store them."  </P> <P> The Postal Service is in the final year of its traditional three-year rate  cycle. It will apply next year to the independent Postal Rate Commission for an  overall increase, probably between 15% and 20%. The commission, after lengthy  hearings, will decide on the allocation of higher rates among different types  of mail. New rates will take effect in the first quarter of 1991.  </P> <P> The price of a first-class stamp, now 25 cents, would rise to 30 cents if the  rate commission decides on a 20% increase.  </P> <P> Losses are mounting as the Postal Service reaches the end of the three-year  cycle because labor cost increases and inflation are exceeding the revenue  increases produced by the last rate increases.  </P> <P> The system should break even for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. But fiscal  1990 will produce losses of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, the biggest deficit  since the Postal Service became an independent agency in 1971. The largest  previous loss was $802 million in 1982.  </P> <P> The key to Frank's plans for controlling Postal Service costs is increased use  of automation.  </P> <P> An extensive automation plan "is more crucial to the Postal Service than  anything else," Frank said. "We want to have a program that fully automates the  mail stream."  </P> <P> A vital element is the use of bar codes, the computerized horizontal stripes  printed on some envelopes. They help reduce the number of people handling each  piece of mail.  </P> <P> Bar code information goes far beyond zip codes. For example, bar codes can  direct a letter to a specific floor in a big building or to one side of a block  on a residential street. That means fewer hours spent sorting and bundling  mail.  </P> <P> About 40% of all letters carry bar codes now, up from 7% at the start of last  year. Frank hopes to encourage businesses to increase the figure to 60% by the  end of next year, and he will make a pitch for automation in his speech Monday  to a conference of major mailers.  </P> <P> The inducement will be financial. He said he hopes to raise the discount given  to businesses that use bar codes.  </P> <P> The postal service has just developed a machine able to read bar codes through  the clear address windows on business envelopes. When the machines are in  common use, businesses will be able to print bar codes on letters instead of  placing them on envelopes, which is more expensive.  </P> <P> Increased reliance on automation, combined with a $200-million reduction in  spending by headquarters and elimination of 1,000 management jobs through the  system by attrition, should enable the Postal Service to handle its budget  crunch next year, Frank said.  </P> <P> The deficit for 1990 will be driven by cost-of-living increases and regular  wage increases under labor contracts as well as by a surge in workmen's  compensation claims. The cost of benefits for the Postal Service's  800,000-member work force also is rising rapidly, with health insurance  payments increasing at an unsustainable rate of 30% a year, Frank said.  </P> <P> Total hours worked throughout the system will be reduced for 1990, with fewer  part-time employees hired and less overtime for regular workers. In addition,  some 8,000 jobs won't be filled as vacancies occur, Frank said. Normal  attrition is 60,000 people a year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Difficult Undertaking'  </P> <P> "We will operate in the field with fewer hours next year than we did this  year," Frank said. "That is a very difficult undertaking because our volume is  going up."  </P> <P> Each year, the system must accommodate an additional 1.5 million to 1.8 million  addresses of new homes and new businesses.  </P> <P> Various marketing innovations are being implemented, including the sale of  stamps on an experimental basis through automated teller machines at banks in  Seattle. The experiment will be tested at banks in Santa Ana later this year.  </P></p>

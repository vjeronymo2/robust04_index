			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Police in Karachi on alert after political violence Pakistani police and other investigation agencies were last night closely monitoring the security situation in the city of Karachi, where three days of violence this week have left at least 29 people dead. Among the dead, 16 belonged to rival factions of the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement), an ethnic party of Urdu-speaking immigrants from India, which split in a power struggle more than two years ago. The other 13 victims included three policemen. The larger faction of the MQM has been involved in a bitter power struggle with members of a breakaway group which formed a separate party last year. Members of the two factions have been targeting each other in sniper attacks and ambushes, in an effort to establish their authority in the city. While the larger faction of the MQM still appears to have the support of a large number of people, it is not clear if either of the two sides is gaining ground decisively. Efforts by the Pakistani government to negotiate an end to the violence have so far produced no results. But the killings have once again sparked fears among the city's businessmen, worried that security fears will deter investors away from Karachi. Senior officials say privately that at least part of the violence has resulted from the involvement of unemployed, educated youth. The city has Pakistan's fastest growing population living in slums.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Cold war warmed over: Militant Islam has become the west's new evil empire A year ago this week the Algerian army deposed President Chadli Bendjedid and cancelled the second ballot of parliamentary elections, due to take place a few days later. It was, on the face of it, an outrageous thing to do, just after the decisive political victory of liberal democracy over Soviet communism in eastern Europe and the decisive military victory of the western democracies over the army of an Arab dictator in the Gulf war. Surely the same western democracies that had put great pressure on governments elsewhere in Africa to accept multi-party elections would not tolerate such a blatant abortion of the electoral process on the very fringe of western Europe? They did, of course, and the reason is no secret. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was virtually certain to win an overall majority if the second ballot had gone ahead. During the cold war, the west would turn a blind eye to authoritarian practices if the alternative seemed likely to be a communist or pro-communist government. Now, it seems, the same rule applies, only for 'communist' read 'Islamic fundamentalist'. In the case of communism, there was a double rationale for this attitude. On the one hand, the expansion of communism, by whatever means, was seen as threatening western security. On the other, it was argued that a communist victory, even through the ballot box, would in fact be a defeat for democracy, since a communist government would not allow any more free elections. This second argument has been used explicitly in the Algerian case by a senior US official, Mr Edward Djerejian, who said there would be no overwhelming merit in a system of 'one person, one vote, one time'. It has some plausibility, in that some of the FIS leaders had said openly that they did not believe in multi-party democracy, and it was doubtful whether the discredited Mr Chadli would have been strong enough to hold them to the constitution once they were in office. A year later, however, the claim by the army to have saved democracy from itself is looking thin. Thousands of Islamic militants are in prison (and Amnesty International has again begun to receive regular reports of torture), but there are enough still at large to carry on nightly gun battles with the security forces in many parts of the country. There is no sign of new elections being held. Even in economic policy the regime has reverted to 1970s-style dirigisme. The west's willingness to support such a regime suggests that Islamic fundamentalism has also replaced communism in the other half of the cold war rationale. It is seen as a threat not only to Algerian liberties but also to western security. John Esposito, a leading US specialist on Islam, shows in a new book, The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality? (Oxford, Dollars 22), that this view is indeed held by many influential people in the US. It is probably even more widely held in Europe. The normally sober Economist magazine, in its imaginative history of the 21st century published last month, sees a new Arab-Islamic superpower, with Iran and Pakistan as satellites, conquering Turkey and south-east Europe, and going on in alliance with China to subdue large parts of Russia. The Economist imagined this superpower starting with a coup in Saudi Arabia in 2011. But it also assumes that an isolationist US will confine its interest to a 'tranquil, fairly prosperous and almost wholly democratic' western hemisphere, while western Europe, protected by its nuclear deterrent, suffers only an influx of Russian refugees. Tragic as such a scenario might be for Turkey and eastern Europe, a cynical west European (and still more a cynical American) may be tempted to wonder what all the fuss is about, if that is the worst that 'resurgent Islam' can do to him. The most plausible part of it is that western Europe's 'disaster' takes the form of a bungled Anglo- French military intervention in the Middle East, not an Arab or Moslem invasion of western Europe itself. Mr Esposito takes an optimistic view of Islamic revivalism, concluding that 'guided by our stated ideals and goals of freedom and self-determination, the west has an ideal vantage point for appreciating the aspirations of many in the Moslem world as they seek to define new paths for their future'. The French scholar Olivier Roy is much gloomier about what Islamic movements have to offer their own people. But the title of his book, The Failure of Political Islam (L'echec de l'Islam politique) (Seuil/Esprit, FFr130), is also implicitly reassuring from a selfish western point of view. Mr Roy, who was an admirer of Islamic politics in its revolutionary phase, recounts sadly how such movements have retreated during the 1980s into what he calls 'neo-fundamentalism', or even 'lumpen-Islamism', led by less well-educated people who interpret Islam as an austere and joyless life-style rather than a recipe for social liberation. Mr Roy takes it for granted that the FIS will come to power in Algeria sooner or later. But, he says, it would change only the law and les moeurs - not so much actual morals as the code of public, or publicly admissible, behaviour. 'It no longer offers any model of a different society or a better tomorrow.' Algeria under such a government would be more like Saudi Arabia than Iran. Not perhaps the ideal neighbour one would wish for, but hardly a significant threat to European security.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Italian banks agree plans for Ferruzzi restructuring ITALIAN BANKS have agreed in principle to a freeze on interest payments to enable the administrators of the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group to carry out a radical restructuring plan. If the agreement is now endorsed by the banks' boards and by the foreign banks involved, it will mean that they will forego interest payments of some L1,500bn (Pounds 623m) this year. The foreign banks are due to discuss the restructuring plan today in Milan. Until now they have taken a tough stance, opposing a debt moratorium. Italian financial institutions account for over 75 per cent of outstanding bank debt; the remainder, totalling L6,500bn, is owed to some 100 foreign banks. In return for an agreement, the administrators will restructure the group's outstanding L28,000bn worth of debts, sell off L5,500bn of non-core business and recapitalise both Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) and its quoted industrial subsidiary, Montedison. The carrot for the banks is the promise of eventually recovering their money through the recapitalisation and subsequent projected profitability of the operating companies, essentially in the Montedison portfolio. Without an agreement, Italy's second-largest private group risks bankruptcy proceedings. The situation has to be clarified by Thursday, when Ferfin and Montedison are due to approve their half-year balance sheets. A decision on the accounts was postponed on September 30 because no agreement had been reached on a debt moratorium. Excluding the debt service payments will dramatically change the profit and loss account. It is still not clear whether the debt moratorium will be backdated to January. This is likely to be a major sticking point with the foreign banks, if they are willing to accept the principle of a moratorium at all. The Bank of Italy discreetly intervened on Friday, using its good offices and powers of moral persuasion to demonstrate that the restructuring plan, drawn up by Mediobanca, had its full backing. The Bank of Italy's public endorsement makes it more difficult for the foreign banks not to fall into line. However, the mood of the foreign banks is unlikely to have been softened by apparently well documented reports that both Mediobanca and Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of the main creditors, knew of the Ferruzzi group's financial plight almost three months before it became public knowledge. Mediobanca's plan envisages a five-year timescale, during which net financial debt of Montedison will be cut from L14,400bn to L4,900bn and that of Ferfin from L5,000bn to L1,900bn.</p>

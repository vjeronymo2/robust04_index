			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 18 (AA) -- Prime Minister Tansu Ciller  on Saturday [18 June] said that the new economic measures will  bring short-term difficulties but in the long-run will allow for  the restabilization in internal and foreign balance in the  economy.    The prime ministerial notice on the 1995 fiscal year budget  call by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller was published in Saturday's  OFFICIAL GAZETTE.

And the following  principles will be followed" she said.

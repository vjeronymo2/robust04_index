			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV URGES ARABS TO 'PUT OUT THE FIRE';  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: IN HIS FIRST COMMENT ON PERSIAN GULF CRISIS, HE DENIES THAT  MOSCOW HAS TURNED AGAINST IRAQ.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his first statement on the Persian  Gulf crisis, called on Arab states Friday to "put out the fire" themselves and  make outside intervention unnecessary. He denied that the Soviet Union has  turned against Iraq.  </P> <P> "From the very beginning," Gorbachev said, "the Soviet Union has taken a clear  and consistent position on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. There is nothing  anti-Iraqi in it. On the contrary, we strived to help Iraq find a way out of  the situation it found itself in, with minimum losses.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, this path was not taken," he added. "The crisis has worsened,  prompting the Saudi Arabian leadership to request the U.S. government to deploy  U.S. Army and aviation units in Saudi Arabia."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, vacationing in the Soviet south, addressed his remarks to Egyptian  President Hosni Mubarak, host to an emergency Arab League summit meeting Friday  in Cairo. The text of Gorbachev's remarks was carried by the official Tass news  agency.  </P> <P> Although the statement was free of the harsh criticism of Iraq that has been  made by other Soviet officials and the state-run news media -- one newspaper  branded the Kuwait invasion a "crime" -- it left no doubt that Gorbachev wants  Iraq, a longtime Soviet ally, to pull its soldiers out of Kuwait immediately.  </P> <P> "Numerous examples show that a crisis in interstate relations, unless it is  immediately localized and settled, gathers momentum like a stone falling from a  rocky cliff," Gorbachev said. He asked the Arab League to begin "active work"  to bring about an end to the conflict.  </P> <P> Last week, in an extraordinary example of superpower cooperation, the United  States and the Soviet Union called jointly for a worldwide arms embargo against  Iraq. Earlier, the Kremlin shut off the flow of weapons and ammunition that had  made it Baghdad's top arms supplier for more than 20 years.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Soviet government issued a statement that the Kremlin is ready  to talk about the Persian Gulf crisis with military leaders of the United  States, Britain, China and France -- members of the U.N. Security Council's  Military Staff Committee. But Gorbachev assured Arab League states presumably  jittery about outside military action that the Soviet Union wants them to  settle the matter themselves.  </P> <P> "I believe that efforts by Arab countries could play a major role in this  common cause," he said. "Perhaps it is the most preferable path to take."  </P> <P> At the Arab League summit, the leaders voted to recommend that Arab nations  commit military forces to the defense of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and any other  Arab land threatened with Iraqi aggression.  </P> <P> Gorbachev said he is ready to "maintain constant contact" with Mubarak and  other Arab leaders "to jointly seek a chance to put out the fire in the Persian  Gulf, and restore peace and stability there."  </P> <P> Although officials have ruled out Soviet participation in the U.S.-led force  being deployed in Saudi Arabia, the superpowers are staying in touch. Eduard A.  Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, talked about the gulf crisis by  telephone Friday with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, while the latter  was in Brussels, Tass reported.  </P> <P> The Kremlin has also drawn up plans for evacuating the 800 Soviet nationals  living in Kuwait. Rear Adm. A. Karpin, deputy chief of the navy's political  directorate, told the military daily Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) that the navy  is "ready to evacuate its compatriots by sea, if such a task is set before it."  </P></p>

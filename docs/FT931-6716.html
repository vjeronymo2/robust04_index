			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Insurance salesmen get a blast - Complaints to ombudsman soar over life policy deals THE INSURANCE industry's referee, Dr Julian Farrand, this week blew the whistle on some of the selling practices of salesmen. The annual report of the insurance ombudsman showed total complaints had risen 29 per cent from the year before to 5,576 in 1992. But life insurance cases accounted for a much steeper increase of 41 per cent - more than one-third of his workload. The ombudsman deals with both general and life insurance and resolves disputes with customers who are unhappy with the way a complaint has been handled by their insurance company. Farrand attributes the rise in life assurance cases to the increasing complexity of policies and the failure of some salesmen to explain them fully. He said it was 'disconcerting' that so many fact-finds - the forms filled in by salesmen or advisers detailing the financial circumstances of a client - were not completed fully. 'It suggests that, in the push to produce a sale, important requirements and needs may be overlooked and an unsuitable product selected by the salesman,' he added. A mother and son were sold two life policies and told they would make a reasonable profit after five years. Since these were whole-of-life plans, they got a shock when they came to surrender them five years later. The agent for the company said she had stressed their long-term nature by drawing a graph for the clients showing their growth over 45 years. But the line showed an increase in returns from the beginning of the policy. Finding for the clients, Farrand noted: 'With the aid of a magnifying glass, one might estimate a return after five years of around 30 per cent.' In another case a young woman had been sold a large amount of life cover. The section on the fact-find asking which aspects of insurance were important to her was left blank. 'When reviewing her complaint,' Farrand said, 'it was difficult to understand why that amount of life cover had been required. After some investigation, the probable answer became clear - that over-selling was involved.' Sales of inappropriate policies are highlighted by the fact that while the insurance company's decision was revised in only 31.5 per cent of all cases investigated by the ombudsman, this proportion rose to 42 per cent when it came to life insurance. Farrand is, therefore, suggesting a 'reverse fact-find' which salesmen would have to complete before the contract was signed. He suggests the customer should ask these questions: Whose agent are you? How much commission do you get? What charges will be made for managing my money? Will I do better than with the building society? Could I lose money? How soon will the surrender value equal the premiums paid? Why are you advising me to buy that particular policy/investment? Allied Dunbar claimed this week that asking a salesman to disclose how much commission he got - a cost which is, ultimately, borne by the customer - was 'irrelevant information. It is useless.' The Office of Fair Trading has, however, called repeatedly for commission disclosure at a time when the whole financial services industry is under pressure to introduce higher standards of investor protection. The Prudential said it favoured customers being told the overall expense of the contract and not just the commission. 'An insurance salesman could be on full salary or just commission or a combination of the two,' said the Pru. 'So, a customer who simply asks the rate of commission might be misled by the answer.' Another area which preoccupied the ombudsman was home income plans. In the 1980s, many elderly people wanting to take income out of their home were persuaded to take out a mortgage and invest the money in an equity-linked bond. This was supposed to cover the mortgage payments and give them an income. But poor stock market performance and rising interest rates meant higher mortgage payments and investment losses, pushing many into debt. In cases where the risks of the investment were not explained properly, Farrand said he would find in favour of the customer. The guidelines he uses for compensation are much better than those employed by the Investors Compensation Scheme, from which home income victims have to claim if the company or independent financial adviser selling them the policy is no longer in business. Last week, the High Court ruled that the ICS was not acting 'irrationally' in refusing to award compensation for distress over home income plans, or for money spent by a victim in the belief that this was profit, not capital. By contrast, Farrand said he expected victims to be returned to the same financial position they had been in before the scheme. He is also prepared to make awards for distress: one couple was given Pounds 3,000 after one of them had a heart attack. In some cases, he will also oblige the insurance company to pay the victim for the costs of taking professional advice. Pressure is, therefore, expected to increase for compensation arrangements for home income plan victims to be equalised within the industry. The ombudsman awarded a total of Pounds 4.5m last year, with the highest amount being Pounds 120,000 in a case about building insurance. He said he was disappointed that the industry 'suffers from some people's apparent inability to recognise that a fraud against it is a fraud against the premium-paying population at large.' Of the general insurance cases, one involved a claim where the insurer refused to cover accidental damage for a Nintendo Gameboy, saying it was not a computer as specified under the policy. But, after Farrand consulted the Oxford dictionary, the company agreed to pay out. The Insurance Ombudsman, City Gate One, 135 Park St, London SE1 9EA.</p>

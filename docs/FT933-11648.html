			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: LTV wins appeal court ruling on anti-trust suit LTV, the US steel group which last month emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, yesterday said a US appeals court had ruled in its favour, upholding a lower court ruling in an anti-trust lawsuit against USX's former Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad unit, writes Karen Zagor. The net value of the judgment, including interest to date but excluding fees and costs, is estimated at Dollars 485m. Under LTV's confirmed reorganisation plan, all proceeds for the litigation will be contributed to the restored steel pension plans. The award stems from a 1982 lawsuit against the USX unit which charged that a number of railroads had monopolised dock handling and inland transportation of iron ore to steel mills for nearly 30 years. B&amp;LE is the last railroad to settle. B&amp;LE has 90 days to petition the supreme court to review the appeal court ruling. In June, USX said its US Steel unit had taken second-quarter pre-tax reserves of more than Dollars 400m to cover damages in the case.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Iceland Foods to move into Littlewoods outlets - Profits expected to rise 19% to at least Pounds 55m SHARES IN Iceland Frozen Foods jumped 21p to 668p as the high street food retailer announced a Pounds 27.5m placing to fund its move into Littlewoods outlets and forecast a 19 per cent rise in annual profits to at least Pounds 55m. Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman, said the move into Littlewoods reinforced Iceland's recent transformation from freezer centre to high street food retailer. 'Frozen food has become more about convenience food than bulk buying,' Mr Walker said. Analysts were encouraged by the Littlewoods deal which is expected to add Pounds 100m to sales in a full year. Many upgraded their forecasts for 1993 from about Pounds 63m to more than Pounds 66m. 'Any deal that represents one year's organic growth and is done without any cost to the balance sheet has to be applauded,' said Mr David Shriver of County NatWest. Iceland has agreed to take over the foodhalls in 48 of Littlewoods 127 stores, with an average floor space of 4,100 sq ft. The food group will only pay a rent based on the turnover it achieves in those stores. However, it will have to re-equip the food halls, at a cost expected to be about Pounds 20m. This would be funded by the placing, which has been underwritten by NM Rothschild &amp; Sons. Mr Walker said Iceland had decided a placing was the most prudent option, in light of the group's decision to keep gearing at less than 50 per cent. 'It gives us a little comfort factor,' he said. Investors were offered 4.3m new Iceland shares at 640p, representing about 4 per cent of the existing equity. The deal is not expected to be dilutive. Iceland also announced that it would increase its target of store openings for the current year from 50 to 60, for a total of about 680, including the Littlewoods outlets. The increased openings would also be funded with placing proceeds. The group's aggressive expansion programme was announced amid forecasts of record turnover of Pounds 1.04bn for the 53 weeks to January 2, against Pounds 889m. On a like-for-like basis, Iceland saw a 10 per cent increase in sales, while food inflation was estimated to have been just 2 per cent. Mr Walker said the increase in sales was primarily due to more customers walking through the door. Individual transactions were roughly similar at about Pounds 7.50. Chilled foods provided the group's greatest growth in 1992, increasing an estimated 25 per cent year on year. Frozen food accounted for just over 50 per cent of sales, while basic groceries represented 22 per cent of turnover. The final dividend is forecast to rise by 18 per cent to 6.9p for a total of 10p. This compares with a total of 8.5p last time. Earnings per share are estimated to be not less than 41.2p, a rise of 19 per cent. On a fully-diluted basis the increase is 17 per cent to 37.5p.</p>

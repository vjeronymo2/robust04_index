			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Shampoo and set in Russia: Christopher Parkes on a German group's eastern hair care flair In Dzerzhinsk, on the outskirts of Nizhny Novgorod, stands a new-generation Russian factory fortified in a style reminiscent of the old days when the area - home to the Soviet Union's T-34 tank and MiG 29 warplane - was closed to foreigners. Ringed by a solid 3-metre-high concrete wall, electrified barbed wire, floodlights, a no-go area of raked sand and a further wire fence inside the main perimeter, Germany's Wella group goes about its day-to-day business: making shampoo, conditioner and permanent wave lotion. Mr Boris Nemtsov, regional governor, is ignoring the elaborate defences erected to keep gangsters away from the German haircare group's DM25m investment in the Russian chemicals industry. He is holding forth on the 'prejudice' disseminated by foreign media. 'I get a lot of information from the outside,' he says in perfect English. He sees the FT, the Wall Street Journal and the Economist. He reads too much about lawlessness, inflation and instability and not enough about the advantages for potential investors. 'You can make profits here which you cannot dream of where you come from,' he says, citing labour costs a tenth of those in Germany, and clamouring demand for western-quality products. As for the mafia, Russia is no worse than eastern Europe or New York: 'And the way to deal with it is to improve the situation in the private sector,' he says. 'When private banks first appeared in Russia they were full of corruption and crime. But they organised their security privately and the problem was no longer a problem,' he adds. Mr Nemtsov, 34, a 'conservative' favourite of President Boris Yeltsin, blessed with double-rations of energy and charisma, is guest of honour at the official opening of the factory, a 50:50 joint venture between the German group and Caprolactam, a sprawling Russian chemicals combine. He seems put out that the size of the plant does not match his view of the market potential. He waves his arm around the compound where the new buildings occupy less than 20 per cent of the 50-hectare enclosure and where new jobs have been found for just 130 of Caprolactam's bloated workforce of 13,000. 'If this factory were five times bigger Wella could supply the whole market,' he says. The joint venture, known as Capella, expects to break even on sales of DM30m-plus in its first year. It is considering increasing capacity, and plans to double turnover by 1996, presidential election year in Russia. Few are tempted to look much further. 'We are in a country where you cannot do much long-term planning,' says Mr Peter Zuhlsdorff, Wella chairman. 'Our only navigational aid is the foghorn; they haven't got radar yet.' Wella was first steered towards its Russian investment three years ago by the presence in one of the last great potential markets of its global rivals in haircare: Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble and L'Oreal. Wella, which had hitherto supplied the market through exports, also feared Russia might be closed to non-essential imports. It was guided towards Dzerzhinsk by a joint venture advisory agency set up in 1991 by the Nizhny authorities and Germany's WestDeutsche Landesbank shortly after the region was declared an experimental privatisation zone by Mr Yeltsin. Nizhny's importance as the Soviet weapons smithy meant it had above-average (by Soviet standards) road and rail links. Caprolactam was once sole supplier of a wide range of raw materials to the entire Soviet Union, and is seeking more partners such as Wella - its first foreign collaborator - to make added-value products with more appeal than its present range, which includes linoleum and plastic funnels. Lawlessness plus political and economic chaos entered Wella's calculations but, Mr Zuhlsdorff says, the investment was based on business realities in the global personal products market. The company's situation in Russia is basically no different from its other markets: balancing risks against opportunities and competing against global rivals. 'What is going on here is the sharing-out of a new market,' says Mr Zuhlsdorff. 'In the long run, not taking a chance now would involve us in greater risks in the future.' As for the security of his investment (Caprolactam provided the land and the buildings), Mr Zuhlsdorff seems unconcerned. 'Our DM25m is not exactly peanuts, but . . .' he says with a wry smile and a shrug. The message is that it is an acceptable stake in the light of the potential offered by 150m heads of Russian hair and ample evidence that local customers will pay for western quality despite widespread poverty. Wella products, marketed in Russia for the past 15 years, currently sell for about 90 per cent of German retail prices. That is a good enough start for him, and he sees Wella as established and sure to gain. Only the extent of the gains and their timing is in doubt. 'There will not be a catastrophe,' he states. There may be years of uncertainty. Growth may come in stops and starts or not at all for some periods. 'But long term, (economic reform) will go on.' Short term, formal distribution arrangements appear to be a concern because the former state-run system has collapsed. Wella has tried to overcome this by setting up a marketing joint venture with Caprolactam. This Moscow-based company, Russwell, already has five wholesale distributors and 50 staff building a chain of exclusive dealers. At the same time, the group's Welonda shop-fitting subsidiary is opening hair salons - a key outlet for the Wella brand - as quickly as it can find joint-venture partners. There are now some 150 in Russia. The latest is in the White House parliament building in Moscow, with two more planned for the capital's Bolshoi Theatre and GUM department store. Whatever Mr Nemtsov's reservations about the scale of the new factory, which started production last autumn, the venture has restored Wella's fortunes in a market where sales had virtually evaporated in 1992. Thanks to Capella's output, bolstered by imports of hair colours and other more refined products, Russia is again the group's biggest market in terms of turnover in eastern Europe. Wella's handsome margins are being recycled into print and broadcast media advertising. And Mr Nemtsov, given to grand gestures and ambitions ('I am governor in Nizhny just as President Clinton was governor in Arkansas') does not miss the significance of Wella's initiative. 'Did you know how foreign investment in Poland started? In the same way as here, with cosmetics.' The Capella plant is a small but important addition to the 300-odd joint ventures Mr Remtsov claims are under way in the region. But many more are needed if Russia is to make a smooth transition to a market economy. 'We need anything, any investors, anything that makes a profit.'</p>

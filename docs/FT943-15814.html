			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest boosts Taunton Cider to Pounds 20m Sharply lower interest costs helped Taunton Cider report a 15 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits despite intense competition from low-price brands in the take-home cider market which held back both turnover and operating profits. Taunton, which warned about the impact of the surge in economy brand sales in March, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.3m in the year to April 30, against Pounds 17.6m, on turnover marginally higher at Pounds 125.3m (Pounds 124.9m). Interest payments fell from Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 68,000. Interest receipts slipped to Pounds 371,000 (Pounds 572,000) despite an increase in year-end net cash which increased over th year from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 4.5m. Adjusting for the flotation in July 1992, pro-forma pre-tax profits were 4 per cent higher at Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 19.5m.) Earnings per share were up 7 per cent to 13.1p (12.2p) and the board is recommending a 3.95p final divided which makes a total of 6.6p (6p). Operating profits increased by 1.52 per cent reflecting a further increase in sales volumes and the continued strong performance of the group's leading brands which include the Dry Blackthorn, Autumn Gold and Diamond White brands. In the on-trade business, which accounts for about half the cider market, Taunton boosted both volume and market share. Total pub volumes grew by 3 per cent with growth in draught sales offsetting a decline in packaged volumes. The group also increased sales of both its own brands and retailer and economy brands in the take home market, but nevertheless lost market share with its brands showing a 4 per cent volume gain compared with market growth of 9 per cent. Taunton believes economy brands have now peaked with about 10 per cent of the market. It hit back at the start of the year cutting costs and lifting promotional spending. As a result Mr Michael Cottrell, chairman, said: 'Take home sales volumes in the last three months of the year were significantly up on the previous year and have continued strongly into the new financial year.' COMMENT Taunton has responded firmly, if a little tardily, to the threat posed by cut-price cider in the take home market. Promotional spending has been boosted by between Pounds 1m and Pounds 2m a year and is being paid for by cutting costs and boosting productivity. Over the next two years it believes it can cut costs by another Pounds 5m to offset margin pressure. However the years of strong domestic profit growth are probably over. Reflecting this Taunton recently signed a promising distribution deal with Molson in the US. In the meantime pre-tax profits should edge higher to about Pounds 20.7m this year, producing earnings of 13.3p. The shares gained 12p yesterday to close at 162p and look fairly priced.</p>

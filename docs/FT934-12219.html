			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (8): A prudent approach - Profile: AGF SO far Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the third largest insurer in France after UAP and Axa, has been relatively resilient in spite of the pressures on the French insurance industry. It saw net profits fall to FFr1.5bn in 1992 from FFr2.7bn in 1991, but recently reported that profits had stabilised at FFr1.4bn in the first half of 1993. AGF has not been unaffected by the recession. Banque du Phenix, one of its banking subsidiaries, last year was hit by the property squeeze and this year it has borne heavy losses on its stake in Comptoir des Entrepreneurs. However AGF, under the chairmanship of Michel Albert, has been less exposed to the more volatile areas of the economy than UAP and GAN, its fellow state-controlled insurers, and has benefited from his long-term strategy of protecting profitability rather than chasing market share. Mr Albert has already said that he expects the second half of 1993 to show an improvement over the first. AGF has adopted the same prudent approach to international expansion as to the management of its domestic business. Yet it scored a coup last year by taking a stake in AMB, the German insurer, beating UAP in the race to become the first big French insurer with a sizeable presence in Germany.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ASSURANCES GENERALES DE FRANCE (AGF)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimated value*                           FFr26.5bn Government stake                       72.7 per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1992            1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Consolidated sales           FFr59bn         FFr55bn Net profits                 FFr1.5bn        FFr2.7bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Morgan Stanley, European Privatisation 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> FETTA LEADS A MICROPHONED 'TOSCA' OUTDOORS IN REDLANDS  </P> <P> Many years before the Inland Empire became -- as it is today -- an area of  varied and competitive symphonic activity, there was opera every summer in  Redlands Bowl. The outdoor showplace, now in its 66th summer season, has hosted  budding singers and al-fresco operatic production -- as well as dance and  orchestra concerts and recitals -- throughout its long history.  </P> <P> Puccini's "Tosca" returned to Redlands Bowl on Friday night, courtesy of music  director Frank Fetta, a 31-player orchestra and a cast of attractive young  singers. Unstaged, the old thriller still made its mark; the power of this  score does not reside in sets, costumes and gesture.  </P> <P> There was a modicum of interaction between the singing actors, which helped.  What did not help the performance was a probing use of microphones and  amplification, which seemed to distort all voices, flatten out timbres and  stifle vocal coloration. The one benefit of such close aural scrutiny was a  near-complete clarity of words: Sung in English in a serviceable combination  translation, this "Tosca" could usually be understood.  </P> <P> Fetta's impassioned and thorough approach to the familiar score achieved  Puccinian sweep in some moments, but too often bogged down, motion-wise, in  detail. Still, this was an effective musical reading, buoyed neatly by the  capable orchestra. Assisting in choral duties was the Cambridge Singers,  prepared by Alexander Ruggieri.  </P> <P> Though their voices and singing emerged from the sound system distorted in  regard to size and color, the three principals nevertheless seemed  appropriately cast, and comprehensive in their preparation.  </P> <P> As Tosca, Starleigh Goltry looked statuesque and divalike in her gowns, and  sang confidently and with conviction. And, like Jane McGowan before her -- in  1958, McGowan was Tosca in Glynn Ross' production for Redlands Bowl -- Goltry  sang her final lines from the balcony above the Bowl stage.  </P> <P> William Trabold's Cavaradossi matched Goltry in spirit and vocal thrust,  despite apparent sound distortion above the staff. Peter Van Derick looked  stoic and impassive as Scarpia, but spit out the words vehemently.  </P> <P> Among the assisting singers, John Ross Nelson produced a well-detailed  characterization of the Sacristan.

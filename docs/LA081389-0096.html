			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Oakland Coliseum officials are enraged about reports of a party in the  stadium's sky-box seating area attended by off-duty Hayward police officers. As  many as 20 officers attended the private party in late April, drinking liquor  and watching a live striptease show. The officers had received free tickets  from a Hayward auto dealer, said Oakland police officials, who are now  investigating whether acceptance of the tickets constituted a violation of  police ethics. Coliseum operators said they are concerned that the party might  have put them in violation of state alcoholic beverage laws forbidding the  mixing of nudity and alcohol in public places.  </P></p>

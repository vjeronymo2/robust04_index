			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Germany calls for tougher N-proliferation curbs Germany yesterday unveiled a 10-point plan to strengthen the policing and control of the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, called for tougher international export controls and closer co-operation between potential suppliers of technology for weapons of mass destruction. He proposed an international conference to agree verification measures to prevent the spread of biological weapons. j He also urged creation of an international plutonium control system, and a register of nuclear weapons to be held by the United Nations. The initiative on non-proliferation comes at a time when concern over the possible spread of nuclear weapons has been heightened both by the refusal of North Korea to allow international inspections of its suspected nuclear capacity, and by the success of right- and left-wing extremists in the latest Russian elections. Mr Kinkel warned that developments in Ukraine raised the fear that a new de facto nuclear power might be created in Europe. His words came just a day after opposition politicians in neighbouring Belarus suggested that they too should refuse to return nuclear weapons to neighbouring Russia, in the light of the election results. At the same time, Germany's initiative amounts to a firm restatement of the government's belief that non-proliferation should be under political control, rather than becoming a military response to a perceived threat. In particular, Mr Kinkel has not responded to US pressure for European support for more 'counter-proliferation' measures. The 10-point plan says the UN has agreed in principle that nuclear proliferation is a threat to international peace and security. But it states that any use of military measures to prevent the spread of nuclear arms should be seen as a last resort, and should be specifically legitimised by the UN Security Council. The Kinkel plan, which will now be promoted by Germany with its partner states in Nato, the European Union, Western European Union, CSCE and the UN, calls for the unlimited and unconditional extension of the Nuclear Non-proliferation treaty beyond 1995. It suggests that the CSCE should be reinforced as an instrument to control regional proliferation, and that the CSCE model should be imitated in other regions.</p>

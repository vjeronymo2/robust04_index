			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop (3): Aggressive pricing / As PC prices have dropped sharply in most markets for three years, wafer-thin margins and shortening product cycles continue to take their toll on suppliers Over the past 18 months there has been a pronounced resurgence in sales by the large brand name manufacturers in the Dollars 66bn-a-year world personal computer market, reversing the trend towards the cut-price 'clone' manufactures apparent since the late 1980s. The top five PC manufactures all increased their market shares last year in terms of worldwide shipments, according to figures from Dataquest, the market research company. In western Europe, shipments by the top nine manufacturers increased by 7.3 percentage points to 54.4 per cent of the total market, in volume terms. 'There has been a marked swing back to the major manufacturers,' says Mr Chris Fell, director of Dataquest's European PC group. Although circumstances vary somewhat by country - for example, Vobis remains the top PC vendor in Germany - in general terms IBM, Compaq, Apple and Hewlett-Packard, are 'doing well across the board,' he says. Compaq in particular has achieved a dramatic turnaround achieving the industry's largest market share growth last year. The US computer group whose fortunes looked decidedly jaded just a few years ago, reported a 75 per cent increase in sales last year to Dollars 7.2bn. Worldwide unit shipments reached 3.1m, an increase of 98 per cent over 1992. Mr Fell attributes the recent advances made by Compaq and the other large PC manufacturers to several main factors. First he says, 'they never used to be competitive on price - now they are.' After watching as aggressive clone manufacturers grabbed market share during the late 1980s and early 1990s by building PCs using commodity components mostly imported from south-east Asia and the Far East and selling them off the pages of computer magazines, the big brand PC manufacturers, led by IBM, Compaq, ICL and Olivetti in Europe have finally hit back with 'clone-buster' machines of their own. 'If price is equal, these guys will win,' says Mr Fell because of the support and service they also provide. 'People may be willing to pay a small premium for service.' Although Chris Fell believes there will always be a place for the true cut-price 'no-name' assembler/manufacturer, he says many of the 'second tier' clone manufacturers have been hard hit by the more aggressive pricing of the majors. Second, Mr Fell argues the advent of the local area network - particularly client-server networks - has placed a premium on PC networking compatibility and on support and service. According to Dataquest, about 45 per cent of PCs were connected in networks last year, but this percentage is forecast to rise to 55 per cent this year and 77 per cent by 1997. Meanwhile, customer buying habits for desktop computers have also moved back towards established indirect distribution channels. Companies such as Dell and Gateway pioneered direct telephone sales in the US and then the UK in the late 1980s, forcing other PC manufacturers to follow suit or risk losing market share. However, in some markets including most of continental Europedirect telephone/fax sales never took off - and even in the UK the indications are that they have peaked at around 32 per cent of the market - 'direct sales are at best holding their own,' says Mr Fell, and the trend back towards indirect distribution channels - including PC superstores in some markets such as the US and the UK - is clear. Within the indirect sector, retail sales have grown from 14 per cent in 1991 to 20 per cent in 1993. According to Marketline, another research organisation, the average price of a PC in the UK dropped by 16.8 per cent between 1991 and 1993. But although prices are expected to continue to fall, Marketline says the trend is limited - 'what is perhaps more important is that the specification of the models available is constantly rising so that entry-level computers of 1993 offered features which were only available on top-level machines in 1990.' Slim profit margins and shortening product cycles continue to take their toll - on both sides of the Atlantic there has been a steady stream of casualties. Even so, PC volumes are such that no serious contender in the data processing industry can afford to ignore the PC market.</p>

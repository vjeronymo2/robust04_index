			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Leyland Daf van plant loses 227 jobs NEARLY one in five workers remaining at the Leyland Daf van plant in Birmingham was made redundant by the administrative receiver yesterday, with the loss of 227 jobs. The Birmingham workforce, which totalled 1,960 when Daf collapsed into receivership in early February, was cut yesterday from 1,201 to 974. A further round of redundancies is expected next week at the Leyland Daf truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire. However Lancashire County Council yesterday boosted plans for a management buy-out of the truck operation. The council said it was considering a joint bid with the management buy-out team for the Leyland site. The council said discussions were still only at the 'initial planning stage'. Under the proposal, Lancashire Enterprises, the county council's economic development agency, would develop the Leyland site into 'a business and high-technology park', while the buy-out team would concentrate on the existing assembly operations at the site. The plan for the rescue of the UK truck business received further encouragement from Daf Trucks in the Netherlands, which has reached an agreement in principle with the buy-out team to sell the UK-built Leyland Daf 45 series light truck range through its European dealer network. Mr John Gilchrist, leader of the Leyland management buy-out team, said last month the eventual success of a buy-out depended on the signing of a contract to supply the newly formed Daf Trucks. Leyland Daf said yesterday nearly 30 per cent of its output of 13,967 trucks last year comprised deliveries of 45 series trucks to continental Europe. A further 3,972 of the 45 series trucks were built for the UK market, while 1,384 trucks were military vehicles for the Ministry of Defence. Daf Trucks, the new company formed in March to take over the core medium-duty and heavy-duty truck operations of the collapsed Daf group in the Netherlands and Belgium, said it had also 'expressed its intention to arrive at a long-term contract' for the 45 series to be marketed through its European dealer network. Mr Gilchrist said the team aimed to complete its business plan so it could start 'definitive financing discussions' with institutions interested in supporting a management buy-out. In Birmingham, Leyland Daf Vans has already been established as a stand-alone business with the promise of support from 3i, the venture capital group. Formal negotiations with the receivers are expected to start soon with the target of completing a deal in the second half of April. The receiver said yesterday the latest redundancies in Birmingham resulted from a decision to cut production to only 200 vans a week from the previous level of 250. The company was producing 350 vans a week before the collapse into receivership.</p>

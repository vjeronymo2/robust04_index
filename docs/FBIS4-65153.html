			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today met U.S.  Ambassador Thomas Niles and discussed all national and Balkan  issues. Papoulias also met Van Der Stoel, the CSCE high  commissioner in charge of minorities. Correspondent Foivos  Karzis reports:    [Begin recording] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and the  U.S. Ambassador in Athens Thomas Niles this morning discussed  Greek-Albanian relations, the issue of Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] in light of the upcoming  talks with UN mediator Cyrus Vance, and the Yugoslav issue in  view of the Geneva meeting on Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Foreign Ministry Secretary General Ambassador Khristos  Zakharakis attended the meeting. Zakharakis will go to New York  tomorrow to meet Vance on Friday [12 May] within the framework  of the new round of talks on Skopje. He may also meet Matthew  Nimetz, the U.S. presidential envoy on Skopje.    Papoulias made a detailed reference to the Greek-Albanian  relations in light of his recent meeting in Zurich with his  Albanian counterpart, Alfred Serreqi. He emphasized the rights  of the Greek minority, the violation of religious rights,  education issues, and the detention of five Omonoia members.    The foreign minister explained the same issues to Van der  Stoel, the CSCE high commissioner in charge of minorities, who  is visiting Athens. Van der Stoel is expected to submit a  report.    Papoulias and Niles also discussed the Yugoslav issue. The  Greek foreign minister will represent the European Union, as the  head of the communal troika, at the meeting of the so-called  contact group that has been formed. U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, and  a representative of the UN secretary general will participate in  the Geneva meeting. The main goal of the meeting would be a  resumption of the talks between the three warring factions in  Bosnia-Herzegovina through the return of the Bosnian Serbs to  the negotiating table. According to reports, the Greek side  will again make the suggestion that negotiations be linked with  developments and the gradual lifting of the UN embargo against  new Yugoslavia.

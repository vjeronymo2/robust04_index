			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CINEMATIC SLEIGHT OF HAND;  </P> <P> THAT GRACEFUL RAIL STATION IN 'RAIN MAN' IS IN, GASP, SANTA ANA  </P> <P> Quick -- what's the location for the closing scene of "Rain Man," when Charlie  Babbitt puts his brother on a train bound east from Los Angeles?  </P> <P> Gotta be Union Station, right? Where else do you board a train in L.A.?  </P> <P> Wrong. It's the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center.  </P> <P> The station's tiled courtyard, curved stairways and graceful, wrought-iron  railings provided just the backdrop the scene needed, according to Robin  Citrin, location manager for the film, which is the odds-on favorite to sweep  the Academy Awards this week.  </P> <P> The film tells the story of the brothers' cross-country journey, and "we wanted  a real transition from coast to coast," she said. The Santa Ana station  "exemplified (the West) with its Spanish-style architecture."  </P> <P> Union Station in downtown Los Angeles not only was too cavernous and old, but  regulations there were too restrictive.  </P> <P> "They only wanted us to film at night," Citrin said. "The script called for a  daytime scene."  </P> <P> Also, Union Station has extraordinarily high insurance requirements for film  productions. California Film Commission director Lisa Rawlins said each star  working there must be insured for $10 million to $20 million.  </P> <P> "If you film on state property, the general requirement is $1 million" in  insurance, Rawlins said. "Union Station traditionally has required much more."  </P> <P> Once it was clear that Union Station would not work out, Citrin contacted  Rawlins at the Film Commission, which maintains files on locations throughout  the state. Rawlins sent pictures of the Santa Ana station. Citrin said she  chose it over several others, including Glendale and Pasadena.  </P> <P> The $17-million transportation center, on Santa Ana Boulevard just west of  Grand Avenue, opened in 1985, replacing an old depot a few blocks south, on 4th  Street.  </P> <P> Citrin said: "It wasn't too small, it wasn't too large and, to our  understanding, it had never been shot before. . . . It looked real great in the  film. It's always a plus to have an undisclosed location. It gives (the scene)  a fresh look."  </P> <P> Getting the scene was a coup for Santa Ana, which, except for the Old County  Courthouse, has few venues that make it into the movies. In general, Rawlins  said, the film industry considers Orange County to be "as far away as Miami."  </P> <P> The city is "just outside the (30-mile) union zone," Rawlins said, "so if they  come down there . . . (the movie companies) have to pay additional expenses."  </P> <P> Still, about 120 cast and crew members trekked from Los Angeles to film the  scene July 20. The scene lasts just a couple of minutes, but the crew spent 13  hours at the station getting it right.  </P> <P> A train was sent down from L.A. by Amtrak. A spur behind the regular track  allowed filming to go on without interrupting the regularly scheduled trains  bound for Los Angeles and San Diego, according to Israel Garcia, the  transportation center manager.  </P> <P> The station was subsequently the setting for part of pop star Tiffany's most  recent music video, "All This Time." Garcia is hoping that his building's show  biz career is just starting to bloom.  </P> <P> "It's good for the city," said Garcia, who almost made it into the movie  himself but, after putting on a conductor's uniform, was told he looked too  young. "It's something we would like to promote."  </P> <P> And how was the climactic "Rain Man" scene received in Santa Ana? Did anyone  notice the old town's gleaming train station up there on the silver screen?  </P> <P> "A lot of people recognized it," Garcia said. "They thought it was great. But I  was amazed how many people are not aware of this facility. They think we're  still on 4th Street."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY IN THE MOVIES  </P> <P> Other movies that featured Orange County locations:  </P> <P> "Gleaming the Cube" (1988) -- Balboa Pier, Irvine Ranch orange grove,  Woodbridge High School in Irvine, John Wayne Airport, Little Saigon.  </P> <P> "Heartbreak Ridge" (1987) -- the Swallows Inn, San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> "Sweet Dreams" (1985) -- the Westminster Herald newspaper.  </P> <P> "Frances" (1982), "Gideon's Trumpet" (1980), "Norma Rae" (1979), "Compulsion"  (1959) -- the Old County Courthouse in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "The Hindenburg" (1975) -- Tustin Marine Corps Air Station.  </P> <P> "Death Race 2000" (1975) -- Chet Holifield Federal Building (the Ziggurat) in  Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes" (1972) -- the stark, futuristic looking  buildings were on the UC Irvine campus.  </P> <P> "Rebel Without a Cause" (1954) -- the scene in which the teen-age drivers  played chicken was filmed on the Dana Point bluffs.  </P> <P> "All Quiet on the Western Front" (1930) -- the battles were filmed in Corona  del Mar, on land that is now the site of Newport Center.  </P> <P> "The Ten Commandments" (1923) -- Seal Beach was used as the Sinai Desert.  </P></p>

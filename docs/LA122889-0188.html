			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> YELTSIN NOMINATED FOR NEW POST  </P> <P> Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin is running for president of the Soviet  Union's largest republic, a Soviet news service reported today.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, who won more than 5 million votes in Moscow elections with his  anti-elite stance and calls for more radical reform, has accepted a nomination  to be president of the Russian Federation, the Interfax news agency said.  </P> <P> Voters in Ramenki, a town near Moscow, nominated him, said Interfax.  </P> <P> Yeltsin was dumped from his job as Moscow party chief in late 1987 for his  outspoken criticism of the slow pace of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  reforms. He was later given a state post in construction with the rank of  minister.  </P> <P> The 58-year-old former engineer parlayed his image as a fighter for justice and  victim of the party apparatus into a sweeping victory in March elections for  the Soviet Congress, when he won 89% of the Moscow vote.  </P></p>

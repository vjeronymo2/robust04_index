			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Has the British Parliament's Report </F> Proved?"]    [Text] Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of  the British Parliament published a report on Sino-British  relations. The report is a self-confession of how the British  side ruined Sino-British cooperation. It is also excellent  teaching material for Hong Kong compatriots to know the nature  of British colonialists.    The report affirms and supports Chris Patten's  confrontational policy and provocative methods of pursuing  political reform in Hong Kong and states that the British side  will act unilaterally in the remaining years of the transition  period. This clearly announces that in the next three years,  Britain will not converge with the Basic Law or devote itself to  a smooth transition, but will continue to proceed on the path of  the "three violations," set up illegitimate organizations (such  as a human rights commission) and various other obstacles to the  composition of the special administrative region and the smooth  implementation of the Basic Law, impose on the special  administrative region groups of people chosen by Britain and new  laws and a new political system unilaterally formulated, and  challenge China in the resumption of the exercise of  sovereignty. Reinforcing this line of confronting China to the  end is now intended to win support from parliament. It is also  intended to reduce domestic pressure on the Major  administration, whose performance has been unceasingly  criticized and which is heading toward a dead end, and shift the  attention of the British people. The British administration  thinks that by holding a confrontational attitude and adopting a  stance of protecting British interests, it will immediately show  an image of "being able to accomplish something" and will arouse  the nationalist feelings of the British people.    On the contrary, this only has exposed its weaknesses.  First, this has exposed the fact that the British  administration does not have powers of political analysis and  will only continue to forfeit Britain's long-term interests in  the Far East and forfeit the opportunity to develop Sino-British  cooperation and develop British economic and trade interests.    Second, it has exposed the administration's empty show of  strength. The less strength it has, the more it wants to take  risks. The outcome will be that its strength and timing will be  at a disadvantage in the competition and it will surely fail.  The report encourages unilaterally setting up the three-tier  councils and pursuing Patten's proposals, while admitting that  the British can do nothing to prevent China overturning his  proposals and reorganizing the three-tier councils in accordance  with the Basic Law.    Third, it has exposed the fact that Britain's international  card has failed everywhere and can no longer create the  scenario. Britain is attempting to organize "allied forces" and  launch a crusade on the Hong Kong issue. It has proposed that  the European Union formulate a common policy to deal with China;  used "human rights" and "democracy" as weapons in relation to  loans, aid, and trade agreements with China; issued threats; and  supported its stand on Hong Kong. But the international  situation is that, on the question of joining the EU, Britain  has been isolated from the European continent. At first, it  appeared tough on relations with other European countries.  Later, when none of its allies conformed, it drifted to their  side like a deflated balloon. Its allies do not care about its  complaints, and it simply does not have much influence in the  EU. The fact that Britain played the "international card" in  Europe by asking its allies to follow its policies toward China  and Hong Kong is just ridiculous now that it has not correctly  assessed its own strength and does not know its limitations at  all. France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Finland,  and Luxembourg are all busy developing relations with China,  doing a lot of business, and seizing markets. Moreover,  Portugal, taking a different path from Britain, is successfully  implementing the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and  negotiating cooperation. Now, Britain is asking for help from  its allies, but who is going to listen?    The British perhaps still cherish hopes about the  "international card," so the report on Sino-British relations  once again put forward plans and proposals in hope of success.  This is a signal and Hong Kong people had better heighten their  vigilance on the British Hong Kong authorities'  internationalization scheme.    The report does not take the facts into account when it  links  Sino-British relations, which are now at a low ebb, with "human  rights obstacles." Of the Western countries, Britain was the  first to recognize China, but did it ever consider "human rights  obstacles then?" Why were there no "human rights obstacles" in  the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's, when Britain maintained  good relations with China? It was not until Patten began to  pursue a confrontational line when he arrived in Hong Kong that  Sino-British relations worsened. The report, however, did not  mention these facts but shirked responsibility, so how can it  serve its purpose?    The fact that the report attacks Article 18 and Article 158  of the Basic Law precisely shows that the current low ebb of  Sino-British relations is caused by Britain's incorrect policy  on Hong Kong. Britain signed the Joint Declaration and promised  that Hong Kong would be returned to China and that China would  resume exercising sovereignty in 1997. But it is unwilling to  do so and is using tricky plans to prevent China from exercising  sovereignty over Hong Kong. Everyone on the street knows that  Britain is opposed to and is preventing China from stationing  troops in Hong Kong after 1997. Now, it is attacking China for  having the right to proclaim a state of war preparedness in Hong  Kong if it is invaded by a foreign enemy and if national unity  is endangered and has attacked China's NPC Standing Committee  for having the right to interpret the Basic Law. This has fully  exposed Britain's ambition of opposing China's possession of  sovereignty over Hong Kong in ways conducive to the extension of  its concession-style rule. This "country within a country" only  appeared in the former Shanghai concessions where the central  government could not station troops, could not interpret or use  Chinese laws, and did not have the right to defend its territory  and deal with riots, and such rights are possessed by all  countries. Only those in Britain who wish to throw Hong Kong  into confusion and who shield troublemakers would put forward  such absurd demands.    The report is very frank about telling us the intentions  which Britain has never told before. Now, Hong Kong people who  love the country and who love Hong Kong can see more clearly and  know more clearly what dangerous factors have to be removed in  order to guarantee a smooth transition and guarantee Hong Kong's  long-term prosperity and stability.</p>

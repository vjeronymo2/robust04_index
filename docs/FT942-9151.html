			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: EU eases rules for cross-border listings European economic and finance ministers yesterday agreed to simplify listing requirements for the shares of European Union companies that wish to be listed on the stock exchanges of other member states. The directive will significantly lower the cost to companies of cross-border listing by allowing some of the information previously required for listing, to be partially or fully waived by the relevant authorities in the host country. In future certain companies will be able to be listed in other member states without publishing a new listing prospectus. The move applies mainly to companies of 'high quality, large size and international standing, listed in the Community for at least three years and showing a good record of compliance with European Union listing directives', according to the European Commission. The move fell short of complete mutual recognition by the stock exchanges of the 12 member states but was, according to the London Stock Exchange, a 'significant step towards mutual recognition and very useful for smaller companies wishing to move to full listing'. The Commission said the directive was expected to bring about a more efficient simple market in securities. In particular, it would assist efforts by the Federation of European Stock Exchanges to launch the so-called Eurolist project. This aims to provide deeper and more liquid markets for well established European Union companies with international standing by listing their shares simultaneously in at least six member states.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: S Africa curbs tax speculation SOUTH AFRICA'S Commissioner for Inland Revenue yesterday rejected rumours that foreigners were to be taxed on all interest income, speculation which last week caused a sharp weakening in the financial rand investment currency. The financial rand declined by 4.5 per cent on Thursday, to equal last July's low of R3.38 to the dollar, as foreign investors withdrew deposits from South African banks in order to avoid paying tax. A fall in the financial rand - a pool of investment currency in which only foreigners can deal - reflects a weakening of foreign investor sentiment. However, Mr Hannes Hattingh, the Commissioner, said the impression that all interest accruing to non-residents was now taxable was 'not the position at all', adding that 'the long-established rules still apply'. He noted that so far as interest was concerned, the general principle was that income tax was levied if interest was received by, or accrued to, a taxpayer from a South African source. The source principle also applied to non-residents, and meant that the actual source of interest was determined by the place where the credit was made available by the creditor to the debtor. Thus interest accruing from a direct investment in South Africa by a non-resident was subject to tax. Market traders said the financial rand traded calmly yesterday following the Inland Revenue's statement of clarification. It was trading at a level of R3.37 just before yesterday's close. Mr Hattingh noted that there were two main exceptions to the general principle. The first was that interest payable to non-residents on stock or securities issued by the government, Transnet and any local authority, Eskom or the South African Broadcasting Association, was exempt from income tax. The second was that in terms of double taxation agreements with other countries, South African tax would not exceed an agreed percentage of interest.</p>

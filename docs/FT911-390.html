			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; the Family (Briefcase): The costs of a house that was never home ABOUT TWO years ago I was unwell and we decided to sell our fairly large house and buy a cottage. My wife bought a derelict cottage in Henley and we paid on a tender a very high price. An architect and structural engineer prepared plans for modernisation which were put out to competitive tender. The property market had fallen, the tenders were at least 50 per cent higher than we expected, I had got better and, in any event, our house would have proved difficult to sell, so we decided to stay where we were and accept a considerable loss on the property we had bought. Our accountant tells us that: (a) The Revenue may take the view that my wife was dealing in property (she owns our home jointly with me and has never dealt in other property during her life). This would involve her being treated as a trader and the loss could only to be set off against income during the current year and the indexation would be lost. (b) While the capital loss might be allowable on the indexed sale price of the property, architect's and structural engineer's fees would not be allowed. I asked the local tax office and they expressed the view that such charges would be allowable but, as might be expected, they would not put anything in writing. What would be your view? The fees even on an aborted project basis amount to some Pounds 20,000 so the matter is of some importance to us. (a) We think it unlikely that your wife's tax inspector would regard her purchase of the derelict cottage as the commencement of an adventure in the nature of trade, leading to a schedule D case I loss. Similarly, we doubt whether the Appeal Commissioners would. (b) The architect's and structural engineer's fees are indeed disallowed by section 32 (1)(b) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, because that expenditure was not 'reflected in the state . . . of the asset at the time of the disposal'. The counter staff at tax offices are generally fairly junior and lacking in experience and detailed knowledge. While they do their best to help the public, therefore, their opinions should always be treated with caution. Your accountant's opinions carry more weight than those of the counter staff at your local tax office, as you will now understand. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

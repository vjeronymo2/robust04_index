			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKING INTO THE '90S. A NEW WORLD IN TIME. WALLS FALL, DEBTS RISE,  POLITICIANS THRIVE, ENVIRONMENTS SUFFER-A LOOK OVER THE SHOULDER AND OVER THE  HORIZON.;  </P> <P> PICKING THE PERFECT, INCORRUPTIBLE POLITICIANS  </P> <P> To put current charges of Los Angeles political corruption in perspective,  consider the picture more than five decades ago.  </P> <P> When I was in my teens my great ambition was to become a Los Angeles police  officer. I had known officers and admired them.  </P> <P> Then the image of the police department -- and local politicians -- came into  question. A great upheaval happened in Los Angeles, following discoveries by a  brave man, Clifford Clinton. He was researching corruption in local government,  having hired -- and paid for -- a private investigator. The investigator's car  was bombed; the culprit turned out to be a police captain, Earl E. Kynette, who  was convicted and sent to San Quentin.  </P> <P> More scandals followed, revealing mammoth political corruption in Los Angeles.  Superior Court Judge Fletcher Bowron, in charge of the Grand Jury, looked into  the police department to discover that hirings and promotions were based on  bribery.  </P> <P> Police Captain Peter Delgado was charged and indicted. While on bail he escaped  to Mexico and later ran a resort hotel.  </P> <P> The brother of Mayor Frank Shaw and several people working with him carried  corruption into City Hall.  </P> <P> The climax was a recall election. Old guard out; new brooms in. Fletcher Bowron  became mayor and Los Angeles has enjoyed an essentially incorruptible city  government since.  </P> <P> Looking at the current criticism of Mayor Tom Bradley and other city officials,  anyone who remembers the past may realize that the transgressions by my old  Police Academy classmate are relatively minor compared with what we saw 50  years ago. I am not defending Tom -- he has admitted having made mistakes --  but in long perspective we can be generally proud of the cleanliness of local  government, in this city and this state.  </P> <P> When I was chief of police, my officers felt the biggest problem in the  department was the quality of sergeants. I would smile and say our sergeants  certainly aren't perfect, but I had a problem: Sergeants are selected from the  ranks of policemen. I think the same thing applies for the '90s in the  selection of politicians -- whether mayors, legislators, governors or  Presidents. We must select our politicians from among the citizens of our  society. We will never get perfect politicians until we have perfect citizens.  We can continue to fine-tune politics with ethical reforms and make  improvements, but at the same time we should recognize having the best example  of democracy in history and celebrate the quality of public servants selected  over the last two centuries.  </P></p>

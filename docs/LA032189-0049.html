			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Several thousand people demonstrated in the capital of Soviet Uzbekistan to  press demands that Uzbek be made the republic's official language, an official  of the Uzbek news agency Uztag said. The official told Reuters news agency that  the crowds gathered in front of government house in central Tashkent where they  were addressed by the republic's newly appointed president, Mirzaolim  Ibragimov. Ibragimov, 61, told the crowd that a special working commission has  been set up to look into the issue and said authorities want people to send in  suggestions on how to solve the problem. Russian is still the state language in  most of the 15 Soviet Republics but there has been pressure for change.  </P></p>

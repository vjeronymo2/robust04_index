			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Christophe Lamfalussy: "A Dangerous </F> Precedent"]    [Text] How can we fail to be touched and moved by the tears  of the families who watched on Thursday [14 April] as 10 coffins  returned from Rwanda, containing the bodies of our UN troops  murdered in such a cowardly way in Kigali?    Emotions are running high. This is entirely legitimate. The  politicians have felt the wind change, those who called for all  Belgian UN troops to be pulled out of Rwanda. Under these  conditions, it is not easy to press home a contrary point of  view. However, the decision made by the Belgian Government,  confirmed Thursday by Foreign Minister Willy Claes, begets two  thoughts.    The first is that it is not very diplomatic to force any  decision which is up to the Security Council. The 430 Belgian  soldiers are serving under the UN banner within an international  force.    Second, a withdrawal ascribed to the deaths of men would  create a dangerous precedent. Who would then not be tempted to  lay into UN troops if there was any certainty that they would  withdraw under pressure of their public opinion? We have more  than 1,000 soldiers in the former Yugoslavia, and tensions are  running high.    Nonetheless, the murder of our soldiers in Rwanda raises a  much larger question concerning the UN mandate. The famous duty  to interfere, a product of 1980's humanism, no longer holds  water.    The countries of the West agreed to keep the peace and  manage  the provision of humanitarian aid, but not to impose peace by  force. For the first time, Belgium is recognizing this  impotence, which is leading it to wash its hands of the drama in  Rwanda. So the message being received by the African people is  one laden with extremely serious consequences.</p>

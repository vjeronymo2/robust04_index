			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Water stocks active NEWS THAT the world's biggest waste management group plans a Dollars 500m listing in New York and London lifted Wessex Water, whose joint venture group with Waste Management International will form part of the flotation. The planned listing incorporates all the non-North American business of the parent company. Dr Angela Whelan at BZW said the US waste management market was several years ahead of Europe in terms of environmental legislation and commercial development. 'The move for a listing sends a very strong signal that Waste Management sees considerable growth in the European market,' she said. Wessex gained 12 to 412p. Elsewhere, sentiment turned against the water utilities, as traders and analysts considered the sector's recent surge - it outperformed the Footsie by 6 per cent in January - overdone. County NatWest changed from a buy to a hold on the sector, analyst Mr Robert Miller arguing that 'the upside is limited until the election outcome is clearer.' However, he is moving to a sell on Thames Water, believing its recent outperformance to have gone too far. Thames lost 3 to 368p. Courtaulds hit Chemicals and fibres group Courtaulds fell sharply after one UK agency broker expressed caution on the outlook, other City analysts cut profit forecasts and the shares were hit by profit-taking following a two-day presentation by the company at the Gleneagles hotel in Scotland. James Capel remained convinced that the stock was expensive relative to others in the sector and reiterated to clients its 'weak hold' stance, first published in September. At that time, Capels also featured BOC and Mr David Ingles of the house chemicals team said yesterday: 'We think they are both good companies but Courtaulds is a little expensive while BOC is a little cheap.' BOC, helped by a stock squeeze ahead of first quarter results on February 13, rose 10 to 648p. A number of securities houses marked their return from Scotland by shaving profit forecasts after Courtaulds had signalled that profits for the year to March 1992 would be no higher than Pounds 200m. For instance, Hoare Govett came back by Pounds 5m to Pounds 200m despite being a buyer of the stock. Finally, there was profit-taking following a 22p rise in the stock over the past fortnight. The shares fell 12 to 522p. Granada upset The resignation of Mr David Plowright, executive chairman of Granada TV, caused consternation but no instant consensus in the market over the implications for the performance of parent Granada Group. Although the market had been alerted to boardroom unrest for several weeks, the resignation came as a shock, particularly as Mr Plowright was due to retire at the end of the year. One leading analyst criticised chief executive Mr Gerry Robinson for 'rocking the boat'. Large shareholders also expressed unease at the upheaval. However, others in the market believed the move strengthens Mr Robinson's hand in tackling Granada's financial problems. The shares eased a penny to 223p. Allied-Lyons fell 10 to 639p following a report that the Office of Fair Trading would still count as tied 734 pubs which the brewer plans to lease to Brent Walker. The report resulted in Warburg Securities cutting its estimate of Allied's profits this year by Pounds 20m to Pounds 630m and next year by Pounds 33m to Pounds 700m. Berisford International was one of the most actively-traded stocks yesterday after the new chief executive, Mr Alan Bowkett, bought Pounds 1m worth of stock. The shares gained gained 2 to 26p on turnover of 11m. Tightly-traded Wellcome jumped 24 to 1173p after announcing that interim analysis of a Wellcome study supports the use of its Aids treatment Retrovir at an earlier stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Over a two-year period Retrovir can halve the likelihood of disease progression for people infected with HIV but who are still healthy, according to newly available data, the firm said. Profit-taking left Thorn-EMI 15 off at 826p. The shares had risen on Friday after the group announced plans to rationalise its electrical retailing operations. Yesterday's fall was stemmed by news of Thorn's Pounds 31m purchase of a US rent-to-own group, a move which will strengthen its hold in the sector. Speculation that Monument Oil &amp; Gas might bid for Premier Consolidated lifted the latter 2 1/2 to 30p and left the former slightly easier at 36p. Fisons fell 7 to 387p after securities houses advised profit-taking as bid rumours dimmed. Last week persistent speculation suggested that Hanson (off 4 at 205p) might bid for Fisons or make a joint offer with Medeva (off 2 at 274p). Buying ahead of the figures on February 12 continued in Reuters and pushed the shares up by 11 to 1139p. A cut in profit forecasts by one US securities house hung over Royal Bank of Scotland, which lost 5 to 161p. The house reduced its estimate for the year to March 1992 by Pounds 35m to Pounds 140m and for the forthcoming year by Pounds 90m to Pounds 200m. The cuts reflect lack of profits in the bank's English operations and do not take into account bad debts, expected to be around Pounds 295m. The house also adopted a more bearish stance on the shares. Profit-taking took the wind from Rank Organisation's sails, the shares losing 6 to 665p. There was also talk of brokers switching to Ladbroke, with the feeling that the shares represent good value in the lead-up to the leisure group's results in April, and with the possibility of an increased dividend. Yesterday UBS moved its stance on Ladbroke to a buy. The shares lost 4 to 210p. Leading property shares fell on fears that the possibility of an interest rate cut was fading. British Land lost 5 to 268p, Hammerson 'A' fell 9 to 498p, while MEPC slipped 7 to 377p. National Power and PowerGen were each squeezed 5 higher on a shortage of stock. PowerGen closed at 243p and National Power ended at 232p. Acquisitive conglomerate Tomkins jumped 9 to 441p after UBS Phillips and Drew reiterated its positive recommendation on the stock. Mr Jack Jones at the securities house said the company had 'a strong balance sheet and cash flow and is well placed for further acquisitions.' Worries over the dividend continued to overhang BET, down another 5 to 146p. Profit-taking and a forecast cut from SG Warburg hit Siebe. The shares lost 16 to 563p after the broker was reported to have reduced current-year estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 150m. The following year's figure was cut by Pounds 20m to Pounds 180m and Warburg cited weakness in the US economy where Siebe derives over 40 per cent of its sales. Turnover reached 1.8m. TI Group continued weak after a negative report from brokers Williams de Broe on the company's accounting practices. The shares gave up another 17 to 580p. James Wilkes added 5 to 182p after Petrocon Group announced a Pounds 36.6m bid for the company. Petrocon closed unchanged at 46p. Securiguard jumped 17 to 136p after reporting a 30 per cent improvement in profits. The FT's London Share Service now carries Investment Trust share prices in two separate categories. Those companies designated as investment trusts by the UK Inland Revenue under rule 842 of the Income and Corporation Tax Act 1988 - all those shown under the Investment Trusts heading in the past - will be listed as Investment Trusts-Authorised. A second category, Investment Trusts-Unauthorised, will contain 56 companies until now listed under the Other Financials heading. Initially, daily net asset values estimated by County NatWest WoodMac will be shown for seven of these companies. In time, it is hoped to provide net asset values for all this category.

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (10): Battle in the Vale of York  -National Grid faces a baptism of fire BRITAIN'S electricity industry is about to face one of its first public challenges since its privatisation. It will happen at a planning inquiry next Tuesday, into a proposal to build 90 kilometers of high voltage transmission lines to take power from the new 1,875 MegaWatt gas-fired power station at ICI's Wilton site, Teesside. The power station, developed by a consortium led by the US Enron Corporation and including a number of regional electricity companies, is the biggest built in Britain for about 20 years. It is due to open in the autumn and be fully operational next spring. In order to distribute its power throughout the rest of the country, the NGC plans the longest stretch of new 400 kilovolt 'super-grid' built in Britain since the 1970s. However, it has aroused protests from no fewer than 8,500 objectors, including the North Yorkshire County Council and six other local authorities, the Council for the Protection of Rural England and the Country Landowners Association. Most of the protesters are incensed at the suggestion that the new super-grid line should pass through the Vale of York, at the foot of the beautiful North Yorkshire Moors national park. Although it will not prevent the power station from running, the hearing will be something of a baptism of fire for the privatised electricity industry as a whole and for the NGC in particular. The NGC is responsible for developing and maintaining the transmission system, a job previously carried out by the State-owned Central Electricity Generating Board, which, unlike the NGC, was able to coordinate the planning of transmission with that of new generating capacity. The hearing will, therefore, also provide a forum for the widespread complaints about Britain's lack of an integrated national energy policy. Wilton power station is only the biggest of the new plants due to expand an already bloated electricity generating industry. Several objectors therefore query whether the Wilton power station should be built at all. They point to the NGC's own comments last month when it published its third annual seven-year projection of demand and supply in the electricity market. It noted that some 28 new power stations have so far been committed to the high voltage transmission system, and that the excess of generating plant over demand would jump from 26.8 per cent in 1992/3 to 56.9 per cent in 1997/8, unless, as seemed likely, existing plant were decommissioned more rapidly than would otherwise happen. The statement reported a continuing imbalance whereby the south of England contained 55 per cent of electricity demand but only 40 per cent of generation. While not criticising any particular station, it added that the further developments in the North would probably involve heavy additional investment in transmission. Many of the objections to the grid line and the power station are of the 'not in my backyard' variety. Some protesters argue that if more power is needed it should be produced in the main centres of population where it is needed and not be transported over long distances from other parts of the country. The electricity industry argues that the Wilton plant, fuelled by North Sea gas, will improve the environment because it replaces 'dirty' coal-fired electricity. It also claims that it will produce cheaper power and will therefore be in the public interest. The Inspector will probably regard this debate as outside his remit and simply report it to the government. But the objectors have already anticipated this by accusing the government of approving the power station without the correct procedures. The Council for the Protection for Rural England complained to Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana, the EC commissioner for the environment, a year ago, saying that Mr John Wakeham, the Energy Secretary, had breached EC rules by failing to make the transmission lines and the new gas pipeline the subject of separate assessments of the Wilton station's indirect environmental impact. If Mr de Meana agreed, that could spark another clash between Brussels and Britain on environmental issues like that over the controversial roadworks at Twyford Down near Winchester. In consultations over the super-grid extension, the NGC has tried to allay local concerns by offering a choice of final routes for the cables. It has tabled three alternatives for the sensitive 50km section from Picton to Shipton and another two for the 27km immediately south of Teesside. But that has not satisfied some objectors who say that the power should not come south but should be routed over the Pennines to North West England. The NGC says this is technically and financially difficult. There have also been suggestions to make the cables invisible by burying them. But this, too, has been rejected. Although there would be no overhead lines, passers-by would still be able to see the series of pumping installations needed to control the pressure of the insulation oil in which underground cables are immersed. All of which could leave the objectors with only the shape of the new grid line's pylons as a subject for discussion. Here, too, the NGC is trying hard to offer an unprecedented choice to the public. The current standard shape of electricity pylons still roughly resembles the Meccano-type structures designed for the industry by Sir Reginald Blomfield, a member of the Royal Academy, back in the 1930s. NGC engineers have now drafted a series of new styles, of which the least traditional is a folded plate tower similar to motorway lamp standards. More than 1.5 metres wide at its base, it requires deep concrete foundations. To build them in the countryside could cause inconvenience to farmers, and, unlike the slender feet of the existing towers, take up useful grazing land. In addition to the folded plate tower, NGC engineers have also devised a variants of the present latticed tower. Known as the L12, it is known among NCG engineers as 'Eifellated' because of its vague resemblance to the France's most famous landmark. It has upward-swept arms compared with the drooping arms of most British pylons. It is also lower and lighter than the biggest towers, the 50 meter high structures, which were were the mainstay of the last significant phase of grid construction in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

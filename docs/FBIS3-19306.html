			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov on  Tuesday [15 March] in Bonn described the Greek embargo against  his country as a danger to the stability in the entire region.  Gligorov, who along with Slovene President Milan Kucan was  invited to a Europe Dialogue Forum sponsored by Bundestag  President Rita Suessmuth, underlined his readiness for immediate  talks with the participation of UN mediator Cyrus Vance.    For two years, Greece has been trying "irrationally and  emotionally" to prevent international recognition of The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. The Macedonian  president once more denied any territorial claims on the Greek  province of the same name and emphasized the need for a peaceful  agreement. "Our objective is the Europeanization of the  Balkans," Gligorov said.    Slovene President Kucan, who had come on a private visit to  Bonn just like Gligorov, said that implementing the market  economy and full integration into Europe was his supreme  objective. Both presidents were planning to pay a courtesy call  on Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker on Tuesday.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Assyrian antiquity sold for Pounds 7.7m Headmaster John Lever of Canford School, Dorset, alongside a 3,000-year-old Assyrian bas-relief discovered in his school's tuck shop. The piece was sold at Christie's yesterday for Pounds 7.7m, a world record for an antiquity, well exceeding the Pounds 2.2m paid for a Greek vase last year. It was excavated by Sir Henry Layard between 1845 and 1851 and given to his friend Sir John Guest, who owned Canford Manor. It was built into the wall of a special Assyrian-style building which became a tuck shop after Canford Manor was turned into an independent school in 1923. The sculpture was forgotten as it became covered by layers of whitewash until identified by a US expert last year. The relief shows a eunuch royal attendant carrying a bow and quiver being anointed by a genie. It went to an anonymous buyer who was in the saleroom. The school intends to spend half the Pounds 6m it will receive on a new theatre and sports hall.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- The international  conference "Russia's federal structure and the implementation of  the principles of pluralistic democaracy, rule-of-law state and  human rights" opened in Moscow on Tuesday. It has been  organised with the participation of the Council of Europe.    "The problems you are to discuss assume special importance  at  the present stage of the formation of Russian statehood the  beginning to which has been set by the adoption of the new  Constitution and election of the Federal Assembly. Every  condition has now been created for the stable activity of state  institutions and for Russia's democratic development,  harmoniously combining the interests of the Federation and its  regions", Russian President Boris Yeltsin said in a message of  greetings to the conference.    It is important "to complete the formation of the  Federation's legislative structure, to ensure for the  Federation's subjects genuine independence in dealing with  matters in their jurisdiction, to adjust mechanisms of  cooperation and interaction of local and central structures of  power", the message says. "Stability and security in Russia and  far beyond its limits largely depend on how effectively these  problems are resolved in Russia. I hope Russia will be able  fully to rely on the experience of democracies in coping with  difficulties".    The fundamental law of the country "includes the federal  model envisaging the equality of subjects," said Boris  Pastukhov, Russian deputy foreign minister, presiding over the  conference. However, provisions of the Constitution are yet to  be filled with contents of law. "We are not going to copy the  experience of European states, but we should use everything  positive in it", he said.</p>

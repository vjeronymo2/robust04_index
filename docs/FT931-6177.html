			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Transport ministers in toll roads warning TRANSPORT ministers from Britain and Germany yesterday warned that car and lorry drivers faced the widespread introduction of tolls on Europe's trunk roads and motorways. They said raising more money from vehicle owners presented the only realistic prospect of funding the increases in road capacity needed to cope with the forecast growth in European traffic. Opening a Financial Times transport conference in London yesterday, Mr John MacGregor, UK transport minister, said the challenge to governments throughout Europe was how to finance the new roads their economies needed. He said the UK government would this spring be proposing the introduction of direct charges for the use of inter-urban roads to attract private sector finance into roadbuilding. Mr Gunther Krause, German transport minister, told the conference that Europe faced a looming 'mobility crisis' because of rapidly rising traffic flows - with Germany, the 'number one transit country', at the centre of it. The German government, he said, was planning to introduce motorway charges to fund new roadbuilding, so creating the conditions for a privatisation of the motorway network. The budget funds released by the new source of income would be spent on improving the railways.</p>

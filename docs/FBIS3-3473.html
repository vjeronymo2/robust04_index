They maintained that the national economic growth rate in  China this year will be slightly lower than last year's, but  will not go stagnant, if no serious natural calamities occur and  no major changes take place in state macro-economic control  policies. But, they predicted, the task to keep inflation under  control and solve difficulties for enterprises will be more  arduous.    This year the central government sets the national economic  growth rate at nine percent and will control inflation below 10  percent.    Though experts differ on China's economic growth rate this  year, a near-unanimous understanding is that, to seek a fast  growth rate, it is essential to shift priority from expanding  scale to improving efficiency. Future economic development  should be governed by macro-economic controls, especially by  financial policies.    Experts predicted that this year China's economic efficiency  is likely to improve, but not by a big margin. It takes time to  improve efficiency as a whole, industrial efficiency in  particular.    Wu Jie, an NPC deputy and vice minister in charge of the  State Commission for Economic Restructuring, said the economic  growth rate this year projected by the government conforms to  China's potential for actual growth. It is designed with the  overall environment of economic performance and tolerance taken  into full consideration.    "If we simply expand demands to seek a fast economic growth,  inflation will go up too," Wu added.    When China's economy entered a speedy growth period in 1992,  the growth rate of its gross domestic product was 13.2 percent  that year. In 1993, the growth rate was 13.4 percent. Fast  economic growth has significantly strengthened the national  strength, but, at the same time, has brought about some  conspicuous contradictions and problems, putting strains on the  overall economic environment.    Liu Guoguang, an NPC deputy and an economist, saw the  economy  as characterized by four "highs" and four "strains:" high  inflation, high industrial growth, high growth in money and  credit supply, and high price rise; and strains on transport,  energy supply, major raw materials supply, and funds.    Liu maintained that this year China's economic growth may  come down to about 10 percent and inflation may be kept below 10  percent.    Li Yining, an NPC deputy and an economist, maintained that  there should be a "relatively fast and rational" development  speed. Using a metaphor, he said economic development is like  bicycle-riding -- "a too fast ride may lead to a fall while a  too slow ride will lead to a stop."    Qiu Xiaohua, a senior economist with the State Statistics  Bureau, predicted that China's economy will maintain a  relatively fast growth rate. He listed five factors to back his  views.    First, high consumer spending in a populous country provides  necessary impetus for economic growth; second, the urgent need  to expand construction scale resulting from uneven industrial  development will inject vitality into the economy; third, in the  course of changing the old system, once restrained productive  forces will be released steadily; fourth, breakthroughs will be  made in absorbing foreign investment; and fifth, along with a  slow recovery of the world economy, markets will expand.    Qiu maintained that, while keeping a relatively high growth  rate, it is necessary to highlight a "healthy" economic growth  and give equal emphasis to speed and efficiency. Economic  growth rate should slow down in a proper manner to "land softly"  to avoid too heavy economic losses.    On strengthening macro-economic controls, experts said it is  necessary to bring under control investment in fixed assets,  which may fuel inflation. Economist Ma Hong suggested that  total control be strengthened and investment structure be  readjusted to use limited financial and material resources on  key projects badly needed by the country.    Economist Dai Yuanchen said China's economic growth is  supported by its massive investment in fixed assets instead of  being propelled by consumption. Of the 13.4 percent economic  growth rate last year, less than five percentage points were  propelled by consumption, Dai added. In his view, without being  backed by consumption, high growth will not last long.    As for this year's inflation, Qiu Xiaohua regarded the  situation as "grim," because last year's inflation of 13 percent  has left "upward" factors for this year. The unification of  exchange rates and taxation reforms will also have an impact on  prices, he said.</p>

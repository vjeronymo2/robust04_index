			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jihad Zayir and Rasmiyah Minwir] </F>   [Text] Mr. Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special  Commission, has asserted that his talks in Baghdad will focus  this time on an all-out, rather than a partial, lifting of the  sanctions, as was the case in the past.    In an exclusive statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH upon his arrival  at the al-Rashid Hotel, where he is staying in Baghdad, Ekeus  added that the UN Security Council is fully prepared to find  solutions to the issues related to the lifting of the sanctions  imposed on Iraq. Nonetheless, Ekeus noted, I do acknowledge that  our discussions will address complicated political and technical  issues.    When asked by AL-JUMHURIYAH why the statements he makes in  Baghdad on the prospects for lifting the sanctions are  optimistic, whereas the statements he makes on the issue when he  is outside Iraq are different, Ekeus said that he hopes that  rapid steps will be taken this time to lift the embargo imposed  on Iraq after he apprises the UN Security Council of the outcome  of his Baghdad talks, which he expects to be positive.    When questioned if he is aware of the fact that he is  responsible for the Iraqi people's continued suffering, which is  caused by the embargo and prolonged talks on Iraq's compliance  with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, even though  Iraq has honored all its commitments as enshrined in these  resolutions, particularly those regarding Paragraph C, when the  UN Security Council has failed to honor its commitments as  enshrined in Article 22 of Resolution 687, Ekeus said: This  time, I will make a personal effort. I will talk to all  competent agencies about lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq.  This will be a personal effort on my part. It will also  reflect my sense of responsibility toward the Iraqi people.  This is because I, from the humanitarian point of view, am  aware of what the continuation of the sanctions means.  Nonetheless, any decision on the sanctions issue is contingent  upon the outcome of these talks.    We posed the following question to Ekeus: Is it fair that  the Iraqi people should continue to suffer from the effects of  this unfair embargo, even though Iraq has all along been  honoring its commitments toward the UN Security Council? His  answer was as follows: What can we do? These are the results  of the Gulf War. We will try to find some solutions.    We asked him whether he is optimistic about the outcome of  the talks this time. He said: Maybe, maybe.    Rolf Ekeus came to tears when a glorious Iraqi woman named  Zahra' Yahya, widow of martyr Mu'izz al-Qaysi and mother of  martyr Muhammad, approached him with a photograph of her  martyred son, and asked him whether he recognized the child in  the picture. She addressed him, saying: It is my son Muhammad.  I lost him and his father, too. Do you know why?    Ekeus replied: No.    Zahra' said: My son was martyred when the United States  launched a missile attack on Baghdad in June 1993.    Ekeus said: I am sorry for this outcome.    She answered him saying: What do I have today with your  regrets? I will sue you. I will sue the United States. I will  sue the United Nations and the UN Security Council. You come  here to discuss the destruction of Iraq's weapons. Meanwhile,  you allow the United States to kill Iraqis with its weapons.  You have failed to take any measures against the United States.    Ekeus repeated his strong regrets over the loss of her  husband and son. But Zahra' continued to speak to him in fluent  English, asking him and the UN Security Council to take a  humanitarian position on the crimes perpetrated against the  Iraqi people. Then, Ekeus could not restrain himself any  longer. He came to tears and repeated: "Madame, I am very  sorry for you." Afterward, he left us.    Meanwhile, a Belgian journalist who was nearby, having seen  Mr. Ekeus' tears, commented, saying: Impossible. Is it  possible for Mr. Ekeus to weep and shed real tears? How can  this stony-hearted man weep?</p>

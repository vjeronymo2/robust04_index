			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEBANON  </P> <P> Lebanon erupts again, time to dig out the old inane cliches: Muslim-Christian  civil war, Syrian President Hafez Assad's role as a power broker, Syria's  peacekeeping role, etc. I wish to thank The Times and, especially, Robin Wright  for rising above that level and above the rest of the press in an article about  Lebanon (Part I, April 8).  </P> <P> While the violence in Lebanon repeats itself, relations between forces and  factions sometimes do change. Robin Wright went beyond artillery shells and  told us about some of these changes: that not only the Christians resent  Syria's presence, that (Christian) acting chief of state Michael Aoun wants  reforms (but not under the Syrian gun), that the principal Muslim factions are  on the sidelines in this latest round, etc. It was heartening to read "real"  news about Lebanon.  </P> <P> It was also particularly interesting to read about the too often ignored Syrian  role in Lebanon. The U.S. media at large have so far treated that role about  the same way the Syrian-controlled press has. Is it sloppiness or is it Assad's  long reach? I am not sure which is worse.  </P> <P> Thank you again for "real" news about Lebanon's latest nightmare.  </P> <P> GEORGE ELIAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

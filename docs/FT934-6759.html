			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Demand for Argentine power group share float Heavy demand for shares in Central Puerto, a semi-privatised electricity generator, led Argentina to increase the company's share price 8 per cent, one day before the local and international offer closed. Mr Daniel Marx, finance under-secretary, said the issue, which closed yesterday, was over-subscribed about 13 times. The government originally fixed a price range of Dollars 4.50-Dollars 5.00 for its remaining 30 per cent stake in the company and expected to raise Dollars 126m. However, Mr Marx said yesterday the government had increased the price ceiling to Dollars 5.40 per share, given 'a significant change in market conditions lately'. As a result, he said, Central Puerto's prospective price/earnings ratio has risen to about 13 years. Central Puerto was partly privatised in April 1992, when the government sold 60 per cent of it for Dollars 92.2m to a consortium led by Chilgener of Chile.</p>

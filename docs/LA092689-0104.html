			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL HEALTH;  </P> <P> BIG-LEAGUE CHILD INJURIES;  </P> <P> DOCTORS LAY BLAME FOR GROWING NUMBER OF ORTHOPEDIC CASES  </P> <P> Say hello to another phenomenon of the '80s: sports injuries in children.  </P> <P> Today's kids, who used to get their bumps and bruises by riding bikes or roller  skates around the neighborhood, are instead sustaining orthopedic injuries that  once were the province of adult weekend warriors: overuse injuries caused by  too much activity of a single type or over too short a period of time.  </P> <P> Doctors blame the disturbing trend of sedentary life styles and improper  coaching, but they also point to modern social phenomena such as the increase  in two-career and single-parent families, latch-key kids and fear for  children's safety.  </P> <P> Says Dr. Lyle Micheli, director of sports medicine at Children's Hospital in  Boston, "I hear repeatedly kids saying, 'My Mom won't let me go outside and  play. She wants me to come home from school, lock the door and don't go  outside, and watch television until she comes home from work.' "  </P> <P> Concern about safety and unstructured time makes organized sports more  attractive than simply allowing young children to get the exercise they need by  playing freely outdoors, says Micheli.  </P> <P> In addition, parents want their kids to be fit, and organized sports are a  solution. There are 20 million children in organized, out-of-school sports, the  National Youth Sports Coaches Assn. estimates.  </P> <P> No organization keeps statistics on children's sports-related overuse injuries,  and sports medicine for elementary- and junior-high school age children remains  a rare specialty. But Micheli says that at his clinic, one of the few in the  nation, overuse or repetitive strain injuries in children quadrupled over the  last decade, to about 400 children a week.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Childrens Hospital is seeing enough patients that orthopedics  surgery chief Dr. Vernon Tolo plans to set up a sports medicine clinic within  the next two years.  </P> <P> And the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases  in Bethesda, Md., is considering a major long-term study to see whether sports  injuries in young children are leading to joint problems such as arthritis in  adulthood, said Reva C. Lawrence, epidemiology program officer for the  institute.  </P> <P> The new kind of kids' sports injury might take the form of:  </P> <P> * The tendinitis of a 12-year-old pitcher, who plays in fall and spring  leagues, then goes to an intensive baseball camp in the summer.  </P> <P> * The painful spine in a slender gymnast who trains for hours daily because her  parents and coach think she has the right stuff for the next Olympics.  </P> <P> * The stress fracture in a young couch potato whose parents wanted to get him  into shape by signing him up for a competitive soccer team.  </P> <P> "If you have a kid who has been deconditioned by inactivity -- rides the bus to  school rather than walking . . . less physical activity through the day --  their tissues are weaker," Micheli said.  </P> <P> Micheli says such children face a double risk of injury. Not only are their  bodies unprepared for vigorous exercise but the nature of team sports tends to  cause them to stress the same muscles, tendons and bones over and over again.  "The bottom line is kids never used to get these injuries," he said.  </P> <P> He and others predict the number of overuse injuries will continue to grow  because parents want their children to be fit but often are unaware they must  prepare them for the rigors of organized sports. Part of the increase in  children's orthopedic injuries may be attributable simply to doctors'  heightened sensitivity to and detection of them, said Dr. Arthur Pappas, a  University of Massachusetts orthopedic surgeon who serves on the American  Academy of Pediatrics's sports committee.  </P> <P> But there has been an unequivocal increase, he says, in injuries to  single-sport athletes who specialize by age 10-12 and train intensively. Ballet  dancers. Figure skaters. Gymnasts. Tennis players. Swimmers.  </P> <P> "Those are the kids, who because of a total overload of their physical  structures, are more likely to start having injuries and musculoskeletal  complaints," he said. They "go off and start training when they're very young.  Most bodies aren't meant to take that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Preventing Injuries  </P> <P> To protect youngsters, most sports safety efforts have focused on trying to  prevent impact injuries. In football, great emphasis has been put on players  wearing proper padding, and "spearing" with the head has been banned because it  causes neck injuries; in soccer, competitors don shin guards; in baseball,  batters must wear helmets to protect them from being beaned.  </P> <P> Though baseball organizations have recognized one common overuse problem by  limiting the number of innings a pitcher can play (Little League allows six  innings of pitching per week), coaches and parents must do more to recognize  and avert the types of overuse or repetitive strain injuries now being seen,  doctors and athletic trainers say.  </P> <P> They recommend limiting practices to two or three times a week and to no more  than two hours (even less for the youngest children), and they advise against  letting elementary school children participate in a single sport year-round. In  junior high, there is increasing pressure for specialization, Micheli noted,  but he said it is best if children avoid it before age 14.  </P> <P> John Powell, an athletic trainer and orthopedic researcher at the University of  Iowa Hospital, said a player's slight limp or minor pain can indicate  "microtrauma," small injuries that can add up over time to cause serious  problems. The standard treatment is to decrease the child's activity level for  a few days to allow the body to heal.  </P> <P> When ignored, microtraumas can result in major impact injuries a few days  later, puzzling onlookers who observe of the child, "he wasn't hit that hard,"  Powell said.  </P> <P> Any sports-related pain that doesn't respond to rest needs a doctor's  attention, he and others agreed.  </P> <P> Parents and coaches, they emphasized, should not encourage young players to  continue playing despite pain. This can cause damage leading to joint  immobility, arthritis and other movement problems later in life.  </P> <P> "When a parent says to a child, 'Don't be a sissy,' the child eventually will  learn not to go to the parent, and will not go to someone when injury occurs.  They'll hide it, mask it, try to play through it," said Paul Grace, an athletic  trainer, researcher and coordinator of sports medicine at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology. "The long-term effect of that is we have an athlete  who has the knees or shoulder or back of a 40-year-old when they're 19."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anatomy of the Problem  </P> <P> Children's rapid growth, particularly near puberty, also makes overuse and  impact injuries more likely, research indicates.  </P> <P> In a child's skeleton, the bones still are growing. Growth plates at the end of  long bones in the arms and legs are made of cartilage, which is weaker than the  adjoining bone and more susceptible to microfractures.  </P> <P> Injury risk also increases during growth spurts that put muscles, tendons,  ligaments and bones out of balance. Micheli suggests, for instance, that tight  muscle-tendon structures, a condition that can occur during growth spurts,  increase the chances of stress fractures in associated bones.  </P> <P> A 1988 French study found that, among 11 soccer players with growth plate or  cartilage injuries, bone development was 15-16 months behind the child's growth  in overall body size and strength. A 1988 study at the University of Washington  found that strain in the quadriceps, the large muscle at the front of the  thigh, was greatest in boy soccer players who were tall but whose muscles had  not gained proportional strength.  </P> <P> Overtraining, inappropriate training or raising activity levels too rapidly  during those fast-growth times increases the injury risk even more, doctors  say.  </P> <P> Concern about overuse or repetitive strain injuries comes just as sports  programs for pre-adolescent children have instituted rules that have helped to  cut the risk of impact injuries, particularly in football.  </P> <P> Between 1980 and 1988, the annual number of emergency-room treated injuries  among 5- to 14-year-old football players decreased 26%, from 173,100 to  127,250, the Consumer Product Safety Commission reports. In baseball,  emergency-room treated injuries declined 13% in the same period, to 105,450.  Soccer injuries rose 7%, to 40,620.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Additional Safety Measures  </P> <P> Some studies have suggested additional measures in baseball and soccer to  prevent serious impact injuries, particularly among junior high school children  whose increasing size and strength raise the potential for serious harm.  </P> <P> These include chest padding for batters (children's chest bones are more  elastic than an adult's, so impact from a pitch can result in a fatal heart  attack); breakaway bases to prevent knee injuries in slides; and mouthpieces  for soccer players to prevent teeth injury in collisions. Some also advocate  protective eye wear for batters and soccer players.  </P> <P> Although such injury questions can be controversial, they are easier for  coaches and parents to address than overuse trauma: It's self-evident a padded  helmet will prevent a child's head from damage; it's less apparent that a level  practice field, appropriate shoes and the right equipment will prevent damaged  tendons or stress fractures.  </P> <P> A young athlete also needs plenty of sleep, at least 24 hours of rest between  strenuous activities (often more) and a balanced diet that adds extra complex  carbohydrates after a practice or game. Grace recommends: "We know that when  you perform a sport like soccer you do use quite a bit of energy. If you go  back and you start training in a different activity the next day, and you don't  have the proper fuel in the body, it's a cumulative effect -- which will foster  problems later down the line."  </P> <P> He believes every children's sports league should provide parents with  information about avoiding injuries through proper preparation, and also should  have a dietitian, athletic trainer or pediatrician who can answer questions.  </P> <P> At the same time, doctors and trainers emphasize that they aren't arguing  against sports for children. Properly done, physical fitness training gives a  child healthier bones and muscles, a stronger heart and life-style habits in  adulthood that reduce the risks of heart attack, stroke, cancer and other  chronic disease.  </P> <P> "There is certainly no clear evidence that organized sports are more dangerous,  or safer, than free play," Micheli wrote in a 1983 paper. "Children can break  their arms while playing Pop Warner football or by falling out of a tree, and  the relative risks may be similar."  </P> <P> Said Powell: "That risk, managed properly, is beneficial risk, not detrimental  risk."  </P></p>

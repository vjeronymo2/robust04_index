			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Even Anglophile continental Europeans tend to see the British attitude towards rabies as hysterical, and who can blame them? You might think from talk in this country that continentals were frothing at the mouth and dropping like flies. The Full Treatment (7.30 ITV) looks at ways animals can influence our health 'including how changes in the quarantine rules might affect the spread of rabies in Britain'. Scarcely at all so far as humans are concerned. In promoting its shock report on the motor car in cities, This Week (8.30 ITV) trots out that favourite statistic, 'cars in London's rush hour' (whatever that may be) 'now travel as slowly as the horse and cart 150 years ago, 11 mph'. The implication is that there was a golden age when Londoners raced around at 30 mph. When was that? And what is wrong with 11 mph? If you want to go faster you simply buy a big motorbike. BBC1 launches its latest bit of tabloid telly, 999, a copy of America's '911', which is what you dial for emergency services in the US. The idea is to tell 'real life stories of heroism' performed by ambulance crews, firemen and so on. Let's hope the British version is less ghoulish than its American model (9.30).</p>

"Missile threat" and "export of missiles" by the DPRK is a  false propaganda invented by those bent on stifling it by  military force, the analyst says, and goes on:    The U.S. bellicose quarters dislike the solution of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and are trying to gratify  their wild ambition for aggression on the DPRK at whatever cost.  The U.S. hardline conservative forces are scheming to deploy  Patriot missiles in South Korea and build a "theatre missile  defence system" together with Japan on the pretext of the DPRK's  "nuclear and missile threat". This is aimed at maintaining and  strengthening their military position which is in danger in  northeast Asia owing to the economic and military aggrandizement  of Japan and at tightening control on Japan and South Korea  under the cloak of "security".    As for the DPRK's defence power, it is self-defensive and  the  DPRK is a peaceloving state.    Missile threat is presented not by the DPRK but by the  United  States which is working to maintain and strengthen their  military position in Northeast Asia.    The U.S. hardline conservative forces must not miscalculate  the strength of the DPRK.    If they increase their military forces and dare choose to  use  strength, we will make a corresponding choice.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rabobank Rabobank, the big Dutch co-operative bank, reported a 10 per cent increase in 1993 net profit to Fl 1.1bn (Dollars 570m) and predicted a further improvement in 1994, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Lending expanded 9 per cent last year. Funds entrusted to the bank by account holders grew by only 2.3 per cent, which Rabobank attributed partly to a growing interest in other types of investments following the general decline in interest rates.</p>

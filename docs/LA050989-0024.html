			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: LISTEN UP: ON HEADSETS AND YOUR WORKOUT  </P> <P> Just when you thought you had your workout routine down pat -- from the right  shoes to the right music -- comes this unnerving caveat: Using headset stereos  while exercising may be hazardous to your hearing.  </P> <P> So says Richard Navarro, a speech pathologist and audiologist at the University  of Nevada-Reno who recently evaluated the decibel levels of 51 tape players.  When the stereos were played at one-third volume, Navarro found the average  level to be 85 -- a potentially dangerous one, according to hearing experts. At  two-thirds volume, the level averaged 96 and, at full volume, 108.  </P> <P> Navarro speculates that listening to loud music while working out compounds the  risk of hearing loss because exercise increases blood flow to the extremities,  decreases oxygen around the ear and increases the flow of adrenalin, making the  ear more vulnerable.  </P> <P> Manufacturers of headset stereos share Navarro's concerns, according to Bob  Miller, vice president of merchandising at Radio Shack in Ft. Worth, Tex.,  which sells stereo headsets. "It's probably a very good study," said Miller,  who noted many companies are trying to educate the public about the possible  dangers of playing stereo headsets too loudly.  </P> <P> Levels in excess of 85 to 90 decibels can produce temporary hearing impairment,  said a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck  Surgery in Washington D.C., an organization of ear, nose and throat  specialists. "Headphone radios often produce sound in excess of 100 decibels,  which causes reversible damage to the inner ear," said the spokeswoman, noting  that repeated, long-term exposure to high-decibel levels can lead to  irreversible damage.  </P> <P> Many personal tape players and radios are not safe, contends Navarro, and  buying more expensive models may not negate the danger. In his  university-funded study, the cheaper models tended to be safer because they  emitted fewer decibels when tuned to the same volume, he said.  </P> <P> Research audiologist Steve Otto of the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles said  Navarro's measurements sound feasible and are similar to those of his 1985  study of tiny stereos.  </P> <P> But Larry Royster, a professor of mechanical engineering at North Carolina  State University, questioned Navarro's findings and methodology. In his  evaluation of personal stereos, Royster found the average decibel output was 64  at 25% volume and 81 at 50% volume. "Ninety percent of people using personal  stereos play them at 83 decibels or lower, and 83 is clearly acceptable,"  Royster said.  </P> <P> How can you determine the safety of your personal stereo? Here's the experts'  advice:  </P> <P>  -- Carefully review accompanying brochures. Most manufacturers include safety  information provided by the Electronic Industries Assn., a Washington-based  consumer electronics group. Among the warnings, according to an association  spokeswoman: "Do not play your headset at high volume. Hearing experts advise  against continuous extended play. If you experience a ringing in your ears,  reduce volume or discontinue use."  </P> <P>  -- Contact the manufacturer for more information about a model's decibel  range. Otto of the House Ear Institute said many audiologists have meters which  can measure decibels.  </P> <P>  -- "Don't turn up the music so much that your heartbeat increases in response  to the music," Navarro suggested. "When you can just hear the music  comfortably, leave it at that level," advised Victor Garwood, a USC professor  emeritus of communication arts and sciences and otolaryngology.  </P> <P>  -- Finally, don't listen more than four hours a day at one-third volume, more  than an hour at half volume and never above half volume, Navarro advised. And  be prepared to modulate music when the volume is not entirely under your  control. "Some of my graduate students now wear earplugs at aerobics class,"  Navarro noted.  </P> <P> Rash Relief  </P> <P> Preventing the itchy, agonizing rash caused by poison oak and ivy may soon be  easier, thanks to a chemically treated clay that acts as a kind of Scotchguard  for the skin.  </P> <P> Called organoclay, the compound is currently used as a suspension aid in  aerosol deodorants and anti-perspirants, said Dr. William L. Epstein, a UC San  Francisco professor of dermatology who compared organoclay with three other  preparations commonly used to prevent reactions to poison oak and ivy.  </P> <P> In a study of 28 subjects, the protection provided by organoclay was  "spectacular," preventing breakouts more than 95% of the time, three times that  of the other preparations, Epstein said. He speculates the chemicals in  organoclay may bind better to urushiol -- the main allergen in poison oak and  ivy, thus reducing the amount absorbed. His study, recently reported in the  Archives of Dermatology, was funded by the U.S. Forest Service and the clay's  manufacturer.  </P> <P> Though not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration for prevention of  poison oak and ivy dermatitis, Epstein estimates organoclay may be available  within a year. "It's not a cure-all," he said, noting it is not meant for those  with severe allergies. "But it will help people sensitive to garden-variety  poison oak and ivy."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, old standbys -- such as calamine lotion and antihistamines -- can  offer some relief, said Dr. Gail Anderson, director of the department of  emergency medicine at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center. Taking a cold  shower immediately after exposure may or may not work, he added.  </P></p>

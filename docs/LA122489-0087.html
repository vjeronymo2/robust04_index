			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> POOR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS, RIGID WORK RULES IMPAIR IMPROVEMENT IN MAIL SERVICE  </P> <P> The scene is Columbia Heights Post Office in Washington, D.C. It is Thursday  afternoon, one hour before closing time. Seven people are in line.  </P> <P> A chatty clerk is admiring the new gold belt that a friend is dangling before  the cloudy plastic window that separates clerks from the public. "What are you  doing this weekend?" she asks. "Nothing," her buddy replies.  </P> <P> At the next window, a co-worker weighs a brown paper package and tosses it at  the parcel cart, missing on the first try.  </P> <P> At the third window, a customer taps her yellow pick-up slip on the counter as  the voices of clerks in the rear office seep through the walls.  </P> <P> "All Services," the signs at each window position read. No service, the Rev.  Alfred Owens fumes as he stomps out of line and out the door.  </P> <P> "You would think you would have more people. It makes me angry!" he says. "Once  you get to the window, you have no problem, but I never wait over 10 minutes. I  leave and come back. . . . I'll try again tomorrow."  </P> <P> Window clerk is a coveted position among the U.S. Postal Service's 800,000  employees. It gives the public a regular glimpse into the workplace culture of  one of the nation's largest employers.  </P> <P> Postal officials, fellow employees and outside experts agree that the service  needs to adapt to technology and change the way its employees interact if  productivity is to improve and financial disaster is to be avoided.  </P> <P> So far, old habits appear to be holding on.  </P> <P> Although the post office has spent more than $500 million on automation in the  last year, it has not saved money or improved services. This failure raises  questions about whether its rule-bound work force can be turned around fast  enough, or at all.  </P> <P> This semi-governmental bureaucracy is organized along military hierarchical  lines. Postal work is characterized by strong unions, rigid work rules and  powerful seniority rights. It is carried on in an antiquated factory atmosphere  that attempts each day to serve millions of customers for about 25 cents per  transaction.  </P> <P> "The more centralized an organization is, the more it takes a first-class  upheaval to change it," said Harrison Trice, professor of organizational  behavior at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University.  </P> <P> The current impetus for change is simmering discontent at all levels and an  atmosphere of entrenched habits and attitudes on the part of both management  and employees.  </P> <P> The disciplinary and grievance procedures outlined in the largest union's  contract have become a main channel of workplace communication, which at times  seems absurd. In Falls Church, Va., a letter carrier received this written  warning:  </P> <P> "On Jan. 9, 1988, you were instructed to have your mail ready at each delivery,  to take all obvious shortcuts and to walk with a normal gait; not to take  'little baby steps.' On Jan. 21, 1988, you failed to do so."  </P> <P> In Philadelphia, a new postmaster tried to reduce absenteeism by taking  across-the-board action against workers who were out more than three times in  12 months. When one clerk died on the job, union activists blamed his death on  the postmaster's work rules. It was later determined that the employee had died  of a drug overdose.  </P> <P> In Indianapolis, the postmaster ordered injured employees who returned to work  but asked for light duty to sit in a large, glass-enclosed room in the middle  of the work floor and read mail manuals -- an apparent effort to humiliate them  into returning to regular duty.  </P> <P> In northern Virginia, American Postal Workers Union local president John C.  Clements wrote members of his chapter last April: "I have noticed a disturbing  trend developing -- that desire to 'quietly' resolve out our problems. . . . At  the risk of sounding hard core, I must make the following statement: Labor  peace is management's goal, not the union's!"  </P> <P> The posture of the two largest postal unions regarding change are as different  as their two leaders.  </P> <P> Morris (Moe) Biller, 74, president of the 370,000-member American Postal  Workers Union since 1980, is an old-line fighter who has refused to let his  rank-and-file participate in employee involvement groups, which are supposed to  give workers a say in problem-solving and management of their jobs.  </P> <P> Likewise, when the Postal Service announced that Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. would  operate mini-post offices in its stores, Biller called out the troops. Union  members mailed Sears thousands of letters of protest, some of which contained  torn credit cards. In July, the Postal Service relented.  </P> <P> By contrast, Vincent Sombrotto, 66, president of the 315,000-member National  Assn. of Letter Carriers since 1978, is known as a reformer. He has embraced  attempts to involve employees directly in decision-making about their jobs.  </P> <P> At the local level, managers see first-hand the lack of communication between  supervisors and employees. Part of the problem, postal and union officials say,  is that citing one of the thousands of rules in the official work manuals often  takes the place of reasonable discussion.  </P> <P> "Supervisors don't know how to make decisions unless they can find it in a  book," said Phillip Tabbita, special assistant to the president of the American  Postal Workers Union. "Common sense goes out the window and good relations go  out the window."  </P> <P> Tabbita cited as an example the way budget-related mandates get translated into  work orders. For example, if headquarters decides that cost constraints force  it to keep sick leave down to 3% of any work week, officials will send that  directive down the line. At the end, the message goes out to supervisors on the  work floor that they must keep the sick leave taken by the crew on each of  their shifts within that limit. If someone is on maternity leave and someone  else has an accident, the allotment for the entire crew is used up.  </P> <P> Management "tortures the supervisors in the process, and they torture our  people," Tabbita said.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, the line supervisor can never stand alone and take the blame  for poor relations with their employees," Rubin Handelman, president of the  National Postal Supervisors Assn., wrote supervisors in September. "The blame  must also be pointed toward a supervisor's boss."  </P> <P> Visits to mail-processing facilities and post offices in Washington and its  Maryland and Virginia suburbs, in Philadelphia and in San Diego and New  Orleans, pointed up that, at its core, the Postal Service provides factory jobs  to baby boomers in a white-collar era.  </P> <P> The workplace, for most, is a noisy, drab assembly line for getting someone  else's personal belongings -- the mail -- in and out the door.  </P> <P> To get through their shifts, some employees said, they mentally remove  themselves from their work, which is limited to tasks strictly defined in the  labor contract.  </P> <P> "I think of my business I have on the side, or what the stocks are doing," said  Chuck Muller, 33, who sorts mail by hand in San Diego. ". . . I'm not even here  when I'm at the (work station)."  </P> <P> Felicia McFail, a window clerk at the main post office in Alexandria whose  supervisor described her as "the best in the business," lights up when she  talks about the professional calligraphy she does on the side.  </P> <P> Recently, a visitor clocked McFail and two other clerks at the window: 12  transactions in 15 minutes.  </P> <P> The pace was slower in the back room, where mail is sorted. One clerk was  re-sorting miss-sorted mail. One was hand-counting pieces of stamped  business-reply mail for refunds of excess postage to the recipient. Another was  trying to trace missing packages. Another was hand-stamping letters,  "Insufficient address."  </P> <P> Work life is complicated because the postal hierarchy is superimposed over  workers who have more formal education than their predecessors and may feel  they have a right to more direct control of their workday.  </P> <P> "Back in the 1970s, we never told the union anything other than what we were  required to do," said Deputy Postmaster General Michael S. Coughlin.  </P> <P> The Letter Carriers' Sombrotto said that in the past, "Management had goals and  objectives. They sprung it on you, you grieved, went to arbitration and  litigation; ultimately, they won if they were right."  </P> <P> To try to overcome the us-versus-them attitude, the Postal Service set up what  it calls employee involvement teams. There are also management involvement  groups for supervisors.  </P> <P> But progress has been uneven.  </P> <P> The process, said William Burrus, American Postal Workers Union executive vice  president, is an instrument to weaken the bond between employee and union, and  "a way to get around the collective bargaining process by talking directly to  employees."  </P> <P> Post offices and union locals have found ways to cooperate.  </P> <P> It was the union that pushed for and won training for new window clerks, and  that set up a nationwide task force on child care.  </P> <P> In San Diego and northern Virginia, the local presidents meet regularly with  top managers and join in occasional pep talks or gripe sessions on the work  floor.  </P> <P> Since 1982, the National Assn. of Letter Carriers has allowed its rank and file  to participate in employee involvement groups, of which there are now about  5,000. The number of grievances has been dramatically reduced.  </P> <P> While the major contribution of some of these groups has been as simple as  getting microwave ovens for post offices, there are also experiments in  self-managed work.  </P> <P> At one Washington post office, employee teams have taken on the jobs of their  supervisors. For a year, employees have come up with work schedules and  monitored daily performance and the general administration. Their post office  was recently honored as the only one in the district to have twice exceeded  minimum postal standards for productivity, overtime reduction and safety.  </P> <P> "It's working well," said Joseph Henry of the union's involvement team. "The  whole process of changing human behavior is a long-term process. We're probably  still looking four to five years away."  </P></p>

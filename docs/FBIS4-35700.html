The minister asked the chambers of commerce in  Damascus and the Damascus Rural Area to hold a joint meeting to  achieve this objective by enlightening retailers.    We believe that intensification of price control patrols  alone will not be sufficient to cover the capital and the rural  area, in view of their vast expanse and the huge number of  retailers, As for enlightening retailers about the need to  stick to official prices, this is something which can never be  materialized. Prices increase or decrease according to the  market forces of supply and demand, which apply to all  commodities. The retailer will not stick to an official price  list, even if there is one.    So what can the consumer do in the face of such a situation?  Whoever follows the market movements will observe that there has  already been a clear increase in prices since the wage increase.  We know, for instance, that the Ministry of Supply has so far  not announced any changes in the prices of commodities or  services, other than domestic transportation fares between  provinces. Still, the prices of many commodities have gone up  and the citizen is being compelled to pay the price charged by  the retailer.    The stability of market prices demands government  intervention through its commercial network and public sector  companies in order to provide a suitable package of commodities  for the citizens at prices which can complete with market retail  prices. We believe that the government has companies which  produce all kinds of commodities. It also has a sufficient  number of sales outlets and consumer cooperatives which can  ensure the stability of market prices. When the private sector  discovers that the commodities it is selling are offered by  consumer cooperatives at cheaper prices, it will be compelled to  charge a price closer to that of the cooperatives. Therefore,  the solution does not just lie in suppressing retailers who sell  at higher prices by intensifying price control patrols, which  will not be able to control everyone no matter how hard they  try, but also in the intervention by the government and the  numerous productive public sector companies by providing a  package of commodities acceptable in quality and price. This is  the most effective way to achieve price stability in the short  and long term. This way, we will be able to achieve two  objectives at the same time: Introducing the production of  public sector companies on the one hand, and ensuring  commodities for citizens on the other.</p>

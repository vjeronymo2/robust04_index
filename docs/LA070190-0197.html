			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: RENEWING LISTING WITH GOOD AGENT MAKES SENSE IN THIS  SLOW MARKET  </P> <P> QUESTION: Starting in February, I tried to sell my home without an agent. That  was a big mistake. But a friendly real estate agent kept bugging me, in a nice  way, so I listed my home for sale with her for 30 days. She heavily advertised  the house and held open houses almost every weekend, so I renewed the listing  for 90 days. The agent tells me home sales are slow in our town and there are  many listings. As my listing is about to expire, do you think I should renew?  Also, what can I do to get my home sold?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Renew your listing. You need all the help you can get to sell your home  in the slow buyer's market that prevails in most cities. That means there are  more listings of homes for sale than there are qualified buyers. If your agent  is doing a good job, stick with that agent.  </P> <P> Please remember there is a buyer for every home. But that buyer will only  purchase at his price and terms.  </P> <P> To make your home stand out from the crowd of other homes in the multiple  listing book, you've got to make your home especially attractive. One way is to  offer it on a lease with option to purchase. Another way is to offer attractive  seller financing terms.  </P> <P> Of course, I am presuming your home is already in tiptop physical condition. If  not, be sure to clean, paint and repair as necessary. Then price your home  correctly. Please don't make the mistake of overpricing your home in hope a  fool will overpay for it. That rarely happens.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seller Liable If Home Isn't Up to Code  </P> <P> Q: We contracted to buy what we thought was a three-bedroom home. But last week  my husband went to city hall to learn what would be required to add a family  room and a second bathroom. To his surprise he learned the third bedroom was  added illegally without a building permit.  </P> <P> To legalize the addition, the city will require complete inspection and  possibly removing some of the walls to check the wiring. Do we have to go ahead  with the purchase? If so, can we get the seller to pay for legalizing the  addition?  </P> <P> A: If the seller did not disclose the illegal addition -- and because you  learned about it before the sale closed -- you need not complete the purchase  because the property was misrepresented to you. The seller must refund your  earnest money deposit if you elect to cancel the sale.  </P> <P> Another alternative is to require the seller to either reduce the price by the  amount of your damages or pay the costs of having the room addition legalized.  </P> <P> Home improvements constructed without proper building permits and inspections  can not only be dangerous, but they hurt the value and resale potential of the  home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $175 Lien Holds Up Sale of $325,000 Home  </P> <P> Q: We have contracted to buy a house for $325,000. Everything was going well  until the title insurance company discovered a $175 judgment lien from a small  claims court recorded against the seller.  </P> <P> She claims the lien is not hers, but her name is very unusual, so I think the  judgment is correct. Is there any way to close the sale while awaiting  settlement of this little claim?  </P> <P> A: Yes. It is usually possible to close the sale by having the closing  settlement agent hold back an amount double the lien from the sales proceeds  until the dispute is settled. Please consult the person who will be closing the  sale, so a reasonable solution can be agreed upon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seller Not Moved Out on Closing Day  </P> <P> Q: We were supposed to close the purchase of our home last Tuesday, but the  seller had not yet moved out. The realty agent felt we should close the sale  anyway. But my wife said we shouldn't start paying on our mortgage interest  until we can move in. Now the real estate agent says we are in breach of  contract if we don't close the sale. What do you advise we do?  </P> <P> A: If the seller has a legitimate reason for not moving out of the house yet,  you could close the sale, but hold back from the seller's proceeds for a  month's rent at some outrageous rate, such as $100 per day. However, if the  seller is just stalling and does not have a valid reason for delaying the  closing, you may want to consult a real estate attorney about filing a lawsuit  for specific performance of the purchase contract. In addition, the attorney  will probably recommend recording a lis pendens against the property to prevent  a sale to someone else.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Owner Should Get Security Deposit  </P> <P> Q: I live in an apartment building that was recently sold. The new owner  verified my rent and lease, but did not say anything about my $500 security  deposit. I didn't lose my deposit when the building was sold, did I?  </P> <P> A: No. Sellers of buildings in which the tenants have security deposits are  required to transfer those deposits to the new owner. However, just to be sure  there is no misunderstanding as to the amount of your deposit, today would be a  good time to write a certified letter with a return receipt to the new owner  explaining you want to verify that your full $500 security deposit was  transferred.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Don't Prepay Loans When Interest Low  </P> <P> Q: We have a first and second mortgage on our home. The first is a 7.5%  interest rate. The second mortgage is at 9% and is held by the woman who sold  the house to us. We can afford to prepay either mortgage. Which one should we  pay off?  </P> <P> A: Don't pay off that first mortgage, because of its low interest rate. As for  the second mortgage, I wouldn't pay it off either, unless the lender will give  you a discount for early payment. When you prepay a mortgage you are investing  money at the loan's interest rate. Neither the 7.5% nor the 9% interest rate is  a good investment. Instead of prepaying either loan, conserve your cash for  emergencies or other investments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Seller Deduct VA Mortgage Fee?  </P> <P> Q: That new $184,000 maximum VA mortgage amount is a mixed blessing. As a home  seller, I was thrilled when a buyer offered me my full price for my home.  However, then I learned it is my "privilege" to either pay the buyer's VA loan  fee or reject that buyer. The realtor tells me it is against the law for the  veteran to pay his loan fee. How stupid. But I decided it is worthwhile to me  to get an all-cash sale, so I agreed to pay the loan fee. Can I deduct this fee  on my tax returns?  </P> <P> A: As the home seller, you can subtract the VA loan fee from the gross sales  price of your home. I agree it is a stupid federal law that prohibits veterans  from paying their own loan fee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Interest Deduction Only If You Own Home  </P> <P> Q: Since February I have been paying my father's mortgage payment because he is  unable to work. It looks like he won't be able to return to work soon. Can I  deduct the mortgage interest on my income tax returns?  </P> <P> A: No. Sorry, you cannot deduct the interest you pay on your father's mortgage  unless you also are a co-owner of the property. If you hold title to the  property and risk losing the property if you don't pay the mortgage, then you  can deduct the mortgage interest you pay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agent Should Help Arrange Financing  </P> <P> Q: About two weeks ago, our offer to buy a home was accepted by the seller.  Then we asked the real estate agent for recommendations as to which mortgage  companies are best for getting our home loan. He was not very helpful and acted  as if it is our job to find a loan. Shouldn't the real estate agent help us  obtain the best loan?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Smart agents know they can't sell a home unless they can finance it.  Most realty agents are only too eager to recommend local real estate lenders  who currently are offering the best home loan terms. Perhaps you can talk to  the manager of the agent's office for assistance in obtaining the best  available mortgage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Equity Sharing Not Always a Good Move  </P> <P> Q: I would like to invest in real estate, but don't have the time to deal with  tenants. A local real estate broker has a plan whereby she will match an  investor (such as me) who puts up the down payment with a resident who will  make the monthly payments. We will split the profit in five years when the  house is sold or refinanced. It sounds too good to be true. Is it?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Home equity sharing is authorized by Internal Revenue Code 280A. Both  the non-resident investor and the resident co-owner must be on the title if  they are to receive income tax deductions.  </P> <P> The non-resident rents his share of the home to the resident who gets to deduct  their portion of mortgage interest and property taxes on their share of the  home. The co-owners agree after five or 10 years the property will be sold or  refinanced with a split of the profits.  </P> <P> This sounds like a good deal for both parties. It usually works very well  between parents and their adult children where everyone knows and trusts each  other.  </P> <P> However, among strangers, equity sharing can lead to trouble. For example,  suppose the resident co-owner quits making payments due to unemployment,  illness, or divorce. How do you, the non-resident co-owner, get rid of a  deadbeat co-owner?  </P> <P> Since you can't evict them, if they resist, you will wind up in court. Some  equity-sharing companies recommend pre-signed quit claim deeds or other  devices, but they won't work if the resident co-owner gets a lawyer and fights  to claim part of the equity.  </P> <P> I would like to be more positive about equity sharing. But I've heard too many  horror stories to be enthusiastic except between parents and their adult  children where everyone has a family obligation to perform the equity-sharing  contract as agreed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protect Rights When Co-Owning Property  </P> <P> Q: I am thinking of buying a house with my best friend. We were in college  together, both are bachelors and have no immediate prospects of marriage. But  we realize it is stupid to waste money on rent. We can each put up $20,000 for  a down payment on a house we will buy together. It will be a very nice  "bachelor pad." However, if one of us should get married or have an out-of-town  job transfer, how should we provide for either selling the house or the  remaining co-owner to buy the other out?  </P> <P> A: Taking title as tenants in common is not enough. In addition, you need a  contract which provides for contingencies such as a buyout agreement or the  possibility that one co-owner must sell, but the other cannot afford to buy him  out. Please consult an experienced real estate attorney who will draw up a  co-ownership agreement which will provide for the possible problems which might  arise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Time Limit on VA Mortgage Eligibility  </P> <P> Q: I am a Korean War veteran who has never obtained a VA home loan. Am I still  eligible for a VA mortgage? If so, can I use my eligibility to buy a vacation  second home? What is the maximum VA mortgage?  </P> <P> A: Yes. No. $184,000. There is no time limit for eligible veterans to obtain a  VA home mortgage. However, the home must be the veteran's primary residence.  The VA loan limit was recently raised to $184,000. For further details, please  consult a local VA-approved lender such as a bank, S&amp;L or mortgage broker.  </P></p>

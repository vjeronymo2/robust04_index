			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Observer: Shear bluff Who's to blame for Glasgow's failure to get its new art gallery? The finger is being pointed at Michael Shea, the Queen's former press secretary and part-time spin doctor for Lord Hanson. Shea became a trustee of the National Galleries of Scotland after he moved back to his native Scotland in 1992. He never liked the idea of the new gallery's nucleus being the Scottish national portrait collection, which would have been removed from Edinburgh to the new gallery. Shea persuaded his fellow trustees and his chairman, the terse merchant banker Angus Grossart, to state in February that while they wanted the new gallery to go ahead, they also wished to leave the portrait gallery intact. That not only defused the row; it also made it easy for Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, to point out this week that the proposals not only lacked general support but also, by excluding the portrait collection, had 'lost their core'.</p>

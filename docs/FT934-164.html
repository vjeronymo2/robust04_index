			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / International Company News: Timken to take Dollars 48m charge as jobs go Timken, the US manufacturer of bearings and alloy steels, is to take a special Dollars 48m charge against pre-tax earnings to cover an accelerated productivity improvement programme that could cost 2,200 jobs over the next few years. The Ohio-based company said the charge would reduce fourth-quarter net income by Dollars 1.13 a share. Excluding the charge, Timken expects positive operating income for the fourth quarter and the year - for the first nine months of 1993, it had operating income of Dollars 12.3m on sales of Dollars 1.3bn. A Dollars 254m accounting adjustment produced a net loss of Dollars 242m or Dollars 7.90 a share for the first nine months. Mr Joseph Toot, president and chief executive, said the company needed to quicken the pace of its achievements in international competitiveness and increase its ability to gain more business. At current operating levels the accelerated programme would reduce Timken's worldwide workforce of 16,000 by 2,200. The charge reflects costs of about 900 lay-offs worldwide, with the rest achieved through retirements, attrition and cutting part-time employment. Already this year, Timken has announced the closure by mid-1994 of its bearing plant at Daventry in the UK. Its operations are being consolidated into the nearby factory at Duston. This week's announcement comes six months after Timken said it was resuming work on its new Dollars 120m plant in Asheboro, North Carolina. But a planned sister plant at Ueberherrn, Germany, which had also been postponed in 1992, remains shelved.</p>

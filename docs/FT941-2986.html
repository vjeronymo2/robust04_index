			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Cabinet row over Tube deal: Ministers warn Major to back financing plan or risk rout in local elections Mr John Major has been warned by ministerial colleagues to overrule Treasury objections to a new London Underground financing scheme or face the threat of a Tory rout in the London local elections in May. The cabinet is deadlocked over a Pounds 440m leasing deal to provide new trains for London's Northern Line. The scheme is being pressed by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary and Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. But the proposal - essentially a 20-year leasing arrangement - being promoted by ABB Transportation, a rolling stock manufacturer, has run into fierce Treasury opposition. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, insists it would represent a flagrant breach of public borrowing rules. Ministers believe the deadlock will be broken only if Mr Major intervenes. The prime minister has recently taken a tougher line in settling Whitehall disputes and he showed his willingness to overrule the Treasury when the government gave approval last month for London Regional Transport's CrossRail scheme. The ministers are warning that the issue has already assumed a high political profile because of the frequent disruption of Northern Line services caused by the breakdown of existing 30-year-old trains. The government is already bracing itself for heavy losses in outer London boroughs in the local elections. Ministers believe that the losses could turn into a collapse if the government is seen to reject the modernisation plan. The scheme has won support from a number of London-based Conservative MPs and the present deadlock has become a powerful weapon in the Labour party's campaign. It has secured approval from the government's own private finance panel. Mr John Marshall, the Tory MP for Hendon, yesterday used a Commons debate to step up pressure on Mr Portillo. The government's embarrassment has been increased by the fact that Mr Portillo has been appointed as the party's campaigns co-ordinator for the London poll. The Treasury secretary has also faced a barrage of criticism from the Evening Standard, the capital's principal evening newspaper. But the Treasury view is that the ABB proposal falls well outside its commitment to promote private finance for major infrastructure schemes. Mr Portillo has argued that the manufacturer would bear none of the risk of the project in return for its guaranteed profits.</p>

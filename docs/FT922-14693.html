			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Private prison on Humberside opens its doors BRITAIN'S first privately run prison, the Wolds on Humberside, opened its gates to public inspection yesterday before receiving its first official inmates on Monday. The Pounds 38m remand centre, to be run by Group 4, will eventually house more than 300 adult male remand prisoners who will be supervised by warders or 'prisoner custody officers' employed by the security company. Standards set for various aspects of prison life are well in excess of those in public-sector prisons. Stiff financial penalties can be imposed on Group 4 if the terms of its contract with the Home Office are not met. Remand prisoners will be housed in 156 single and 72 shared cells, all with en-suite sanitation, and each prisoner will have a cell key. The prison is arranged in the form of six self-contained houses of 50 prisoners each, with access through electronically locked doors. This arrangement is designed to confine any disturbances to a controllable number of inmates. Prisoners will spend about 15 hours a day outside their cells - in sharp contrast to most remand prisons - and can use their time on work programmes, education, physical exercise, counselling and recreation. Mr Steve Twinn, the prison's director, intends to impose two levels of 'prisoner contract'. One of these will offer a higher quality of life, including generous payments, to those who work and guarantee a higher standard of behaviour. Mr Adam Sampson, deputy director of the Prison Reform Trust, said it remained strongly opposed to privatisation of prisons, but many of the ideas being tried at the Wolds were welcome, particularly the amount of time prisoners were to be allowed out of their cells. 'However, it must be acknowledged that there are risks,' he said. Nine unions with members working in prisons were also critical. A spokesman for the unions said it was the 'height of hypocrisy' for the Home Office to ignore demands for improved conditions in state-run prisons while ensuring such facilities for the Wolds.</p>

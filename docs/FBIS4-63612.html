			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- Russian ultra-nationalist  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy accused the Russia's Choice and Yabloko  blocs of using foreign funds in their election campaign in  December 1993.    Speaking on Russian television on Monday, Zhirinovskiy said  Russia's Choice and the Yabloko Bloc received money from foreign  organisations, claiming that he had obtained this information  from a report of the Central Electoral Commission.    Zhirinovskiy also denied allegations by political analyst  Nikolay Svanidze that he had allegedly paid the members of his  party faction in the State Duma 500 U.S. dollars each to support  the federal budget. "None of the members of our faction has  ever received any payment and never will," Zhirinovskiy said.  Svanidze did not provide any proof.    Zhirinovskiy said his Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is  "the most honest" party and members of its faction in the State  Duma "the cheapest" deputies, because they cost the state less  than any other party in the election campaign.    Representatives of Russia's Choice and the Yabloko Bloc were  not immediately available to make explanations.</p>

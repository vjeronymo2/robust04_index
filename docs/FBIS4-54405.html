			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- Documents from archives  of the Bulgarian Foreign, Interior, and Defense Ministries  concerning the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops  in 1968 were handed over to Czech President Vaclav Havel today  by Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. Daskalov told  journalists after the meeting that the documents contained  primarily an assessment of the events which preceded the  military invasion and followed it by "former Bulgarian and  Czechoslovak functionaries."    Havel said that today's act followed his earlier talks with  Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev at which Havel showed interest  in such documents. Part of the "national hygiene" is to know  better one's own country's history, Havel said, adding that he  would extend the documents to a commission of historians dealing  with the 1968 events.    Daskalov pointed out that the Bulgarian Parliament had in  1990 officially apologized to the former Czechoslovakia for  Bulgaria's role in the events. Asked why Bulgaria was handing  over the documents concerning 1968 only now Daskalov said that  it was probably because in Bulgaria is more bureaucracy.    Havel said that his meeting with Daskalov today served as an  opportunity for exchanging information on the current political  situation in both countries and on prospects for mutual  relations. He said he believed there were no political problems  or contested issues between the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.  The two countries hold similar views on many questions and  orientate their foreign policy in the same direction, he added.    Hungary was the first country to hand over documents  concerning the 1968 events to the former Czechoslovakia in June  1990, six days after Czechoslovak archive documents concerning  the 1956 Hungarian revolution were handed over to Hungary.    In August 1991, Czechoslovakia officially asked the former  Soviet Union for access to the Soviet Government and party  archives. In December 1991, Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia  Aleksandr Lebedev handed over documents concerning the events of  1968 and 1969 to Vojtech Mencl, chairman of the Czechoslovak  governmental commission looking into the period. The documents  contained reports which were sent by the then Soviet ambassador  to Czechoslovakia to Moscow and the orders from Moscow.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin handed over two packages of  archive materials to the then Czechoslovak President Havel  during his visit to Moscow in April 1992. The materials came  predominantly from the archives of the former Soviet Communist  Party and from the KGB.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Confidence falls among UK exporters CONFIDENCE about order prospects among UK exporters has fallen in the past three months, a survey by DHL, the international distribution company, shows. Its export confidence index, based on replies to its survey, stood at 51 in the first quarter after 56 in the fourth quarter of last year and 33 in the third quarter. The survey underlines how the weak state of many foreign industrial economies may hold back growth in the UK.

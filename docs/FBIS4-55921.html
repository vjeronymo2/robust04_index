			<p>BFN     [Text] Tel Aviv, May 22 (CTK) -- The visit by a delegation  from the Czech Defence Ministry to Israel has opened up  possibilities for closer cooperation between the ministries and  armies of the two countries, and has created a framework for  specific cooperation between Czech and Israeli companies in  weapons modernisation, Defence Minister Antonin Baudys said  today.    The five-day visit has seen the signing of an outline  memorandum on military cooperation. The Czech delegation was  familiarised with the structure, management and organisation of  the Israeli army, saw soldiers training and carried on a number  of negotiations with both state and private military industry  companies.    Baudys said Israel had a very good quality, highly-organised  and well-trained army, and that Israeli weapons companies were  offering the Czechs what they needed -- top level technology for  modernising the weapons and weapons systems used up till now.  Modernisation programmes would bring new jobs and would later  allow Czech companies to break into the world market, Baudys  said.    He stressed that no specific agreements had been signed in  Israel, and that cooperation in the near future would be the  subject of negotiations between companies.    Oskar Sima, director of a military repair company, told CTK  that one of the very attractive offers which had been made to  his company was technology for the modernisation of T-72 Soviet  tanks. An agreement on the supply of the technology was to be  signed at the end of May, Sima said.</p>

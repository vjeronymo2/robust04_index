			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Motoring: Bargains beckon CROSS-Channel ferry operators, notably Stena Sealink, are already carrying extra travellers eager to buy cheap drink in France, writes Stuart Marshall. From yesterday, weight and space are the only practical limits on what a motorist can bring back, local duty paid, from France. No longer will you have to trouble your conscience by tucking an illicit extra bottle under the seat. Customs' guidelines allow for 90 litres of wine, 10 litres of spirits, and 110 litres of beer. All you need do is convince them you are going to drink it all yourself. Even duty-free allowances are to be doubled - you can bring in what you buy on both outward and return voyages. The pity is that with Ffr8 to the pound, not Ffr10, hypermarket wines are not the bargains they were. But lager (under Pounds 5 for two dozen 25cl bottles) is still cheap. Stena Sealink, which offers day trip fares starting from Pounds 70 return for a car with five people, is featuring the Champagne-Ardennes region in its 1993 short break programme. Two nights' bed and breakfast in Reims will be about Pounds 80 a person in a two-star hotel and Pounds 120 for a four-star relais du silence, ferry crossings included. For a small supplement, visits to champagne cellars, with a tasting, are included. Reims is a relaxed 2 1/2 -hour (and Ffr170) drive on the uncrowded A26 autoroute starting in Calais docks. Edmund Penning-Rowsell writes: In Alice King's book A Bootful of Wine (Mandarin/Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 4.99, 192 pages) the wine-buying operation is planned in detail. Be sure to work out the car's payload and capacity, and how to pack the wine. A VW Golf hatchback with the back seat down takes 20 cases, a Ford Sierra 10 in the boot. King lists and describes 230 wines likely to be found in French supermarkets and provides recommended growers' names to be found on the label. Biggest savings are on sparkling wines: Pounds 1.83 a bottle on duty and VAT, compared with Pounds 1.11 table wines. Each wine listed is given the grape variety, its phonetic spelling and price band: inexpensive below Ffr20, medium-priced Ffr20-70 and expensive more than Ffr70. Buyers at cellars in wine districts must ensure that the green capsule conge is on the bottle top, as this alone shows that TVA (VAT) has been paid.</p>

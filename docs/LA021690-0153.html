			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN CONCERT  </P> <P> It was another scene entirely at the Laurie Anderson concert, across town at  the Wiltern Theatre. The general fashion effect was minimalist.  </P> <P> Many outfits looked as if they had been layered together after random visits to  thrift shops. There was little glamour and no glitz, but one definite surprise  -- a man in an ankle-grazing velvet skirt worn with a dinner jacket. Plenty of  men, as well as women, wore black leather jackets (Anderson, a performance  artist-turned-professional musician, often wears one, too) or flowing duster  coats. But some accessorized with splashes of color. A saffron vest, a ginger  scarf, cappuccino lipstick or cinnamon-tinted hosiery were reminders that such  tones do exist, even at rock concerts. Lots of hats, especially bowlers, topped  off this solemnly chic crowd. MARISSA ROTH  </P></p>

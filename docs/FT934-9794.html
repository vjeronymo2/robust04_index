			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Fisons' inducements inquiry focuses on West Midlands SENIOR managers at Fisons, the troubled pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group, were yesterday interviewing a regional sales director as part of an investigation into alleged illegal marketing practices. Fisons said its early inquiries suggested there was a possibility that some offers of inducement had been made to doctors to prescribe the company's products. However, it believed no money had been paid to general practitioners. The company admitted a scheme had existed involving patient treatment cards, which could have led to payments to GPs. The programme had been withdrawn and had never been authorised by senior management, said the company. Such inducements are against the industry's code of practice and could lead to expulsion from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and prosecution by the government's Medicines Control Agency. Mr Rick Tiller, West Midlands regional sales manager, was interviewed yesterday by Mr Brian Higginson, managing director of UK pharmaceuticals operations, and Mr George Battersby, the personnel director. A decision about whether to suspend Mr Tiller had not been taken last night, according to the company. Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, and Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals division managing director, are directing the investigation. Fisons said it would like to conclude its inquiry as soon as possible. The company said it was initially concentrating on the seven-strong west Midlands sales force, but would then ensure its country-wide sales forces had been behaving ethically. Fisons is undergoing a cost-cutting exercise called 'FFF' - 'funding Fisons' future' - designed to cut 15 per cent from costs. The programme, assisted by consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, is understood to have damaged morale. Fisons' complicated organisational structure may also have contributed to the ability of the 'rogue elements' to practise illegal marketing techniques. There are up to six layers of management between Mr Scroggs and individual members of the sales forces. Fisons' UK drugs sales represent between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the division's turnover of Pounds 410m last year.</p>

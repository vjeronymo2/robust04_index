The orders are from Grosskraftwerk Franken for its Franken II power station at Frauenaurach. The coal/gas fired extension is planned to meet the expected increased demand for electricity in the industrial region of Nuremberg in the second half of the 1990s. EVT will supply a low-emission steam generator and waste heat recovery boiler, while MAN Energie will supply a 605MW steam turbine.</p>

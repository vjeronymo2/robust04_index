			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Molson chief optimistic on first-quarter result MOLSON, the diversified Canadian brewing group, said beer profits this year would be hit by the slow economic recovery in North America and price wars. The group's special chemicals, retailing and entertainment operations, however, should do better. 'Our first quarter ended June 30 will equal or better the year earlier level, when profits were CDollars 38.4m (USDollars 29.9m), or 66 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 799m,' Mr Marshall Cohen, president, told the annual meeting. For the full fiscal year, Molson should improve on its fiscal 1993 performance, he added, when final net profit was CDollars 164.7m, or Dollars 2.76 a share, on revenues of CDollars 3.08bn. Molson, Canada's biggest brewer, last year abandoned efforts to develop a US market on its own and concluded a CDollars 350m deal with Miller, the brewing arm of Philip Morris of the US. Miller bought the US marketing and distribution rights for the Molson brand, aiming for a US market share of 2.5 per cent in five years, up from the current 1 per cent. Molson Breweries is 40 per cent owned by Molson, 40 per cent by Foster's of Australia, and 20 per cent by Miller. Mr Cohen said it would take between five and seven years for the full benefit of the Miller deal to offset Molson's smaller share in its international brewing business. He said that Diversey, Molson's international cleaning chemicals subsidiary, had overcome problems with integrating Du Bois Chemicals in the US. However, European, Asian and Latin American operations were doing well and Diversey overall now contributed more revenue than the brewing business. 'Diversey can be Molson's most profitable business and yet develop strong competitive positions in all its markets,' Mr Cohen said. 'We see an improvement in the US operations in the second half this year.' Molson is speeding up its five-year programme to build 28 large hardware stores in Canadian cities after two pilot units had exceeded expectations. Older hardware stores are being rationalised and overall retail results are improving. Molson also owns the Montreal Canadians ice hockey team which won the 1993 National League Stanley Cup, and the sports and entertainment outlook is favourable. Mr Cohen said the group's new strategy and improving performance should be reflected in Molson's share price.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Carbide ahead in cost-cutting UNION Carbide, the US chemicals group, yesterday said it was more than a year ahead of schedule in its efforts to cut annual costs by Dollars 400m. Mr Robert Kennedy, Carbide's chairman, said: 'Our workforce is slashing costs and improving operations so dramatically that we now expect to achieve our goal during 1993.' The company also posted essentially flat first-quarter 1993 earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 42m, or 28 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 1.19bn. Although the results were in line with the company's forecasts, released last week, shares in Union Carbide slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 19 1/2 at mid-day in New York. Analysts had predicted underlying profits of about 19 cents a share for the group before Union Carbide said its earnings would exceed most estimates. During the latest quarter, pre-tax earnings from continuing operations slipped to Dollars 60m from Dollars 69m a year earlier. In the first three months of 1992, the company had after-tax earnings of Dollars 42m, or 27 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.19bn, excluding charges for accounting changes. Including the income from discontinued operations and after-tax charges for accounting changes, Union Carbide posted a net loss of Dollars 286m, or Dollars 2.28, a year ago. Mr Kennedy said earnings were helped by improving volumes and cost containment measures, which helped offset lower variable margins for many products. The company expects continued pressure on margins and general economic weakness, especially in overseas markets.</p>

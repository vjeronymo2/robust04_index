			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Urals Russians put a new slant on making money MR BORIS SIDERENKO is a Russian entrepreneur who has given the concept of 'making money' in Russia a whole new meaning, writes Gillian Tett. In the Russian Urals, Mr Siderenko and other local businessmen have become so frustrated with the collapse of the rouble they have devised and printed their own 'parallel' currency. 'It's called the Ural franc,' says Mr Siderenko, fanning out a sheaf of elegantly printed banknotes. 'We hope to introduce it here as an alternative to the rouble.' The scheme sounds far fetched, but Mr Siderenko and his colleagues are in earnest. For as the economic and political disintegration of the former Soviet Union continues, it is not only the separate republics which are considering setting up customs posts and printing their own currency - but also separate Russian regions, like the Urals. Two million banknotes have already been printed on the presses of Gosbank, the state bank of the former Soviet Union, with a planned circulation of more than 50m Ural francs. This is tentatively forecast to represent a value of up to Rbs50bn, according to Professor Vitali Nayshul, a Moscow economist, and architect of the scheme. Reserves of hard currency and commodities (particularly iron ore and minerals) are being amassed to provide backing and joint venture negotiations are under way with western banks to provide further support, and a banking framework. Prof Nayshul expects the Ural franc to be brought into circulation in the Urals within the next two months - although he admits that he is not yet sure whether it will be used solely for trade within the Urals, or for particular commodities traded between the Urals and other regions. Spiralling inflation is the driving force behind the scheme. Faced with the increasing worthlessness of the rouble, enterprises and individuals are abandoning and are being forced into two options: paying in hard currency, or resorting to direct barter deals. 'It's easier to buy things with a train full of wood than with a stack of roubles. Factories want wood; they don't want roubles,' says Prof Nayshul. But hard currency is in short supply and barter clumsy and time consuming, even though many large enterprises now employ whole departments whose sole occupation is to arrange barter deals. The Ural franc scheme is intended as an alternative. 'We want the Ural franc to be a 'hard' convertible Russian currency, to exist alongside the rouble,' explains Prof Nayshul hopefully. However, he and his team have yet to convince sceptics that their 'currency' will turn out to be anything more than a short-lived example of the economic anarchy in the former Soviet Union. For, as teams of beleaguered Russian economic advisers are discovering, 'making' money is one thing. Making it credible, is quite another.</p>

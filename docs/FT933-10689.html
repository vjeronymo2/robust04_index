			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / People: Bridon: high hopes for a healthy future After nearly a year of management upheaval, largely due to illness, Bridon, which manufactures and distributes wire rope and engineered products, has found a new chief executive. He is 46-year-old American Ronald Petersen, who has lived in the UK since 1981. The last chief executive but one, David Allday, stepped down last September because, as the then chairman John West put it at the time, 'he has had to push water uphill and has had enough'. In an internal appointment, Brian Clayton took over as chief executive with the aim of 'revitalising group strategy and looking for a long-term successor'. Then, in February, John West stepped down as non-executive chairman because of his ill-health, to be succeeded by Derek Edwards, who, however, died suddenly last month. Hence Clayton, 60, steps down from his executive role, as planned, but instead of becoming a non-executive director, becomes non-executive chairman. Clayton adds that the company will 'in the short to medium term' be looking for one or two more non-executive directors. Petersen, who was picked primarily for his sales and marketing skills, was previously chief executive of Insituform Group Ltd, responsible for all the non-US activities of the American parent which sells systems for the non-invasive lining of pipes. Before that, he had worked, in North America and Europe, for Armstrong World Industries, which manufactures and distributes flooring and ceiling systems. With a total of 17 of the last 22 years spent in the UK, Petersen is characterised by Clayton as 'very anglicised'. While Bridon has been the subject of persistent bid speculation, Clayton says it has all 'probably been without foundation'. He says Petersen is on 'a perfectly normal contract with no strings attached'.</p>

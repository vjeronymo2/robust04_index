			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Senate delay on Somalia averts clash with Clinton PRESIDENT Bill Clinton avoided an immediate confrontation with Congress over US policy in Somalia yesterday, when the Senate agreed to postpone by at least a week a vote that could have led to a cut-off in funds for the operation. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, made it clear the delay was designed to give the president more time to resolve the administration debate on the next moves in Somalia. This entered its second day yesterday as Mr Clinton set aside domestic policy for the moment. Outside the White House political pressure continued to grow, with members of Congress demanding either that US troops be withdrawn forthwith or that the president come up with a clear statement of policy goals. The debate cut across party lines. A letter signed by 65 Republican congressmen demanded an early withdrawal, but Senator Bob Dole, the Republican minority leader, argued that 'this is not a time for panic'. Democrats were similarly divided. Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, while criticising the administration's fixation with getting rid of General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali factional leader, argued that the wrong global signals would be sent by a premature US retreat. Congressman Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, appearing on the same TV programme, contended that after the Gulf war nobody could suggest that US credibility was an issue. He said the US should declare a victory and get out. Opinion polls have also shown little enthusiasm for a long US stay in Somalia following last week's costly military assault on Gen Aideed's positions in south Mogadishu. Approximately two-thirds of those questioned in two surveys favoured an early withdrawal, though a majority in one believed US forces should continue to try to punish Gen Aideed. Both houses of congress last month passed resolutions which, though non-binding, assume greater significance in the current heat of the debate. They require Mr Clinton to lay out by October 15 the details of his Somali policy prior to a possible vote by November 15 either to endorse a continuing mission or to force a withdrawal. There is genuine concern in the administration not to lose the initiative on the main domestic legislative agenda - specifically healthcare reform, which had been proceeding quite well, and the North American Free Trade Area, where an uphill battle has been joined. The US yesterday reduced its UN arrears with a payment of Dollars 533m (Pounds 352.9m), including Dollars 300m for peacekeeping. This still leaves the US debt of Dollars 472m for the regular budget and for peace-keeping. Member states' total arrears were put at Dollars 1.7bn, including Dollars 1.2bn for peacekeeping.</p>

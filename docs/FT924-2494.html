			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: We're all in it together, Major tells EC leaders - The British premier's handling of the summit, where he won unexpected praise from the French THERE was one simple premise underlying Mr John Major's handling of the summit yesterday: the price of failure for Europe would be as great as, if not greater than, it would be for Britain. Put another way, he needed a successful outcome to cope with the deep ambivalence within the Conservative party over Britain's place in Europe. But his continental partners needed the same success to re-establish their own confidence in the direction for the Community set at Maastricht. By last night the signs were that the message had been absorbed by most if not all of the EC leaders in Edinburgh. The prime minister cast himself as the honest broker, committed to putting the community of interest above the differences dividing fellow heads of state. The strategy was only partially successful. Mr Jacques Delors did not disguise his irritation with the minimalist British approach to the expansion of the Community budget. Germany was joined by Spain, Portugal and a number of other countries in demanding that Mr Major set a mid-1993 deadline for British ratification of Maastricht. He could not. But if the events of the past few months have indeed left Britain, along with Denmark, pulled along precariously on the Community's coat-tails, Mr Major was adept enough in Edinburgh to hide the reality. Around the national briefing rooms in the press centre there were few of the familiar charges that Britain had once again found itself on the wrong side of an 11 to 1 split. Even talk of a 10 to 2 division tended to be sotto voce. To the delight of British officials Mr Major found himself the beneficiary of a inexplicable charm offensive by President Francois Mitterrand. First Mr Mitterrand broke the habit of a lifetime and arrived early at the summit to have dinner with his host. Then he spoke kindly of a British prime minister. French ministers have spent weeks pouring scorn on Britain's handling of the presidency. Mr Mitterrand - perhaps because French views on Denmark, the budget and enlargement have more in common with London's than he would care to admit - has now told the same ministers to substitute praise for insults. He led the way, describing the UK compromise on the Danish question as subtle and skilful. Chancellor Helmut Kohl voiced serious reservations on the formula for Denmark. But in return for Mr Major's private assurance that a successful summit would pave the way for the return of the Maastricht bill to the House of Commons early in the New Year, he seemed disinclined to stand in the way of an agreement. The prime minister has been at pains to make it clear to his counterparts that eventual ratification at Westminster lies in their hands at much as his. The harder they make life for him, the harder he will find it to defeat the Tory Euro-sceptics. So for all the ritual hand-wringing yesterday by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister responsible for Europe, and the real anger of Spain over the budget proposals, the prime minister appeared convinced that a deal could be struck before the summit winds up later today. His threat to keep the leaders in Holyrood Palace throughout the afternoon and evening should help to concentrate minds on agreeent. Britain's argument that it was time for the Community to resolve its internal squabbles carried more force than hitherto. Traditionally, the British case for a more outward-looking Community has provoked the justifiable suspicion that it was seeking merely to obstruct closer integration. With Russia on the verge of another coup, the conflict in Bosnia theatening to engulf the Balkans and a new president about to enter the White House, the case for looking outwards rather than inwards is compelling. So too is the threat from the financial markets - underlined again yesterday - that continued paralysis in the Community will be a useful excuse to renew their onslaught on the European exchange rate mechanism. There is thus an attractive logic to Mr Major's view that those in the vanguard of European integration share for the moment a coincidence of interest with those in the rear. The events of the past few months have halted the conveyor belt to federalism. European governments have been left groping for an alternative. But there is also an important caveat. If Edinburgh does produce something that can be hailed as a success Mr Major cannot delay indefinitely. His partners will have offered him a breathing space to catch up. But no one in Edinburgh was in any doubt yesterday that the rest of Europe will not wait forever - for Denmark or for Britain.</p>

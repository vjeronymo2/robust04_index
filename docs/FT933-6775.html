			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Attack on lethargy of inmates at privatised prison INMATES at Britain's first privatised prison, run by Group 4, laze about for much of the day or play table-tennis, while many are thought to take large quantities of hard drugs, the chief inspector of prisons reports today. Judge Stephen Tumim praised the staff of Wolds Remand Prison, in east Yorkshire - the only prison operating exclusively as a remand centre for adult males in England and Wales - for providing a high-calibre service to prisoners that costs the taxpayer Pounds 5m a year. But the judge and his team of 13 attacked the 'lethargy' among the prison's 320 inmates. This was due to the fact that the 171 prison staff - who address the inmates as Mr - could 'not make the unconvicted work'. Judge Tumim's critical comments follow the controversy over recently leaked Home Office documents which suggested that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, thought prisons were not 'austere' enough, and that prisoners enjoyed 'standards of comfort which many taxpayers would find hard to understand'. He contrasts the lethargy of life in the Wolds with the 'excellence' of its facilities. Cells - to which inmates had keys - were light and spacious; meals were wholesome and ample; and visits were allowed 365 days a year. 'At the Wolds, inmates lie abed more or less as long as they wish,' he observed. 'Few of them go to breakfast or use the excellent facilities for physical and mental education. There is little work and much pottering about. They play a little pool and table tennis. If the sun is out, they bask.' The only way to prevent the lethargy becoming 'corrupting' was to include sentenced prisoners at the Wolds, according to one of his 102 recommendations. Staff at mixed prisons were better able to encourage involvement in activities. Mr Derek Lewis, the prison service director-general, said he would implement this recommendation. But he denied that an absence of systems for checking the financial aspects of the contract between Group 4 and the Home Office was a 'serious weakness'. Mr Lewis said two prison service staff were at the Wolds to ensure taxpayers' money was well spent. But Mr Stephen Shaw, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, agreed with Judge Tumim that the lack of financial monitoring of the remand prison was 'alarming' given the government's determination to press ahead with privatisation. For Group 4, Mr Jim Harrower, the managing director of UK operations, said he was pleased Judge Tumim had recognised the quality of staff. Certain areas, such as the drugs problem, were being addressed, he said. Wolds Remand Prison, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, Home Office, Pounds 1.50.</p>

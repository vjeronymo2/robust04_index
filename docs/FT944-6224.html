			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): Education director Leisha Fullick, 48: director of education, London Borough of Lewisham. Earns: Pounds 60,000. Politics: Not allowed to say. Wanted: 'A move away from the kind of society which was created in the 1980s when the creation of private wealth was put above public facilities.' Said yesterday: 'There was no sense of a feelgood factor. We are constantly told the economy is improving but there was no recognition of this in the Budget. In particular, I would like to have seen him do something about the VAT on fuel. If we are to find alternative forms of transport and get cars off the road, then the current increase in petrol prices will not be enough. I was glad to hear of the increase in education spending, but I would like more details on where the money is to be spent.'</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> OXNARD MAY CHANGE SITE OF FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Relocation of the California Strawberry Festival to a larger site will be  discussed Tuesday at the Oxnard City Council meeting. Festival organizers hope  to have the May event moved to College Park, a meadow next to Oxnard College.  </P> <P> The fair has been held at Channel Islands Harbor since its beginning seven  years ago. More than 70,000 people swarmed through the harbor's seven-acre  fairgrounds last May, said Dr. Tsujio Kato, co-chairman of the 1990 event.  </P> <P> This year's fair would spread to 14 acres at College Park to accommodate  shorter lines, a larger arts-and-crafts area and more entertainers, Kato said.  </P> <P> Organizers say another advantage to College Park is its on-site parking and  easy freeway access.  </P> <P> The fair, which has generated about $500,000 for local nonprofit groups since  it began, will be held May 18 and 19.

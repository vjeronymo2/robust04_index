			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER TEXAS THRIFT CHIEF IS ACCUSED BY U.S.;  </P> <P> BAILOUT: THE EX-CHAIRMAN OF SUNBELT SAVINGS IN DALLAS WAS CHARGED WITH FRAUD;  HIS THRIFT'S COLLAPSE COST TAXPAYERS MORE THAN $2 BILLION. THE S&amp;L DISASTER  CONTINUES.  </P> <P> Moving against one of the nation's costliest savings and loan failures, a  federal grand jury indicted the former chairman of a Texas thrift Wednesday on  charges of bank fraud, misapplying funds and making false statements arising  from a $700-million Southern California real estate purchase.  </P> <P> The defendant, Edwin T. McBirney III, resigned as chairman of Sunbelt Savings  Assn. under pressure from federal regulators in 1986. The Dallas institution  was consolidated with seven other insolvent thrifts two years later in a  bailout that cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> In a 1984-86 deal characterized by U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins in Dallas as a  case of "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours," McBirney allegedly  offered another Dallas thrift, Western Savings Assn., a $6-million profit on  any property it wanted to sell.  </P> <P> In return, Western agreed to provide approximately $30 million needed by a  Sunbelt subsidiary, Sun Cal, to complete the purchase of the Southern  California property.  </P> <P> The indictment did not specify the location of the real estate or the eventual  outcome of the transaction. But Paul Coggins, McBirney's attorney, said that  the real estate included the Hilton hotel at Los Angeles International Airport  and about 12 other properties in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> The allegedly fraudulent reciprocal loan arrangement led to others as well as  to false statements by McBirney to hide the transactions from regulatory  authorities, the grand jury charged.  </P> <P> To generate the promised $6-million profit, Western chose a 708-acre tract of  land in Denton County, Tex. McBirney lined up a California real estate broker,  not identified in the indictment, to buy the land for $21.1 million.  </P> <P> McBirney allegedly represented to the buyer that the property was worth more  than $23 million and was suitable for residential development, and that Sunbelt  would be interested in making loans to prospective home buyers.  </P> <P> The indictment said that McBirney did so without benefit of an appraisal or  other relevant information and without conducting an investigation into the  true value and potential of the property. McBirney also caused Sunbelt to  extend a loan to the buyer without required documentation, according to the  indictment.  </P> <P> To keep the loan out of default and to prevent federal and state regulators  from learning the true nature of the transaction, McBirney allegedly made  additional loans to third parties and diverted proceeds from them, according to  the indictment.  </P> <P> The grand jury charged that McBirney deceived his own employees to block  regulators from obtaining correct information about the complex financing.  </P> <P> "In spite of the great lengths to which people went . . . to deceive the  regulatory authorities and hide their criminality, today's indictment  demonstrates that even these complex schemes can be penetrated through an  aggressive, long-term investigative effort," U.S. Attorney Collins said.  </P> <P> Coggins, McBirney's attorney, said his client would plead not guilty at his  arraignment next week. He said that prosecutors have "sliced a single  transaction into 17 different counts, and it's government overkill."  </P> <P> The attorney added that there is no allegation that McBirney personally  profited from the transactions.  </P> <P> If convicted on all counts, McBirney would face up to 85 years in prison and  $4.25 million in fines.  </P> <P> The indictment made no mention of McBirney's high-flying style in running  Sunbelt, which came to be known as "Gunbelt Savings" because of its quickness  to extend loans.  </P> <P> Collins said that he sought to keep the indictment "lean and small" so that  jurors could understand the highly complex transactions.  </P></p>

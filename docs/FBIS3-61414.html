Bardin; UDC  669.24'26:537.622]    [Abstract] A study examined the morphology, dimensions, and  orientation of particles of the ferromagnetic phase in 7.5- to  15-m-thick microstrips of the cold-deformed stainless steel  alloys 0Kh12N12M3 and 0Kh12N12K3. The study specimens, which had  been deformed by rolling to a degree of 98 percent with  intervening cycles of tempering, were examined under light and  transmission electron microscopes. The structural studies were  performed on specimen strips with a thickness of 10 m. The  alloy 0Kh12N12M3 was determined to have a coercitive force of  29.5 kA/m, a saturation induction of 0.13, and a residual  magnetization of 0.09. The alloy 0Kh12N12K3 was determined to  have a coercitive force of 62.9 kA/m, a saturation induction of  0.15, and a residual magnetization of 0.13. The particles of the  specimens' _a_-phase were found to have very diverse shapes and  sized and to contain the following characteristic types of  particles/regions: 1) isolated small equiaxial or  anisotropically shaped _a_-phase particles with a cross section  of 4 to 10 nm and an axis (l/d) ratio of &lt;3:1; 2)  highly fragmented (i.e., in a block structure) particles of  rather diverse shape with cross sections of 10 to 165 nm; and 3)  colonies of elongated uniaxial particles with cross sections of  4 to 20 nm and an axis ratio between 3:1 and 12:1 (the direction  of their long axes was generally close to the direction of  rolling, and the particles often appeared to consist of  individual fragments or chains of smaller particles within the  confines of the defect band); and 4) regions with a relatively  low density of _a_-phase measuring 0.5-3 m. The studies  indicated that the main contributor to the study alloys' level  of magnetic properties are anisotropic particles with a  heterogeneous structure consisting of disoriented fragments  (blocks) and/or individual microparticles separated by  _g_-phase  interlayers.

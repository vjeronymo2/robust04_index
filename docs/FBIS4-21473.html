			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Committee on Ecology and Environmental  Protection and the Academy of Sciences held a joint press  conference today. Our colleague Menzere Sadiqova reports:    [Begin recording] Sadiqova: At the very  time when the ecological (?balance) has already been gravely  disrupted, no state can remain indifferent to an attempt by a  neighboring country to use nuclear power. Therefore, the  agreement signed between Armenia and Russia on the reopening of  the Metsamor nuclear power plant has raised serious concerns.  The reopening of the nuclear plant, which poses a danger not  only to the Caucasus but also to all Caspian Sea countries and  which was built to operate for a limited duration, will cause  radioactive waste to travel through Azerbaijan and then to the  Caspian Sea via rivers. The reopening of this plant, which was  planned to withstand a seven-point earthquake on the Richter  Scale but is located in a seismic region susceptible to 9-point  earthquakes, might amplify the tectonic processes in the Caspian  Sea and cause yet another Chernobyl tragedy at the very time  when the level of the Caspian Sea is rising.    Arif Mansurov, chairman of the Azerbaijan State Committee on  Ecology and Environmental Protection, provided detailed  information on these issues during the news conference. He  assessed this decision by Armenia and Russia as a lever for  political pressure.    In his statement, Academician Eldar Balayev, president of  the  republic's Academy of Sciences, said that the Metsamor nuclear  plant generates more than 14,00O waste [measurement not  specified] each year and added that there are many Armenian  nuclear experts working in various nuclear centers; the  reopening of this plant might enable them to gather in Metsamor  in the future and allow them to make use of atomic power for  nonpeaceful purposes.    The news conference was held in Russian and English because  foreign reporters were also taking part.    We are currently in a state of war with Armenia. Do you  think that by reopening the nuclear plant they could make use of  it for military purposes?    Mansurov: At present, Armenian politicians are in  a bind and could resort to anything. They could also make use  of the waste from the nuclear power plant. [end  recording]</p>

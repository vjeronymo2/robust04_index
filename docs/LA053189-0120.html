			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLECTION POLICY IN VETERAN LOAN DEFAULTS CRITICIZED  </P> <P> The Department of Veterans Affairs spends millions of dollars each year trying  to collect some of the $2 billion owed by veterans who have lost their homes  through foreclosures, but retrieves only a fraction of the amount, according to  the General Accounting Office and veterans organizations.  </P> <P> GAO investigators found that the department's emphasis on foreclosing after a  veteran defaults on a mortgage, and then trying to get cash from the veteran,  is a "flawed" policy that has resulted in collection of only about 14% of the  total debt, said Ed Kratzer, the GAO's deputy assistant director for housing.  The GAO, which is the investigative agency of Congress, is working on two  reports about loan policies and practices at the veterans department.  </P> <P> Several years of high foreclosure rates, especially in the Southwest and West,  have seriously depleted the fund used to guarantee veterans' mortgages, forcing  Congress to appropriate $1.7 billion since 1984 to keep the program afloat.  </P> <P> More than 13 million military families and individuals have bought homes over  the last 45 years with the help of the loan guaranty revolving fund. The fund  is used to pay lenders when veterans default on their mortgages. Under the  present system, the government guarantees mortgages for up to 50% of a loan of  $45,000 or less. If a loan is higher than $45,000, the department guarantees  40% of the total or $36,000, whichever is less.  </P> <P> While spending money and effort to collect the debt, the veterans department  frequently ignores other ways of handling a default that would be less costly  to veterans and to the government, Kratzer said.  </P> <P> "Foreclosure is usually the most expensive" way to handle a loan default and it  is a "messy, expensive" process, he said.  </P> <P> After a foreclosure, the department sells the house. If the proceeds of the  sale are less than the amount owed on the mortgage, the department tries to  collect the difference from the veteran. Few veterans, who presumably would not  have defaulted in the first place if they had had enough money, have sufficient  funds to pay this extra amount, veterans' groups said.  </P> <P> One GAO report nearing completion is expected to "point out alternatives to  foreclosure that (the veterans department) ought to be considering," Kratzer  said. "There is a lot of money to be saved on both sides," by veterans and the  government, he said.  </P> <P> The department could, for example, ask a veteran to deed his home voluntarily  to the government, saving the cost of a foreclosure, or the agency could pay  off the loan and become, in effect, the veteran's banker. If the government  takes over the loan, it usually restructures it and may lower the payments.  </P> <P> Taking over a loan is the best solution because it keeps veterans in their  homes, according to Charles M. Novak, management analyst with the GAO's Seattle  regional office. "There's only about a 50% success rate (with this tactic), but  even if it only works half the time, it's still beneficial" for the veterans  department because it saves foreclosure costs on half the houses the department  takes over, he said.  </P> <P> The third alternative to foreclosure is called a compromise sale, in which the  veteran is allowed to sell his home when he can no longer make payments. If the  proceeds of the sale are not enough to cover the amount due, the government  advances the money needed to make up the difference and asks the veteran to  sign a promissory note to pay all or part of the amount.  </P> <P> Novak, who studied veterans department foreclosures in several regions of the  country, said the government chose an alternative to foreclosure in only a  small number of mortgage-default cases.  </P> <P> In Seattle, for instance, he said it costs the government about $11,000 in  interest, maintenance, tax and other expenses to hold a house for a year after  foreclosure. The veterans department collects an average of $3,000 from the  veterans after foreclosure, meaning that the government "is spending $11,000 to  collect $3,000," he said.  </P> <P> Congress and the Bush Administration have sharply different views of what to do  about the troubled veterans' loan fund.  </P> <P> A bill approved recently by the House Committee on Veterans Affairs would  indemnify veterans, barring the government, in all but a few cases, from trying  to collect from those who have lost their homes.  </P> <P> The legislation would abolish the current loan guaranty fund and replace it  with a mortgage insurance program for veterans.  </P> <P> To help support the fund, veterans would pay a fee of 1.5% of the total loan  amount or three-fourths of 1% if the veteran makes a down payment of 5% or  more. The government would pay one-fourth of 1% of the loan amount each year  for three years to help fund the insurance program. Disabled veterans and  widows of veterans who died from service-connected causes would not have to pay  the fees.  </P> <P> Veterans currently pay 1% of their mortgage amounts into the revolving loan  fund.  </P> <P> The Congressional Budget Office said that income from fees and proceeds from  loan sales would enable the new insurance fund to build up a reserve that could  be invested in U.S. Treasury securities.  </P> <P> Eliminating veterans' obligations to repay the government after a foreclosure  would have little impact on the new mortgage fund because the veterans  department collects so little of the debt, the budget office said.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, however, believes that the proposed fund would show  deficits beginning in 1994 that would continue indefinitely, said R.J. Vogel,  chief benefits director for the veterans department.  </P></p>

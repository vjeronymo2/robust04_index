Some 2,000 to 3,000 people, many in uniform, were waiting to  greet the rightwing Liberal Democratic Party leader, who is  making a tour of parts of former Yugoslavia, including  Serb-controlled regions of Croatia and Bosnia, an AFP  correspondent said.    He was officially welcomed by the self-proclaimed president  of the Serb Republic of Bosnia, Radovan Karadzic, Biljana  Plavsic, from the collegial presidency and Aleksa Buha, a member  of the government. Karadzic introduced Zhirinovskiy to a  Russian volunteer fighting on the Tuzla front in northeast  Bosnia. "The Russians have already arrived. They are coming on  their own, it is a sign of Russia's goodwill," Zhirinovskiy said.    Zhirinovskiy was later scheduled to visit Vukovar in the  self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in Croatia to meet  the newly-elected self-styled president Milan Martic.    Zhirinovskiy warned on arrival in Belgrade on Sunday that  airstrikes against the Serbs would be considered an attack by  the west on Russia itself.    Attacks by NATO warplanes or UN troops on Serb positions  anywhere in Bosnia or other areas of the former Yugoslavia  "would be tantamount to a declaration of war on Russia," he  said. "It's better that Europe not learn what retaliatory  measurs we could take," he told a press conference.    He also called for UN troops to be pulled out of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and "let the Serbs settle the matter  themselves."    Zhirinovskiy arrived here from Serbia after traveling  through  Hungary following a stormy tour of Slovenia, during which he was  invited to leave by the government for causing a public  disturbance and suggesting the independent republic should be  reincorporated into rump Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Ekostahl to make new subsidy call EKOSTAHL, eastern Germany's large steel plant, will make another attempt at seeking subsidies from the European Community aimed at modernising the plant, preparing it for privatisation and saving the remaining 3,200 jobs. Officials from the Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising eastern German industry, and which owns Ekostahl, yesterday said a revised plan designed to modernise the cold rolling mill and construct a mini-mill would be presented to Brussels by the autumn. 'Without subsidies and giving Ekostahl a chance to compete in Germany, it will be impossible to find buyers for the mill,' a Treuhand spokesperson said yesterday. Treuhand officials, however, are concerned about what social and political impact Ekostahl's closure would have on the local region which is dependent on the mill. Ekostahl applied last April for subsidies totalling DM1.2bn (Dollars 740m), but had insisted they would be linked to reducing capacity. The EC rejected that application on the grounds it would add to overcapacity in Europe.</p>

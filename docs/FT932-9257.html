			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / BT pension scheme in Pounds 750m shortfall BRITISH TELECOM yesterday announced it had discovered a Pounds 750m shortfall in its pension scheme as of the end of March, leaving it with 5 to 6 per cent too little cash to meet current liabilities. Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director, said the shortfall reflected much lower than expected dividend income and the effects of changes in advance corporation tax announced in the March budget which have cut income for pension funds all across Britain. Chancellor Norman Lamont cut the percentage of ACT pension schemes could reclaim from the Inland Revenue to 20 per cent of the cash dividend from 25 per cent. The change cuts cash generated by investments in UK equities by 6 1/4 per cent. Also, instead of the 5 per cent per year dividend growth assumed by most pension scheme actuaries for 1992, dividends actually fell by 0.1 per cent and have shrunk a further 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 1993. The difficulties facing the British Telecom pension scheme are likely to be mirrored in other UK pension schemes, actuaries said. UK equities constitute the largest single investment category for UK pension schemes. The average fund has 60 per cent of assets in that sector. To cover the shortfall, BT will immediately inject Pounds 800m from its cash reserves into the scheme and resume its corporate contributions, estimated at Pounds 250m per year, according to Mr Hepher. A further planned round of 15,000 redundancies for the current year is expected to place an additional Pounds 250m 'strain' on the scheme by year-end, he said. Mr Hepher said there are no plans to alter the pension scheme or its benefit structure in any way as a result of the increased cost. The cash injection will have no effect on the company's profits for the current year except to produce a slight reduction in interest income. However, the decision to front-end the expense removes one of the uncertainties which could undermine the government's sale of its third stake in BT later this year. BT's scheme, in a valuation conducted at the end of December 1992, had a surplus of Pounds 119m. Enhanced pension payments to 29,000 workers made redundant over the past year reduced the surplus from Pounds 913m. Lex, Page 18 Analysis, Page 21</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PADRE PITCHERS CAN'T STOP GIANTS' MITCHELL  </P> <P> On a day in which National League pitchers were mostly in control, Kevin  Mitchell used his bat to handle the San Diego Padres.  </P> <P> The Padres have made a late-season run that has put a scare into the San  Francisco Giants. A sweep of Sunday's doubleheader at Candlestick Park would  have put the Padres only three games out of first in the West.  </P> <P> But in a rain-delayed first game, Mitchell hit two home runs to lead the Giants  to a 5-3 victory that all but ended the Padre pennant hopes.  </P> <P> Mitchell not only leads the majors with 45 home runs, he also leads both  leagues with 120 runs batted in. He has a chance to be the first National  League batter to hit 50 home runs since George Foster in 1977.  </P> <P> Bruce Hurst pitched a five-hitter for his league-leading 10th complete game as  the Padres won the second game, 6-1.  </P> <P> Hurst (15-10) who walked four and struck out seven, worked out of a  bases-loaded jam in the sixth. Will Clark's single and two walks loaded the  bases, but Greg Litton flied to right.  </P> <P> Rick Reuschel (16-7) gave up six hits and three runs in seven innings, walking  six and striking out five.  </P> <P> The rainout Saturday that forced the doubleheader was probably a blessing for  Mitchell. For several weeks, he has been bothered by chipped bones in his left  wrist that eventually will require surgery. When he is rested, Mitchell can  come back and hit the long ball.  </P> <P> "It's no big deal," said the slugger who is virtually a cinch to win the NL  most valuable player award. "It bothers me a little, but we're going after the  pennant. I'll have that taken care of after we're through playing."  </P> <P> Mitchell's bat enabled Scott Garrelts to improve his record to 14-3, although  his major league leading earned-run average climbed to 2.27. He gave up six  hits and three runs in six innings. Steve Bedrosian pitched the last two  innings for his 22nd save.  </P> <P> San Diego's Jack Clark had four hits, including his 23rd home run in the first  inning that gave the Padres a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 2, Chicago 0 -- The first-place Cubs aren't just good, they're also  lucky. When they go into a mild slump, so does their primary opposition.  </P> <P> The team that is playing the best in the East already did the Cubs a favor by  putting challengers into a slump. With Doug Drabek pitching an eight-hitter at  Pittsburgh, the Pirates beat the Cubs two in a row, but it did little harm.  </P> <P> Despite losing two of the three to the Pirates, the Cubs' magic number is nine  and they lead second-place St. Louis by five games.  </P> <P> The Pirates, expected to be a contender, are finally playing to expectations.  They won two out of three from the Mets, swept three from the Cardinals and are  7-2 against the top three teams in the East.  </P> <P> "Pittsburgh's been a good club the last two weeks," Cubs' Manager Don Zimmer  said. "They've been beating everyone. But I kind of like the position we're  in."  </P> <P> Philadelphia 9-0, St. Louis 5-2 -- Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog blamed lack  of hitting for the Cardinals' slump after they cut the Cubs lead to a half game  Sept. 8.  </P> <P> But there have been two bigger problems -- the injury to bullpen ace Todd  Worrell and the recent ineffectiveness of 18-game winner Joe Magrane.  </P> <P> Both problems hurt the Cardinals at Philadelphia where a sweep could have moved  St. Louis to within four games of the Cubs.  </P> <P> Magrane, trying for the fourth time to win his 19th game in a season in which  he has pitched more innings (214) than ever, had a 5-1 lead in the sixth  inning. With Worrell injured, there was nobody to come in when Magrane  faltered. The Phillies won it when John Kruk hit a grand slam with two out in  the 12th.  </P> <P> Montreal 1, New York 0 -- Talking about teams having troubles scoring brings to  mind the Mets.  </P> <P> They managed to get Mark Langston out of his slump at Montreal.  </P> <P> Langston was only 1-4 with an earned-run average of 5.17 in his five previous  starts. But he held the Mets to three hits and struck out nine to improve to  12-7 and record his fourth shutout.  </P> <P> Houston 1, Cincinnati 0 -- Mark Portugal has been a fortunate find for the  Astros. Portugal, unsuccessful with Minnesota, pitched a five-hitter for his  first shutout in a game at Houston.  </P> <P> Portugal is 6-1 since joining the Astros after an 11-19 record in four seasons  with the Twins. Ken Caminiti's 10th home run leading off the fifth inning was  the only run. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

Tudor said that in certain places in Transylvania leaflets  printed in Hungary are reported to be circulating, threatening  PRM leaders and the Hungarians who live in harmony with the  Romanians. In his opinion, once the conflicts in former  Yugoslavia are over, "international professionals" are trying to  shift the testing arena to Romania.    PRM president voiced his satisfaction for the recent  government reshuffle, which he termed as a response full of  "responsibility" to the alarm signals given by his party.    Without assuming the "merit" for the replacement of the  former Minister of Defence Nicolae Spiroiu, Tudor qualified his  removal as "a consequence of his own mistakes," and the reaction  of the "monarchist" opposition as a proof that Nicolae Spiroiu  "was an important part in the political machinations" that wish  the coming of former King Mihai the First to Romania.</p>

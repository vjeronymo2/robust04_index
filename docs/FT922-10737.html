			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Takeover reactions vary - The Battle for Midland LARGE companies mostly welcomed the prospect of a leaner fitter banking sector following a takeover of Midland bank. Small and medium companies were more concerned about the possible reduction of competition. Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director of Redland, the large building materials group said: 'In terms of clearing bank services, there is little between the major banks. I cannot see that it would make any difference to us.' Mr David Chater, finance director of Radyot, a maker of components for commercial vehicles based in Cradley Heath, east Midlands, said: 'I believe in free competition and survival of the fittest. The engineering industry has seen a vast amount of rationalisation during the past ten years and this sort of move is long overdue in the banking sector. It's a good thing if it makes banks leaner and fitter.' The chief executive of a large textile company said: 'This should have happened years ago. Damage has been done to the banking industry by the Bank of England's reluctance to allow this kind of thing. 'Any reduction in competition will not be damaging. If there are any signs of a cartel forming, then continental banks will start to play the UK business sector. Large companies do not rely on clearing banks anyway. Small business is a different matter, but Royal Bank of Scotland and other Scottish banks provide a serious alternative.' Most large industrial companies said that they used a range of domestic and international banks to raise finance and for corporate advice and would not be inconvenienced by a takeover of Midland. Most companies welcomed the possibility of lower charges as a result of the closure of redundant branches and duplicated services. Other companies were concerned about the loss of competition. T Cowie, the Sunderland-based motor finance and retail group, said it had banked with Midland for many years, borrowing money to finance its 60,000 vehicle company car fleet. Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said: 'We believe a successful bid from Lloyds would mean less competition in the supply of money, not more. 'From our point of view, a successful bid by Lloyds would be extremely disappointing. We have enjoyed a very positive business relationship with Midland going back several decades. We have always found them to be very good at servicing our business, so we would be very concerned about the level of service from Lloyds.' Mr Frank Nicholson, managing director of Vaux Breweries, part of the Vaux Group, warned: 'Big in banking is not always beautiful.' Vaux, founded 170 years ago, has banked for a century or more with Lloyds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING CORPORATE CUSTOMERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE companies banking with Lloyds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National Arjo Wiggins Apleton* Associated British Foods* Blue Circle* Bowater Courtaulds* Hanson Ladbroke* Land Securities PowerGen Reed International* Sears Severn Trent Water Shell Transport Smith &amp; Nephew* Smith (W H) Sun Alliance Tate &amp; Lyle Willis Caroon* (* more than one bank involved)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE companies banking with Midland  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argyll Group BOC Group Eurotunnel* Forte* Kingfisher Northern Foods* Pearson* Prudential Corp Rothmans Intl* SmithKline Beecham Tesco* Wellcome Williams Holdings* (* more than one bank involved)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE companies banking with both Lloyds and Midland  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bass* British Aerospace* BTR* Coats Viyella* General Electric* Hillsdown Holdings* P&amp;O* Sainsbury J* (* more than Midland &amp; Lloyds Bank involved)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE companies - information about bankers unavailable  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays British Steel British Telecom Cadbury Schweppes Fisons General Accident ICI Lloyds Bank Midland Bank NatWest Reckitt &amp; Coleman RTZ Unilever  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Analysis; Stock Exchange Yearbook; Arthur Anderson Corporate Register; Annual Reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

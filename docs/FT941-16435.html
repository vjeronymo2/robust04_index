			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Cash inflow cheers bulls and bears - New York The year-end stand-off between the inflation-wary bears and the growth-minded bulls began to erode last week under the weight of a seasonal inflow of funds from institutional investors adjusting their portfolios for 1994. The Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed above the 3,800 level, an important barrier, for the first time and rang up a 66-point advance on the week. The balance may tip more decisively this week. Based on last Friday's December employment data and expectations of tame consumer and producer price reports this week, the optimists have every reason to feel vindicated. However, the next few days may test their patience. The strides taken last week were in part explained by the so-called January effect. This phenomenon is caused by the reinvestment of cash generated for tax-related stock sales at the end of the previous year. With the January surge tampering off, cyclical stocks may stall. Given the sharp, speculative rise of cyclical stocks 'investors may have trouble finding value in the near term', says Mr James Solloway, director of equity research at Argus Research in New York. 'After the past two weeks, the market has become a little bit extended, a little too leggy,' agrees Mr Alfred Goldman, technical market analyst at AG Edwards &amp; Sons of St Louis. 'This week there may be a pause to refresh.' If so, Mr Solloway would view any pull-back as a buying opportunity. The overall trend remains bullish, both analysts believe, citing the economic fundamentals. Those who see a sustained period of low-inflationary growth on the horizon were cheered on Friday when the Labor Department reported non-farm payrolls last month grew by 183,000, well below expectations, but strong enough to suggest continued economic buoyancy. The figure reinforces the impression that the economy is expanding on the back of productivity gains rather than increased labour costs, a trend which Mr David Hale, chief economist with Kemper Securities in Chicago, expects to continue through 1994. That bodes well for fat corporate profits as well as low interest rates - both of which are supporting stock prices. Cyclical companies are benefiting from strong capital spending by manufacturers. Equities in general have prospered as investors seek better returns than money market funds and other short-term instruments are yielding. The focus is centred on December's producer price index, due Wednesday, and the consumer price index scheduled for release the next day. The data will provide direct evidence of inflationary pressures. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette is forecasting a 0.1 per cent PPI decline and a 0.1 per cent rise in the CPI, suggesting prices are well under control. If those estimates prove accurate, the bond market is likely to rally and 'any pause to refresh' in equities may turn out to be very brief indeed.</p>

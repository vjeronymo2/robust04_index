The opening ceremony for the bridge and the  Nanchang- Jiaoqiao section of the expressway was held at the  bridgehead this morning. Among those present at the opening  ceremony were Mao Zhiyong [provincial party secretary], Wu  Guanzheng [governor], Zhu Zhihong, and Lu Xiuzhen. Wu Guanzheng  spoke. [passage omitted]    The construction of the Nanchang bridge started in September  1989. [passage omitted] The Nanchang bridge starts from the  Tandekou flyover and ends in Changleng Township, totaling nine  km long. This bridge is the main channel between northern and  western Jiangxi.    In his speech, Governor Wu Guanzheng said: In January last  year, the Jiaoqiao-Jiujiang section on the Nanchang-Jiujiang  expressway opened to traffic; now the Nanchang bridge and the  Nanchang-Jiaoqiao section on the Nanchang-Jiujiang expressway  have opened. This is another major achievement in our  province's basic facilities construction and will play a major  role in promoting Jiangxi's opening up and economic development.  [passage omitted]    Projects now under construction in the province include  seven  power stations, five railways, three airports, six tunnels, 19  reservoirs, 200,000-gate program-control telephone equipment,  and 10 fiber-optic cable projects. This year we will proceed  with ten major projects including power stations in Fengcheng  and Jiujiang, the Chang Jiang bridge in Jiujiang, the  Jiujiang-Hukou expressway, the Hukou bridge, a new railway  station in Nanchang, a new airport in Nanchang, and 600,000-gate  program-control telephone equipment, requiring a total  investment of over 13 billion yuan. Following the completion of  these projects, the bottleneck situation in basic facilities  will be greatly alleviated, the investment environment will  greatly improve, and economic development power will also  greatly increase.    Wu Guanzheng hoped that comrades participating in the  construction of these projects would continue to display their  indomitable spirit, closely cooperate with each other, and make  great achievements in basic facilities construction.</p>

The Attorney General's Office (PGR) has not received any  reports or evidence about the presence of ETA members in Mexico  to promote armed actions from this country.    Information obtained at the PGR indicated that if ETA  members  are found to be operating in the country, the appropriate  authorities will investigate the situation. The PGR stated in a  communique that neither the Mexican judicial authorities nor  Interpol have been asked by any Spanish authority to investigate  the presence of members of the separatist organization.    Mexico conducts investigations with strict respect for the  law, and the authorities do not allow themselves to be swayed by  rumors that sometimes only confuse the public.    The Spanish newspaper ABC published a report stating that  ETA  members direct activities of that organization form Mexico and  that they have infiltrated various sectors of the Mexican  economy.</p>

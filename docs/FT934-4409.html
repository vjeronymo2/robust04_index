			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: CIBC stages strong earnings rebound Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce staged a strong earnings rebound in fiscal 1993, thanks to a sharp drop in loan-loss provisions, and record retail and investment banking earnings. But the bank, which was one of the biggest lenders to failed property developer Olympia &amp; York, said it continued to have real-estate problems. Earnings of Canada's second-biggest financial institution totalled CDollars 730m (USDollars 547m), or CDollars 2.99 a share, in the year to October 31, against a loss of CDollars 12m, or 59 cents per common share, a year earlier. Last year's losses were due to the bank's exposure to O&amp;Y. Return on assets for 1993 was 0.53 per cent, compared with 0.01 per cent. Assets stood at CDollars 141.3bn on October 31, up from CDollars 132.2bn a year earlier. Loan-loss provisions dipped to CDollars 920m from CDollars 1.84bn. Non-performing loans stood at CDollars 2.43bn on October 31, or 2.3 per cent of total loans, from CDollars 3.04bn, or 3 per cent. Fourth-quarter earnings jumped to CDollars 191m, or 75 cents a share, from CDollars 45m, or nine cents a share. The continued difficulties in the real-estate market are reflected in the transfer of CDollars 100m in excess loan-loss reserves from country-risk provisions to a special provision set up last year for troubled property loans. Real-estate provision now stands at CDollars 250m. Mr Al Flood, chairman, said: 'While there is evidence that real estate values in North America have stabilised, we do not expect an early turnround.'</p>

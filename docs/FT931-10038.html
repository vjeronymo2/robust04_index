			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Minister eases threat to more than 3,000 Nuclear Electric jobs THE THREAT to more than 3,000 jobs at Nuclear Electric diminished yesterday when Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the closure of any Magnox stations before the end of their planned lives would be difficult to justify economically. He was speaking after a report by Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, commissioned as part of the government's coal inquiry, backed Nuclear Electric's analysis of potential savings from closure. The nuclear industry's critics say the savings would be considerably higher than Nuclear Electric has estimated. They have used this to back arguments that the Magnox stations should be closed earlier than planned to make way for more coal to be burned for the electricity market. Publication of the report in parliament came as leaders of 11 of the 12 regional electricity companies met in London to try to meet government demands on purchases of coal-fired electricity. The regional companies have agreed in principle to buy the electricity which the generators will produce from outline contracts with British Coal to buy 40m tonnes and 30m in the following four years. However, there is friction among them about how the electricity will be apportioned. Some are under pressure from the government to withdraw from contracts for nuclear-generated electricity so they can take up more coal-fired power. In separate talks the generators indicated they could not take more than 65m tonnes of extra coal over five years, even at subsidised prices unless the government cleared a significant amount of room in the market by cutting supplies of other fuels. The government is reluctant to do this.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] In Rwanda, extremely violent  fighting went on in Kigali throughout the day between government  forces and the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the RPF.  Let us take stock of the military situation as described less  than half an hour ago by one of our special correspondents in  Kigali, Christophe Boisbouvier:    [Begin Boisbouvier recording] At nightfall this evening, the  Rwandan Armed Forces were still resisting in the basin of  Kigali. They are under fire from the rebels who are attacking on  two fronts, in the north and in the south. In the south, they  are attacking from a hill that overlooks the district of  Gikondo. Their aim is to join up with the RPF pocket, which, as  you know, has been holding out for six days in the area between  the town and the airport. According to the latest information  here, it seems that the rebels coming from the north have  managed to link up with those in the pocket, but this is not  certain.    This evening, for the first time we heard firing from rocket  launchers. This is proof of the violence of the fighting and,  again, of the resistance of the Rwandan Armed Forces -- or at  least those of its battalions which have not yet decided to  surrender.    As far as Westerners are concerned, there has not been a  single French soldier in town since the evacuation of the  embassy this morning. Some Belgian units are still in two or  three positions while they evacuate the last foreigners. There  is also the airport where 500 Belgians and 350 French soldiers  are deployed. The RPF has just told them via the United Nations  that they have another three days to complete evacuating and  leave.    [Announcer] Christophe Boisbouvier, this was truly a mad day  in Kigali, right?    [Boisbouvier] Absolutely, a mad day indeed, where events  moved very quickly. At 0600 to 0630 this morning, the rebels  were arriving from the south of the town, where they were not at  all expected to be. It seems that last night they managed to go  round the capital through the wooded hills around the town.  This is reminiscent of Vietcong tactics, somewhere else, in  Asia. They surprised everybody indeed when they attacked above  Gikondo. This is partly why the French Embassy had to be  evacuated. [passage omitted]    In the afternoon, since the evacuation road between the town  and the airport was cut, the rebels continued to progress from  the south and the north, and, as I was saying, they may be  joining up with the pocket which is between the town and the  airport. [end recording]    [Announcer] That was Christophe Boisbouvier, one of our  special correspondents in Kigali. He spoke to us on the  telephone less than half an hour ago.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (8): Family firm or public company - The future 'WHAT we are facing in Italy', a senior industrialist says, 'is not just a political change, but a management change.' Scandals and corruption apart, Italian managers are wrestling with a nagging problem: how to modernise the structure of Italian capitalism. The challenge for Italian industry is how to evolve from the family firm to the public company. Family control extends to some of the largest enterprises in the country. As many Italian managers are coming to realise, this has at least three big drawbacks. It limits the supply of professional managerial talent from outside the family: it hampers the development of an international business culture: and it restricts the availability of finance for expansion. In a few exceptional cases, these problems appear to be overcome. Merloni Elettrodomestici, Europe's fourth-biggest maker of white goods such as washing machines and refrigerators, is a truly international company with factories in France, Portugal and Turkey and almost two thirds of its sales outside Italy. But although the company is publicly quoted, it is 75 per cent controlled by the Merloni family. Mr Vittorio Merloni, the chairman and founder, is reasonably sure he can finance his ambitious growth targets without relinquishing family control. But he concedes that he does not know what will happen beyond the end of the decade. And although he is surrounded by professional non-family managers, he also concedes that attracting outside talent remains difficult. Others put the point more bluntly. Dr Roberto Tronchetti Provera is president of Camfin, an oil distribution and business services group which, like Merloni, is publicly quoted but family controlled. Speaking in his capacity as vice-chairman of Assolombarda, the powerful northern employers' federation based in Milan, he insists that the move away from family control is inevitable. 'If you want 51 per cent control of a company you will never grow', he says. 'You have to make a choice.' Granted, he says, the old system served well enough in its day. 'In the past, family ownership was a good thing. When you're building the industry of a country, you need family ownership. 'Historically, that has been true everywhere. And you must realise that we are a recent industrial country, certainly by comparison with Germany or the UK.' Now, however, industrialists such as Dr Tronchetti Provera are clearly irked by the size limitation imposed by the family structure. 'If you compare quoted companies in Italy to those in France, Germany and the UK', he says, 'the only big company we have is Fiat. A company like Pirelli seems big to us, but it has only 10,000 employees.' Mention of Pirelli is not, perhaps, wholly accidental. Through his family company, Camfin, and in conjunction with his brother and fellow director, Marco, Dr Tronchetti Provera is a sizeable shareholder in Pirelli. Marco is also Pirelli's managing director. And, as Roberto points out, as companies grow, so do families. 'Bringing together 100 family members', he says, 'can be as difficult as bringing together 10,000 shareholders.' This is a live topic among Italy's bosses. According to another industrialist - whose privately-owned metals company had a turnover last year of Dollars 2bn - he and a number of like-minded patriarchs have regular meetings several times a year. 'We discuss all these things', he says. 'How to keep control and expand; how to keep other family members happy; whether to bring the daughters into management'. Dr Tronchetti Provera says: 'I don't think Italian families will continue to dominate in the long term. But whether a company is run by family or management doesn't matter to me as an investor. 'What matters is that the company is not run in the interests of a single group. In any case, you can have a family company which is run very well, like the Barilla group, or a non-family group which is run badly.' The answer, he claims, is evolutionary. 'We are going through a period where control of the company will still be very important, but not necessarily family control.' What he has in mind is the French principle of the noyau dur - the hard core of friendly and committed shareholders, controlling perhaps 15-30 per cent of the shares, who will guarantee the company's independence. This was precisely the tactic adopted by Fiat in its giant Dollars 3bn fund-raising at the end of last month. As part of the exercise, Fiat brought in as new core shareholders the French electronics giant Alcatel Alsthom and the Italian insurer Generali, to add to a group already including such European heavyweights as Deutsche Bank and the Italian merchant bank Mediobanca. The same tactic is also to be pursued in Italy's forthcoming privatisation programme. Here, too, Italy is following the French model whereby friendly groups of core shareholders are assembled for each company before it is privatised. The relevance of all this to humbler Italian family firms is in one sense strictly limited. As recent stock market scandals have shown - in particular, that of Ferruzzi, which culminated in the suicide of the disgraced tycoon Raul Gardini - the Italian market is not for beginners. Dr Tronchetti Provera says: 'Families are sceptical of the market because it is not well organised and controlled. Solve that and the difficulty disappears. Today, the system isn't working properly. All the Ferruzzi problems happened without the control of the stock exchange authorities. 'Without an institution such as the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US, you will never have a market. 'But I think we will have a reasonable working stock market two or three years from now. As an association of industrialists, we very strongly request clear rules and efficiency in the market's controlling body. This is the only way to allow the development of Italian industry. 'You need clear rules so that new companies coming to the market know what to expect, and new shareholders as well.'</p>

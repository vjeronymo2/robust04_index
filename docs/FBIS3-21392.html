			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tapan Dasgupta: "Prime Minister Defends Mixed </F> Economy Concept"]    [Text] Davos (Switzerland), Feb. 1--The Prime Minister, Mr  P.V. Narasimha Rao, today defended the concept of mixed economy  as in India. He told the global leaders of industry and finance  that the collapse of communism and rejection of the command  system did not necessarily mean total acceptance of market  economy.    Urging the leaders for maintaining a balance between the  two,  he said, India followed the middle way or mixed economy which  saved the country from "political submission and economic  dependence."    Reacting to the criticism that the process of reforms has  slowed down in the country, Mr Rao said that in the new-found  enthusiasm for change, governments should not go overboard and  plunge large chunks of their people into mass misery.    "They have no right to do so, the scheme of change must take  full note of such contingencies and make allowance for them.    "Each society has to find its own "middle way" suited to its  circumstances, but find it must, eventually and find it in the  spirit of the new changes in the world, if it has to succeed,"  the Prime Minister said.    Mr Rao was addressing the closing plenary session on  "Challenges before mankind as it enters 21st century," at the  annual Davos symposium organised by the World Economic Forum  (WEF).    According to Mr Rao's prognosis, poverty will continue to  pose the most serious challenge to mankind during the greater  part of the 21st century. The reasons furnished by him are that  poverty is a breeding ground of disunity and tension. These  tensions will dominate to such an extent that the governments  will be unable to give first priority to eradication of poverty,  but he is hopeful about the removal of illiteracy within the  first quarter of the coming century or even earlier by  harnessing some of the major technological developments relating  to communications.    The Prime Minister's speech was also an implied criticism of  the U.S. foreign policy and Pakistan's encouragement of  terrorism in India. He said the end of the Cold War was welcome  but it would not by itself usher in peace everywhere. While it  would prevent world conflagration, it could also create  conditions for the resolution of regional conflicts, "provided  it fits into the global strategy of the wielders of real power.  "The question is: Who will wield that real power?" he said.    Disagreeing with some thinkers that economic problems have  now become solvable, Mr Rao said that the prospect of their  being actually solved was nowhere in sight in the short run. On  the other hand, the ethnic-cultural-religious problems would  certainly threaten to get aggravated. "What seems likely is a  further complication wherein economic, social and  ethnic-cultural factors combine to compound the threat to the  political unity and peace of states.    Obviously referring to the situation in Kashmir and Punjab,  he said, "much of the fundamentalist fanaticism prevailing  today, may, on a deeper analysis, be found to be traceable to  causes very unrelated to religion." To discover and remove these  causes would be the real challenge of the leaders of the world,"  since it may not always be possible to eradicate malaise by  individual efforts in the affected countries separately," the  Prime Minister said.    The Prime Minister, while criticising the fetters imposed by  some western powers on technology imports by Third World  countries, said those who invested in furthering the frontiers  of science and technology would naturally like to be  compensated. But, "when the price is paid, there should be no  other extraneous and unreasonable restraints. In case of an  unwarranted insistence on such conditionalities, the challenge  will be to develop the necessary peaceful technologies at the  national level."    The Prime Minister might have been referring to the case of  importing cryogenic engines from Russia which was scuttled by  the United States.    PTI and UNI adds: Mr Rao said that though politically  motivated religious fanaticism had held complete sway in the  past few years, "with diligent and patient work among people,  their desire for socio-economic development has been made to  prevail over false religious slogans and tactics."    Mr Rao who devoted most of his time in addressing the theme  of the meeting, "Redefining changes in the global economy,"  recognised that there were costs inherent in the free exchange  of knowledge and ideas. "Those who invest in furthering the  frontiers of science and technology expect recompense," Mr Rao  said adding that "we do not necessarily argue against that  expectation but we believe that when the price is paid there  should be no other extraneous and unreasonable restraints."    Mr Rao contended that in the event of unwarranted insistence  on such conditionalities, the challenge would be to develop the  necessary peaceful technologies at the national level, in an  obvious reference to the withholding of cryogenic rocket  technology to India.    The Prime Minister in a dig at copying western ideas said  while they succeeded "by their arms in the past and technology  in the present," others should adopt or adapt to the  technologies as well as that is wise and humane in the West.  [sentence as printed] "While doing so, we have to be securely  anchored in our own tradition which is equally incisive, and  much more relevant to our situation," he said.    Mr Rao also did not agree with those who feel that the  rejection of the command economy ipso facto meant a  total acceptance of what it had sought to replace. In India, he  asserted, "we recognise the change, but maintain a balance which  has come to be known as the middle way."    He pointed out, some feel that with the collapse of  communist  system and the world having become uni-polar there could be no  middle-way, since the world has only one way now. This  assertion, he said, was "unrealistic" from what has happened in  the recent past.    The Prime Minister said that one should not accept a dogma  even if it happens to be [the] only one in the field at a given  moment.    While change had to be accepted as a result of deliberate  and  objective thinking, "at the same time, those who wear the shoe  and know where it pinches should have full say in deciding how  to mend it." As such, he said, their scheme of change must take  full note of contingencies like mass poverty and make allowance  for them.    The Prime Minister said while the remarkable advances in  medicine, bio-technology, nuclear science and cybernetic  promised to change human life beyond recognition, this should be  so only if the new stimulus does not stop at the point of  affordability.    In this context, Mr Rao said he found India and a few other  developing countries more fortunately placed and said "we do not  find serious difficulty in the flow or absorption of technology,  except when our progress itself tends to create some uneasiness  in some quarters."    Referring to the theme of the forum, Mr Rao called for new  approaches and new programmes to solve the global problem of  poverty and provision of basic needs to millions.    With growing integration, any thought of insulating any part  of the world from the problems of other parts would be futile,"  Mr Rao warned.    He also called for harnessing technological developments in  communications to banish illiteracy and suggested a healing  relationship between the earth and human civilisation by  removing the adverseal attitude towards nature.    Mr Rao cautioned the business people of globe that the  fallout of mass misery would not affect specific groups,  countries or regions only, but would engulf the whole world.    He said the end of Cold War would not usher in peace  everywhere, though it could prevent major conflagration.    It could foster conditions for the resolution of regional  conflicts, provided it fits into the global strategy of the  wielders of real power--one or more it matters little and the  question is, Mr Rao said, who would wield that real power.    In a clear rebuff to the developed western world,  particularly the United States, the Prime Minister said no  extraneous and unreasonable constraints and conditionalities  should come in the way of technology transfer.    The Prime Minister declared that in case of an unwarranted  insistence on such conditionalities, the challenge would be to  develop the necessary peaceful technologies at the national  level.    In an obvious reference to the West and the insistence of  the  United States to link transfer of technology and aid to human  rights, environment and exploitation of labour, the Prime  Minister said: "We must seek to reaffirm, as a matter of high  principle, the spirit of inquiry which was central to human  progress."    Earlier, the commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, said  that no extraneous considerations such as human rights,  environment and exploitation of labour should be allowed to  interrupt free access of goods and services from developing  countries to industrialised nations.</p>

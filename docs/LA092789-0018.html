Huerta, 23, pleaded innocent Monday to murder in the the Sept. 5  slaying of Sylvia Flores, 23, also of Escondido, whose body was discovered in a  drainage ditch Sept. 16 in the 14100 block of San Pasqual Road.  </P> <P> Huerta was arrested Friday in Kingsburg and brought to San Diego on Sunday by  homicide detectives.  </P> <P> According to a declaration by San Diego Police Detective Richard Thwing, Huerta  admitted killing the woman to the two people, who later contacted police. Both  said that Huerta told them they would be killed if they ever told police about  what he had said.  </P> <P> One of the two said he saw blood on Huerta's face, pants and shirt Sept. 5, the  day of the killing. Huerta told that person, according to the declaration, that  he stabbed Flores but that the knife bent, so he then dragged her to the side  of the road and hit her with a large rock.  </P> <P> On Sept. 7, Huerta and the witness drove near the location of the body, where  Huerta allegedly pointed to where he had left it, the declaration says.

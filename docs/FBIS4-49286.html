			<p>BFN     [Text] Suzhou, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Construction started  today on the Suzhou Industrial Park in Jiangsu Province, a joint  land development project between China and Singapore.    The project is designed to develop a modern industrial park  of considerable size, with modern industries as the main  structure, and new and high-tech as the leading sectors,  complemented by service industries and public welfare services.    In detail, with complete infrastructural facilities, the  park  will include industrial and residential areas, schools,  hospitals, parks, sports grounds, and grasslands.    The park, situated to the east of this scenic city in  eastern  China, will ultimately be developed to cover an area of 70 sq  km. The area for the first-phase development is eight square km.  The entire project will be completed in ten years.    The project was put forward in October last year, and on  February 26 this year, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and  Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew signed the joint  development agreement in Beijing, with Chinese Premier Li Peng  and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong present.    From March 5 this year, the two sides have been busy  training  management personnel and wooing international investors to the  park.</p>

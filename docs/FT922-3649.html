			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / EC accord lays base for single securities market THE FOUNDATIONS of a single European market in securities trading were laid early this morning in Luxembourg by European Community finance ministers. They reached preliminary agreement on rules to harmonise capital requirements for European banks and securities firms. The ministers and European Commission officials finally agreed the key points of the draft capital adequacy directive shortly after midnight following more than nine hours of talks. The directive will lay out the regulatory framework for the single market, putting securities firms and banks' trading operations on the same footing. The agreement is likely to give fresh impetus to the investment services directive. This second measure, which would build on the capital adequacy directive, would give securities firms a passport to operate throughout the EC. However, it has been held up by disputes between groups of member states led by France and Britain. Britain, which takes over the EC presidency next month, has always said it favours an investment services directive, but only on terms which do not damage City firms. Until the final hour of talks it looked as though an accord would again be held up as Britain, Germany and France tried to defend their interests. Officials were cautious about proclaiming a breakthrough, pointing out that a number of technical issues needed to be resolved before formal agreement could be reached. The whole measure will return to the finance ministers' agenda on June 29 for political approval. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner for financial services, welcomed the deal and said afterwards: 'I have throughout made it clear that the purpose of the directive is to lead to the opening of the European securities market. This is now being done in a fair way which is guaranteed not to damage the legitimate interests of any existing market.' The agreement will apply to securities firms and to the part of banks' balance sheets on which investment business is conducted - the so-called 'trading book'. If formally approved, the directive would theoretically take effect from the beginning of next year, although implementation is likely to take much longer. The main points of the deal include: A flexible limit on the amount of capital which firms must have to back single investments or 'large exposures'. Firms will be allowed a window of 10 days in which to breach existing limits restricting such investments to 25 per ent of their capital base. This should help preserve the manoeuvrability of Britain's small merchant banks. A choice of the limit on the amount of subordinated short-term debt firms can count as capital for regulatory purposes. An agreement that will allow corporate treasurers and pension funds, as well as banks and investment firms, to carry out so-called repurchase agreements under the looser rules of the capital adequacy directive. A three-year review period to ensure that the directive continues to fit in with international accords on capital adequacy, such as that proposed between securities and banking regulators earlier this year. Commission officials described the deal as 'a fairly uncomfortable compromise' for everyone. Tory split exploited Page 14 Germans likely to back UK on Brussels powers Page 2</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: MacGregor promises green paper on funding - Transport THE GOVERNMENT'S proposals involve an Pounds 18bn programme for transport, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said in a statement yesterday. He promised a green paper on possible arrangements for paying for the use of inter-urban roads and the best ways to involve the private sector in their provision. 'Road construction over the period of the survey will be at a record level,' the statement said. 'This means that all the schemes planned to start next year will go ahead. There is a huge need for roads expenditure and we need to secure the best value for money we can. 'So ,in the longer term I hope to see greater involvement of the private sector in the financing, design building and operation of national roads. The green paper will look at possible new approaches to this; it will also discuss the related question of arrangements for payment for the use of these roads. 'An extra Pounds 130m has been made available to British Rail in 1993/94 compared with last year's plans and an extra Pounds 100m in 1994/95. This will allow BR to press ahead with investment in Channel tunnel services, to complete the Pounds 0.8bn project to upgrade services for inner-Kent commuters and to continue with necessary investment in track and signalling. 'In the run-up to privatisation BR are being given increased scope to fund new rolling stock by leasing. 'The government is providing nearly Pounds 1.5bn of grant towards London Transport's existing business over the next three years which should allow for investment of around Pounds 1.75bn. 'This would be Pounds 0.5bn higher in real terms than over the last three years and would, among other things, enable London Underground to complete the Pounds 750m project to upgrade the Central Line.' On the Jubilee Line extension, Mr MacGregor said: 'I am glad that substantial progress has been made in our discussions with the administrators, who have now offered financial contributions equivalent to those promised by Olympia &amp; York. There are to be further negotiations between the administrators, the banks and London Transport over the detail of the funding agreement. The expenditure plans will provide for the line to go ahead if the final agreement matches, in all material respects, that drawn up with O &amp; Y. The provision for the Civil Aviation Authority will enable them to maintain their major investment programme, and in particular to be able to keep the new en-route centre on target for completion in 1996. Our support for local authority public transport is unchanged. All the projects for which we have already made provision will go ahead as planned. Spending will continue on the South Yorkshire Supertram, Merseyside resignalling, bus priority measures and local rail service safety works. The provision for local authority airports, used in conjunction with airports' own resources, will ensure safety and security schemes can proceed. We look to the private sector to play the major role in financing significant airport expansion. 'The temporary relaxation of the rules about capital receipts will give local authority airport owners just the opportunity for which several of them have been asking and will provide extra resources for local authorities to spend, at their discretion, on public transport and roads, as well.'</p>

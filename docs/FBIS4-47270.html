These also include (7Z,9Z)-7,9 dodecadienyl acetate (Z,Z-1)  pheromone or a component of pheromone composition. These  compounds are normally prepared by the Wittig reaction or by  cross-conjugation of vinyl electrophiles with vinyl nucleophiles  in the presence of palladium complexes. In the present work a  study was made of two similar routes to the synthesis of the  title pheromone using organo-cuprate conjugation of Z,Z-diene  electrophiles, (2Z,4Z)-1-acetoxy-2,4-heptadiene or  (3Z,5Z)-1-bromo-3,5-octadiene with  _o_-ter-butoxy-1-chloropentanome or -butane, respectively. To  prepare the electrophiles, optimum conditions were determined  for the reduction of 2,4-hepta- and 3,5-octadiene-1-ols into the  corresponding Z,Z-alkadienols with activated zinc in a water-  alcohol medium which facilitated high geometric purity of the  products. Both schemes result in 1-ter--butoxy-7,9-dodecadiene  (mixture of four isomers). Acetolysis of the latter results in  the pheromone with traces of the stereoisomer.

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Surge at Hyundai Hyundai Corporation, the trading arm of South Korea's largest conglomerate, has reported a 47 per cent rise in net earnings, to Won5.3bn (Dollars 6.6m) for the first half of 1994, writes John Burton. Sales rose 24 per cent to Won6,323bn. The improved results reflect increased exports, which benefited from the weak Korean currency.

Sunkyong Ltd, the fifth-largest trading house, suffered a 36 per cent fall in earnings, to Won3.2bn. It blamed growing investment costs, including the recent purchase of a controlling stake in Korea Mobile Telecom, the cellular telephone monopoly. Ssangyong Corporation, the sixth-biggest trading company, had a 32 per cent fall in profits to Won2.5bn, while sales rose by 15.6 per cent to Won1,354bn.</p>

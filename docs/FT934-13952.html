			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Placer and Outokumpu in Chilean copper deal CANADA'S PLACER Dome and Outokumpu of Finland are to develop the Zaldivar copper deposit in northern Chile into a Dollars 600m mine. Work on the project, recognised as one of the richest undeveloped copper ore bodies in Latin America, will start immediately. Production is scheduled to begin in the second half of 1995. The mine is expected to have a life of at least 17 years. Placer said yesterday that an updated feasibility study indicated mineable ore reserves of 246m tonnes with a grade of 1.02 per cent copper. A reserve suitable for dump-leaching was estimated to contain 70m lb of copper with a grade of 0.41 per cent. Cash production costs are estimated at 52 US cents a lb. Placer and Outokumpu each have a 50 per cent interest in the Zaldivar deposit. Placer will oversee construction of the mine, while Outokumpu will market its production. The mine will be managed by a jointly-owned company, Compania Minera Zaldivar. The project will be financed by up to Dollars 400m in loan financing from Placer, plus a capital injection from both partners. The decision to go ahead with Zaldivar represents a major diversification for Placer Dome. The Vancouver-based company's interests centre on gold, but it has recognised for some time the difficulty of replenishing gold reserves to sustain growth. A similar attempt to broaden its base two years ago resulted in heavy losses when Placer wrote off its investment in the Mount Milligan copper deposit in British Columbia.</p>

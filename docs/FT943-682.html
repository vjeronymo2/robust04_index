			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Small step in the right direction for pensions Sir, In arguing that the proposed new pensions solvency requirement 'will at best be useless', Mr H R Wynne-Griffith (Letters, September 24/25) points out that it is impossible for a company in dire financial straits to pay a substantial cash injection into a pension fund. However, a pension fund insolvency is not necessarily a sudden phenomenon, and the aim of the proposed solvency standard is to ensure that an ongoing fund remains continually solvent. Members' benefits are then at least partially protected in the event of the sponsoring employer encountering dire financial straits. In the case of Swan Hunter, we are told that the pension fund is nearly 100 per cent fully funded on the new solvency requirement ('Swan Hunter pension example', September 24/25). Swan Hunter employees reading this alongside reports that they stand to lose up to 40 per cent of their pensions will doubtless view the proposed new solvency standard as only a small step in the right direction.

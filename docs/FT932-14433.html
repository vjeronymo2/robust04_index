			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Personal View: Private functions in public education THE UK's private sector is being asked to help build tunnels under the Channel, railways across London and possibly even jails and hospitals. It is unfortunate, then, that it is being made to feel so unwelcome in the sector that needs it most - state education. There are plenty of good reasons for thinking that there is a role for government in education. But all these reasons lead to the same conclusion - the primary government role should be to pay the bills. The state need not be in the business of running schools or even in making important educational decisions. These are both activities at which the authorities - at local and national level - have failed to excel, and both can perfectly well be devolved to private agents. In fashionable jargon, splitting the functions of educational purchasing from the functions of educational provision could improve the incentives of suppliers and improve the allocation of resources. The key to creating a more privatised system of education lies in the management of capacity. It is decisions about which schools should open, which should expand and which should close that need to be delegated to mechanisms of the marketplace, rather than to the might of government. The fact that J Sainsbury has been able to open new stores, and that the Co-Op has had to close them, has at least fuelled a process of improvement in retailing standards over many years. If only the same improvements in schools were evident over that period. Unfortunately, if we want capacity decisions of schools to be made on a similar basis to those of supermarkets the management of capacity needs to be taken out of the hands of the authorities. And so must the discretionary allocation of capital. New schools should be allowed to open - as long as they can attract a licence from educational inspectors - and old schools should be allowed to expand, without the permission of the secretary of state. In either case, schools should be allowed to use their own capital, or sometimes borrow it from the state. If they can then attract enough pupils, they should be rewarded with an annual return large enough to compensate their lenders for the cost of capital. Meanwhile, existing state schools should be told to use their assets efficiently, and that if they fail to educate the number of students for which their capital was designed - if they become overendowed with capital for their size - they will face a penalty in the form of a reduced maintenance grant. It would not be impossible to design practical systems of financial control that deal with the undoubted complexities of the education sector, while nevertheless retaining the essential underlying mechanisms that ensure dynamism in the supermarket sector. Unfortunately, the 1993 Education Bill leaves control of all capital in the hands of administration. The reason that the Department for Education feels such a strong need to maintain control of schools' capacity is its near obsession with what it calls surplus places. Quite apart from the fact that in a system of parental choice, it is inevitable that there have to be surplus places (it would otherwise be quite fortuitous if a significant proportion of parents could exercise much of a choice), the method chosen for dealing with surplus capacity is hopelessly overcentralised. If private promoters were to be encouraged into schools, perhaps using their own capital, what would the state have to pay them? At the moment, government annually spends about Pounds 2,000 a student on the running costs involved in teaching, with some small portion of this devoted to capital investment; but the state also devotes a stock of about Pounds 8,000 worth of land, buildings and equipment to each student. At a 10 per cent rate of return on that capital, the true 'market price' of educational services in the state sector is near Pounds 3,000 a head. At that rate, private capital may find it attractive to enter the market. Unfortunately, the thrust of John Patten's Education Bill is not an attempt to replace local education authorities with private agents in education decision-making, but to replace local education authorities with John Patten. It is possible that the superior administrative skills of Mr Patten and his agents will exert a beneficial influence on the schools system, but it is equally possible that his detachment from educational realities will undermine it. Replacing one set of administrators with another set of administrators is not as effective as dispensing with the administrators altogether.

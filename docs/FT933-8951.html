			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Boral to float manufacturing arm BORAL, the Australian industrial products company, plans to float its manufacturing division by the end of 1993. Mr Jim Leslie, chairman, said yesterday he expected the proceeds to substantially exceed the book value of the division's assets. The balance sheet asset valuation of Boral's manufacturing division at June 1992 was ADollars 336.7m (USDollars 230.8m), but this included the engineering and tyre divisions which will not be part of the sale. Mr Leslie said the move follows a corporate restructuring completed in July. He added that Boral intended to focus on its core building products and energy businesses. The manufacturing businesses had combined sales of ADollars 280m in 1991-1992 and earnings before interest and tax of ADollars 32.8m. Mr Leslie said Boral was well advanced with the float plan, although a corporate sale remained an option. The division includes some leading brands including Gerrard springs, Kinnears ropes and Cyclone hardware, with operations in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. Mr Leslie said Boral would release its 1992-1993 corporate results on September 1 and he expected the 12.7 per cent increase in net earnings for the December half to be exceeded for the full year.</p>

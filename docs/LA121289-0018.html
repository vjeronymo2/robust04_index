			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> SIGNATURES FILED ON REDISTRICTING  </P> <P> Supporters of an initiative to have an independent commission redraw political  district boundaries said they filed enough signatures to qualify the measure  for the June, 1990, statewide ballot. The initiative would strip the  Legislature of the power to redistrict, giving it to a 12-member commission  made up of five Democrats, five Republicans and two persons not registered in  either party. Sponsored by the League of Women Voters and other groups, the  initiative is the first of six measures originally targeted for the ballot to  be submitted to the secretary of state with signatures. A spokeswoman for the  office said it appears that only four of the six remain active, however.  Supporters of the initiative said they submitted 965,000 signatures. A total of  595,000 valid signatures are needed to put the measure on the ballot.  </P></p>

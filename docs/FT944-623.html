			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: Monstrous metaphors - The Frankenstein myth FRANKENSTEIN, CREATION AND MONSTROSITY ed. by Stephen Bann Reaktion Books Pounds 25 (Pounds 10.50 pbk), 215 pages Readers who have seen the Kenneth Branagh film will feel surprised and relieved, in embarking on Frankenstein, Creation and Monstrosity, to discover that Mary Shelley's novel and the myth that it founded can still generate reflective, happily exploratory forms of commentary. All the contributors, in other words, seek out complexities and eschew easy generalisations. Ludmilla Jordanova, for example, emphasises that Frankenstein, 'far from being a simple, moralistic tale of masculinist, scientific overreaching', is 'a remarkably precise exploration of the internal conflicts felt by practitioners in a variety of fields'. In locating an abnormal intensity in Frankenstein's thirst for knowledge and devotion to secluded study, Mary Shelley 'pointed up the importance of balancing acts, not the unproblematically 'bad' qualities of scientists in general or of Frankenstein in particular'. Jordanova sees Shelley's novel as participating in a more general 'ambivalence surrounding a thirst for natural knowledge' in early 19th century Britain; at the same time, she presents the novelist as grasping perfectly 'the fantasies of (at least some) medical practitioners of the time', fantasies that prompted doctors and scientists to express themselves in the heightened language of 'sudden light', sublime visions, and an eroticised unveiling of nature. Many of the essays concentrate less on the creator than on the monster and on monstrosity in general. Louis James's essay includes an entertaining account of monsters on stage: Mary Shelley's novel was first performed as a play in 1823, five years after its publication. James places the moment when Frankenstein brings the monster into being in the tradition of 'the moving statue' sculptures that come to life, as the statue of Hermione does at the end of The Winter's Tale. Moving statues, he suggests, provide metaphors for the power of theatre itself to combine 'intense subjective experience' with 'objective, highly stylised forms of appearance, speech and situation'. Stephen Bann, in his introduction, firmly steers the book away from the usual preoccupations of literary critics - Mary Shelley's troubled life, the struggle between sublime aspiration and contented domesticity  - by touching on some quite different early 19th century monsters: the composite creatures that the Roman Catholic country squire and impassioned taxidermist Charles Waterton put together out of diverse stuffed animals, adapted in some instances to acquire human faces. Waterton provides, amusingly, a fortuitous point of contact between the Frankenstein myth and the Dracula tradition: during his travels in South America, he not only collected specimens as both the raw material for monsters and for feats of taxidermy in which he sought to shock his audience into the impression of a live animal, but displayed a parallel fascination with vampires by habitually sticking his foot out of his hammock in the hope that a vampire bat might bite it] Jean Louis Schefer, in the concluding essay, establishes a more general thematic connection between 'the two great fantastic novels': 'If the frenzy of the test tube monster suggests that feelings have been pumped into a creature that is not ready for them then it is also true to say that Dracula marks the return, in a different guise, of this shattered, or unfulfilled, state of equilibrium.' He moves on to trace links between vampire legends and the Christian doctrine of the Eucharist: 'The resurrection of the deceased, his presence which remains real in defiance of time, the blood of sacrifice as a means of regeneration, the consecrated bread: all of these themes in Bram Stoker's Dracula are present in two different ways: they are available for sacred purposes, but also for evil ones, in a devilish form of parody that follows the same ritual.' Michael Fried introduces monsters of a less familiar kind: the array of half humanised animals, gradually reverting to their bestial nature, produced by the eponymous doctor in HG Wells's Island of Dr Moreau. He traces within this 'scientific romance' an obsession with monstrous faces, which he sees as characteristic of a more general recurrence of 'the disfigured, usually upward turned face with staring but unseeing eyes' in writings that he terms impressionist ('the practice of ten or so authors - Conrad and Kipling, for example - working in the English language chiefly between 1890 and World War I'). Fried pursues the role of upturned, monstrous faces as metaphors for 'those things that, before all, actually lay before the writer's eyes: the upward facing sheet of paper itself, in the first place blank but soon covered with script'. It should be clear by now that this book goes off at many tangents, energetically taking up the themes of creation and monstrosity as a source of productive starting points. To adopt a cinematic parallel: reading it is more like admiring the bolt through Boris Karloff's neck than averting the gaze from Robert de Niro's puckered scars.</p>

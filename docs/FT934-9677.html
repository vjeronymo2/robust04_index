			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Croats angered by Vitez attack MOSLEM forces yesterday fired two shells on a Croat-held munitions factory in Vitez, central Bosnia, as Croat officials warned the attacks could prompt 'a catastrophe'. Faced with a string of Moslem victories, the Croat authorities said the latest Moslem offensive would cause 'a horrific explosion and an unprecedented catastrophe for the wider area of Bosnia-Hercegovina'. It was said to be the first direct hit on the vital munitions factory in Vitez, the headquarters of British United Nations soldiers, and follows the fall last week of Vares, 25 miles to the east, to the Moslem government's forces. The Croatian Defense Council (HVO), the Bosnian Croat army, admitted in a statement it had joined forces with the Bosnian Serbs, their former enemies, to surround the Nordic UN battalion near Vares on Sunday. The two-hour encirclement helped the Croats retake several villages, which the HVO statement cited as proof of UN support for Moslem forces, Belgrade radio reported. In Sarajevo, UN soldiers yesterday escorted the first of 1,500 Serbs, Croats and Moslems to be evacuated from the besieged Bosnian capital as part of an agreement postponed for nearly one year. Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN envoy, is due to meet Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, in Sarajevo today to consider possible steps to revive the peace talks. Meanwhile, Sarajevo radio said Serb forces pounded the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a UN-designated 'safe area' in south-eastern Bosnia.</p>

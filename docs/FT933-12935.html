			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Steinkuhler sharedispute shelved THE insider dealing commission of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange yesterday pointedly failed to clear Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the former union leader, of insider dealing in the shares of a Daimler-Benz holding company. Without naming the former head of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, the commission said it had been unable to pursue one individual who had made self-incriminating remarks because that person had not signed the voluntary code under which insider dealing is regulated in Germany. The commission said that under current laws it had no powers to pursue further the individual, who is understood to be Mr Steinkuhler. He bought nearly DM1m (Pounds 300,000) of shares in Mercedes Holding (MAH), the bulk the day before an announcement on April 2 which led to a sharp rise in the price of MAH shares. The shares had risen before the announcement. At the time Mr Steinkuhler was on the supervisory board of Daimler-Benz. It is understood that Mr Steinkuhler did not accept the anti-insider code retrospectively as some people have done in order to allow the commission to complete its enquiries. Mr Steinkuhler denied dealing on the basis of inside knowledge gleaned from his position on the board, but he resigned from the Daimler board as well as his union position. The commission said yesterday that it could be assumed that the rise in the MAH share price prior to the announcement on April 2 was not caused by people trading on the basis of inside knowledge.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE VIEWS: VIEWING UPPER EGYPT FROM A BOAT ON THE NILE  </P> <P> Early morning rituals along the Nile haven't changed much in 4,000 years. From  our boat we watched a woman carefully pick her way down the muddy bank,  carrying an earthenware water jug over a shoulder, just like those used in  2,000 BC in the temple reliefs.  </P> <P> At the first rays of the rising sun a flurry of white egrets flapped out of the  trees. Fishermen poled their triangular-sailed feluccas out into the river and  unfurled their nets, then began to shout and beat their hands against the sides  of the wooden boats, flailing the surface of the water with their oars to  stampede the fish.  </P> <P> On the bank a man washed in preparation for his prayers, then unfolded a square  piece of cloth and kneeled facing Mecca. Curious children came down to the  steps to watch our boat tie up, rubbing the sleep from their eyes.  </P> <P> We arrived at this river landing outside Dendera, near Luxor, on Abercrombie  &amp; Kent's 44-passenger Sun Boat, one of the smallest, newest and most  luxurious vessels of the nearly 100 that cruise the Nile.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeing the Sights  </P> <P> A cruise boat is the most comfortable way, perhaps the only feasible one, to  visit the great temples and tombs of the Pharaohs in Upper Egypt. A few of  them, such as the magnificent temple of Horus at Edfu and the two-god temple at  Kom Ombo, are only a short walk or carriage ride from the river.  </P> <P> Even better, the air-conditioned interior and breezy deck of the Sun Boat  provide a welcome respite from the dust and flies, heat and traffic that are  facts of life in modern Egypt. Even in October, considered the best month for  weather, it is sunny, hot and dry, with a parching wind that blows from the  desert.  </P> <P> Our group of 18 on this Nile Discoverer itinerary have our own Egyptologist,  Mona Saleh, a striking and dynamic woman who doubles as guide, shopping  negotiator and den mother.  </P> <P> "You must drink at least three liters of water a day to keep from getting  dehydrated," she said. So each of us dutifully clutched a plastic bottle of  mineral water everywhere we went.  </P> <P> We boarded the Sun Boat in Luxor the day before, after flying down from Cairo,  then caroming in cabs past camel markets and adobe villages to stand awe-struck  in the avenue of the sphinxes outside the vast Temple of Karnak.  </P> <P> (Movie fans would recognize it, especially the hypostyle hall with its 134  columns, from the film of Agatha Christie's "Death on the Nile.")  </P> <P> In town the temple of Luxor, surrounded by urban traffic, is visibly  deteriorating, according to Mona, who takes a tour through it every month. "It  will not last another century," she says.  </P> <P> The forecast is even worse for the temple at Edfu, where sewage from the slums  crowding against it flow into the ground and seep up into the sandstone and  limestone temple, making it crumble at the touch of a finger . . . and many  fingers test it.  </P> <P> The day before our visit, we were told, 4,000 Egyptian (about $1,735 U.S.) of  entrance fees were collected, but none of it seems to be diverted toward  relocating the squatters and saving the temple.  </P> <P> Other days included a trek to the tomb of Tutankhamen, a bus to the Aswan High  Dam, a flight to world-famous Abu Simbel, a boat ride to the relocated island  temple of Philae and a felucca cruise on the Upper Nile. Tour participants  spend several days in Cairo at the beginning and end of the cruise seeing the  Pyramids, Sphinx and Egyptian Museum.  </P> <P> Sun Boat I has 22 comfortable, air-conditioned, nicely decorated cabins with  big windows for watching the river scenery go by and, we felt, better food and  service than in the leading land hotels. The housekeeping and maintenance is  also good.  </P> <P> We recommend the deluxe cabins on the two upper decks over the state cabins on  the lower deck, because noise from the engines seeps into the latter, in 101  and 102 especially.  </P> <P> The suggested tip for the five-day trip for two is $25, which is pooled and  divided among the 40-man Egyptian staff. There is a bar, a modest-size swimming  pool and an upper deck with chairs and loungers in both sun and shade.  </P> <P> Meals are single-sitting, with a fixed menu of soup, first course, main course  and dessert for lunch and dinner, along with a daily breakfast buffet and  afternoon tea. Vegetarian cuisine is available by advance request. The chef  proved especially skillful at cheese and dessert souffles.  </P> <P> Abercrombie &amp; Kent's 12-day Nile Discoverer and the similar 11-day Nile  Explorer offer small-group year-round departures at seasonal prices from $1,390  to $1,990 per person, double occupancy, plus $929 to $999 for round-trip air  fare aboard British Airways' New York City-to-Cairo service via London. Air  fare in Egypt is an additional $215.  </P> <P> Bear in mind that a Nile cruise should not be compared to a Caribbean or  Mediterranean cruise. It is much more akin to expedition sailing, where the  emphasis is on the sightseeing, some of it arduous, rather than relaxation and  entertainment.  </P> <P> Some tips for the trip: Take lightweight, launderable cotton clothing, a sun  hat, strong sunblock, insect repellent and sturdy, practical walking shoes.  Except when sunbathing or swimming on the boat, dress modestly but comfortably.  </P> <P> Women should not wear shorts or halters ashore. Slacks are quite acceptable.  You won't need the dressy clothing you would normally carry for a cruise.  </P> <P> While water on the Nile cruise vessels is said to be filtered, it is wise to  avoid it entirely for drinking, toothbrushing or as ice cubes. (We heard about  three people in another group who got ill after going to church and taking  communion.) Sealed bottles of chilled mineral water are available almost  everywhere and are provided free on the Sun Boat.  </P> <P> Whether on the ship, on shore or in the best hotels, avoid raw vegetables and  salads and any fresh fruit you cannot peel yourself. Egyptian beer is quite  good and inexpensive, but we found most of the local wines undrinkable and  imported ones very costly.  </P> <P> Take care not to overexert yourself, especially in the Valley of the Kings and  the tomb sites, as heat exhaustion also can lead to illness.  </P> <P> We would not recommend this tour for children younger than 12, for the elderly  with chronic health problems or anyone who has difficulty walking up or down  stairs.  </P></p>

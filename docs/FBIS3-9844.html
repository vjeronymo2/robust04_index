Major General Pavel  Strubl, Air Force and Air Defense inspector, said that success  had been attained in fulfilling the basic objectives. A  three-tier system of command has been set up in the Air Force  and Air Defense Forces. Thus, there is the Air Force and Air  Defense headquarters, which is a body of the chief of General  Staff. There is also the 3d Tactical Air Force Corps and the  4th Air Defense Corps, which are the operational levels  [operacni stupne], and, last, there are the Air Force and Air  Defense units, which are tactical factors [takticke prvky].    This year will be the most complex period for these two  bodies. Just for illustration: The numbers of aviation  equipment in use will be radically reduced. Seventy-seven  combat aircraft, 11 combat helicopters, 20 training aircraft,  and other equipment will be discarded. Compared to the present,  this amounts on the whole to a 30.6-percent reduction. There  will also be similar changes in the Air Defense Forces.    Newsmen learned from the information service that 11  inspections verifying the organizational structure and 81  inspections checking the elimination of superfluous equipment  took place on our territory from 1 January 1993 until 1 March  [no year as heard]. What is pleasing is that the inspections  confirmed the responsible attitude of the Czech Republic to the  fulfillment of (?an agreement) in all spheres.</p>

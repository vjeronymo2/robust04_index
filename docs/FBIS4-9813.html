			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On 31 March, nine years after the murder of  three communist teachers -- Jose Manuel Parada, Manuel Guerrero,  and Santiago Nattino -- Judge Milton Juica sentenced 17 former  Carabineros members and a civilian. Three of the former  Carabineros were sentenced to life in prison. The judge also  determined that high-ranking Carabineros officers, including the  institution's director, General Rodolfo Stange, and former  General Cesar Mendoza, must be tried by the Military Courts for  failing to carry out their duties.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] There was an  atmosphere of great tension early this morning at the seat of  the Sixth Criminal Court, where it was known that today Judge  Milton Juica would make known his sentence.    Just after noon, those involved in the triple murder arrived  at the courthouse to receive their sentences. Alejandro Saez  Mardones, sentenced to life imprisonment, was the first to  arrive. The former military policeman entered the courthouse  amidst the shouts of demonstrators from human rights  organizations.    Similar incidents occurred with the arrival of Colonel  Guillermo Gonzalez Betrancourt, retired, who has also been  sentenced to life imprisonment.    Former Carabineros Captain Patricio Zamora Rodriguez, also  sentenced to life imprisonment, was the last to arrive.  [passage omitted]    The most serious incidents took place with the arrival of  Miguel Estay Reyno, alias El Fanta, the only civilian involved  in the murders, who was tried under the charges of kidnapping  and murder. Estay Reyno was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment.  Jose Fuentes Castro received the same sentence. Claudio  Zalazar Fuentes was sentenced to 15 years in prison.    These six people were accused of terrorist-style kidnapping  and of triple murder. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

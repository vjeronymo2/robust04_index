			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Synchronise Eurostar as well Sir, I am surprised that in his article on European time (Personal View, November 24), Sir Alastair Morton did not also suggest that, if the UK's clocks were synchronised with the Continent and if the first Eurostar trains of the day were to leave Waterloo Station between 0600 and 0700, instead of at 0823 as at present, then British executives would also be able to fulfil a full day's engagements in either Paris or Brussels without the added expense and inconvenience of flying to those destinations the night before.

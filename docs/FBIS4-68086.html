			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japanese police will transfer  their internationally-acclaimed, security-boosting techniques to  their Mexican counterparts in a 13-day seminar to start in  Mexico City on May 25, National Police Agency (NPA) officials  said Monday [9 May].    The NPA decided to comply with a Mexican Government request  to dispatch nine experts on measures to counter the threats from  terrorists, drug traffickers and gangsters to society, NPA  officials said.    The Mexican request was conveyed to the Japanese police by  Mexican Deputy Security Minister Socorro Diaz Palacios, who paid  an official visit to Tokyo last November, the officials said.    Palacios voiced interest in acquiring Japanese police  techniques credited with maintaining the security standards of  the Japanese society renowned for its low ratio of the breakout  of violent crimes, they said.    The Mexican Government will shoulder the budgetary outlays  to  fund the travel costs of all nine Japanese experts unlike the  previous similar cases of international cooperation, in which  Japanese police sent its experts to other developing countries.</p>

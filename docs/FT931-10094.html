			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India sanctions more cotton sales THE INDIAN federal government has sanctioned an additional cotton export quota of 500,000 bales (170 kg each) for the cotton season which began in September 1992. Earlier, anticipating a bumper cotton crop and, consequently, a domestic price collapse, the government released 1m bales for export. Officials say that the only way domestic cotton prices can be maintained at above the recommended minimum level is by stepping up exports. World prices for cotton are higher than Indian prices by at least 10 per cent at present. In 1991-92 India imported 300,000 bales of cotton.</p>

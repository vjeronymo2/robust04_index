			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Opposition snubs Japan's premier Japan's new opposition group yesterday boycotted prime minister Tomiichi Murayama's address to the opening session of parliament, the first such snub in 28 years of Japanese politics. Undeterred, Mr Murayama outlined his three-month-old government's policies to his opponents' nearly empty benches, completing the political and tax reforms which had been started by the opposition parties during their tenure in power for nearly a year until June. He aims, during the 65-day parliamentary session, to enact a bill to redraw Japan's unique multi-seat constituency boundaries, replacing them with small single seat boundaries, plus regional seats which will be chosen by proportional representation. This will be the final touch to the political and electoral reforms which have dominated the government's time for much of the past year. Also on the new government's agenda is the enactment of a recent package of income tax cuts with a subsequent increase in consumption tax, civil service spending cuts, and pensions reform. Renovation, the newly formed voting bloc of nine opposition groups, gave as its reason for boycotting Mr Murayama's speech the government's refusal to select a member of the opposition as deputy speaker of the lower house. Renovation also wanted an 80-day rather than 65-day parliamentary session. Opposition officials promised to give the government a 'turbulent' parliamentary session, starting with questions to the prime minister next week. The government, however, with its 38-seat majority, appeared confident of being able to hold power for its full term. Mr Keizo Obuchi, vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party, the dominant member of the ruling coalition, said yesterday that autumn 1997 would be the best time for the next general election. The opposition, by contrast, wants an election soon after the new constituency boundary bill is enacted.</p>

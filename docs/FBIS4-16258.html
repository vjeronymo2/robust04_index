			<p>BFN     [Text] President Saparmurad Niyazov of Turkmenistan told  INTERFAX Thursday that Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] was against tough  structures within the Commonwealth of Independent States.    "We (CIS countries -- IF) have efficient bilateral  structures, but the strengthening of independence should not be  interfered with by new tough structures. The CIS role should be  enhanced, but without those structures, he said. We need to  integrate but in a civilized way, he said. Asked about his  attitude towards Nazarbayev's proposals on the creation of a  Euro-Asian union, he said that the idea was not new. We should  understand the very essence of the idea. One center should not  be replaced by another one. If it is a matter of the creation  of a new coordinating center, Turkmenistan is against. If a new  structure will help strengthen independence and our relations,  the idea should be analyzed, said Niyazov.    He believes that it is premature to consider the idea of a  Euro-Asian union.    Niyazov said that partners should not be sought overseas.  CIS partners and Russia are top priority partners for  Turkmenistan. We are grateful to the Russian people that they  helped our republic to achieve a cultural and other progress, he  said.</p>

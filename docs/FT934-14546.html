			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Cap Gemini stays in red with loss of FFr197.5m CAP Gemini Sogeti, the French computer services company, stayed in the red in the first half of this year with a net loss of FFr197.5m (Dollars 34.9m) and warned that it was unlikely to return to profit until next year. The group, in which Daimler Benz of Germany has a 34 per cent stake, last year went into deficit for the first time with a net loss of FFr72m for the 1992 financial year. It has been struggling to adjust to a sharp downturn in demand in its main markets, particularly France, Germany and Spain. Cap Gemini said that it would be 'futile to hope for an improvement in the economic situation during the second half of the year' and that it did not expect its performance to improve until 1994. Cap Gemini benefited in the first half of last year from the proceeds of the sale of a property near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris which contributed to an exceptional profit of FFr154.5m. As a result it stayed in the black with net profits of FFr142.5m during the first half of 1992. Without the property sale it would have made a net deficit of FFr118.3m.</p>

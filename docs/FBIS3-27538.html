In a 110-page address delivered to the parliament, Yeltsin  said the struggle revolves around how to further social and  economic reforms.    He complained that although the country had abandoned the  Soviet-era command style of management it has not learned to  abide by the law.    "It has to be admitted bluntly that the democratic  principles  of the power structure are being discredited more and more,"  Yeltsin stated.    He urged the legislature to adopt laws enforcing "strict  rules" on powerful state bodies, on the government itself, on  federal state services, on the basic organization of regional  bodies and on the status of lawmakers.    Meanwhile, he stressed the need to carry out a legal reform  in Russia, pinpointing the need to introduce efficient justice  based on strict legal and democratic principles.    Yeltsin also called on the people and various political  forces to cooperate with the new Russian Constitution.    "It is the duty of all those who are linked with the fate of  Russia to use this chance for renewal and stability offered by  the new Constitution," he added.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: US computer networking merger Wellfleet Communications, the second-largest US manufacturer of computer network routers, yesterday announced an agreed Dollars 1bn stock swap takeover of SynOptics Communications, a leading supplier of intelligent network hubs and switching systems. The deal is the latest example of consolidation in the US networking industry. Routers connects networks of computers, while a hub connects desktop computers to a network. The two described the deal as a 'merger of equals' between companies sharing a common vision of open, standards-based network solutions. They claimed it would position them to move customers to a new generation of high-performance networks. However, Wall Street took a mixed view, and Wellfleet's shares closed down Dollars 5 3/16 at Dollars 20 1/16 . SynOptics, which rose an unusually-strong 15.6 per cent on Friday, dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 5/8 . Analysts questioned how easy it would be for the smaller, but fast-growing, New England-based Wellfleet to combine with SynOptics, a California-based former industry leader which has had several quarters of uninspiring results. Several of Wellfleet's rivals, including industry leader Cisco Systems, have recently acquired switching and hub technology companies. However, the businesses they bought were significantly smaller than them. Under the deal, which the two companies hope to complete in October, SynOptics shareholders will receive 0.725 of a share of Wellfleet stock for each SynOptics share held. At yesterday's share prices, the deal values SynOptics at around Dollars 1bn. Mr Paul Severino, president of Wellfleet, will become chairman of the combined group. Mr Andrew Ludwick, president and chief executive of Syn-Optics, will take on the same titles at the new business. There will be four additional members of the board, two from each company. Mr Ludwick said the two companies had complementary technologies and products, while their manufacturing, service and support systems, customer base and channels were also compatible. The companies said they intended to develop an end-to-end standards-based architecture. The key to this would be jointly-developed new products which combined both routing and switching technologies.</p>

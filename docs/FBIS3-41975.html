In the Vancouver declaration on the results of the meeting  of  the Russian and U.S. presidents on 3-4 April, the leaders of the  two countries acknowledged the great importance of preventing  the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery  vehicles. They reaffirmed their determination to strengthen the  Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to turn  it into an open-ended and global pact.[.sup]1[/]    Despite the good intentions of Russia and the United States  and of the majority of countries in the world community,  however, North Korea's actions have given rise to the most  severe crisis in international non-proliferation policy since  the time the treaty first went into effect (in 1968).    On 12 March 1993 the DPRK officially notified the UN  Security  Council of its intention to withdraw from the Treaty on the  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and thereby free itself  from its political obligation not to develop nuclear weapons.  The DPRK became the first country in the world to announce its  planned withdrawal from the treaty. This decision could set a  dangerous precedent and have a negative effect on the nuclear  non-proliferation framework, which is overseen by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A letter to the  foreign ministers of the states party to the treaty says that  the DPRK decided to withdraw from the treaty in connection with  the state of emergency that arose in the country as a result of  the American-South Korean "Team Spirit" maneuvers and with the  "unfair resolution" the IAEA Board of Governors passed on 25  February, demanding that military installations with no  relationship to nuclear activity be opened for inspection.  Article 10 of the treaty says: "Each party to this treaty shall,  in exercising its national sovereignty, have the right to  withdraw from the treaty if it decides that extraordinary  events, related to the subject matter of this treaty, have  jeopardized the supreme interests of its country. It shall give  notice of such withdrawal to all other parties to the treaty and  to the UN Security Council three months in advance. Such notice  shall include a statement of the extraordinary events it regards  as having jeopardized its supreme interests."    When the DPRK made the announcement, it also put its army on  red alert, and the Republic of Korea responded by doing the  same. "A war between the DPRK and the United States could break  out at any moment," the DPRK ambassador to the United Nations  declared.    Many experts believed just a short time ago that the threat  of a North Korean nuclear weapon was considerably diminished, if  not completely non-existent. After signing the Non-Proliferation  Treaty in 1985, the DPRK agreed to put its nuclear facilities  under IAEA control in 1992. Inspections created strong  suspicions, however, that the declared quantity of plutonium was  far smaller than the amount actually produced. On 25 February  this year the IAEA decided to conduct a "special inspection,"  envisaging access to any and all facilities and gave the DPRK a  month to open two facilities where the undeclared plutonium  might be located. The DPRK responded by announcing its  withdrawal from the treaty.    This was the beginning of the crisis in the nuclear  non-proliferation framework, which was then alleviated in a  somewhat unexpected manner. Just one day before Pyongyang's  decision would become a reality, on 11 June, a joint  American-North Korean statement was published and said that the  DPRK "is unilaterally postponing any action on its intention to  withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear  Weapons for the period of time it deems necessary."    The nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula had tremendous  repercussions in the world community. There is widespread  interest in assessments of the DPRK's technological capabilities  for the development of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass  destruction, the motives behind its announced withdrawal from  the treaty, the implications of this decision for the  non-proliferation framework, and the role of the world's leading  countries, the United Nations, and the IAEA in resolving this  crisis.  <H5>  Arsenal and Potential </H5>   Nuclear potential: Experts agree that Pyongyang  has the industrial potential to build nuclear weapons. The  network of atomic industry facilities that was built up over  almost three decades of work on the nuclear program in the DPRK  could be used for military purposes.    A 200-MW gas-graphite natural-uranium reactor is being  built,  for example, and sites are being chosen for the construction of  three 635-MW reactors. There are two plants for the enrichment  of uranium. There are uranium mines in Pakch'on and Pengason.  Uranium reserves have been estimated at 26 million tonnes of ore  (over 15,000 tonnes of uranium).    With the help of the USSR and the PRC, the DPRK used its  existing crude resources to build a scientific-experimental  infrastructure in the 1950s and 1960s and began training the  necessary group of specialists. The DPRK has several specialized  scientific research institutes, including the nuclear power  engineering and radiology institutes, the Nuclear Physics  Department of Pyongyang University, and the School of Nuclear  Research Technology at the Kimch'aek Polytechnical Institute.    History and the Present Day: North Korea's nuclear  research began right after World War II. Attracted by the DPRK's  deposits of uranium ore, the Soviet Union assisted in geological  prospecting and the assessment of reserves for the possible  development of an atomic industry. Western experts believe that  the ore began to be mined and exported to the USSR in the late  1940s. In 1952, at the height of the Korean War, China took an  interest in North Korea as a source of uranium for its own  nuclear bomb. At that time the USSR and the PRC were working  together closely in the atomic field, including its military  spheres. In 1955 researchers from the North Korean Academy of  Sciences addressed an international conference on the  development of atomic energy in Moscow. In 1956 the USSR and  DPRK concluded an agreement (which was renewed several times) on  cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. In accordance  with this document, scientists and experts from North Korea  received instruction and training at atomic facilities in the  USSR, particularly in Dubna.    Pyongyang signed the same kind of agreement with the PRC.  According to some reports, Korean specialists were trained in  the Chinese nuclear research center in Lop Nor and were even  present when nuclear weapons were tested.    The Atomic Research Center, where the main nuclear projects  were conducted, was established in Nenben in 1964. In 1965 the  USSR supplied the DPRK with a 5-MW research nuclear reactor,  which has been under IAEA control since 1977. The North Koreans  began building their own reactor in Nenben in the beginning of  the 1980s. This 50-MW reactor is scheduled to begin operating in  1995. It is significant that both reactors, the 5-MW and the  50-MW, are categorized as dual-purpose reactors and can be used  to generate electricity and to produce weapons-grade plutonium.  Israel and India used the same kind of reactors for this  purpose. Experts agree that light-water reactors are preferable  for civilian needs and gas-graphite reactors are the best choice  for military use.[.sup]2[/]    According to estimates, the research reactor began operating  in the middle of the 1980s and is capable of producing 4-7  kilograms of plutonium a year. The more powerful reactor in  Nenben can produce 40-60 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium  each year.    The gas-graphite natural-uranium reactor in T'aech'on  (around  80 kilometers from Pyongyang) is capable of producing 160-200  kilograms of plutonium a year. The combined product of the three  reactors would amount to around 200-260 kilograms of  weapons-grade plutonium a year.    Before the plutonium from reactors can be used to produce  nuclear weapons or in breeders, it has to be extracted from the  spent fuel in special radiochemical plants. The construction of  this kind of enterprise began at the end of the 1980s in Nenben.  Experts have estimated that it will be capable of processing  several hundred tonnes of nuclear waste a year. According to  DPRK spokesmen, the plutonium regeneration enterprise is being  built as part of the program for the development of breeders and  is a laboratory rather than a plant. Western experts doubt  Pyongyang's ability to carry out this kind of program. Only a  few industrially developed countries, such as Japan, could  afford the high cost of this kind of program. On 22 July 1992,  IAEA Director General J. Blix said that this enterprise meets  all of the criteria of a plutonium regeneration plant, and not a  laboratory. According to IAEA estimates, 80 percent of the  construction and 40 percent of the installation and adjustment  work have already been completed. It will begin operating at  full capacity within 4-5 years and will cost hundreds of  millions of dollars.    In March 1990 North Korea reported that a gram of plutonium  had been isolated from the spent fuel of the 5-MW research  reactor in the regeneration plant. In connection with this,  Western experts suggested that the plutonium isolation projects  could have been going on for a long time, and not only in the  facility in Nenben, but also in special laboratories at  Pyongyang University, with its projects in experimental nuclear  physics, and the so-called "hot cells" the USSR had delivered to  the DPRK in the 1970s as elements of the research reactor. In  addition, they did not exclude the possibility of an underground  plant for the regeneration of plutonium, serving as a unique  link between laboratory projects and the industrial production  of plutonium. None of this answered the main question: How much  weapons-grade plutonium does the DPRK have, and how close is it  to a nuclear weapon of its own?    Reports of intelligence services: A report of the  Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service had this to say:  "At this time the DPRK does not have a nuclear weapon....  Available data...indicate that the widespread speculation  regarding the 'breakthrough' in the DPRK's development of its  own nuclear weapons is seriously doubtful. There is a gap in the  technological chain the DPRK built back in the 1970s: the  development of the raw material base--experimental research--the  generation of fissionable material--the creation of an explosive  device--tests of the device--the `perfection' of delivery  vehicles--the development of a nuclear weapon. The break  occurred in the plutonium generation link."[.sup]3[/]    The CIA has a different opinion. According to the head of  this agency, J. Woolsey, there is the real danger that North  Korea has enough fissionable material to build at least one  nuclear device and conceal it from the IAEA. Defense Secretary  L. Aspin admitted on "Meet the Press" on 14 March 1993 that U.S.  intelligence had come up with conflicting estimates of the  amount of plutonium North Korea had produced and conflicting  opinions as to whether it had enough to build a bomb.    The intelligence data the South Korean defense minister  cited  when he addressed parliament on 16 March 1993 indicate that  Pyongyang has the basic nuclear technology and has even tested  detonators for nuclear devices. Some of the missiles in the DPRK  arsenal could carry nuclear warheads and could reach any part of  South Korea, and one type could even reach western Japan. At  this time the DPRK is working on the SCUD-X missile.[.sup]4[/]    According to a report the Japanese Foreign Ministry prepared  in March 1993, the DPRK is completely capable of obtaining from  16 to 24 kilograms of plutonium--enough to build an atomic bomb.    Missile delivery systems: Short-range missiles of  the Frog-5 and Frog-7 categories, acquired from the USSR in the  late 1950s, and updated Soviet-produced SCUD-B missiles and the  North Korean SCUD-C model make up the basis of North Korea's  delivery vehicle potential.    The DPRK is using technology from Egypt to upgrade SCUD  missiles acquired earlier from the USSR and is exporting them to  countries in the Near and Middle East, thereby violating the  framework set up in 1987 by the leading industrially developed  countries to control the spread of missiles and missile  technology. The importers of the missiles include Syria, Iraq,  and Iran. According to L. Spector from the Carnegie Foundation,  the DPRK and Iran concluded a special agreement on cooperation  in missile engineering in 1990, and the PRC assisted the DPRK in  missile development projects.[.sup]5[/] The North Korean  medium-range Nodom missile with a range of around 1,000  kilometers is in the testing stage. According to the Japan  Defense Agency, in May 1993 North Korea tested the Nodom-1  medium-range ballistic missile. Experts noted that the missile  was close to completion and could be deployed soon.    All of this has led experts to believe that the DPRK has its  own missile industry, producing models which might be used as  delivery vehicles for chemical weapons, and then for nuclear  weapons after the necessary modifications.    The Foreign Intelligence Service reports that the DPRK has  encountered several objective difficulties in the development of  the missile industry, primarily due to the shortage of skilled  personnel, scientists, and engineers and the comparatively low  technical level of industry. This is why the DPRK is actively  seeking specialists abroad to attain greater success in missile  engineering and turn it into a competitive branch.[.sup]6[/]  The territory of the former Soviet Union has been named as one  of the locations of this search. With a view to contacts of long  standing, the DPRK expects the crisis in the military industry  to result in a brain drain and the solicitation of export  orders. Russian Security Minister V. Barannikov reported in  December 1992 that his service had thwarted the attempts of more  than 30 rocket scientists to cross the border in order to go to  work in a third country. A more specific later report said that  they were going to the DPRK.[.sup]7[/] The Russian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs issued a protest to the DPRK and threatened  the severance of relations unless Pyongyang stopped its attempts  to lure Russian scientists and specialists to the DPRK.    The DPRK's airborne delivery systems are MIG-25 and MIG-29  planes it bought from the USSR.    IAEA control: As mentioned above, it was not until  January 1992 that a delegation from the DPRK signed an agreement  on nuclear safeguards with the IAEA in Vienna. Pyongyang pledged  to grant IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear facilities. This  occurred more than seven years after the DPRK had become party  to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The main reason for this long  delay was North Korea's demand for the removal of U.S. nuclear  weapons from the southern half of the Korean peninsula.    The U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea were covered by the  U.S.-USSR agreement (September 1991) on the elimination of land-  and sea-based tactical nuclear weapons. In December 1991 Seoul  officially announced that all American nuclear weapons had been  withdrawn. That was also the time when the DPRK and the Republic  of Korea signed an agreement on reconciliation, non-aggression,  bilateral exchanges, and cooperation and the document declaring  the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone. In 1992 there were  several official announcements by the President and defense  secretary of the United States that tactical nuclear weapons had  been withdrawn from Asia and Europe. Independent American  experts W. Arkin and R. Norris confirmed the fact that 151  nuclear weapons had been removed from South Korea. In 1992 the  United States and South Korea cancelled the "Team Spirit" annual  combat maneuvers as a goodwill gesture.    When the DPRK was signing the agreement with the IAEA, it  submitted a list of nuclear facilities and the nuclear materials  in its possession. The list said that North Korea had derived  several grams of plutonium from the spent fuel of an  experimental reactor. Pyongyang assured the IAEA that  representatives of the agency could visit any sites they wished,  including installations which were not on the official list of  facilities subject to inspection.    In November 1992 IAEA technical experts were studying the  discrepancy between the radioactive content of the small  quantity of plutonium and the products of reactor waste.  Although the quantity of plutonium North Korea had declared was  far below the amount required to build a nuclear weapon, the  discrepancy led to the understandable suspicion that the amount  of plutonium produced might exceed the amount declared.    The IAEA inspectors hoped to answer this question by first  gaining access to the reactor core, to check how many fuel rods  had been removed for the extraction of plutonium, and then  visiting two suspicious facilities in Nenben. North Korean  spokesmen said the reactor could not be inspected until it had  been shut down, so that the rods could be removed. The agency  hoped that the scheduled replacement and, consequently, the  inspection might occur between April and October 1993.    Meanwhile, the North Korean Government had refused the IAEA  access to the suspected nuclear waste storage sites on the  grounds that these were military installations and that they had  no connection to the nuclear program. The North Korean Ministry  of Foreign Affairs said that the heads of the IAEA had no right  to use U.S. intelligence information as grounds for a so-called  "special inspection," presupposing the inspection of non-nuclear  facilities. The IAEA stood its ground and warned the DPRK that  the matter would be discussed by the IAEA Board of Governors,  which passed a resolution on 25 February 1993, requesting the  DPRK to grant IAEA inspectors access to the suspicious  facilities within a month. The arguments between the DPRK and  IAEA reached their peak when the United States and South Korea  resumed the annual "Team Spirit" maneuvers. It was then that  Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation  Treaty.    A DPRK Foreign Ministry note of 15 March stressed that the  discrepancy between official information and the results of  agency measurements was the product of the IAEA Secretariat's  fabrications. The DPRK protested the 25 February resolution on  the "special inspection" and said it was withdrawing from the  Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in defense of  its own sovereignty.    At a special meeting on 18 March 1993 the IAEA Board of  Governors passed a resolution expressing concern over the DPRK's  announced withdrawal from the treaty, stressing that the  agreement on safeguards with the DPRK was still in force, and  requesting the DPRK to reconsider its decision and help the  agency clear up the inconsistencies the inspections had  revealed. This was the main topic of discussion at another  meeting of the board on 31 March 1993.    Experts have said that it is of fundamental importance for  the IAEA to learn the truth about the DPRK's nuclear program.  After the IAEA failed to detect Iraq's nuclear weapons program  before the war in the Persian Gulf, it became the target of  harsh criticism and its effectiveness was in doubt. In the case  of the DPRK, the agency intended to do its job thoroughly, and  if North Korea were to refuse inspections in the three months  remaining before the expiration of its treaty membership, the  IAEA was prepared to turn the matter over to the UN Security  Council.  <H5>  Possible Motives </H5>   Experts and specialists have three explanations for the  DPRK's decision to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.    The first explanation essentially says that  Pyongyang wants to continue working on the military atomic  program it adopted in the 1970s without being bound by political  commitments or feeling the need to conceal its nuclear  preparations from the IAEA.    In this case, the decision to deny the inspectors access to  the suspect facilities and prevent the determination of the  precise quantity of plutonium produced seems completely logical.  After the lessons the IAEA had learned from the inspections of  nuclear installations in Iraq, when the latter had managed to  conceal the degree and scales of its progress in the development  of nuclear weapons, Pyongyang could hardly expect to fool the  agency experts for long. Eventually, sooner or later, the IAEA  would discover the military atomic program, and then the  Security Council would take the same measures it had taken in  the case of Iraq. These denuclearization measures still do not  apply to countries which are not party to the Non-Proliferation  Treaty and do have secret military nuclear programs, such as  Israel, India, and Pakistan. That meant that it was politically  more convenient for a country striving to develop a nuclear  weapon not to be a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.    What lay behind the decision to create atomic potential?  When  American nuclear weapons had been deployed in South Korea and  American military and political leaders had implied several  times during the cold war that they were prepared to launch them  at the first sign of hostilities between North and South Korea,  the DPRK's motives had been unequivocal--it wanted to neutralize  the nuclear threat from the south with its own weapons. The main  motive for the development of nuclear weapons disappeared,  however, after the removal of the American weapons from the  peninsula.    In spite of this, experts have noted that military and  political factors are still influencing the DPRK's choice in  favor of nuclear weapons. After Russia's denunciation of the  treaty on friendship and mutual assistance with the DPRK in  1992, accompanied by its development of political and economic  relations with the Republic of Korea, and after the PRC had  recognized the Republic of Korea, self-reliance, including  reliance on its own potential nuclear strength, acquired  decisive significance. At a time when the north was clearly  losing the economic competition, people in Pyongyang may have  believed that atomic potential could become the main political  instrument and means of leverage in bilateral relations with  Seoul. They probably expected the development of weapons of mass  destruction to confer greater stability on the regime of Kim  Il-song and his dynasty in the country.    In addition to all of this, as long as nuclear weapons are a  symbol of military and political might, they will be a cherished  dream of states hoping to play a prominent role in their own  regions and in international affairs. This applies not only to  the DPRK, but also to Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya, not to  mention such de facto nuclear states as Israel, India, and  Pakistan. All kinds of surprises can be expected from these  states--from the secret development of atomic potential to open  withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This has been  pointed out repeatedly by prominent experts in the United States  and in Russia.[.sup]8[/]    The second explanation is that the DPRK wants to  gain maximum advantage from a promise to give up its advanced  nuclear arms program in exchange for military, political, and  economic dividends in its relations with South Korea, the United  States, and Japan. People in Pyongyang might believe that these  states will pay a higher price for access to the DPRK's atomic  facilities than the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the  southern half of the Korean peninsula.    Pursuant to the declaration of the nuclear-free zone, the  DPRK and the Republic of Korea established a joint commission  for nuclear verification. It was supposed to define the scales  and principles of bilateral inspections. The commission met  several times in 1992, but its work reached an impasse when the  two sides could not reconcile their differences of opinion:  South Korea, with its diversified atomic industry, including 10  nuclear power plants which have been covered by IAEA safeguards  since 1975, proposed an equal number of inspections of atomic  facilities and other military installations; the DPRK said the  facilities in Nenben could be inspected in exchange for access  to all American bases in South Korea, to verify the absence of  nuclear weapons there.    North Korea continued to allege that there were nuclear  weapons in the south of the peninsula, despite South Korean  President Roh Tae Woo's statement about the lack of those  weapons in the country, and asserted that nuclear-powered  submarines with nuclear weapons on board were still sailing into  the American submarine base in Chinju. The South Korean  representatives responded by denying the existence of nuclear  weapons and military bases for nuclear submarines on their  territory and said that Seoul would agree to mutual inspections  of installations, but the demand for unilateral inspections of  the South Korean military bases was unacceptable.    Some experts feel that Pyongyang might decide to return to  the Non-Proliferation Treaty if it gets firm guarantees of the  absence of nuclear weapons on American bases and of the  withdrawal of all American troops (36,000 men) from the  territory of South Korea. The idea of turning the Korean  peninsula into a zone free of weapons of mass destruction,  including nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weapons,  could contribute to the security of the peninsula. This opinion  was expressed by Russian President B. Yeltsin in the South  Korean National Assembly in November 1992. The only question  concerns the means of accomplishing this.    The resumption of the "Team Spirit" maneuvers had an  indisputably negative effect on the North-South dialogue on  nuclear verification issues. The United States' declared  willingness to reduce its military presence on the Korean  peninsula dramatically by the year 2000, however, could be a  step in the right direction. It is precisely the American  military presence and the security of the DPRK that could be  used, according to some experts, as bargaining chips to  encourage the DPRK to return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.    The third explanation combines elements of the  first and second. On the one hand, Pyongyang may have decided  that withdrawal from the treaty would give it more freedom to  pursue its nuclear preparations and, on the other, the further  it progresses in the development of weapons of mass destruction,  the higher price it can charge for its return to the  Non-Proliferation Treaty. Furthermore, it is even possible that  Pyongyang has chosen the extremely risky course of openly  declaring itself a nuclear state at some time in the future, so  that it can negotiate security issues on the Korean peninsula on  a fundamentally new level and demand the complete withdrawal of  U.S. troops in exchange for the renunciation of its nuclear  status.    Today it is difficult to judge which of these explanations  is  an accurate description of the motives behind the DPRK's  decision to withdraw from the treaty.  <H5>  International Reaction </H5>   The overwhelming majority of countries in the world, both  industrially developed states and developing countries,  expressed serious misgivings about the DPRK's announcement.    The United States: At a press conference on 16  March this year, President B. Clinton expressed the "deep  concern" of the United States, and the hope that Pyongyang would  reconsider its decision during the 90 days between the  announcement and the date the decision would go into effect.  Observers noted the subdued nature of the U.S. reaction. When  Secretary of State W. Christopher addressed the House  Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs on 25 March, he said: "The  United States is still working with the IAEA, the United  Nations, and the Asian countries to persuade North Korea not to  withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its inspection  framework. There is still time for this work to produce results.  We feel that sanctions against North Korea might be effective.  If we reach the point of UN actions against North Korea, there  will be several ways of exerting pressure.... We do not want to  reach that point, however, and we hope that North Korea will  acknowledge its error."    Meanwhile, U.S. military and political leaders were  suggesting that if the DPRK did not change its mind, it might be  advisable to consider launching a "limited strike" at its  nuclear installations. In particular, Congressman J. Murtha  suggested this. Commentators said, however, that this could  start a war on the Korean peninsula. The Clinton administration  does not want this to happen.    Russia: Russian Foreign Ministry spokesmen  described the DPRK's decision as an unprecedented, disturbing,  and dangerous move and expressed the hope that North Korea would  change its mind. A special meeting of the IAEA Board of  Governors was convened at Russia's suggestion. The idea of  convening a special conference of five states--North and South  Korea, the United States, the PRC, and Russia--was discussed in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Commentators have noted,  however, that Russia has had no major way of influencing the  DPRK after the almost complete cessation of shipments of Russian  raw materials and arms to North Korea.    The PRC: As an ally of the DPRK, Beijing did not  express its opinion, and it did not confirm its role as a  mediator in the DPRK's relations with the United States. The  Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did stress, however, its  support for a nuclear-free zone on the Korean peninsula.    Japan: On 19 March 1993 Prime Minister K. Miyazawa  expressed deep regret over the DPRK's announcement, but he asked  the international community to give Pyongyang a chance to  reconsider its decision before taking any measures against the  DPRK. Japanese Defense Minister M. Sukuma said that the chance  of war on the Korean peninsula was slim, although it could not  be called non-existent. Tokyo implied that economic aid to the  DPRK would be out of the question until the nuclear issue had  been settled. According to reports in newspapers, Japan, the  United States, and the Republic of Korea agreed to submit the  "Korean question" to the Security Council for consideration  unless the DPRK changed its mind.    Republic of Korea: Seoul had the most frightened  reaction. It asked the countries of the world to exert pressure  on Pyongyang. South Korea put the 650,000 personnel in its armed  forces (the DPRK has 1.1 million) on red alert. According to  reports in the press, Seoul planned to ask Washington not to  withdraw the 14,000 American soldiers participating in the "Team  Spirit" maneuvers, its B-1B bombers, and the Patriot air defense  systems from the country and to keep the aircraft carrier  Independence near the Korean coastline. Seoul warned that it  would refuse to finance economic cooperation with Pyongyang if  the latter did not change its mind. Expenditures on cooperation  were supposed to amount to 1.2 billion dollars in 1995, as  compared to 126 million in 1992.    Implications: The DPRK's decision could have  far-reaching negative implications for the Non-Proliferation  Treaty. It could set a dangerous precedent, and North Korea's  example could be followed by the states that have been irritated  by IAEA inspections for a long time because they complicate  secret projects in the nuclear sphere. Experts have included  Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya among the future "deserters." This  could reinforce the reluctance of several "threshold" countries,  such as Brazil and Argentina, to become party to the treaty, and  it could strengthen the determination of such countries as  Israel, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan to stay outside  the non-proliferation framework.    If the DPRK continues to follow the nuclear path and  acquires  nuclear weapons of its own, this event, experts agree, could  have the most dramatic implications for the non-proliferation  framework. In this case, South Korea will have to reconsider its  attitude toward nuclear weapons and might decide to develop  them, particularly in view of the fact that it has the  industrial base for this. If an arms race starts on the Korean  peninsula, Japan is unlikely to stay out of it, and it might  have to begin the agonizing reassessment of its own traditional  non-nuclear stance. Experts believe that Japan could have its  own nuclear weapon within a year after this decision has been  made. This would have global implications. Other Asian  countries, especially Taiwan, are also likely to join the race.  Experts have pointed out the fact that the DPRK is already  capable of exporting technology and materials to other states in  violation of the nuclear non-proliferation framework. This  capability will grow stronger with time.    Developments: After the DPRK refused to allow the  inspection of the suspicious facilities, the IAEA asked the UN  Security Council for help. The council met behind closed doors  on 12 May. The press reported that two definite points of view  were expressed during the discussion of this issue. The  supporters of the first (the United States and other Western  countries) insisted on severe economic sanctions against the  DPRK for its refusal to allow the IAEA inspection and its  decision to withdraw from the treaty. The advocates of the  second (the PRC and Pakistan) took a more neutral stance by  proposing a resolution requesting the DPRK to reconsider its  decision and return to the treaty ranks. The result was a  comparatively mild resolution, simply mentioning that the  Security Council would consider taking concrete and severe  measures if the DPRK did not comply with the request to return  to the treaty. It was passed by 13 votes, with two abstentions  (China and Pakistan), and it requested North Korea's observance  of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.    Paradoxically, the failure of the Security Council to  approve  economic sanctions against the DPRK could be of great benefit to  the prestige and the future of the non-proliferation framework.  A resolution on economic sanctions might have compromised the  treaty itself and invalidated Article 10, acknowledging the  right of parties to withdraw from the treaty. In this case, the  treaty would have lost one of its fundamental principles--the  principle of voluntary membership. Instead of remaining a free  association, it might have turned into a compulsory union, which  is certain to have undermined its prestige.    The very fact that this problem arose is an indication that  the mere existence of the treaty is not enough to guarantee the  actual non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United Nations  has to have a stronger role in enforcing the treaty. This can  only be done if the Security Council adopts a special  declaration on non-proliferation, stipulating possible responses  to similar problems in the future, whether they involve  withdrawal from the treaty or the open declaration of nuclear  status. The five permanent members of the Security Council  should begin drafting a declaration obligating the nuclear  states to eliminate their arsenals, and the non-nuclear states  to never create them. This declaration could be the deciding  factor in the reinforcement of the non-proliferation framework.    During the discussion in the Security Council, the DPRK  complained to the United States that Washington was continuing  to deploy nuclear weapons in South Korea and that the discussion  of nuclear issues could only be continued within the framework  of bilateral talks with the United States. The American  representative to the United Nations said that Washington was  willing to conduct these negotiations and stressed that the  United States had no intention of attacking North Korea and did  not have any nuclear weapons in South Korea.    The apparent possibility of breaking the deadlock was  realized in bilateral American-North Korean talks in New York  and Geneva (June-July). The first round resulted in the  publication of a joint statement, which said that the DPRK was  rescinding its announced withdrawal from the treaty.    This certainly can be viewed as a victory in the struggle to  uphold the authority and prestige of the Non-Proliferation  Treaty.    It is too early, however, to say that the crisis has been  surmounted, because the DPRK is still insisting that IAEA  inspectors will not be allowed access to the suspect facilities.    Prospects: At this time it is difficult for  experts to guess how the crisis will end. On the one hand,  Pyongyang's political ambitions and the scales and progress of  its nuclear program indicate an obvious desire to acquire  nuclear weapons of its own. On the other, the fact that all five  permanent members of the UN Security Council are party to the  treaty, and that they acknowledged the need for a consistent  fight against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in January  1992, suggests that the crisis might be resolved through joint  efforts, especially now that the overwhelming majority of  industrially developed and developing non-nuclear countries  share the "big five's" insistence on the need to strengthen the  Non-Proliferation Treaty and its framework. Experts believe that  the international community is facing its first test since the  war in the Persian Gulf, and only time will tell how it will end.  FOOTNOTES    1. IZVESTIYA, 6 April 1993.    2.

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / International Company News: Conti board seeks a conciliator BY NAILING his colours so firmly to the mast of an independent Continental, Mr Horst Urban, the former chief executive of the German tyre company, was finally the source of his own undoing. His blunt, aggressive tactics led to the rejection of the first merger proposal from Pirelli of Italy, but the supervisory board of the German tyremaker decided this week that conciliation rather than tenacity was what was required at this time of crisis in the industry. As a result he stepped down from his post. In the eight months since Pirelli's approach, conciliation has not been one of Mr Urban's notable characteristics. Bluff and outspoken, the amiable, pipe-smoking, Mr Urban is different, in many ways engagingly so, from the usual run of smooth-spoken, elegantly mannered German executives. He was born in Silesia (now in Poland), 15 miles from what is now the east German border. In 1945, as Russian troops advanced, he fled with his mother and two brothers. The young Horst was only nine years old and his father was a prisoner-of-war in the US. He remembers trundling a small cart with the family's belongings down the country roads. He went back briefly after the war and then returned to the west for good on a British army transporter. There was no opportunity to attend university. 'I had to leave school early to earn money. The first time I entered a university was when I gave a lecture.' Instead, he trained as a tax inspector in Stuttgart, ending up at Continental by way of IBM, Ford of Germany, and BMW. Mr Urban reckons his refugee years taught him a lot. They certainly strengthened his independent streak. He became chief executive of Continental in 1987, having joined the company in 1974. Then, it was flat on its back. 'If I'd known in what bad shape Continental was, I'd probably never have come', he joked. 'I found out soon enough.' Today, the company is in far better condition, but the industry is rapidly running out of air.</p>

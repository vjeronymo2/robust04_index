			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 475] </F>   [Excerpts] Vilnius, April 11, ELTA -- If Russia tried to  check the reaction of the Baltic countries and the whole region  by its last political steps, it became aware of the position of  the Baltic states on the issue, Seimas [parliament] Chairman  Ceslovas Jursenas told a news conference on Monday [11 April].    Jursenas noted that the reaction to Russia's intention to  establish new military bases in Latvian territory of each state  as well as of the whole region was "adequate, correct and  effective".    Jursenas emphasized the importance of the joint statement  made by the three presidents of the Baltic states and the  support for Latvia and Estonia expressed by Lithuanian Foreign  Ministry.    During the visit of Jursenas to Estonia on April 6-8 a lot  of  attention was given to the issues of the foreign policy of the  Baltic countries and its coordination. [passage omitted]    Jursenas also emphasized that, despite the hostile Russian  policy, neither Latvia nor Estonia shut the doors for the  negotiations with this country.</p>

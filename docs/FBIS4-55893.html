			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BETA-attributed report: "Serbs -- Common Enemies"] </F>   [Text] Pristina, (BETA) -- Stipe Mesic, chairman of the  Chamber of Deputies of the Croatian Assembly, stated for the  latest edition of ZERI, the Pristina weekly in Albanian, that  the so-called Republic of Kosovo was proclaimed by "the legal  and legitimate parliament" in that region.    Mesic believes it would be "perfectly logical" if "the  republic of Kosovo" were to have its representative and an  office in Zagreb. According to Mesic, the war between the  Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina was "absurd" since  both sides have "a common enemy -- the Serbs." Asked whether  Croatia will be able to incorporate the territory of the  republic of Serbian Krajina, Mesic said that first the Serbs in  Krajina would have to be "politically defeated."    "The most important thing is for the international community  to isolate Milosevic completely and to close off all the bridges  and roads via which Serbia supplies the Serb army in  Bosnia-Herzegovina with weapons," Mesic said. Mesic also said  that due to forceful pressure from Belgrade, Croatia had to ban  the news program in Albanian on Croatian Radio.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk today met with a  Palestinian delegation led by Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general  of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP].    During the meeting, they discussed the Palestinian situation  and the successive developments in the wake of the signing of  the Cairo agreement. The Russian envoy indicated the importance  of the terms of reference for negotiations on the  Palestinian-Israeli track, based on international legitimacy and  its resolutions, in a way that secures the Palestinian people's  right to establish an independent state and guarantee a just  solution to the refugee issue.    For his part, Hawatimah said the Cairo agreement fragmented  the Arab negotiation front and opened the way for separate and  partial solutions that cannot achieve comprehensive peace and  stability in the region. He indicated this agreement carries  the elements of its own failure.    Hawatimah demanded the activation of the Russian role in the  region in order to achieve the interests of the Arab and Russian  peoples and bring about real peace.</p>

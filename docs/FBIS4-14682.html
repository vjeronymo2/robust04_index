			<p>BFN     [Text] Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the  Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, has relayed the  greetings of leader President Saddam Husayn to the chairman and  members of the fifth congress of the Russian Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], which began its work in Moscow today.    In a speech delivered at the congress, comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani  'Abd-al-Ghafur said: It pleases me to relay the greetings of  leader President Saddam Husayn, as well as those of the  steadfast Iraqi people, and the cadres of the Arab Socialist  Ba'th Party cadres to the leaders and cadres of your party and  the friendly Russian people. The Ba'th Party wishes every  success for the congress in its efforts to achieve the LDP's  objectives in the interest of Russia and its future.    'Abd-al-Ghafur added: The LDP congress is being held under  complicated international circumstances, in which world peoples  are resisting all that has been brought by the so-called new  world order; namely, the U.S. attempts to dominate the world,  and the double standards employed in handling the issues of  international legitimacy, democracy, and human rights, and  abusing these values to interfere in the domestic affairs of  world peoples and deny them the right to lead the free and  decent life they deserve, not to mention the use of the United  Nations to oppress world peoples in violation of the UN Charter  and international conventions through the enforcement of  embargoes against world peoples to achieve selfish and rancorous  political objectives.    'Abd-al-Ghafur noted that the Iraqi people have been  suffering from an unfair and tyrannical embargo for the past  four years because they are determined to walk the path they  have chosen, and also because they are opposed to U.S. bids to  control their resources and undermine their national  sovereignty. He noted that the enforcement of the embargo  against Iraq is a form of international dictatorship practiced  by the United States against the world community and the United  Nations in order to achieve its objective of domination.    'Abd-al-Ghafur called for the lifting of the economic  embargo  clamped on the Iraqi people, saying: Iraq has fulfilled all its  commitments per the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,  even though they are unfair resolutions, at a time when the  Council has failed to honor its commitments toward Iraq due to  U.S. interference. This has been clearly manifest during the  recent UN Security Council deliberations. For the first time,  there has been a rift among the UN Security Council members,  particularly the permanent members. The positions of Russia,  the PRC, and France were marked by a measure of objectivity.  These positions marked a departure from the U.S. position, and  insisted that Iraq be granted some of its rights by way of  implementing Paragraph 22 of UN Security Council Resolution 687,  which allows Iraq to export its oil.    The Iraqi official hoped that Russia's recent position at  the  UN Security Council will be promoted and become more effective  to help lift the embargo and end the sufferings of the Iraqi  people. He asked the congress to attach special attention to  the issue of enforcing embargoes on peoples as a means to  achieve political objectives to the detriment of these peoples'  interests. He also urged the conferees to come up with  decisions and recommendations demanding an end to the embargo  clamped on the Iraqi people, particularly since Iraq has  fulfilled all its commitments.    The Ba'th official commended the struggle being waged by the  Russian people to uphold their dignity, sovereignty, and  independent decisionmaking, as well as their rejection of  attempts to impose custodianship and domination on them and the  attempts being made by some international forces that profess  false concern for them and their future at a time when they seek  to weaken Russia, because it is not in their interest to see  Russia reemerge as a powerful country occupying its deserved  position and standing in today's world.    'Abd-al-Ghafur stressed that the Iraqi people will never  abandon their freedom, dignity, independence, and their right to  walk the path they have chosen to ensure their livelihood,  because they are well aware that people who are stripped of  their dignity, freedom, and independent decisionmaking are  rendered lifeless. He reaffirmed that the Iraqi people will  continue their struggle and maintain their support for the  leadership of His Excellency President Saddam Husayn, given that  he is the symbol of the struggles waged by the Iraqi people, the  Arab nation, and humanity against global injustice and  oppression.    This speech by the member of the Iraq Command of the Ba'th  Party was welcomed by thunderous applause to show solidarity  with the just struggle waged by the Iraqi people, and with their  heroic confrontation of the forces of evil and aggression.    In an opening speech, LDP Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had  earlier asserted his party's total solidarity with the Iraqi  leadership and people, and its support for the just struggle  being waged by the Iraqi people to promote their freedom,  dignity, and independence. He urged the Russian leadership, on  behalf of the party and its fifth congress, to do whatever is  necessary to lift all aspects of the embargo clamped on Iraq.  He reiterated his party's firm position on the issue, and its  persistent efforts in internal and external forums to achieve  this objective, and end the Iraqi people's sufferings.    Zhirinovskiy urged his party members to close ranks and make  persistent efforts to promote the great accomplishments the  party has recently made, the accomplishments that have allowed  it to enter the Parliament, and that will allow it to win the  Russian presidency during the next elections.    The LDP leader criticized the deteriorating situation in  Russia, and held the current Russian leadership fully  responsible for the current situation in the country. He also  denounced the plots being concocted against his party by certain  government structures in Russia. He called for enhancing the  powers of the party leaders.    Some 343 delegates and 865 guests, including 14 foreign  delegations, attended the congress meetings.    Among the most important developments seen during the fifth  congress was a decision to hold the party congress every three  years, and a decision authorizing the congress to elect the  party leader, whereas the party leader shall appoint the party  command members and his close aides.</p>

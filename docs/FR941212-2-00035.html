David Messman, Branch Chief, at (202) 942&hyph;0564 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Each of the Trusts is a unit investment trust sponsored by the Sponsor. The Trusts are made up of one or more separate series (``Series''). Over five hundred Series have been created by the Trusts collectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Each Series is created by a trust indenture among the Sponsor, a banking institution or trust company as trustee, and an evaluator. The Sponsor acquires a portfolio of securities and deposits them with a trustee in exchange for certificates representing fractional undivided interests in the portfolio of securities (``Units''). Units currently are offered to the public through the Sponsor and other underwriters and dealers at a price based upon the aggregate offering side evaluation of the underlying securities plus an up-front sales charge. The sales charge currently ranges from 4.75% to 2% of the public offering price, and is subject to reduction as permitted by rule 22d&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants seek an order under section 6(c) exempting them from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), 22(d), and 26(a)(2)(C) and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to let them impose sales charges on Units on a deferred basis and waive the deferred sales charge in certain cases. Under applicants' proposal, the Sponsor will continue to determine the amount of sales charge per Unit at the time portfolio securities are deposited in a Series. The Sponsor will have the discretion to defer collection of all or part of this sales charge over a period following the purchase of Units. The Sponsor will in no event add to the deferred amount initially determined any additional amount for interest or any similar or related charge to reflect or adjust for such deferral. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Sponsor anticipates collecting a portion of the total sales charge immediately upon purchase of Units. A portion of the outstanding balance will be deducted periodically by the trustee from distributions on the Units and paid to the Sponsor until the total amount of the sales charge is collected. If distribution income is insufficient to pay a deferred sales charge installment, the trustee will have the ability under the trust indenture to sell portfolio securities in an amount necessary to provide the requisite payments. If a unitholder redeems or sells to the Sponsor his or her Units before the total sales charge has been collected from installment payments, the balance of the sales charge may be collected at the time of such redemption or sale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. For purposes of calculating the amount of the deferred sales charge due upon redemption or sale of Units, it will be assumed that Units on which the balance of the sales charge has been collected from installment payments are liquidated first. Any Units disposed of over such amounts will be redeemed in the order of their purchase, so that Units held for the longest time are redeemed first. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Sponsor intends to waive collection of the unpaid balance of the deferred sales charge upon any sale or redemption of Units. If applicants later decide to collect the unpaid balance of the deferred sales charge upon sale or redemption, they may nonetheless waive payment of the balance of the deferred sales charge on redemptions or sales of Units in certain specific cases. Any such waiver will be disclosed in the prospectus and will satisfy the other conditions of rule 22d&hyph;1. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

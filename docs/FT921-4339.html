			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / A spectacle to make even Pontius Pilate blush: How poor regulation made the plundering of Maxwell pension funds possible IF THE regulators had 'acted with the proper degree of suspicion . . . and if professional advisers' care had been commensurate with their fees . . . then the Maxwell pension funds would have been secure'. That is the conclusion of Mr Frank Field, chairman of the Commons social security committee, which yesterday published a 95-page report hitting out at City regulators, auditors and banks for their part in the Maxwell frauds, and calling for urgent and radical pension law reform. It also tells banks which received the stolen Maxwell funds that they have a 'moral duty' to compensate the Maxwell pensioners, a view likely to be vigorously contested. The committee's inquiry started nine months ago and found its work thrust into the spotlight by the death in November of Robert Maxwell, the publisher. It rapidly emerged that in the last year of his life he had plundered more than Pounds 400m from the pension funds of companies under his control to prop up his web of tottering private companies. About 30,000 past and present employees of Maxwell companies now face a severe drop in their income when they retire. In the committee's view the 'single good deed Robert Maxwell has done for pensioners generally is to ensure that this issue of the ownership and control of pension schemes is now high up on the political agenda'. The central problem is that the framework for pension scheme regulation is the law of trusts, dating back to the Middle Ages. That law leaves unclear the ownership of assets in some significant cases, in spite of the importance of these assets. For most people a pension is their second most valuable asset, worth an average of 70 per cent of the value of their house, according to the committee's report. Pension funds make up a third of the value of the UK stock market, or more than Pounds 160bn in 1989. About 40 per cent of adults - 19m people  - are members of occupational pension schemes organised by their employers, rather than state schemes, and the law can leave the ownership of these assets open to dispute. Where there is a surplus on the pension fund it is unclear whether this belongs to the employees and pensioners, or to the company. Many companies in the past decade used their legal ability to tap into pension surpluses as a means of justifying high prices paid in takeovers. Under present legislation responsibility for the supervision of pension funds is also unclear. Professional advisers and regulators involved with the Maxwell funds come in for fierce criticism from the committee for 'the strict compartmentalised view that each took of (its) role . . . As a committee we felt at times as though they (the professional advisers) were witnessing a bizarre 'game' of pass the pensions parcel . . . Pontius Pilate would have blushed at the spectacle of so many witnesses washing their hands in public . . . of their responsibilities'. In particular: The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), the City investment watchdog which authorised two fund managers to invest the Maxwell pension funds, is accused of telling the committee 'that (its) part of the self-regulatory system works well providing all the participants are honest'. The accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte is criticised for rarely attending trust meetings of the Maxwell funds although, by auditing many of the Maxwell companies as well as the two main pension funds, it was in a position to see the whole picture. The committee also criticises 'those investment banks which dealt in MCC shares for trusts and persons connected with Mr Maxwell'. This refers to the alleged illegal operation to support MCC shares by routing share purchases through offshore trusts. The committee does not name any banks, but US bank Goldman Sachs handled many of these share purchases. There is no evidence that it knew the origin of the money. Goldman Sachs is also understood to be the subject of the criticism of 'those investment banks who acquired shares in MCC during the closed period for directors dealings, and then later sold those shares to Mr Maxwell under option agreements, which if not illegal are questionable'. The committee makes two groups of recommendations from its observation of the Maxwell abuses. The first - that the next government should set up an inquiry leading to a new Pensions Act - is likely be seized by all parties for their election manifestos. The committee recommends an inquiry, perhaps with the additional powers of a Royal Commission, which could address directly the question of ownership of pension funds and would 'blow away' the ambiguities created by the law of trusts. In the committee's view, under new legislation the Occupational Pensions Board, one of the present regulatory agencies, should become the main agency for occupational pension funds, taking over many of the functions of Imro. The second group of the committee's recommendations - concerning compensation for the Maxwell victims - is likely to prove more controversial. The committee recommends that: An inquiry should consider whether to establish a pension compensation fund. The government, as former owner of British Airways, should consider urgently the claims of the pensioners of British International Helicopters, a BA subsidiary taken over by Maxwell. The government should point out to banks holding share certificates to which the Maxwell pension funds also claim title that they have a moral, if not legal, responsibility to return those assets. The committee also comments that 'the circumstances surrounding the MCC share support transactions are certainly those in which a substantial contribution to the rebuilding of the pension fund assets is more than appropriate'. The committee is one of the first bodies to examine and report on the Maxwell fraud. Its comments will no doubt be seized with warm enthusiasm by the defrauded Maxwell pensioners. However, those claims for compensation are likely to be vigorously contested - not least in court cases that have yet to begin. It will probably not be clear until those cases are well under way how much can be achieved for the Maxwell pensioners. There may be faster progress on the wider issue of pension reform, although the committee is realistic in its estimate that creation of new legislation will take a minimum of three years.</p>

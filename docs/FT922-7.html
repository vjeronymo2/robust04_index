			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Sharp futures drop STERLING futures contracts traded at their lowest since early May yesterday as the weakness of the pound caused a ripple of uncertainty on the UK money markets. In an otherwise quiet day - interbank rates barely moved - the September sterling contract fell 11 ticks from Friday's close of 90.18. This was the lowest level since May 5, when interest rates were cut from 10 1/2 per cent to 10 per cent. The December contract declined 10 basis points, touching a low of 90.32, and the March contract lost 7 ticks. Most traders said the bearishness of sterling futures trading was probably short-lived. 'Unless people actually think interest rates are going to go up, I cannot really see the contracts falling much further,' said one trader. Overnight cash rates ended cheaply at around 8 1/2 per cent after the Bank of England took out the liquidity shortage in the early afternoon. An initial forecast shortage of Pounds 850m was revised to Pounds 900m in the late morning, and again to Pounds 1.1bn in the afternoon. In the early round the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 48m, including Pounds 10m of band-3 bills at 9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 38m of band-4 bills at 9 19/32 per cent. Later it bought bills worth Pounds 157m. This comprised Pounds 23m of band-2 bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 112m of band-3 bills at the same rate as before, Pounds 7m local authority bills at 9 19/32 per cent and Pounds 15m of band-4 bills at the earlier rate. In afternoon operations the Bank met the shortage, buying Pounds 919m of band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Period interbank rates did not react as badly as sterling futures to the UK currency's weakness. One-month money ended at 10 1/8 per cent, unchanged from Friday. The three-month interbank rate - an important indicator of how the market thinks base rates will move - also closed at 10 1/8 per cent, 1/8 firmer. German call money hovered near the Bundesbank's Lombard emergency funding rate in spite of an injection of funds under Section 17 of the Bundesbank act. This allows the central bank to transfer public authority funds to the market for a limited period. Dealers said only a small amount was injected into the market yesterday, which had little effect on rates. Call money was quoted unchanged from Friday.</p>

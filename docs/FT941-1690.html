			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / People: Electronic switches Why should a former chief secretary and deputy governor of the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands, one of the UK's few remaining dependent territories, have heard of Kapiti? And what made him take the post of human resources director with one of the UK's more outlandishly named financial systems suppliers? The answer is that Mark Forrester, now 49, has had a broad and varied career including spells as private secretary to both Sir Edward Heath and Lord Wilson and head of personnel for Paribas Capital markets group. He learned about Kapiti, a private company with New Zealand connections and turnover to end 1992 of Pounds 24.3m, through spells with banking groups including County Bank, the merchant banking subsidiary of National Westminster. His experiences abroad qualify him to help Kapiti expand its international operations. Educated at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, Forrester spent the early part of his life in Whitehall, eventually moving into the establishment arm of the Civil Service and taking responsibility for personnel budgeting, training and pay negotiation. He joined the banking world in time to enjoy the City's Big Bang and its consequences and in 1992 took on a contract as head of administration for the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands, responsible for 1,200 civil servants and 13,000 islanders. He claims not to miss Grand Turk, six square miles of the West Indies that was his home for two years. The nearest he gets to it these days is Kapiti's Slough headquarters, incongruously named Key West. Ben Maddocks, 45, who joined Kapiti at the same time as marketing director, also has Caribbean connections. For a spell he worked in Bermuda with American International, the bellwether among property and casualty insurers. His background, however, is not in insurance but in chemistry and physiology. Educated at the University of Aston in Birmingham, he explains that an understanding of physiological processes is an excellent preparation for business process re-engineering and other transformations undergone by corporate bodies as well as living ones. He learned financial management with Burroughs Corporation and the Legal &amp; General group where he reckons to have been one of the first in the insurance industry to introduce standard costing techniques - commonplace these days, but revolutionary in the 1970s. After American International in Bermuda he worked with management consultants Touche Ross in Toronto and Price Waterhouse in the UK. His most recent role has been as managing director of Camsco in London, a subsidiary of Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the Austrian banking group. Camsco provides organisational and information technology services to the bank's international network. A disagreement over strategy with the management of Creditanstalt led to him joining Kapiti in February this year. The company was a pioneer of integrated banking packages in the 1970s and has continued to innovate in financial packages, including programs that operate in Japanese, Arabic and Cyrillic languages. Maddocks sees his role as interpreting the demand of the marketplace and ensuring they are met.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 290 SOVIET ATHLETES PUNISHED FOR DRUG USE, MOSCOW PAPER REPORTS  </P> <P> In the second revelation on rampant Soviet doping practices in less than a  week, a Moscow newspaper reported today that 290 Soviet athletes were punished  for using forbidden drugs in the three years before last summer's Olympic  Games.  </P> <P> "In the three pre-Olympic years, the anti-doping laboratory of the Sports  Committee had to work hard -- 290 of our athletes and trainers were punished  for doping," the newspaper Leninskoye Znamya (Leninist Banner) said.  </P> <P> Last week, the Soviet magazine Smena (Change) revealed that Soviet Olympic  athletes had their urine secretly prechecked for steroid use in a heavily  guarded $2.5-million laboratory on a ship docked near Seoul.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tightening Control  </P> <P> Leninskoye Znamya reported that the Soviet sports establishment is tightening  control over illegal drug use by athletes by expanding its spot-testing and  introducing new punishments.  </P> <P> "The struggle against doping is entering a new phase," Vasily Gromyko, deputy  chairman of the State Sports Committee, was quoted as saying by the newspaper.  "Now we're starting to spot-test athletes during training," not just before  competitions.  </P> <P> A new agreement with the U.S. Olympic Committee will grant Soviet and American  monitors the right to test each other's athletes, Leninskoye Znamya reported. A  Soviet delegation will fly to the United States for the first round of testing  within days, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> The Soviet sports committee also plans to start publishing the names of  athletes who are disqualified and punished for doping, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> The newspaper also revealed that world-class speed skater Liudmila Filimonova  was barred from competition for two years after testing positive for forbidden  hormones before the recent winter Spartakiad, a Soviet national competition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denials Contradicted  </P> <P> She and her trainer repeatedly denied that she was taking steroids, but tests  in East Germany and Moscow contradicted her, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> The Smena article said that dozens of cases of doping were revealed among  competitors in a recent Soviet youth Olympics and that many athletes were  encouraged to use steroids by their trainers or team doctors.  </P> <P> Some Soviet athletes, particularly in track and field and weightlifting, have  withdrawn from competitions after secret tests revealed that they would not be  able to pass official testing, Smena said.  </P></p>

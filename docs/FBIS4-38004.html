			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with PLO "Foreign Minister" Faruq </F> Qaddumi by RESALAT correspondent Jamileh Kadivar in Cairo "on  the sidelines of the Nonaligned Movement session"; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Kadivar] What is your opinion of the Gaza-  Jericho accord and the plan for an autonomous Palestine?    [Qaddumi] I had certain views and recommendations regarding  the peace talks that began in Oslo. I presented my views at the  Palestinian leadership session. As you are aware I have never  attended the talks since the accord in Oslo. As I mentioned  before, I had many recommendations and much criticism with  regard to this accord.    [Kadivar] Do you believe that the establishment of an  autonomous government in Gaza-Jericho will have positive results  for the Palestinians? In any case what specifically were your  recommendations and criticisms regarding the Oslo talks?    [Qaddumi] First of all, right from the outset, these talks  and the accord were not based on the formula of land for peace.  We had agreed with our brothers in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon  that we would support a solution based on that formula, However  the accord did not pay much attention or lay much stress on this  accord. In addition, there are no guarantees in this accord.  The United States and Russia should have guaranteed its  implementation. They merely contented themselves by  participating as witnesses.    In addition, there should have been some debate on the basic  issues, and a timeframe should have been discussed for these  issues. In the accord, most of the clauses are formulated in a  complex manner that demands further discussion so that the  implications are clear. The Zionists have used this device to  impose an interpretation of the clauses that accords with their  own wishes. That is why the talks are not achieving any clear  cut results.    [Kadivar] Recently 'Arafat had said that it is possible that  peace with Israel may be temporary. He mentioned this in South  Africa, and again some days ago. What is your opinion in this  regard? Why is 'Arafat repeating this stance?    [Qaddumi] The accord has some bases and principles that will  be specified in future talks. When the first and second accords  were signed in Cairo, the Israelis interpreted many of the  clauses as they wanted to, and the United States and Russia made  no effort to paraphrase and clarify them correctly.    As you know, this accord is for an interim period of two  years, but this does not mean that it is free of discrepancies  and difficulties.    [Kadivar] I have read the accord very carefully, but I have  not been able to comprehend precisely the limits of the powers  and obligations of the "Palestinian authority" or "the  autonomous government." Could you please explain the extent and  manner of these powers? How do you define relations between  Israel and Palestine? Do you have any historical examples of  such autonomy?    [Qaddumi] No! This has no precedent in history and is a  unique and exceptional phenomenon among international accords.  It is the responsibility of the Palestinian nation to create new  realities in the Palestinian homeland and to be able to  interpret the accord in a way that will enable it to attain its  national objectives. All of us believe that the Palestinian  people will eventually be victorious in this protracted struggle.    [Kadivar] What views do the Palestinian people, the  residents of the occupied areas, have regarding the accord?    [Qaddumi] At the outset, the people were in favor of it 100  percent, but today the number of its proponents has decreased.  The number decreased to 70 percent and now stands at 30  percent. This is due to Israel's behavior and its delay in  withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho. The Israelis do not adhere  to their commitments. The withdrawal has been delayed five  months. They renege on their words and promises as they wish,  as they are the ones who committed usurpation of the Palestinian  territories in the first place. The international climate and  situation is such that there is still no international pressure  on Israel to honor its commitments. [passage omitted]    [Kadivar] Until the accord was signed, there were numerous  differences between the two sides, such as the manner of using  roads, borders and so on. Have these issues been resolved?    [Qaddumi] There are certain peripheral issues that need to  be clarified, but they are not very momentous. As for the  highways, the Israelis have control over them and consider them  to be necessary for Israel's national security. They wish to  impose their own will and determination, even though the  highways are part of the national security of the autonomous  region, not just part of Israel's national or foreign security.    It is thus clear that Israel is continuing to contemplate  aggression and expansion. On the other hand, by raising such  issues it wishes to extort the maximum concessions from the  Palestinians or at least from the negotiating team.    [Kadivar] What is the status of 'Arafat's cabinet?    [Qaddumi] 'Arafat did offer cabinet positions to some  people, but they refused. The Palestinian Government as an  institution that can carry out all the administrative duties and  foreign relations does not exist in this setup. The accord says  that the PLO acts on its behalf in foreign relations. Therefore  I am outside the sphere of the administration; since I am only  in charge of the embassies, foreign and international relations,  I am not part of the administration. The PLO is the actual  political and legislative authority in the administration. This  means that the PLO Central Committee is the central government  and the government is a domestic body having no foreign  relations functions.    [Kadivar] When will 'Arafat go to Gaza and Jericho?    [Qaddumi] I think it will be in a few days.    [Kadivar] Can you draw an analogy between the Camp David  Accords and the Gaza-Jericho Accord?    [Qaddumi] They are similar in many respects and many of the  clauses are similar too.    [Kadivar] What are the differences?    [Qaddumi] There are not many differences except for the fact  that the Camp David Accords were signed by the Egyptians and the  Gaza-Jericho accord by the Palestinians.    [Kadivar] Then, when the Camp David Accords were signed, why  did 'Arafat condemn them and describe them as a form of  treachery and slavery? Do you not think that the Camp David  Accords brought greater benefits to the Palestinians than the  Gaza-Jericho accord?    [Qaddumi] The fact is that both the accords were  unfavorable, but as I said earlier, this was the choice of the  Palestinians. We merely chose the lesser evil, and that was  also because we were forced to. In fact, this accord is a  reality imposed by the larger countries; it imposes certain  international conditions on us.    After the dismantling of the Soviet Union and the end to the  Cold War and due to certain conditions in the Arab and Islamic  countries, which are in a relatively weak position, and the fact  that one power has imposed its will all over the world--all  these are characteristics of our contemporary era--we cannot  easily say that we could have gained much more than we have now.  [passage omitted]    [Kadivar] In your opinion, how true is it that the accord  was signed hastily due to the apprehension on both the Israeli  and Palestinian sides about the proliferation of Islamism?    [Qaddumi] I wish to mention something. The opinion of our  Iranian friends is of immense importance. You may ask any  question you like and repeat the answers verbatim.    [Kadivar] This is exactly what will be done. I am seeking  facts about the Palestinian issue and the Gaza-Jericho accord.  I remember two years ago at the Nonaligned Movement summit in  Jakarta, I strove to speak to 'Arafat about Palestinian issues.  Unfortunately, for no particular reason, he avoided speaking to  me, despite having promised to talk to me. Therefore I am  grateful that you have spared me some of your time.    [Qaddumi] 'Arafat is a religious person who has no fear of  Islamist leanings. Throughout the course of his life--I am one  of those who has been with him for nearly 40 years--he has not  had any close cooperation with the Muslim Brotherhood or with  any irreligious movements, but he does not fear Islamist  leanings. However, for certain specific reasons, he has  differences with them. As for Rabin, why does he fear Islamist  leanings?    There is no doubt that the Islamist movement is part of the  national and popular movement. I myself am one of those who  believe that this popular movement can and has the right to  struggle. We are all facing a common enemy. The only  differences are in the tactics and mode of tackling them.    The fact is that our people, our cultural and historic  legacy  is Islamic. Our roots and foundations are Islamic. However,  due to the evolving factors and developments in the world there  are differences in perceptions of issues. 'Arafat certainly  does not fear Islamism. [passage omitted]    It is Rabin who fears Islamist tendencies. He is afraid of  Iran, too, since he knows very well that Iran has Islamic  thinking and ideology and that Israel is a Zionist and usurper  country that has occupied "the holy land." He knows that the  Iranian policy and strategy is opposed to Israel, and we have  supported the Islamic Revolution right from its outset. In  Paris, I met imam Khomeyni and we had contacts with many Islamic  combatants prior to the victory of the Islamic Revolution.  'Arafat is truly Islamist in his thinking and way of life.  [passage omitted]    [Kadivar] Why is it, then, that from time to time 'Arafat  criticizes the proliferation of Islamism and the impact of  Iran's role on the Islamic movements or at least complains about  them? It is natural for Israel to say these things, but why Abu  Ammar? [Yasir 'Arafat]    [Qaddumi] Abu 'Ammar wants the Islamist movement to be in  contact with him and cooperate with him. Therefore the Islamist  groups are in touch with him and cooperate with him within the  PLO framework. There are many Islamist personalities who are in  touch with 'Arafat. The problem only begins when some groups  listen to the words of other Arab or non-Arab countries. This  generates differences, which have proliferated in the aftermath  of the signing of the accord.    [Kadivar] What is the outlook for the future of the region  after peace between Israel and Arab countries?    [Qaddumi] It is not easy to talk of complete peace with Arab  countries. For example, Syria has a clear stance that Israel  should withdraw from all occupied Syrian and Lebanese  territories. The Israelis say that they cannot function on two  fronts simultaneously and that first of all, issues should be  settled with the Palestinians. As you are aware, there are  still many differences with the Palestinians with regard to  withdrawal by Israel. Therefore, Syria will not sign any accord  with Israel until it withdraws completely from Golan and Lebanon.    [Kadivar] While we have witnessed Abu Ammar reneging on his  stance on talks with the Israelis, do you think Syria will do  the same?    [Qaddumi] I do not think so. I know Hafiz al-Asad and  Syrian policy very well and I do not believe he will retreat  from his stance.    [Kadivar] As you mentioned, it was due to certain  international developments that 'Arafat agreed to talks. The  same conditions existed for Syria as well. Why was it that  'Arafat succumbed to these conditions and Syria did not?    [Qaddumi] No. The circumstances for the PLO were different  from Syria's. If this little opening had not emerged, the PLO  would have encountered financial and political crises. In fact,  the PLO sought refuge in the Gaza-Jericho accord.    [Kadivar] How do you appraise relations between Iran and the  PLO?    [Qaddumi] Our relations are in fact friendly and fraternal.  Our embassy in Tehran is one of our largest embassies. Our  ambassador in Iran is brother Abu Salah--Salah al-Zawawi--with  whom I have been well acquainted since our youth. He is a  dynamic, able, and intelligent person, who, despite various  differences of opinion, has striven to maintain Iran-PLO  relations at the desired level.    There are many differences and strains that I believe are  tactical or ephemeral. All of us believe that we have a common  enemy before us.    [Kadivar] What are your expectations of Iran?    [Qaddumi] That on the basis of its policy it will continue  to defend us on the international level. As you see in the  world today, there is a new system which conflicts with our  aspirations and mores.    We should approach these circumstances in such a manner that  we can reach our objectives.    [Kadivar] I thank you for answering my questions with such  patience.    [Qaddumi] Thank you.</p>

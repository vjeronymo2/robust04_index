			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The assessments presented in the background documents are screens of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparative risks posed by use of substitutes, not assessments or rankings of the absolute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risks associated with use of each substitute. Designating a substitute as acceptable does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imply the absence of risks for that substitute, but rather that the substitute in question is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed to present lower overall risks than both the class I compound it is replacing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other substitutes available for the same end-use. For instance, in some cases, ozone-depleting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances can be replaced by chemicals with known toxicity or ability to contribute to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground-level ozone formation. The Agency's risk screen analyzes these effects, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP determinations generally describe as acceptable those substitutes for which risks from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacements would be lower on an overall basis compared to risks from other existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives, or for which such risks could be managed by developing and implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate regulatory controls. Additionally, in cases where the Agency has listed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute as unacceptable, it has assessed_as required in section 612_the availability of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes and concluded that alternatives with reduced overall risk are currently or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a rule, the Agency did not evaluate the technical performance of a substitute, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the purpose of the SNAP program is to examine environmental effects of substitutes identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as being of commercial interest regardless of technical acceptability. However, in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sectors, performance of the substitute does pertain directly to environmental or health effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, in refrigeration, the ability of a refrigerant replacement to serve as a coolant will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly influence the substitute's energy efficiency, which in turn will affect the substitute's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental effects. Similarly, in fire suppression, the ability of a substitute to put out fires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and thereby save human lives will directly affect a substitute's health effects. Further, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of narrowed use listings, the Agency's decision to grant or deny a narrowed use petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may hinge on the ability of potential substitutes to meet technical performance criteria. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, in the case of certain specialized solvents, some substitutes otherwise considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable may require special consideration because they are the only available substitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering performance characteristics deemed essential in a certain application. In cases such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as these, the SNAP analyses do consider the performance of a substitute as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's evaluation of each substitute in an end use is based on the following types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and analyses:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Atmospheric effects are assessed by predicting ozone depletion and analyzing total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> global warming potential, including chemical properties relevant to global warming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ozone depletion is based on market penetration of a substitute and is measured in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of cumulative Cl <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  loadings and its effect in terms of increased incidence of skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer cases and skin cancer mortalities. Analysis of total global warming potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes changes consideration of inherent properties such as atmospheric lifetime and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absorption spectra, as measured by the GWP index, and from changes in fossil fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use due to increases or decreases in energy efficiency resulting from production or use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the substitutes. Atmospheric lifetime is considered as an indicator of the likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persistence of an environmental effect or of the time lag to reverse any known or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unknown effect associated with an emission. The model used by the Agency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine atmospheric effects_the Atmospheric Stabilization Framework model_has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been used by the Agency in calculating the benefits from the phase-out of class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances. The model was peer-reviewed in connection with this earlier analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although scientific studies have pointed to the possibility of ecological effects due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone depletion, such as crop damage, the scope of existing studies is limited and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore these effects were not part of this analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Exposure assessments are used to estimate concentration levels of substitutes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which workers, consumers, the general population, and environmental receptors may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be exposed, and over what period of time. These assessments are based on personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring data or area sampling data if available. Otherwise, exposures are assessed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using measured or estimated releases as inputs to mathematical models. Exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments may be conducted for many types of releases, including releases in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workplace and in homes, releases to ambient air and surface water, and releases from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the management of solid wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Toxicity data are used to assess the possible health and environmental effects from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to the substitutes. If Occupational Safety and Health Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (OSHA)-approved or EPA-wide health-based criteria such as Permissible Exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limits (PELs, for occupational exposure), inhalation reference concentrations (RfCs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for noncarcinogenic effects), or cancer slope factors (for carcinogenic risk) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for a substitute, exposure information is combined with this toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to explore any basis for concern. Otherwise, toxicity data are used with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing EPA guidelines to develop health-based criteria for interim use in these risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Flammability is examined as a possible safety concern for workers and consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA assesses flammability risk using data on flash point and flammability limits (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA flammability/combustibility classifications), data on testing of blends with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flammable components, test data on flammability in consumer applications conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by independent laboratories, and information on flammability risk minimization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Some of the substitutes are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), chemicals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase tropospheric air pollution by contributing to ground-level ozone formation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Local and nationwide increases in VOC loadings from the use of substitutes is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

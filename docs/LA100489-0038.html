			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> MODERN QUARTET SKIPS FUSION AND SCORES WITH AN OLD FORMULA  </P> <P> Where is the modern in the Modern Jazz Quartet?  </P> <P> They play jazz -- no doubt on that score; and they are a quartet. How modern  they are remains subject to question, as the quartet made clear at the  Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Fortunately, pianist John Lewis and vibraphonist Milt Jackson, once looked on  as young radicals in the revolutionary bop band of Dizzy Gillespie, have proved  beyond question that modernity is not an essential component of their music; on  the contrary, their aim in recent years has been the conservation of qualities  all too scarce in the wake of the fusion era.  </P> <P> The values they hold dear are best represented by their collection of tributes  to Duke Ellington, which took up most of Sunday's program. In addition to  arrangements inspired by Ellington works of the 1930s and early '40s, there  were two original tributes: Lewis' "For Ellington," with its sublime evocation  of the Duke's quasi-gospel mood in his later years, and Jackson's "Maestro  E.K.E.," a languidly effective theme with easy interplay by Jackson, Lewis and  bassist Percy Heath.  </P> <P> "Ko-Ko," a minor blues, one of the all-time Ellington masterpieces, came to  life vividly with an often exact duplication of the original recording. Another  partial blues, "Sepia Panorama," similarly managed to capture with the four men  what Ellington had expressed through a 15-piece orchestra.  </P> <P> The only flaw in a generally inspired afternoon was the occasionally colorless  drumming of Connie Kay, whose tendency to underplay now and then weakens the  impact. On the slower works, however, notably the exquisite "Django" (played as  an encore), all four men achieved the magic blend that established this group  back in the early 1950s.  </P> <P> Jazz is sometimes called the sound of surprise. What emerges at a Modern Jazz  Quartet concert is geared not to surprise but to subtlety, serenity and  sensitivity. The formula still works as well as it did in the formative days  when this group provided an invaluable alternative in the already hectic world  of jazz.  </P></p>

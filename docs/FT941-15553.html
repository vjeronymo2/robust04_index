			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / People: Provident move to RBS venture Ian Chippendale is to head up a new insurance venture which will seek to emulate the success of Direct Line, the rapidly growing 'direct' motor insurer owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland. Royal Bank announced its plans to launch the new company, which will specialise in sales of non-standard motor and home policies, last November. Chippendale, 45, has been an executive director at Provident Financial, a successful consumer credit and insurance company, since 1989. Chippendale held responsibility for the group's operating companies in the insurance sector - including Halifax Insurance, a motor insurance underwriter which specialises in women drivers, and Colonnade Insurance Brokers, a chain of registered brokers - as well as overall responsibility for the group's corporate development. Chippendale will work closely with Peter Wood, the founder of Direct Line, who will be non-executive chairman of the new company. It will be launched before the end of the year and initially will be based in Leeds. Wood will invest Pounds 1m and own 40 per cent of the new company, with Royal Bank investing Pounds 1.5m to acquire 60 per cent of the ordinary equity and a further Pounds 22.5m in preference shares. Chippendale's appointment was announced at the Royal Bank's agm in Edinburgh yesterday where shareholders approved with only one dissenting vote a deal which replaces Peter Wood's controversial bonus arrangement with the bank. Wood, who received Pounds 18m last year, is to be paid a lump sum of Pounds 17m plus a contribution of Pounds 7m to his pension. He has also bought Pounds 7.5m worth of shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>

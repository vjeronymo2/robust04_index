			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canadian bank rises 11.2% HEALTHY stockbrokerage profit, rising fee income and higher interest from Brazil and Argentina helped Bank of Nova Scotia achieve a 11.2 per cent gain in second quarter net profit. Canada's fourth-biggest chartered bank earned CDollars 183m (USDollars 139.60m), or 77 cents a share, for the three months ended July 31, up from CDollars 165m, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Return on average assets was 0.71 per cent against 0.69 per cent. Net interest income rose 4.8 per cent and non-interest income 21.3 per cent. Noninterest expense was up 10 per cent. The bank reduced its country-risk provision by CDollars 200m, reallocating this to property and corporate loan provisions and raising the general provision from CDollars 50m to Dollars 250m. Nine-month profit was CDollars 520m, or CDollars 2.18 a share, up 2 per cent from CDollars 510m, or CDollars 2.2, on fewer shares outstanding. Return on assets was 0.69 per cent against 0.73 per cent. Total assets reached CDollars 105bn on July 31, up 9.2 per cent year-on-year and mainly a result of a 12.3 per cent increase in mortgages.</p>

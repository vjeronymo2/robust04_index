			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / CAP reform benefits may not reach consumers THE EFFECTS of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are more likely to be seen in the rural landscape of the UK than on its supermarket shelves. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said yesterday it estimated that the reform would reduce food prices by 2 per cent over the next three years, as long as savings were passed on. The 2 per cent figure refers to the food retail prices index, which includes many foods such as fruit which are not affected. Some food and farming organisations expressed doubts over whether the full effect of the cuts would be passed on to the consumer, however. Mr Martin Palmer, head of economic services at the Meat and Livestock Commission, said that the CAP cuts would not necessarily translate into lower end-prices. 'If you take those measures alone, without any other factors, yes, you should see a reduction in price. But there are lots of other factors,' he said. Mr Palmer said that farmers were already under pressure from consumers to produce increasingly high-quality meat at lower prices, while at the same time complying with concerns over animal welfare and the environment. The effect of the CAP changes might be to satisfy consumers' demands in those areas without raising prices in real terms. Some analysts suggested that big retailers would use the opportunity to increase their profit margins. Safeway, the supermarket chain, said it was too early to estimate price changes because EC intervention stocks would not be affected until the mid 1990s, but added: 'Whenever they do become available, all CAP-related price reductions in the food we buy will be passed on to customers.' The National Farmers' Union said: 'Farmers have no control over the retail price. It is very difficult, really impossible, to say how these cuts are going to be worked through - a whole chain has to be taken into consideration.' The Milk Marketing Board said that a small price cut was possible but this depended on various factors, and ultimately on what shops decide to charge. Mr Stephen Thornhill, head of marketing and economics at the Home Grown Cereals Authority, said that the basic cereal price would drop significantly but the effect might not be noticeable to consumers. 'The retail margin on pricing accounts for much more of the finished product price than the basic commodity, particularly in cereals,' he said. One food industry analyst said he thought that savings would be passed on because of consumer pressure. 'There is no way the processing industry will be allowed to keep them,' he said. 'I think it will go down the chain, right to the consumer.' A more vivid illustration of the effects of the CAP may be the appearance of the countryside. Britain's rural landscape could be transformed - particularly the vast swathes of agricultural land in areas such as East Anglia, Lincolnshire and Northumberland. Fifteen per cent of arable will stand idle as a result of the agreement on set-aside - more than 1.5m acres, or an area bigger than Devon. Friends of the Earth, the environment pressure group, warned that the set-aside agreement was a 'blunt tool', and should have been targeted to protect the environment, with conditions on the way farms were managed imposed on set-aside compensation payments to ensure they resulted in environmental gains. Set-aside land might be left fallow. This might provide wildlife sanctuaries, but only temporarily as much of the land would be rotated so there would be little long-term environmental benefit. Where the soil or weather is poor, the use of the land may change if farming ceases to be profitable altogether. Another transformation of the landscape could be the growth of US-style superfarms, as small farmers find it impossible to remain profitable and sell out to bigger farmers who can achieve economies of scale. This could have a double-edged effect on the economy. Mr Jim Ward, head of the agricultural research department at Savills, the agricultural and residential property consultant, said the CAP agreement removed the uncertainty that had blighted the agricultural land market for the last three years. He predicted an upturn in activity, perhaps returning to 1988 levels by next year. This could be followed by a slow increase in values. 'In the longer-term I'm very bullish about land prices,' Mr Ward said. But as farmers are forced to cut costs and boost productivity, there could be other significant socio-economic consequences. The Rural Development Commission had predicted a loss of up to 100,000 jobs in agriculture over the decade if the CAP were reformed. Mr Geoff Lutterloch, head of rural economy at the RDC, stood by the figures. 'Agriculture faces a painful period of readjustment,' he said. 'More than 14,000 agricultural jobs were lost in the year to June 1991 anyway, and we are predicting that farming will continue to lose labour throughout the decade.' The RDC launched its the Countryside Employment Programme earlier this year with pilot programmes in Lincolnshire, the Welsh Marches and the Cotswolds, selected as areas typical of those likely to be affected by CAP reform.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (2): Monopolies are being quickly eroded - Privatisation in Europe - Public perception often lags behind concrete reality - and telecommunications is no exception ACROSS western Europe, the general perception is that telecommunications are monopoly, state-run utilities. In reality, their monopolies are being fast eroded, and governments are rapidly disengaging themselves not only from the management, but also the ownership, of public telecommunications operators (PTOs). A decade ago, most of western Europe's PTOs were effectively government departments. Their policy was determined by the state; their finances were to all intents and purposes part of the state budget; decisions about tariffs and investment were taken by ministers; and the PTOs were generally grouped together with postal services to make a single state communications utility. No longer. With a few exceptions, PTOs have been separated from postal services. Most PTOs have also been given corporate status, turning them into free-standing companies with one shareholder, the state. Although their boards are appointed by ministers, who also determine overall policy, operational independence is the norm. There is no intrinsic reason why corporate status should not be a settled state. However, for most PTOs it is turning out to be a temporary staging post to full privatisation. In many cases it was always intended to be that way; but even where that was not the intention, pressures from overburdened state budgets and the liberalising international telecoms market have forced the pace. Within a year or two, only Austria, Norway, Luxembourg and Switzerland are likely still to have old-style state-run PTOs. The PTOs of Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland and Sweden are corporations, or soon will be. The first four all appear set to take further steps towards privatisation in the near future: Belgacom, the Belgian PTO, recently formed a 75:25 joint venture with Pacific Telesis, the US regional operator, to operate its new GSM cellular service. The step is widely seen as a trial run for privatisation of the company as a whole, although a strategic alliance with another US operator is thought to be unlikely. Telecom Finland is about to become a corporation, and from next January faces strong competition for voice traffic in its home market from a new consortium of regional operators. Telecom France did not feature in the first batch of state companies to be privatised by the centre-right Balladur government. But it is likely to appear on a future list. Telecom Eireann, the Irish PTO, is engaged in talks with Cable and Wireless, the UK group, about a possible alliance. Although the Irish government insists that privatisation is 'not on the agenda,' few Irish observers believe an alliance without a formal stake for the strategic partner will be Telecom Eireann's final destination. The rest of western Europe's PTOs are still further down the privatisation track. With the sale of the last tranche of government shares this summer, British Telecommunications is now entirely private owned. OTE, the Greek state operator, appeared to be the next in the queue, under a scheme voted through the Greek parliament earlier this summer to give a 35 per cent stake to a strategic partner with management control, with another 14 per cent to be floated on the Greek stock exchange early next year. However, the recent return of the Greek socialists, under Mr Andreas Papandreou, is likely to scupper the sale. The socialists are pledged to keep OTE in the state sector, though in what form remains to be seen. There will be at least three significant flotations in the next two years: Deutsche Telecom, the German PTO, will be the largest. Constitutional amendments to enable the privatisation to go ahead are about to be introduced into the German Parliament, with a first stake in the company set for flotation in 1996. Germany's will be an unusually complex privatisation, partly because of the delicate legal status of Deutsche Telecom and its employees, and partly because of the exigencies of a cross-party agreement with the opposition Social Democrats necessary to get the required parliamentary majority for the privatisation legislation. KPN, the Dutch posts and telecoms operator, is to be privatised in two stages over the next three years. The government has indicated that it intends to retain only about 30 per cent of the shares after the second sale. A minority stake in Tele Danmark, the Danish Operator, will be sold early next year. TD is already a publicly-quoted company, and earlier disposals have reduced the state's holding to 89 per cent. Those four are unlikely to be the only offerings on the horizon. Some of the corporations might reach the market in the same time-span. The Turkish government appears to have reached tentative agreement on a partial sale of PTT Turkey. Part or all of the PTOs of Spain, Italy and Portugal are already publicly listed companies, and a reduction in the government-owned stake is likely in all three. In Portugal and Italy, it will go hand-in-hand with a significant re-organisation of the industry. The operating subsidiaries of Stet, the Italian telecoms holding company, are to be brought together into a single company, provisionally named Telecom Italia. The three-company Portuguese industry is to be similarly rationalised. No privatisation blueprint exists. Although the PTOs are engaged in a common business, and many of them have comparable debt and investment profiles, each PTO has its own problems and peculiarities. Nonetheless, two models are emerging. For small PTOs, the favoured option is to sell a stake of about a third to an established international operator, in return for management expertise, investment and marketing resources. A further, though smaller stake can then be floated on the domestic stock exchange, leaving the state with a 51 per cent stake at the outset. For larger PTOs, a conventional flotation is the most likely course. This need not - and in most cases will not - preclude formal alliances with other international operators. A host of issues have to be resolved on a case-by-case basis - valuation, regulation, reserve government powers and guarantees of employee rights being only the most vexatious. Needless to say, consultancies and merchant banks are salivating at the prospect.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROPEAN COUNTRY STATISTICS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNTRY             Population      Access       CAGR, 1986                     in millions   lines (m)*     to 1991, %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium                9.84         4.10            4.6 Denmark                5.15         2.97            2.6 France                57.05        29.10            4.0 Germany               80.33        33.4             3.5 Greece                10.06         4.19            5.4 Ireland                3.52         1.05            6.7 Italy                 57.05        23.07            5.1 Netherlands           15.13         7.18            2.9 Portugal               9.85         2.69            9.2 Spain                 39.02        13.79            5.4 Turkey                 57.3         8.15           15.9 United Kingdom        57.37        25.60            3.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNTRY          Lines per   Mobile subs.

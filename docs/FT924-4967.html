			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Eemland hopes auction will cut Gillette link - Six unnamed groups will bid for Wilkinson Sword this week A CRITICAL phase in the disentangling of a bizarre international business imbroglio is set to open this week, as an auction gets under way for Wilkinson Sword, the shaving products and toiletries group. Six unnamed prospective bidders will enter detailed discussions with Eemland, Wilkinson's owner, and its advisers, the Swedish Enskilda bank and Goldman Sachs International, which put the business on the market last month. Eemland hopes the planned sale, which it aims to agree in principle by the end of the year, will rid Wilkinson of a deeply unwelcome financial involvement by Gillette of the US, its biggest competitor, which has aroused fierce opposition from competition authorities worldwide. A change of ownership should also relieve Eemland - a consortium owned by Swedish financial institutions, the JP Morgan Bank and Gillette - of mounting debt and give Wilkinson the financial and industrial muscle it needs to survive. The auction has been preceded by tense negotiations, as Eemland has haggled over the terms of the sale with Gillette, with which it has long had uneasy relations. Indeed, until recently the Eemland camp claims to have been uncertain whether Gillette was prepared to co-operate fully. 'It has been a poker game up to the last minute,' says one source close to the talks. Gillette's role and motives have been widely questioned since late 1989, when it helped finance a highly-leveraged Dollars 650m buy-out from Stora, the Swedish pulp and paper group, of the consumer products operations of the latter's Swedish Match subsidiary. As well as Wilkinson, these included a matches and lighter business. Gillette, with about 70 per cent of the world wet shaving market, wanted to buy Wilkinson's non-EC businesses. However, Stora insisted on selling Swedish Match, later renamed Eemland, as a package. Gillette's answer was a complex deal whereby it invested Dollars 13.7m to acquire a 22 per cent non-voting stake in Eemland and granted the consortium Dollars 69m of mezzanine debt. In exchange, Eemland sold Gillette Wilkinson's non-EC assets, while disposing separately of the matches and lighter business. The US company has always insisted it has no control over Eemland and would withdraw once the latter was able to repay the loan or could be publicly floated. However, it failed to convince competition authorities in Britain and Germany - or in Brussels, which issued a decision earlier this month. Concluding that Gillette was in a position to influence Wilkinson, the various authorities have ordered it to sever its links with Eemland and hand back Wilkinson's former non-EC businesses in Europe. Gillette has appealed against the UK and German rulings, though it did comply with a US order to return to Wilkinson its US operations. Eemland says Gillette never sought to meddle in its affairs. However, the consortium argues that its financial structure, of which Gillette was a principal architect, has kept Wilkinson on a tight leash. The terms of the Gillette mezzanine debt are particularly onerous. A roll-up loan with an interest rate 6 per cent above the London inter-bank offered rate (Libor), it will have grown to Dollars 112m by the end of this year, twice Eemland's Dollars 55.5m of equity. Though Wilkinson is in the black, with operating profits of DM46.8m (Dollars 29.4m) on sales of DM 316.3m last year, its margin is well below the 25 per cent assumed in its original business plan. It is unclear when, if ever, it would be in a position to repay the Gillette loan. Two developments brought matters to a head. One was the reluctance of Eemland's Swedish shareholders to inject further capital. The other was Gillette's apparent conclusion that it could not continue to stave off indefinitely pressure from competition authorities, particularly the EC, which is able to enforce its orders faster than national bodies. The opportunity for an exit was provided by the unexpected success of Wilkinson's Protector, an advanced shaving system launched in March. Developed on a shoestring budget, it is said to have overtaken sales of Gillette's rival Sensor in Germany and to be doing well in Britain - Wilkinson's two main markets. Eemland argues that the product offers a buyer willing to invest fresh resources a unique opportunity to re-build Wilkinson into a substantial market force before Gillette responds with a comparable razor of its own. There are also whispers of further Wilkinson innovations in the pipeline. However, the eventual buyer will have to limit its ambitions to only part of the world market. Gillette has agreed, as part of the sale, to hand back Wilkinson's former European businesses outside the EC. However, it has balked at requests by Eemland that it also return those in fast-growing regions such as Latin America and south-east Asia. In these markets, the Wilkinson brand is used on Gillette products. The consortium hopes to raise as much as Dollars 300m from the sale of Wilkinson, which will be sold debt-free. That sum should be enough to cover Eemland's liabilities, though it seems unlikely to provide its shareholders with much of a return on their investment. But it is likely to take several more tense hands of poker during the coming weeks before it becomes clear whether any of the prospective bidders - which include both financial groups and industrial companies  - are prepared to raise their stakes to that level.  ---------------------------------------------------------------                   CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF EEMLAND  --------------------------------------------------------------- At time of buy-out in 1989  --------------------------------------------------------------- EQUITY  ---------------------------------------------------------------                                            Amount paid                                       (Dollars m equivalent) Ordinary shares  --------------------------------------------------------------- Scandinavian investors   Copenhagen Handelsbank*                     4.8   Spira Invest                                4.0   Procuritas                                  1.9   SPP Insurance                               0.6   Skandia Insurance                           0.6 Morgan Capital Corp****                       0.1 Management                                    0.4                                            -------                                              12.4                                            ------- CONVERTIBLE LOAN STOCK Morgan Capital Corp                          13.7 Gillette UK                                  13.7 SPP Insurance                                10.6 Skandia Insurance                             4.8 Intermediate Capital Group                    0.3                                            -------                                              43.1                                            ------- Total equity                                 55.5  --------------------------------------------------------------- DEBT  --------------------------------------------------------------- Senior debt***                              409.0 Mezzanine debt Institutional                                69.0 Lustrasilk (Gillette)                        69.0** Junior debt Stora loan note                              47.8                                            ------- Total debt                                  594.8                                            ------- Total equity &amp; debt                         650.3  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Mergers and Monopolies Commission  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

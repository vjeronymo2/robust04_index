			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 26 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The Honduran Armed  Forces will continue to implement a plan to gradually reduce its  military units due to "the lack of economic resources," Defense  Minister General Reynaldo Andino Flores announced today.    The Army will dismantle artillery, armored cavalry, and  infantry units due to lack of operating budget, based on a plan  drafted in 1989. The Armed Forces eliminated a battalion of  territorial forces and an artillery brigade in 1992, "and we are  going to continue with the reductions due to the current crisis  in the country," Andino said without giving specific numbers.    The armored battalion, which has approximately 50 British  and  Israeli-made tanks and armored vehicles will be part of a single  military unit to be installed at the Nicaraguan border, in the  southern part of the country. A communications battalion  currently stationed near Tegucigalpa will be merged with an  infantry unit in the eastern part of the country. The Honduran  Armed Forces are made up of approximately 24,000 soldiers,  including at least 6,000 policemen.    Gen. Andino said the gradual reduction plan began five years  ago. The military budget totals 270 million lempiras (a little  over $37 million) and according to Gen. Luis Alonso Discua,  commander in chief of the Armed Forces, it has been reduced 10  percent more.    During the eighties, the Army received approximately $500  million in U.S. military aid. The United States also armed the  Nicaraguan "contras" in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the  Nicaraguan Sandinist Government from eastern Honduras. U.S.  military aid, however, was drastically reduced in the nineties  and currently amounts to less than $1.5 million.</p>

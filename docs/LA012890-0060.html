			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN STRONGLY BACKS MEDFLY SPRAYING;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: HE SAYS STATE CANNOT SURRENDER TO THE PEST. POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE  FOR AGRICULTURE CITED.  </P> <P> The Mediterranean fruit fly has proven over the years that not only does it  have an attraction for 250 varieties of ripe fruit, but also for a few  varieties of politicians.  </P> <P> Former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. faced the pesky fly in 1981 and his  popularity tumbled because of his hesitation to order aerial pesticide  spraying.  </P> <P> Now, nine years later, it appears that the fly is beginning to buzz around Gov.  George Deukmejian -- ironically, because of his unflinching support for the  aerial malathion assault.  </P> <P> In a statewide radio address Saturday that drew strong criticism from  anti-spraying forces, the governor defended aggressive efforts by state and  local agriculture officials to eradicate the fly with repeated nighttime  helicopter missions.  </P> <P> "California cannot afford to surrender to the Medfly," Deukmejian said in his  first major speech on the current Medfly crisis. "Allowing this insect to take  up permanent residency in California would have long-range consequences for  agriculture and every citizen in the state.  </P> <P> "That is why we intend to proceed with our plan -- a plan which is proven, a  plan which is safe and a plan which is working."  </P> <P> Deukmejian has supported aerial spraying since he approved an emergency  eradication program in August, although he has made few public comments beyond  that move.  </P> <P> He told his radio listeners Saturday that despite criticism from opponents of  aerial spraying, the state has no choice but to continue.  </P> <P> "If left unchecked, the Medfly infestation has the potential to spread and  infect virtually every fruit and vegetable crop grown in our state," he said,  adding that a statewide infestation would require increased pesticide use on  crops, quarantines on California fruits and a devastating loss of jobs.  </P> <P> "Perhaps we have come to take for granted our stroll through the produce  sections of California supermarkets," he said. "For agriculture to continue to  prosper . . . we must help ensure the vitality of our farms, guarantee the  safety of the food we grow and respond to any threats to this $16-billion  industry."  </P> <P> Spraying opponents were furious, but not surprised, at Deukmejian's comments,  saying that the governor has put crops before people.  </P> <P> "I've always said the agriculture lobby is behind this," said Monterey Park  Mayor Pat Reichenberger, one of the most vocal critics of aerial spraying. "I  resent human lives put at risk for an industry that can afford to lose a few  million dollars."  </P> <P> Dan Bender, a coordinator of Safe Alternatives to Fruit Fly Eradication (SAFE),  said Deukmejian said nothing new in his speech and only reiterated the  "propaganda" spread by the state Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> "He's taken the easy route," Bender said. "If he doesn't say anything, no one  can criticize him. He's just giving us the same old line."  </P> <P> Deukmejian has been able to avoid much of the criticism for the state's aerial  campaign by simply not saying much about it and allowing the Food and  Agriculture Department to assume the lead role.  </P> <P> In contrast, former Gov. Brown was initially a vocal opponent of aerial  malathion spraying. Many political observers believe that his delay in ordering  aerial spraying made him appear indecisive and helped doom his bid for the U.S.  Senate in 1982.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's speech capped a week of activity by spraying opponents, who have  become an increasingly vocal and eye-catching political force.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) launched the first major  political challenge to the state's spraying policy by unveiling two bills that  would end the repeated flights of malathion-laden helicopters over urban areas.  </P> <P> On the same day, about 80 demonstrators turned out in West Los Angeles for a  protest that featured six cast members of the television series "Cheers."  </P> <P> Two days later, attorneys from the Orange County cities of Garden Grove,  Huntington Beach and Westminster walked into a Sacramento Superior Court in an  unsuccessful attempt to win an injunction against spraying scheduled that  night.  </P> <P> Marilyn Wiczynski, deputy city attorney in Garden Grove, said the city intends  to continue its legal battle to stop the spraying.  </P> <P> The state's eradication program has been the largest ever mounted in Southern  California.  </P> <P> More than 370 square miles of Los Angeles and Orange counties have been  infested with the fly and about 50 cities have been sprayed so far.  </P> <P> Affected areas are now sprayed every 21 days, but that will jump to every 15  days in April, and then every seven days in June if the infestation continues.  State officials say some cities may be sprayed up to 12 times by the end of  June.  </P> <P> According to state officials, if the Medfly escapes into California's fertile  Central Valley, the bug could cause more than $200 million in crop damage each  year. The threatened fruit, nut and vegetable crops are estimated to be worth  about $5 billion a year, according to the state.  </P></p>

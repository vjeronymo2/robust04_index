			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / From career woman to a life of imperial isolation: Emiko Terazono reports on how the Japanese regard Masako Owada on the eve of her wedding WHEN Miss Masako Owada enters the imperial palace in the heart of Tokyo to wed the heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne today, she will be purified with sacred water, and initiated into an isolated life as wife to the eventual spiritual head of the Japanese people. She and Prince Naruhito will take their vows before the Amaterasu, the sun goddess, the most important in the Shinto religion. For modern Japanese, though, the spiritual side is just theatre - they want to know if the career girl commoner and the prince will live happily ever after. And on a even more wordly level, for some Japanese, the wedding will mean only an excuse to drink 'royal' sake with gold flakes floating in it, eat 'royal' lunch boxes and festive cakes. Following the relief at the initial announcement that the 33-year-old prince had finally found a bride, the Japanese media has turned the story into a great romance - a tale of a prince who battled to win his love. The imperial household agency, the mandarins who jealously guard the affairs of imperial family, initially strongly opposed the prince's choice of the 29-year-old Miss Owada. Her grandfather headed Chisso, a chemical manufacturer once linked with poisonous mercury disposals in southern Japan. Miss Owada herself refused the prince's proposals on several occasions as she pursued a career as a diplomat in the footsteps of her father - Mr Hisashi Owada is deputy foreign minister. The prince vowed to protect her from the pressures and antagonisms of the imperial court, and Miss Owada eventually accepted his hand. Today's royal wedding has not been met with the frenzied excitement as the marriage of the current Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko 34 years ago. 'For ordinary Japanese in 1959, the royal couple playing tennis in a summer resort, and parading through the streets of Tokyo on a horse-led carriage was like Hollywood or Disneyland,' says Mr Naoki Inose, a writer who has published several books on the imperial family. Corporate executives, who had hoped that a 'Masako boom' would spur Japan's depressed consumer demand, have been more disappointed. Aside from a rise in sales of the somewhat dated Toyota Corolla model driven by Miss Owada, and an upward blip in the popularity of pearls, often worn by the bride-to-be, there seems to be little evidence that the economy is being lifted by a wedding boom. When the engagement was announced, analysts predicted additional retail spending as large as Y3,300bn (Pounds 20bn) - a figure based on the rise in consumer confidence triggered by the 1959 'Michi-boom'. when the current emperor married. At the time, Japan was beginning its rapid economic growth, and consumers rushed to buy television sets to watch the wedding, boosting sales at electronics makers. Feminists have meanwhile lamented that the wedding represents a setback for Japanese women. Many argued that Miss Owada, who gave up her fast-track job to marry the prince, symbolised a career woman sacrificing herself for confinement within the home. Many Japanese men appear threatened by Miss Owada, who represents a new breed of strong Japanese women - she is a graduate of Harvard and Oxford and speaks five languages. 'She's stuck-up,' remarks a middle-aged office worker. She was recently chided by a weekly magazine for talking too much - 27 seconds more than Prince Naruhito at a press conference. At the same time, those who hoped that Miss Owada's strong character would lead the royal household to a new era of openness have so far been disappointed. Taken over by imperial banality, Miss Owada now smiles shyly at the cameras and walks behind the prince. Her stodgy frocks have not prompted the fashion boom seen when Prince Charles wed Princess Diana. In contrast to recent coverage of the British royals, the imperial household agency has set out to control its public image, and media coverage has been superficial and polite. Still, traditionalists are alarmed that the publicity over the wedding is threatening the mystique surrounding the imperial family. But for nationalists and those who advocate a more prominent imperial family, the wedding is seen as an ideal opportunity to arouse such sentiments among the Japanese. Following criticism from conservative politicians, the imperial household agency was forced to reverse its original decision to leave out from the ceremonies the anthem which accords the emperor godlike status, The official wedding celebrations, including six banquets over three days and visits to ancestral shrines in eastern Japan, will last till the end of next week. Then the doors of the palace will again be closed and the imperial family will return to its refined confinement. The princess behind those walls could yet emerge as a force for modernisation, making the imperial family more accessible. She may find it hard to escape the confines of imperial life, having to make do with occasional appearances at state dinners, charity functions and sports tournaments. But among her imperial duties, she will face enormous pressure to succeed in the most important - to produce a son to become the next heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne.</p>

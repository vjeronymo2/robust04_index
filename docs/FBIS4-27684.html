			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session enters  its seventh work day today, 2 June. In the morning's plenary  session, the National Assembly continued to discuss the revised  draft law on the organization of the People's Councils and  People's Committees under the direction of National Assembly  Chairman Nong Duc Manh.    The National Assembly discussed new issues related to the  law. Some deputies suggested that the law be called the Bill on  Amending and Supplementing -- not the Law on Revision of -- Some  Articles of the Law on Organization of the People's Councils and  People's Committees. They also suggested that only a few  articles required amendment. Other deputies urged that the  National Assembly hold back the law for a while and wait for the  upcoming party Central Committee Plenum where new measures will  be set to resolve various pressing issues related to the  activities of the People's Councils and People's Committees.    Many deputies said a vertical-type administrative system  should not be applied to the management of the People's Council.  Rather, the National Assembly Standing Committee and the  government should formulate concrete regulations on coordination  between echelons of the People's Councils. Other deputies  supported this idea, but asked who will take up the  responsibility of approving the composition of the People's  Council Standing Committee and who will be authorized to  determine the wage and retirement systems of members of the  People's Councils and so forth.    Some deputies said the chairmen of People's Committees  should  also be members of the People's Councils, with the exemptions  given in specific essential cases. Many deputies suggested that  it is necessary to set up the People's Council Offices in  provinces and cities and that many localities have already done  so. Other deputies suggested that among other specialized teams  a scientific-technological and environmental team be set up in  the People's Council, and that the environmental protection task  be added to the duties of the People's Councils. Many deputies  suggested that a sanctions system be applied so that the  People's Councils and the councillors may be able to settle  letters of complaint and denunciations lodged by the voters.  Some other deputies have asked whether we should consider the  removal of councillors at the regular People's Councils meetings  or to solicit the views of voters on this matter, especially  when more than 50 percent and not two-thirds of People's Council  members are decided on the removal of a people's councillor.  Many deputies suggested that the People's Councils and  councillors be charged with the additional task of opposing  corruption and smuggling.    The National Assembly will continue its work this afternoon  at the conference hall.</p>

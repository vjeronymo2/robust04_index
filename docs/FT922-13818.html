			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / A mission to mother invention: Efforts by the Patents Office to market itself PATENTS PENDING is in danger of becoming an under-used phrase in Britain, according to the man responsible for marketing the services of the Patent Office. Mr George Hamlyn can reel off unpleasant statistics at the drop of a hat: in the EC, annual spending on wasted research has reached Pounds 20bn; and this year only 50,000 patents have been registered by the UK compared with 20,000 alone from the Japanese company Hitachi. The importance of the Patent Office, part of the Department of Trade and Industry, is underrated by companies, according to Mr Hamlyn, who travels throughout the UK to promote the office as a resource for businessmen - containing 25km of archives, with about 32m patents, 2m of them from the UK. 'More than four fifths of the information in patents you cannot find in any other published form,' he says. 'One of the uses of patent information, if you have a technical problem, is to find out whether it has been solved previously.' Mr Hamlyn says too many companies fail to contact the Patent Office in central London before embarking on costly research to solve technical questions. 'They come up with the answer, they then go to patent it, we do a search and, surprise surprise, we discover that it's been done half a dozen times before. They have reinvented the wheel.' Mr Hamlyn recalls a company that unsuccessfully tried to replicate a laboratory result on a larger, pre-production scale. 'For weeks they employed the whole R&amp;D department, trying to puzzle out what was going wrong. One of them finally suggested doing a patent search. We found them a 30-year-old document which offered a solution. They were delighted and so were we. But that 30-year-old document was their very own patent; they hadn't even thought to look.' An amusing tale, but it contains a sting that British companies would do well to consider. According to Mr Hamlyn, Japanese companies will this year file more than 350,000 patents, about a third of the world total and seven times as many as will be put up by British companies. The top three patenting companies in the US now are Hitachi, Toshiba and Canon. Hitachi has 150 full-time employees devoted to studying patents, feeding that information into company research. Mr Hamlyn dismisses as 'nonsense' the idea that Japan's dominance of patents is explained by superior inventive skills. 'That just doesn't hold water. Japanese research shows that in the last few decades 50 per cent of the economically valuable inventions around the world came from the UK. But we just don't exploit them. The UK and US are very good at fundamental research  -just look at their lists of Nobel prize-winners. The UK has had 61 in physics, medicine and chemistry since the start of the Nobel prizes (in 1901), the Japanese have only had four. But if you look in the shops you'd think it was entirely the other way round.' Mr Hamlyn and his team are trying to market two related items: the importance of protecting new ideas by patents and the Patent Office's search and advisory services, with its access to massive archives of patents. The Patent Office has experts for everything from paperclips to oil rigs, with instant access to more than 40 computer databases across the world. It is not a monopoly supplier of patent search services - anyone can use the science, reference and information service to do a patent search themselves, but it can save a lot of time to use one of the many individual patent or searching agencies. Search charges vary from about Pounds 100 for a simple search, through more complex, computer-based searches costing Pounds 200, to labour-intensive searches using an expert examiner with an average price of Pounds 400. Some large companies requiring in-depth surveys pay several thousand pounds. To market itself, though, the Patent Office roadshow has been running for three years, has made 64 tours of the UK and is making a presentation in Lisbon between May 18 and 20. It demonstrates its commitment to advanced technology with its video laser disc package on patents training - price Pounds 2,000, including hardware. Mr Hamlyn said: 'The awareness campaign is really directed at making people aware of what patents, registered designs, trademarks, copyright can do for them. We are trying to make people aware of intellectual property. We are not saying that every time you have a bright idea you rush out and get a patent. These are expensive things; an average invention of average length would probably cost about Pounds 2,000 for the UK alone. That goes up if you apply for patenting abroad; it can go up to Pounds 50,000 for patenting in some 15 countries.' On the other hand, Pounds 2,000 to prevent industrial theft might prove to be a cheap insurance policy. Patents are about money, as Mr Hamlyn emphasised: 'We're concerned to get through to business that if it understands the broad basis of the system it's obvious you will make better informed commercial decisions in the future.'</p>

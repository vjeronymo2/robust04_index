			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Long View: Bonds lead the asset race SO THE Nervous Nineties are proving . . . well, nervous. As the Tokyo stock market plumbed new lows this week, and New York and London wobbled, those wonderful 1980s seemed a long way away. Not that it should really come as any surprise to investors. The extraordinary returns during the 1980s, especially on equities, could not be sustained. The 1990s had to be different. It may seem a little premature to make a statistical assessment of just how different, but within a few days, believe it or not, we shall be a quarter of the way through the decade. How are the numbers shaping up? First, a reminder of the joys of the 1980s. For the UK investor, domestic equities stood out, returning almost 24 per cent a year on average in combined income and capital gains to the tax-exempt investor. Overseas equities returned almost exactly the same. British government bonds lagged a long way behind at just under 15 per cent - still a good performance in relation to average annual inflation of 6.9 per cent. Finally, money market deposits delivered a return of 12 per cent on average. As at 1992 1/2 the 1990s, however, are shaping up as the decade of bonds. If you look at sterling bonds there was a reasonable positive return in 1990 at a time when shares were experiencing their first calendar year decline since 1976; and although UK equities were strong last year - returning 20 per cent for UK pension funds according to the WM Company, the performance measurement specialists - the pensions' fund sterling bond portfolios were almost as successful, returning 18 per cent. So far this year, after the recent stock market retreat, bonds have their noses in front. Put all this together and after 2 1/2 years sterling bonds are showing an annualised return of some 14 per cent, while UK equities have only been able to manage about 5 per cent, and overseas equities a seriously disappointing minus 1 per cent or so. Note, however, that money market deposits are showing strongly with 13 per cent, although fading a little this year. In fact the past 2 1/2 years have by no means been all bad for equities  - the All-Share Index showed a rise in the year ended September 1991 of 32 per cent - but there have been some bad patches too, notably during the worst of the Gulf crisis. There are two main motors for share prices. They are buoyant when monetary factors are positive, notably the money supply is growing fast and interest rates are falling. They also rise when the company sector is prospering and is pushing up its profits and dividends strongly. In the classic cycle the first phase tends to lead to the second, in successive legs of a bull market. In recent years, however, these positive factors have been weak. Profits, of course, have been under pressure in the UK and the US for several years and are now crumbling in Japan and much of Continental Europe too. True, interest rates have been falling, especially short-term rates, and this has pushed up the US stock market in particular. But low interest rates have not been reinforced by a buoyant money supply. Meanwhile in Tokyo, the deflation of the extraordinary 1980s bubble continues inexorably. This process has failed to affect other markets until now, but the stability of the Japanese financial system is now on the line and Wall Street has itself become high-priced enough to be vulnerable. In normal conditions you would expect both bonds and equities to benefit from an easier money environment in which short-term interest rates were falling; but equities would benefit more because they are riskier securities which are more sensitive to economic conditions. Indeed, equities have been quite volatile at times during the past 2 1/2 years, but overall they have failed to perform as well as bonds because of lack of support from the corporate fundamentals. The big broking houses have been energetically trying to compensate by forecasting big earnings recoveries just around the corner. Indeed profits may be picking up modestly in the US but in Britain the evidence is very scanty. In some respects the recessionary background in the UK has been rather similar during the past two years to that at the start of the 1980s. But then, the returns were flattered by high inflation, and the fundamentals were more attractive, with a dividend yield between 6 and 7 per cent, for instance, against under 5 per cent at present. Even so, the stock market was sluggish in the early part of 1982, only to surge later in anticipation of strong profits recovery in 1983. Can history repeat itself? British pension fund managers certainly seem to think that the pattern of asset returns has been anomalous in the 1990s so far. They have been piling ever more heavily into equities. At the start of 1990 the typical fund, according to the rival measurement service Caps, had 81 per cent in equities, while at March 1992, the latest available date, it had an 84 per cent exposure. Last year these professional managers were directing funds with particular enthusiasm into overseas equities, especially Japanese. It is hard to change a strategy which has worked for many years. But the high stock market returns of the 1980s - at any rate the latter years - were in part the consequence of the growing indebtedness in many leading economies which not only boosted activity (and therefore profits) but also at times led to the creation of euphoria and asset price bubbles; GPA would have been enthusiastically welcomed by the market in 1986 or early 1987, for instance. Distortions were building for most of the decade and it would be prudent to assume it will take much the same time to unwind them. In the meanwhile, investors who still expect life to be much the same as it was in the Exceptional Eighties are going to be disappointed by the realities of Different Decade.</p>

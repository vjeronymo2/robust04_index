			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN DONNE IN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Is the Pacific Sea my home? Or is  </P> <P> Jerusalem? pondered John Donne,  </P> <P> who never stood among these strenuous,  </P> <P> huge, wind-curried hills, their green  </P> <P> gobleted just now with native poppies'  </P> <P> opulent red-gold, where New World lizards run  </P> <P> among strange bells, thistles wear the guise  </P> <P> of lizards, and one shining oak is poison;  </P> <P> or cast an eye on lofted strong-arm  </P> <P> redwoods' fog-fondled silhouette,  </P> <P> their sapling wisps among the ferns in time  </P> <P> more his (perhaps) than our compeer: here at  </P> <P> the round earth's numbly imagined rim,  </P> <P> its ridges drowned in the irradiating vat  </P> <P> of evening, the land ends; the magnesium  </P> <P> glare whose unbridged nakedness is bright  </P> <P> beyond imagining, begins. John Donne,  </P> <P> I think, would have been more at home  </P> <P> than the frail wick of metaphor I've brought  </P> <P> to see by, and cannot, for the conflagration  </P> <P> of this nightfall's utter strangeness.  </P></p>

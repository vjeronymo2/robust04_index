			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER SENTENCED TO PICK UP TRASH FOR SLAPPING POLICEMAN  </P> <P> A newspaper reporter who slapped a Glendale police officer after she was  stopped for an illegal turn was ordered last week to spend 30 days picking up  trash along freeways.  </P> <P> Glendale Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph F. De Vanon on Friday also placed  Hollywood resident Rose Demirjian on two years probation and ordered her to pay  a $700 fine and write a letter of apology to the officer.  </P> <P> In a rocky ending to what one court official called the "Zsa Zsa case," De  Vanon threatened to jail the protesting Demirjian if she didn't follow his  orders.  </P> <P> After a non-jury trial last Thursday, De Vanon found Demirjian, 38, guilty of  misdemeanor battery on a police officer, resisting an officer, making an  illegal U-turn and driving with a suspended license.  </P> <P> Demirjian, a news and features writer for the Armenian Reporter, acted as her  own attorney. During the two-hour trial, she frequently interrupted the judge,  calling the police officer and witnesses who testified against her "liars."  </P> <P> "Your continued refusal to face up to your conduct . . . is incredible," said  De Vanon, who also barred her from driving without insurance and a valid  license.  </P> <P> The judge gave Demirjian until April 5 to perform the community service for the  state Department of Transportation and write a letter of apology to Officer  Behrouz Hashemi.  </P> <P> Demirjian on Thursday defiantly declared she would appeal. But after the  sentencing on Friday, the Lebanese immigrant laughed quietly and held back  tears, still maintaining her innocence.  </P> <P> "I'll have to take the trash," she said. "I don't want to go to jail. What I  don't like is if I don't write a letter to the jerk, I have to go to jail. He  should apologize to me."  </P> <P> Hashemi and four witnesses testified that Demirjian scuffled with the officer  Oct. 30 after a routine traffic stop on Brand Boulevard near Harvard Street.  </P> <P> Hashemi told the judge that he asked the woman for her driver's license after  he saw her make an illegal U-turn, but that she walked away instead. The  officer grabbed her wrist, attempting to stop her, and Demirjian slapped him,  he said.  </P> <P> Witnesses testified that the woman yelled obscenities at the officer and  struggled as he tried to handcuff her.  </P> <P> Demirjian repeatedly told De Vanon that she had resisted Hashemi but did not  slap him or utter obscenities.  </P> <P> Court officials compared Demirjian's case with that of actress Zsa Zsa Gabor,  who in October was found guilty of slapping a Beverly Hills motorcycle officer.  </P> <P> Gabor, who has appealed the ruling, was ordered to spend three days in jail,  pay about $13,000 in fines, perform 120 hours of community service and visit a  psychiatrist.  </P> <P> But Demirjian, who smiled when told of the comparison, disagreed with it. "Zsa  Zsa is different. I'm an honorable woman," she said.  </P></p>

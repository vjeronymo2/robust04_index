			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> PARENTS OF SON SLAIN BY OFFICER FILE CLAIM  </P> <P> The parents of a man who was shot to death by an Anaheim police officer have  filed a claim against the city.  </P> <P> Gregory A. Rosenberger, 25, was shot by Officer Lee Smith, 36.  </P> <P> Rosenberger, a suspect of drug activity, was fired on during a struggle with  two Anaheim officers Oct. 10.  </P> <P> Rosenberger's parents, Gary and Colleen Rosenberger of Brea, filed the claim,  which is the first step toward a lawsuit. The couple could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> Although the claim does not specify damages, it was filed to Superior Court,  which mandates that a minimum of $10,000 in damages be requested, said Mark  Persson, city claims manager.  </P> <P> Persson said that the claim is "brand new" and that the city attorney's office  will need more information about the case from the Police Department and the  district attorney office's investigation before commenting.  </P> <P> Acting Police Chief Capt. Jack Flanagan said it is the department's "belief  that the officer was justified in the use of his weapon . . . that he acted  with prudence."LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

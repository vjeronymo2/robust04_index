			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME THOUGHTS ON UNTRASHING L.A.  </P> <P> I enjoyed the article regarding the highly respected waste organizer, Joan  Edwards, hired by L.A. City to reduce the voluminous mountains of trash  currently dumped into the landfills.  </P> <P> I hope she is able to bring about discipline to our disposable society.  </P> <P> I also hope she can bring about some change in the bottled drink industry. It  bothers me that only the beer and soda companies have a deposit/return system  to encourage recycling, while the juice industry, with those heavy, valuable  glass bottles, offers no incentive at all.  </P> <P> I support Joan Edwards' ideals and trust that her office will remain free of  special interests.  </P> <P> RICHARD WRIGHT, Rowland Heights  </P></p>

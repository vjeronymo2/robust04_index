			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / The Property Market: Conversion factor adds up for builders The tide may be turning for office development in London. After decades of domination by the needs of commerce, central London may have to find new uses for its unwanted offices and buildings. 'There should be a fundamental revision of land use in central London', says Mr Geoff Marsh of APR, a property consultancy. Developers are starting to consider the feasibility of introducing hostels, flats and houses into less popular office districts. Commuters, tired of long journeys and keen to live nearer their place of work, could be the source of fresh demand in what is still a depressed housing market. The notion of turning offices into housing smacks of woolly-headed idealism and, indeed, the process is fraught with practical difficulties. But the dire state of the commercial property sector is forcing property owners to think again about office schemes. Scores of empty offices and buildings, on which huge bills for rates, interest payments and maintenance are incurred, are virtually worthless because they may never find tenants. The record number of vacant office buildings - and the still greater number of office proposals in the pipeline - will satisfy demand well into the next century. Yet as Mr Marsh says: 'For some of these sites, there is no prospect of a viable scheme for the next 20 years.' The argument that inner city land is too expensive to use for anything but offices has been turned on its head. Office rents need to be at least Pounds 22 per sq ft for land to have any value at all, says to Mr Ralph Pearson of Chesterton, a property adviser. In parts of central London, land earmarked for offices could have a negative value for years to come. Developers, architects, planners and surveyors have given a cautious approval to the idea of converting unwanted office buildings and development sites. 'There are plenty of cases where it will work,' says Mr Richard Saxon, head of architecture at BDP, a design company. Converting offices to houses is no less feasible than the once-radical idea of building flats in old warehouses in the London Docklands, he says. Yet any change of use for office buildings will be neither cheap nor easy. 'Conversion costs are high,' says Mr Michael Campbell of Peaston, an Edinburgh-based developer which has built flats and hostels in office buildings, warehouses and disused mills throughout the country. 'You have got to give the buildings a residential feel. You can't just put up partitions.' Modern office blocks throw up the greatest hurdles. The air-conditioned, glass blocks erected in the 1980s, with large floor spaces and wall-to-wall sealed windows would need to be virtually rebuilt to be used for housing. Conversely, the slab-type office blocks of the 1950s and 1960s are far more suitable for change of use because they have shallow floor spaces with plenty of light and windows that open. Ironically, these features mean they have fallen out of favour for office use. 'The buildings which are most convertible are at the bottom of the heap of desirability for offices,' says Mr Saxon. But even converting those buildings which lend themselves to a change of use would still be expensive. The walls might need to be reclad - 'the cost of replacing the cladding is crazy,' says Mr Campbell - some windows would have to be taken out, new plumbing and electrical wiring would have to inserted from top to bottom and independent heating systems would have to be installed in every flat. 'Conversion of a radical nature sometimes costs as much as starting from scratch,' says Mr Saxon. Nonetheless, the sums appear to add up for cheap, old office blocks which have little hope of ever finding a tenant again. An added incentive is that the conversion of an office block would generate a higher density of housing than would normally be allowed. But developers will have to contend with planners. And although most London authorities would welcome additional housing, some could express reservations. Boroughs that are unsympathetic to the property industry may be unwilling to let hard pressed office builders off the hook; in others boroughs, the need to attract business may over-ride the need for houses. One authority that has already weighed up the issues is Islington, in north London, which straddles an area where both offices and housing are in high demand. The borough has already given planning permission for a couple of schemes to covert office sites into student hostels. City University, for example, is planning to use Glaxo's former offices and laboratories in Graham Street as accommodation for its students. In principle, Islington welcomes such schemes. Mr Bert Newbrook, the borough's assistant head of planning, says the proposals to build hostels instead of more offices takes pressure off the housing stock and also gives a boost to small shops in fringe areas. Conversion into hostels is a particularly suitable proposition for former offices largely because hostels have no need for gardens or garages. Nonetheless, hostels can be unpopular with local residents. A proposal by Rosehaugh Copartnership to convert an office courtyard scheme in Tyndale Terrace, Islington, into a student hostel for the Polytechnic of Central London may yet be rejected by Islington planning committee when it considers the application next week. 'The committee has no problem with the principle,' says Mr Newbrook. 'But the residents are very fearful of the noise the students will make.' These first tentative steps towards finding other uses for offices show just how complicated the exercise can be. Conversion work can be expensive, unpopular and unsuitable, with many potential sites or buildings ruled out by their location or design. Moreover, many developers are unwilling to countenance such a radical change of land use while there is any prospect of a recovery in land values. For all that, a more realistic approach to new development proposals, along with the conversion of a small proportion of existing office buildings, could make a significant inroad into the problem of over-supply that is afflicting the office market. Then, says Mr Stuart Lipton of Stanhope Properties, the surplus of poor quality space will disappear. 'The property market is like a fruit market: the bad products will be turned into juice.' Fewer offices and more housing could bring an even deeper benefit to the London office market. In particular, it could address the potential threat to London posed by many companies' difficulties in retaining a workforce fed up with high house prices and lengthy, unreliable journeys to work.</p>

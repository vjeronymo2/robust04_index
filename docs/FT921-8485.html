			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Observer: Pirelli's retread Step forward Marco Tronchetti Provera, 44, the new man at the helm of Italy's troubled Pirelli tyres and cables group. Little known outside the company until last December, he moved into the limelight when chairman Leopoldo Pirelli told an astonished press the takeover bid for German tyre giant Continental had collapsed. Tronchetti Provera, who, like the 66-year-old Pirelli himself is a substantial shareholder in the company, is thought to have been cool about Conti from the start. His scepticism has now paid off. Although Pirelli, a keen sailor, stressed the need for a firm hand on the tiller while the group was still in troubled waters, it now seems that hand will be Tronchetti Provera's. The change was not unexpected, although many expected Pirelli would wait until the agm later this year before announcing his retirement. As it happens, he will remain non-executive chairman, while Tronchetti Provera takes over the job of executive deputy chairman as well managing director. Undoubtedly, the move is a blow to genealogists, who would have liked to see another Pirelli in charge. As it happens, Leopoldo's son, Alberto, 38, is still on the bridge. But Pirelli-watchers think it may not be long before he too, jumps overboard, to return to studying marine biology, which they say is his true love.</p>

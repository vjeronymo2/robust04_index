			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: Sketches by Boz - Theatre This year offers a bumper selection pack of Dickens in London. Over the next fortnight Oliver] opens in the West End, A Christmas Carol at the RSC, A Tale of Two Cities at Greenwich and The Oxford Stage Company brings its adaptation of Great Expectations to Richmond. With Martin Chuzzlewit still rolling along on BBC2 and Hard Times scheduled for Christmas Day, there is no escape from his gallery of rogues. The enterprising Battersea Arts Centre has come up with a little hors d'oeuvre to whet your appetite for the meatier Dickens to follow in the shape of Sketches by Boz, an evening of newspaper articles by the young novelist. The evening is conceived as an old-fashioned 'entertainment' mounted, cabaret-style, in the cafe, where candles on the tables and food and drink on offer create a convivial atmosphere. On stage a cast of five work their way through half a dozen sketches adapted for stage by Robert Butler and spliced together in Fair Play Theatre Company's production with sardonic little ditties of the time. A Dickens-like master of ceremonies at a lectern links the scenes and occasionally stoops, with marvellous disdain, to speak the words of some unsavoury character or other. The only other props are a piano, a table and a couple of chairs, and round these the company presents a parade of grotesques and unfortunates. You can certainly see the young Dickens sharpening his satirical pencil for the characters that were to people his novels. There is the gauche, gaunt Mr Watkins Tottle, whose faint heart is trampled on by an unscrupulous 'friend' and an insensitive young woman; there is the Scrooge-like killjoy who delights in ruining his godson's Christening party; there is an artful dodger deported by a judge who never looks up from his paperwork, and a trip to the pawnbrokers reveals a cauldron of miserable souls. The show gradually spirals downhill until the last sketch brings us to the cell of a condemned prisoner in Newgate, Dickens writing with all his might to convey to his readers the terror and misery of a man in such circumstances. These are clearly the work of an angry young man, who writes with more heart than head in places - 'The Black Veil' is particularly melodramatic. But this evening of miniatures, performed by a spry, witty company, is an illuminating introduction to the young writer who was to become such a household name - and seasonal companion.

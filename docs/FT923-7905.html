			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Jobless total hits 5-year peak: Hopes of modest recovery encouraged by signs of increase in output UNEMPLOYMENT in Britain rose to a five-year high last month but a slight second-quarter increase in manufacturing output encouraged government hopes of a feeble recovery from recession. The Department of Employment reported that unemployment increased for the 27th consecutive month in July as the number of jobless claiming benefit rose by a seasonally adjusted 29,100 to 2.75m. This lifted the unemployment rate to 9.7 per cent of the workforce from 9.6 per cent in June. But, contrary to forecasters' expectations, manufacturing output crept higher in June, resuming the slight upward trend of the first four months of the year. The figures raised hopes that next week's provisional gross domestic product figures for the second quarter will show no further decline. In spite of a sharp 95,776 increase in July's unadjusted jobless figure to 2.77m, the figures were only slightly worse than the average of City forecasts and pointed to an improvement in underlying trends compared with July last year and the early months of this year. The output and jobless figures - combined with statistics showing a sharp slowdown in the growth of average earnings to a rate of 6 per cent in the 12 months to June - cheered the stock market after seven consecutive days of decline. The FT-SE 100 index rose 14.9 to 2,318. The Treasury drew encouragement from a 0.2 per cent increase in manufacturing output between May and June and revised figures showing that May's fall in output was less than earlier thought. According to the Central Statistical Office, manufacturing production rose by 0.4 per cent in both the first and second quarters. 'The figures suggest there has been a distinct improvement in this key sector of the economy which has been borne out by the broad results of business surveys,' the Treasury said. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said the unemployment news was 'showing signs of improvement' and pointed out that the 19,400 average monthly increase in unemployment in the three months to July was 'the smallest recorded for any three-month period for nearly two years'. She announced a Pounds 2.4m advertising campaign to encourage employers to notify vacancies to their local Jobcentres. This followed evidence in the latest figures of a decline in job vacancy inflows and placings at Jobcentres between June and July. The output data encouraged some City analysts to suggest the recession might be ending. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers International in London, said the figures suggested that non-oil GDP in the second quarter might have risen by between 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent compared with the first quarter, with overall GDP staying broadly unchanged. Others warned that yesterday's news was consistent with the economy bumping along a 'corrugated bottom' to the business cycle and that further falls in output could lie ahead. Mr Robert Lind, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, pointed out the most recent industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry suggested that output could weaken in the coming months. Indeed, CBI economists have expressed concern that, without a pick-up in business and consumer confidence, employers will decide on a further wave of redundancies after the summer holiday period.

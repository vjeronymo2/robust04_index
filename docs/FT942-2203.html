			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Critics of Indonesian nuclear energy plans oppose inactive volcano site - Government says energy demand gives it no option Proposals by the Indonesian government to develop a nuclear power industry are taking on an increasingly determined tone amid widespread criticism from environmentalists and some opposition parties. The proposals include the building of the country's first nuclear power station near an inactive volcano Mount Muria on the northern coast of central Java, an area also prone to earthquakes. International tenders for the plant could be held next year and Indonesia's leading environmental pressure group, Walhi, has stepped up its anti-nuclear campaign. A feasibility study for the construction of the plant was completed by New Japan Engineering Corporation earlier this year but details of the study have not been made public. If all goes as planned, Indonesia could have a working nuclear power station by 2004. Proponents of the nuclear energy scheme at Batan, the state's national atomic energy agency, argue that soaring energy demand in the Java/Bali grid, which is home to 70 per cent of Indonesia's 180m people and accounts for 80 per cent of Indonesia's total energy requirements, leave the country with no choice but to go nuclear. There are also proposals for 12 nuclear power stations in Java and Bali over the next 25 years. Batan predicts that at forecast rates of increased energy demand, Indonesia faces becoming a net oil importer within the next 10 to 15 years. Although the country has coal reserves for another 300 years, the environmental impact of coal-fired electricity generation limits possibilities. 'We have to go nuclear one day,' says Mr Hartato, co-ordinating minister for trade and industry. 'There is no doubt about it.' 'We believe it is not good to rely on a single source of energy,' says Mr Soedyartomo Soentono, deputy director general for nuclear industrial research and development at Batan. Critics retort that with so many alternative supplies of energy in the country, including geothermal and solar energy and gas resources, it does not make sense to make nuclear power a priority. Mr Soentono, however, says geothermal and solar sources of energy could not generate enough power to satisfy the requirements of a rapidly industrialising area. He also argues that Indonesia's huge gas deposits are located too far from Java and Bali. 'The government's main policy is to diversify its sources of energy,' Mr Soentono adds. Batan says that in 1992 86.1 per cent of the country's energy supply came from oil and gas, 7.8 per cent from coal, and other sources accounted for 6.1 per cent. By 2019, Batan predicts 6 per cent of the country's energy supply will come from nuclear power stations, 54 per cent from coal, 38 per cent oil and gas and 2 per cent other sources. Opposition to the construction of the Muria plant has also been voiced in Australia. Critics there argue that Indonesia's frequent earthquakes make a nuclear power plant high-risk. In February this year an earthquake shook the Indonesian province of Lampung in Sumatra, killing nearly 200 people. Some Indonesian geologists argue that building a nuclear power station next to an inactive volcano is gambling with luck. They point to Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines which was dormant for 700 years before it erupted in 1992. Batan says the volcano in the Muria peninsula has been dead for 340,000 years. 'I would not call it a volcano, I would call it a hill . . . , says Mr Soentono. Environmentalists are also concerned at plans eventually to privatise the Muria plant. Batan insists the government would continue to ensure safety requirements are met even if the plant is sold off. The government says it will create a nuclear regulatory authority. It is estimated that the cost of building the Muria plant will be about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn). Opponents of the scheme are angry that Indonesia, which has a foreign debt of between Dollars 90bn and Dollars 100bn and an annual per capita gross domestic product of Dollars 660, should invest in developing nuclear power stations when, according to them, there are other more urgent issues, such as welfare. Batan executives say they have conducted a cost evaluation for the project which concludes that nuclear power stations are a cheaper source of energy than coal. They do not give any figures. Indonesia has three nuclear research reactors, all in Java, and has been developing isotopes and radiation processing programmes since 1964. But there is concern that Indonesia does not have the technical expertise to manage a nuclear power station. 'We do not have a high-tech culture,' says Mr Muhammad Anung, programme manager for energy at Walhi. Opponents of the scheme will have to fight hard to be heard since support for the development of nuclear energy comes from the government's highest quarters. The proposal is one of the pet projects of Mr Jusuf Habibie, Indonesia's enthusiastic minister for research and technology. President Suharto has also indicated his support. Mr Habibie has promised that the public will have the final say in determining whether the Muria project goes ahead. Critics are sceptical. 'Habibie's statement is purely political,' says Mr Anung at Walhi. 'I think they will go ahead and build it anyway.'</p>

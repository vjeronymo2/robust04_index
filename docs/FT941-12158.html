			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Profits down - Legal Briefs Law firms in central London had their worst year for more than a decade in 1993 with profits down on average by 20 per cent, according to the annual survey of law firm performance carried out by the Centre for Interfirm Comparison. Typical profits per partner of London firms fell from Pounds 100,000 three years ago to Pounds 72,000 in 1993. Half London firms suffered a fall in revenue. Litigation was the only area of work to show growth, but the modest 4 per cent rise indicated the boom in litigation was over, the centre said. The profits of provincial firms improved on 1992, but remained below 1980s levels. Conveyancing, once the mainstay of provincial firms, accounted for only one-third of revenues.</p>

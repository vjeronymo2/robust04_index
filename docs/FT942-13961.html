			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / People: Moulton joins Apax Partners Jon Moulton, founder and managing partner at Schroder Ventures until he resigned in February, is to join Apax Partners as a director. Moulton left Schroder Ventures after a disagreement over strategy; Schroders had tried to impose tighter controls over the venture capital group. The high-profile Moulton developed a reputation for doing large management buy-out transactions at Schroders, among them Parker Pen Group and RJB Mining. Though this is an area in which Apax has had limited experience, it has set out its stall as a venture capital group that hires industry experts who bring market knowledge to the boards of the companies in which the group invests. It also says it has a very hands-on approach to its investments - an approach many venture capitalists have not taken when investing in large buy-outs. Apax says that Moulton, on the other hand, shares its hands-on investment philosophy. His appointment would strengthen Apax in an area the group had been thinking of expanding into for some time. Before founding Schroders, Moulton was with Citicorp Venture Capital in London and New York. Moulton will be one of 11 directors at Apax.</p>

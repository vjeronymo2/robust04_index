			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Special report by Tomas Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] The 30 April deadline which the United States had  suggested for Argentina to promulgate the law on pharmaceutical  patents is now past, and the five committees that are studying  the bill are nowhere near issuing a ruling. Argentina has thus  been "included" on the list of nations that will be subject to  economic punishment.    The five Senate committees have already held at least 18  consultative sessions, which they resumed in April. Foreign  Minister Guido Di Tella is expected to appear before the  committees during the second half of May. The first phase will  end a few days later, when Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo  appears before the committees.    After that, the committees will be in a position to issue a  favorable ruling despite the opposition of the Radical Civic  Union (UCR) bloc led by Jose Genoud, one of the underwriters of  an alternative bill which "is better suited to Argentine  interests," as Genoud has repeatedly said.    Of the five committees that are looking at the executive  branch's bill on patents, three are chaired by UCR senators.  This, however, does not guarantee that the UCR will obtain a  majority in the final vote, although it is a serious obstacle  for the ruling Justicialist Party's desire to deal expeditiously  with this matter. The Senate is not the only body that opposes  the bill on patents in what is being looked on as undue U.S.  interference in the matter.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's "message," to the  effect that Argentina would not be allowed to join NAFTA unless  the much-awaited law on patents was approved first, was received  in the Chamber of Deputies like a bad odor. Before going into  the interests at stake in this sensitive issue, let us take a  look at the figures for the huge pharmaceutical market.    Argentina consumes $3 billion worth of medicines every year.  Argentine pharmaceutical laboratories, which frequently copy  formulas, receive $1.6 billion, and the foreign laboratories  that own the patents keep the rest. Should the new law on  patents be approved, this proportion will probably be reversed,  which will significantly increase the price of medicines.    At one point, Pablo Challu, chairman of the Argentine  Industrial Center of Pharmaceutical Laboratories [CILFA], made  the exaggerated assessment that "medicines would go up 300  percent," which prompted a swift rebuttal from government  officials who labeled Challu's statement "sheer nonsense."    Rafael Flores and Felix Pesce, Justicialist Party deputies  for Santa Cruz and Mendoza, lead the group of ruling party  deputies who have been criticizing the bill of the executive  branch. Pesce said: "We will pass a law that will serve the  country's interests," and warned that "we should not play dumb,  because there are powerful economic interests at stake.... A  multimillion dollar business is involved."    Pesce rejected U.S. pressure on the grounds that "our  Congress is an independent body which takes its own time to act  in keeping with the people's will, which compels us to work for  the common good without forsaking our convictions." Rafael  Flores said: "We Argentines cannot allow health to be  downgraded to the level of mere merchandise, because it is a  social asset."    UCR Deputy Nicolas Becerra said "the United States must end  its double extortion," and recalled that "a similar issue, which  President Arturo Illia [1963-66] had to deal with, was the  starting point of a tragic phase in Argentina."    The Socialists, led by Deputies Alfredo Bravo and Hector  Polino, have submitted draft bills rejecting the Bill Clinton  administration's interference with Argentina's law on patents,  an interference "that we cannot endure silently," they firmly  state.    The many voices raised in opposition are upsetting the  administration, which is stuck in the middle and on the verge of  being knocked out by its inability to comply with deadlines and  to fulfill commitments as time runs out.</p>

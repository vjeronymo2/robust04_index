			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CUBAN JAMMING BLINDFOLDS TV MARTI AS U.S. BEAMS TEST SIGNAL  </P> <P> A U.S.-financed television operation began transmitting signals to Cuba early  today, but Cuban officials blocked the transmission after 38 minutes and  accused the United States of engaging in aggressive activity.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed the debut of TV Marti and said  the Administration planned to continue efforts to transmit news and  entertainment programs to Cuba despite the successful jamming effort.  </P> <P> "We just hope that at some point they see the light," Fitzwater said, alluding  to Cuban officials. He said the operation is consistent with national and  international law.  </P> <P> The TV test operation began at 1:30 a.m. EST and was clearly visible on Channel  13 in the Havana area until the jamming began at 2:08, said a Voice of America  official, who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> The Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said in a dispatch monitored in  Mexico City that "Cuban authorities have warned that the beginning of these  transmissions may form part of a larger maneuver and Washington may be looking  for a pretext to unleash military aggression."  </P> <P> The station is designed to be a TV version of Radio Marti, which has provided  news and entertainment to Cuban listeners since 1985. Radio Marti was not  jammed this morning.  </P> <P> The TV signal was sent from a transmitter placed aboard a balloon dangling  10,000 feet above Cudjoe Key off the south Florida coast. Technical problems  have delayed testing for months.  </P> <P> After the testing, the Administration is supposed to make a legal and technical  evaluation of the operation within three months, according to enabling  legislation.  </P> <P> If the operation proves feasible on both counts, formal programming can begin  for a two-year period. The funds already have been appropriated.  </P></p>

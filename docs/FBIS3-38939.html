In a communique released on Sunday 6 February, former  President of the Republic Valery Giscard d'Estaing states the  following: "We are horrified and revolted by the massacre on  Sarajevo's marketplace. Any further talk is now futile. Now is  the time for decisions to be made. Resolution 836 of the UN  Security Council dated 4 June 1993 provides us with legal means  of action. We now await the urgent implementation of these  decisions, consisting in an air strike against the batteries of  artillery which fired on Sarajevo's marketplace."    -- Mr. Longuet wants "reprisals." Republican Party  President and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet on Sunday on RMC  [radio station] expressed his hope that "the United Nations will  authorize NATO forces to perform retaliatory strikes in order to  end the massacre" in Bosnia. He added: "We cannot send troops,  we cannot be present in the field and at the same time appear to  condone ever-increasing displays of violence."    -- Mr. Kouchner, former humanitarian action minister,  regretted on Sunday at the "maison de la chimie" [convention  hall], where he was attending a convention on social change,  that France "should believe the blame can be evenly apportioned  among everyone, as if there was not one person who is hit by a  bomb and another who throws it, as if there was not on the one  hand people who are dying and on the other people who are  killing them. This is biased diplomacy."    -- Socialist Party Leader Michel Rocard said on Sunday 6  February on 20:00 news on TF1 [television network] that it was  "now absolutely necessary for our countries to call on their  governments to force a ceasefire" upon the belligerents, which  requires "the support of air strikes."    -- The Communist Party leader Robert Hue announced on Sunday  on France 2 [television network] during the "Heure de verite"  ["Hour of Truth"] that his party was calling for a "large rally"  in Paris on 10 February at "place de l'Opera" to call for peace  in Bosnia. He added that a negotiated settlement must be found  as a military solution would be "disastrous."</p>

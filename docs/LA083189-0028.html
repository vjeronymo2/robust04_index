			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDING MORATORIUM URGED AT HANSEN DAM RECREATION  AREA  </P> <P> Councilman Ernani Bernardi on Wednesday called for a 90-day moratorium on  construction and demolition in the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, which he hopes  will prevent owners of property near the park's entrance from building an  auto-repair shop.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles wants to acquire the 0.85 of an acre in Lake View  Terrace for use as a park gateway. A used-car lot and a fast-food restaurant  now occupy the parcel.  </P> <P> "I can't think of anything that would be more undesirable than to have that  kind of auto activity at what should be the key entrance to this recreational  area," Bernardi said.  </P> <P> A deal to buy the land for $525,000, which was to have come before the City  Council on Wednesday, fell through unexpectedly when the city discovered that  the former owner had sold the property in April. The new owner, Hayden  Hamilton, filed papers with the city zoning administrator's office to begin the  hearing process Oct. 2 for an 18,000-square-foot auto-repair shop.  </P> <P> Hamilton paid more for the land than the city's estimated value -- about  $675,000, according to Bernardi -- and the City Council voted Wednesday to try  to renegotiate a sale with him. Bernardi said the city will turn to seizing the  land through eminent domain if necessary.  </P> <P> Hamilton could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Bernardi said he thought that Hamilton's land was the only parcel that would be  affected by the moratorium, which is scheduled to be considered Tuesday by the  council.  </P></p>

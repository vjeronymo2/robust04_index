			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Deficit rises at Martin Shelton In spite of a 19 per cent increase in turnover from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 1.63m, Martin Shelton Group suffered an increase in its pre-tax deficit to Pounds 122,000. Last time it was Pounds 76,000. However the interim dividend is being held at 0.75p. Mr Paul Martin, chairman of this USM-quoted group, said that the recession-induced downturn had been felt in the trade sales division of the diary and calendar business, but that this was more than compensated for by other divisions, especially the betting office supply division. Losses per share worked through at 1.58p compared with 0.98p.</p>

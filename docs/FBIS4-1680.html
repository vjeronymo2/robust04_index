			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai will send a  delegation to the '94 Osaka International Fair in mid-April.    The 150-strong delegation consists of manufacturers,  salesmen, and managers from more than 50 Shanghai companies.    In a bid to help more domestic firms enter the world market,  this year the Shanghai Council for the Promotion of  International Trade plans to organize 23 delegations to attend  overseas exhibitions in Australia, France, the Netherlands,  Germany, Japan, Israel, the United States, South Africa, Russia  as well as Hong Kong.    About 450 companies took part in overseas exhibitions in  1993. The total business volume transacted at 24 world fairs  topped 150 million U.S. dollars and a range of cooperation  projects were signed.    Shanghai enterprises received orders of goods worth 572  million U.S. dollars at the East China Export Commodities Fair  held earlier this year.</p>

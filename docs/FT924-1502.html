			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (3): Reversal of fortunes - Copper AT THE bottom of the Nchanga Open Pit, the initials MMD are emblazoned on the cockpit of one of the giant shovels shifting ore in the pit which is the largest single source of copper at Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the company which dominates the Zambian economic landscape. It is an appropriate symbol because it is a reminder that the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy came to power in November 1991 on the back of organised labour, particularly the miners on the Copper Belt. The MMD's accession to power is the single factor accounting for the enormous turnaround in fortunes of ZCCM over the past year. Copper is the fly-wheel of the Zambian economy. It accounts for more than 90 per cent of the country's foreign exchange earnings and much of Zambia's manufacturing industry supplies the industry. Although the past 20 years have seen a steady decline in the Zambian industry's fortunes, historically the government derived more than 50 per cent of its revenues from taxes on copper sales. The 1992 financial year, to March, was a nadir for ZCCM. Repeated equipment failures - the result of government interference starving the company of necessary funds - saw ZCCM's copper production at an all-time low of 387,000 tonnes, 63,000 tonnes below the budgeted target of 450,000 tonnes. The company made a net profit of only K4.1bn. A turnaround commenced, however, when the MMD government installed a new management team in November 1991. Average monthly production in the last four months of the 1991/2 financial year was 37,500 tonnes - 27 per cent higher than the average 29,600 tonnes during the first eight months. The first eight months of the 1992/3 financial year have seen further progress. According to Mr Ed Shamutete, ZCCM's chief executive, production to the end of November was 4 per cent ahead of the target of 431,000 tonnes for the full year. If this is maintained for the full year, as Mr Shamutete believes it will be, the company should achieve production of close to 450,000 tonnes - a 16 per cent improvement over 1991/2. The company has also made progress in cutting costs. Mr Shamutete notes that the cost at mine (excluding interest, depreciation and capital expenditure, tax) has fallen from 73.5 cents per pound of copper produced in 1991/2 to 60.3 cents per pound in the seven months of the current year. By June 1993 the labour force will have been cut by about 10,000 to 46,000. All of this translates to considerable progress on the profit front. For the seven months to the end of October, ZCCM made net profits of K19.7bn, compared to budgeted figures for the period of K11.5bn. 'The results are very encouraging,' says Mr Shamutete. 'Things are going extremely well'. The improved cost, production and cost performances can be traced, in the first instance, to the access to power of the Chiluba government, committed to sound economic management. In ZCCM's case this involved installing new management with a mandate to return the company to its core business of mining metals. Assurances were also given, which the government has upheld, that it would not interfere in the running of the company. Crucially, the government has also given ZCCM the necessary foreign exchange allocation to allow for rational operational planning. Mr Shamutete confirms that the persistent shortage of foreign exchange through the Kaunda years has taken its toll on the company's infrastructure. In the short-medium term, Mr Shamutete says the company needs to spend about Dollars 150m in hard currency terms and Dollars 119m in local money equivalent annually for normal reinvestment. For the next five years the company can meet these commitments from its own resources and with recourse to short-term loan facilities already in place. What happens beyond this, however, is the question facing ZCCM's managers. During the next decade the massive Nchanga Open Pit will become uneconomic. Production from a replacement ore body must be in place in about seven years. The source of this production will be the Konkola deep project, in the North of the copper belt. A recent feasibility study revealed that a new mine, with ore reserves of about 355m tonnes and a mill head-grade of 3.5 to 3.6 per cent copper, could be developed within six years. Mr Shamutete says this mine should guarantee ZCCM maintaining an annual production level of 450,000 tonnes - possibly up to 500,000 tonnes - well into the future. He is hopeful the project will soon get the go-ahead. Konkola has a price tag of about Dollars 550m, 70 per cent of which will be in hard currency. Mr Shamutete says that over the next 14 years, ZCCM will have to spend about Dollars 1.3bn in foreign exchange and Dollars 700m in local currency, both in 1991 terms, to ensure sustained production at the 450,000 tonnes per annum level. The bulk of this will be spent on Konkola. Most likely is that ZCCM will develop Konkola itself, the required equity injection probably offering Anglo American the chance to increase its stake in the company. However the finance question is resolved, the improvement of ZCCM's balance sheet is a priority. Currently the company owes Dollars 722m to various lenders and has paltry share capital of K893m, against annual revenues of about Dollars 1.2bn - a testimony to neglect and abuse by the previous government, the majority shareholder, matched by an understandable unwillingness on the part of minorities to invest further in a poorly run company. Apart from a necessary capital injection, Mr Shamutete believes the debt can be restructured while assets, which have not kept pace with the devaluation of the Kwacha, need to be revalued.</p>

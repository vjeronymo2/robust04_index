			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Bundesbank chief warns on pace of EU expansion: Tietmeyer urges deeper ties in core group of members The European Union could disintegrate if it takes in new members before deepening monetary and political ties in a core group of the existing 12 members, according to Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president. Mr Tietmeyer, picking up the theme of a multi-track, multi-speed Europe, warns today in the German newspaper Handelsblatt that the Union will fall apart if progress towards monetary and political union is oriented towards the 'slowest ship'. Spelling out what a multi-speed Europe might look like, Mr Tietmeyer said it was unlikely a majority of EU countries would fulfil the convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty by 1997. 'But stability is more important than the timetable,' he insisted, saying that whether the union took effect in 1997 or 2000 was not the decisive factor. His hard-hitting remarks amplify the Bundesbank's view that monetary union is appropriate only for a core group of countries which fulfil the anti-inflation criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty. His remarks also lend support to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the German leader, who is in favour of a core group of countries pressing ahead with further integration. 'A monetary union represents a long-term community of solidarity and risk, which requires a corresponding long-term political union,' Mr Tietmeyer said. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, echoed Mr Tietmeyer's view that convergence was the priority. In a London speech at the weekend he said convergence was the first concern and that an early move to a single European currency would be a mistake. 'However appealing the vision of a single currency may be . . . the absolutely essential prior economic condition is to establish sustainable convergence, based on an underlying stability in the participating member states,' Mr George said. 'I believe that we have a long way to go before that necessary pre-condition will be met.' The remarks of the two central bankers comes against the backdrop of a sustained period of exchange rate stability within the European Monetary System, following the substantial widening of the fluctuation margins last August. Mr Tietmeyer did not specify when he thought monetary union could be achieved by the 12 existing states. He also failed to indicate which countries he thought might be able to move more quickly to the first stage of monetary union. However, it is the Benelux countries, Germany and France that have achieved most, so far, in co-ordinating interest rate policy and establishing exchange rate stability, although it is only Luxembourg that fully meets the tough convergence criteria. Mr Tietmeyer's remarks represent an implicit rebuke to those who believe the union can simply take in new applicants, in particular from eastern Europe, without first deepening integration among the 12. The EU had to to become deeper - in terms of closer co-operation between the core member-states - at the same time as it became broader, Mr Tietmeyer said. Tax urged on Forex deals, Page 8</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UN revises Somalia mandate The UN Security Council last night approved a new mandate for UN operations in Somalia emphasising peace-making and reconstruction after a turbulent year in which the world body's peace-keeping capability was severely tested. With the US and several other national contingents due to pull out by the end of March,the unanimous resolution scales down the UN force to a maximum of 22,000 troops, still some 6,000 more than Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, proposed. He has asked about 40 countries to provide soldiers but few have come forward, given the risks in Somalia, where the UN has suffered substantial casualties and many Somalis have died in clashes with the UN force. The resolution reaffirms that the UN must complete its mission by March 1995 regardless of Mr Boutros Ghali's fears about a resurgence of factional fighting accompanied by renewed famine. The revised mandate lays stress on UN help for national reconciliation, including the laying down of arms, protection of ports andairfields to facilitate humanitarian aid and reconstruction, reorganisation of the police and courts, and the repatriation of refugees. Also, the UN would promote 'the ongoing political process' aimed at establishing a democratic government in a country that has long lacked central authority.</p>

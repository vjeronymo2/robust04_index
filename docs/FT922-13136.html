			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Burger King distribution services sold for Dollars 100m BURGER KING, the Grand Metropolitan fast food subsidiary, is selling its in-house distribution business to the Canadian-based ONEX Corporation for an estimated Dollars 100m (Pounds 58.1m). Burger King Distribution Services distributes food and paper products to all the Burger King restaurants in the US and is one of 17 approved distributors for the worldwide business. Mr Barry Gibbons, Burger King's chief executive, said the BKDS sale was another step in Burger King's strategy of focusing on building the global Burger King brand. It follows the appointment last week of Restaurant Services (RSI), a joint venture with US franchisees, as sole purchasing agency in the US. BKDS employs 1,500 people and operates 21 distribution centres throughout the US. Mr Gerald Schwartz, president and chief operating officer of ONEX, said: 'We see significant North American and international growth opportunities with Burger King'.</p>

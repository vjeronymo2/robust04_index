			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (6): Swiss mystique fades NO DOUBT a Swiss bank account still has a cachet all of its own. But as with many hoary traditional things, the reality no longer coincides with the myth. There has ceased to be any point in having a Swiss numbered account operated anonymously for you by a lawyer, for example. Swiss law requires that a bank know the identity of the beneficial owner of all its accounts. It also requires that the bank disclose the identity in the event of criminal inquiries, and it authorises bank directors to inform the authorities if they are suspicious that the account is being used for something illegal. (The Swiss are now discussing making this latter practice obligatory.) Some Swiss banks now play down the importance of secrecy in marketing their services to high net worth individuals. And that leads to a second misapprehension among potential clients. Time was that Swiss banks actually charged foreigners a fee on deposits  - in other words, a negative interest rate. No longer. They are now as eager to attract deposits as any other bank, and pay reasonable interest rates, too. So why bother having a Swiss bank account? In general, there is not much of a case for it. If you have frequent business in Switzerland or in Swiss francs, then a Swiss franc account will undoubtedly be useful. But these days, most international banks will offer accounts in all major currencies, so there is no obvious need to go to a Swiss bank. And even if you spend a lot of time in Switzerland, it may not be wise to put your money in a Swiss franc account. The Swiss franc also has a slightly outdated reputation for being firm and stable. Although it is going through a good patch at the moment, its performance in the past decade has been among the least impressive of major currencies. If you are thinking of stuffing some money away for retirement, then certainly the big Swiss banks are among the strongest in the world. Indeed, among the world's top 15 banks, Union Bank of Switzerland has by far the best tier one capital ratio (7 per cent). However, even though they pay reasonable interest rates, the banks are obliged to extract a 35 per cent withholding tax from earned interest. Switzerland has double taxation treaties with most countries so you can get it back, but it is a nuisance. A secondary, but nevertheless important, consideration is that the Swiss are still extremely careful and competent bankers. One does not need to worry about funds being misplaced or transfers going astray when dealing with them. Finally, even though bank secrecy has eroded considerably, the Swiss still cling tenaciously to a few elements of it. They will not co-operate at all with foreign governments' tax investigations, and they will not help an ex-spouse trying to get his or her share of a family fortune. For most people, however, these considerations do not apply. Thus, to get the best of Swiss banking without the possible disadvantages, it might be best to take out an account with a reputable Swiss bank in your home currency and in your home country.</p>

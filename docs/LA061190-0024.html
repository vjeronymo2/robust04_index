			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON U.S. INTERESTS AND ISRAELI-ARAB TENSIONS  </P> <P> I was struck by the voluminous biographical data that accompanied the report on  the Israeli who murdered the seven Arabs (Part A, May 21). It seems all that  data was intended to justify the reasons why the crime was committed, "deranged  man . . . dishonorably discharged . . . was jilted. . . ." Can one imagine the  newspaper explaining away psychoanalytically the predilections of a mass  killing if the gunman was an Arab and the dead were Israelis? "Home demolished  . . . could not feed six children . . . desperate for self-determination."  </P> <P> SYED BADIUZZAMAN  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

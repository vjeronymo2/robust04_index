			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 5 Mar -- Russia has completed work on  elaborating the concept of the destruction of toxic chemical  agents. The elimination of chemical weapons will start after  parliament has ratified the international convention on the  destruction of chemical weapons, signed in January 1993, Colonel  Viktor Kholstov, doctor of chemistry and deputy chief of the  radiation, chemical, and biological protection troops, told the  ITAR-TASS corespondent. He said that the convention may come  into force from January 1995 if 65 world states sign and ratify  it before this July.    According to this document, a signatory undertakes not to  carry out any new development. Viktor Kholstov stated that  chemical weapons are not being destroyed anywhere yet. All  agents are in special arsenals, are well guarded, and do not  represent a threat to the environment. If munitions become  defective, V. Kholstov continued, Russia has a unique unit that  makes it possible to neutralize them. This unit is without  parallel and was inspected by 40 world delegations who saw for  themselves how reliable it is.    As far as a national program for the elimination of chemical  weapons is concerned, in Viktor Kholstov's opinion, it is  necessary both for the adoption of political decisions and to  substantiate financial outlays.    After the convention is ratified, the state is obliged to  completely destroy over 10 years all chemical weapons on its  territory, Colonel Kholstov said. This requires special  facilities and specific financing. Such a draft program was  drawn up while the USSR still existed, but the implementation of  the measures it prescribed was thwarted for various reasons.  For instance, the facility built near Chapayevsk was not made  operational due to mass protests from the population, which was  deliberately misinformed by certain groupings for their own ends.    The program was taken up again in 1992 after Boris Yeltsin  stated that Russia had inherited earlier disarmament commitments.    Around two dozen ministeries and departments and several  hundred specialists have been involved in drawing up the new  version of the program. The government has allocated resources  for testing the technology, and Russian and American scientists  and engineers inspected the Chapayevsk facility near Samara for  safety.    Authorative commissions of experts assessed the facility  highly and recommended that similar facilties be set up in other  regions of the country.    In reply to a question by the ITAR-TASS correspondent as to  whether new types of chemical weapons were being developed,  Viktor Kholstov said that nobody would be so brave as to assert  that no such work was being undertaken abroad. "Russia is not  violating international agreements, but the strengthening of  national security lies within its scope just as it does in any  sovereign, self- respecting state."</p>

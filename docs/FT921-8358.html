			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (2): Benefits beyond the automotive sector - Nissan's regional impact FEW trips can have paid greater dividends than the flight which Sir William McAlpine and his son Andrew took to Japan soon after Nissan revealed in 1981 that it planned to site its European car plant in the UK. As a result largely of the negotiations triggered by that visit, McAlpine's annual north-east turnover rose from Pounds 10m before 1984, when Nissan announced it had chosen the former Sunderland airport site, to Pounds 150m in 1991 - two thirds of it directly attributable to Japanese investment. Last year was admittedly exceptional even by the standards of McAlpine's success in winning Japanese contracts: in 1991 the company's work on the ever-expanding Nissan plant, now a Pounds 900m investment, coincided with its construction of the first phase of Fujitsu's Pounds 400m semiconductor plant at Newton Aycliffe in Co Durham. Even so, the remarkable boost to turnover underlines the sometimes overlooked spin-off of Nissan's choice of Tyne and Wear for locally-based companies beyond the automotive components sector. Quantity surveyors and project managers Turner &amp; Townsend, founded in north-east England in 1946 and headquartered in Darlington, Co Durham, were similarly quick off the mark in 1981 when Nissan, in tandem with its search for a site, began a less publicised survey of the UK construction industry. Although the Japanese car maker was at that time making no promises to develop beyond its proposed 24,000 cars-a-year first phase, Turner &amp; Townsend realised the project's enormous potential significance and tried hard, but discreetly, to help Nissan with any information it required. That policy of establishing cordial relations early on - and of taking Nissan seriously - has paid off handsomely. Since 1984, the firm has had a constant presence at the Sunderland site, controlling construction finance and contracts. As a direct result it was selected as project manager not only by several Nissan suppliers moving into the surrounding area but by excavator manufacturer Komatsu at Birtley, Tyne and Wear and by Fujitsu for its new Aycliffe plant. The firm's story also demonstrates the importance Nissan at Sunderland has attached to developing its relationships. Thanks to the good understanding built up there, Turner &amp; Townsend was given responsibility for overseeing development of both the Cranfield, Bedfordshire, headquarters of Nissan's European Technology Centre and the Maple Cross HQ of Nissan Motor GB, the company's new distributor. 'Relationships are terribly important to the Japanese,' says Mr David Barry, a partner in the firm and regional director for Turner &amp; Townsend Project Management. 'Having started a relationship they want to see it succeed.' His firm, one of the UK's six biggest in its field, does not divulge its turnover but the Japanese link has substantially boosted income in its north-east heartland. It has insulated the firm locally from the chill of recession, which has forced competitors to cut staff. And it led to the firm being chosen by Toyota as quantity surveyor for its new Derby plant - a contract to which Nissan had no objection provided a 'Chinese wall' operated between the relevant staff in the firm's Derby and north-east offices. 'Nissan was the pad which launched us into this type of work,' says Mr Barry. 'It's been a tremendous relationship.' He and Mr Benny Kelly, McAlpine's regional manager, say they have found Nissan tough in negotiations but loyal and determined to make the relationship work. Both also say Nissan has been very keen to get local companies to work on the plant's development. Other beneficiaries of this policy include electrical engineers Mott McDonald, the consulting engineers for the Tyne Bridge in the 1920s, also constantly at work on the Nissan site since 1984. The 'Nissan Effect' has even helped transform its potted plant suppliers from a little local company into a national operator. Keenness to build local relationships does not however imply any timidity or laissez-faire on Nissan's part. Indeed, one of the company's most remarkable features has been the way it has set its own agenda. At Nissan's request, Turner &amp; Townsend even found themselves restructuring the conventional relationship between client, consultants and contractor. 'We sat with Nissan on one side of the table,' explains Mr Barry. Mr Kelly says Nissan's requirements have stimulated the quality of construction work in the region and improved its responsiveness. Nissan has also forcefully championed to local businesses the doctrines of total quality, flexibility, teamworking, training and equal status. More traditional companies may still have executive dining rooms but some now feel a touch defensive about them. Occasionally there are grumbles that Nissan hogs the limelight a little too much. But nobody denies the importance to Tyne and Wear of Europe's biggest single inward investment by a Japanese company. The backdrop of UK recession makes even more notable Nissan's announcement last month of another Pounds 200m of investment at Sunderland, another 600 jobs, boosting employment to 4,600 next year, and an increase in production capacity by 1993 from 220,000 cars to 300,000. 'It gives some pause for thought for those people who thought they were just coming in for a quick buck and would then go away again,' comments Mr Ed Robson, Sunderland's director of architecture and planning, who was project co-ordinator in the 1980s for the Tyne and Wear local authorities' campaign to net Nissan. The company's choice of the region, its successful expansion and impressive performance - the Sunderland workforce is said to equal its Japanese counterparts - have been valuable selling points in attracting inward investment. 'It's a very strong signal that this is a very good place not only to invest but to grow,' says Dr John Bridge, chief executive of the Northern Development Company, the economic regeneration body. The region now has nearly 50 Japanese companies, expected by 1993 to have created about 12,000 jobs and invested Pounds 1.7bn. There is no mistaking what many north-east job hunters think of Nissan's presence; its current local recruitment campaign for 1,600 additional employees, to reach its 4,600 target, has so far elicited 28,000 applications. But the message has also got through to many of the unemployed that they are not part of Nissan's brave new world. 'I'm too old for them' is a frequent refrain among jobless over-35-year-olds. Nissan's choice of Sunderland raised hopes that a whole new automotive sector would be created in a region devoid of significant car manufacturing since Edwardian times, when Lord Armstrong's Newcastle works made cars for export to Japan. Some spin-off from Nissan, obliged by European Community requirements to achieving 80 per cent European sourcing, is evident, especially in Sunderland and Wearside. Since the mid-80s some 23 automotive suppliers have set up in the region. Nissan estimates it will spend Pounds 190m with its 27 north-east suppliers this year, rising to Pounds 281m in 1993 out of a total Pounds 850m spent with 195 European suppliers. North-east suppliers account for almost half its UK components spending. By next year, Nissan expects its orders to generate work for about 3,000 employees in north east-based direct supplier companies. The Tyne and Wear Development Corporation argued in a recent report, Automotives - the Driving Force of the New North East, that the region could now become a premier centre of car component manufacture in Britain and possibly Europe. Mr Alastair Balls, TWDC chief executive, believes 300,000 cars-a-year capacity is the level at which component suppliers may be attracted to relocate into the north-east when the recession abates. That, he says, is 'just tough' for other regions. Professor Ray Hudson and Dr David Sadler, Durham University geographers, have raised some eyebrows, and even tempers, locally with a recent report suggesting new facilities developed around the Nissan plant have tended to specialise in production of relatively low value-added and bulky components. Their research also suggested the equation optimistically made between just-in-time production and spatial proximity had been greatly over-stated. In a region fighting for more automotive industry, this is heretical talk. But Prof Hudson says he is denying neither the pulling power of Nissan, nor its direct contribution to the local economy. 'What Nissan will have done in employment terms, although in a different part of the north-east, is replace Consett steel works.' He also predicts that Nissan will expand its annual capacity to 400,000 cars during the 1990s. 'That would be a pretty powerful magnet.'</p>

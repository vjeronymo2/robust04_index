			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Danish Referendum: Punks and pensioners find common cause - Odd alliances in the anti-Maastricht ranks TATOOED and unkempt, a group of post-punk youngsters appeared the least likely allies of the staid retired gentleman. But at a campaign meeting for next week's Maastricht referendum here, they cheered him as one of their own when he voiced fears that a Yes to the treaty would endanger his pension. This coincidence of interest captured the sometimes unexpected grouping among those who are campaigning for a No next Tuesday. In their efforts to achieve a repeat of last June's vote against ratification of the treaty, the anti-Maastricht forces are exploiting the electorate's fears on a wide range of issues - from the country's future as an independent nation to worries that Brussels will dictate pension and other social policy issues. By pressing buttons which trigger an emotional response, the No campaigners have made much of the running this spring and are hoping to confound the opinion polls, which continue to show a comfortable lead for supporters of the treaty. But they are up against the entire political establishment, not to mention the business community and the trade union movement, all of them calling for a Yes. At the campaign meeting in Copenhagen on Tuesday night, the Noes were represented on a 10-strong panel by two left-wing university professors and an MP for the right-wing populist Progress Party (the only one of the eight parties in parliament against the treaty). Among those ranged against them were Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister and leader of the Social Democratic Party, Mr Poul Schluter, his Conservative Party predecessor, three other cabinet ministers and a former minister. The meeting itself was organised by the pro-Maastrict European Movement. The disparate opponents of the treaty - stretching from left-wing environmentalists, who would really prefer to see Denmark out of the EC altogether, and ex-Communists to the far right - have not come together to mount a joint campaign. But they are happy to accept each other's support. The left-wing dominated June Movement, biggest of the anti-Maastricht organisations whose leaders include a long-standing former member of the central committee of the Danish Communist Party and a feminist academic, invited Lord Tebbit, inveterate British Tory opponent of Maastricht, to address their supporters. The June Movement's representative at Tuesday evening's meeting, physics professor Niels Meyer, hammered home the message that a vote for Maastricht was a vote to sell out the country's democracy and independence to 'a centralistic and bureaucratic' European union. 'We shall no longer be masters in our own house. We have no need for a new European commercial and political superpower,' he said to applause and whistles from the post-punkers. The Progress Party's Mrs Annette Just, by contrast, enthusiastically supports the free market basis of the internal market, but argued that the European Community did not need the Maastricht treaty's political superstructure. One point on which all the 'antis' are united is that the voters are being deceived when the government claims that the new referendum is being held 'on a new basis' following last December's Edinburgh agreement between Denmark and its EC partners. That agreement allows Denmark to opt out of the treaty's defence co-operation programme, the common currency, supranational legal and police co-operation and union citizenship. But since the Maastricht treaty itself has not been changed, the Noes argue that the voters are being conned. One of the most potent No-campaign posters depicts the Edinburgh agreement as the emperor with no clothes in the famous fable by Hans Christian Andersen. The Noes say that if Maastricht proceeds, it will set Europe on the slippery slope towards a European super-power, a European army and a European police, a vision which many Danes find deeply disturbing - and was probably the main factor in last year's referendum defeat. The weakness of the No campaign seems to be that it has no real alternative to offer. Mr Rasmussen was at his most effective at the meeting when he shot down Professor Meyer for his vague advocacy of wider co-operation with the Nordic countries and the countries of eastern Europe as an alternative to EC political co-operation. 'When I ask the No people what the alternative is, I hear something about mutually interlocking circles,' the prime minister said sarcastically to the evening's loudest applause. The Yes campaigners warn that Denmark will be dangerously isolated and could even be pushed out of the Community if there is a second No vote. The June Movement and others dismiss this as nonsense. Denmark cannot be forced to leave the EC against its will, they say, and will therefore continue to play a full part in the inevitable rethinking of Community strategy if the Maastricht treaty falls.</p>

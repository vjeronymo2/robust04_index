			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Teachers will reserve option of striking THE National Union of Teachers, the largest teaching union, yesterday backed away from strike action in opposition to the government's review body for teachers' pay. However, its executive reaffirmed the union's opposition to the body and refused to rule out the use of future industrial action. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, last week made the setting-up of the review body conditional upon the unions 'tacitly' giving up the strike weapon. In spite of the NUT's stance, he is still proceeding with the Teacher's Pay Bill, which has its second reading in the Commons on Monday. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said yesterday: 'Teachers should fear a review body because it could lead to a longer working year, a reduction in teacher support time, an extension of their duties and responsibilities, and increased use of discretionary pay, causing further divisions in the teaching profession.' However, the union said the NUT would take part in the review, if established, and indicated that strike action on the issue was now highly unlikely. The other five teachers' unions all support the proposed review body. The NUT also decided yesterday to oppose the introduction of teacher appraisal unless the government withdraws its proposal to link it to discretionary pay awards. Graduates are in increasing proportion taking a year out before starting work, a report disclosed yesterday. Cambridge University careers service said that 12 per cent of graduates were still not looking for work six months after graduation. Of those proceeding to jobs, teaching and the law were the most popular choices.</p>

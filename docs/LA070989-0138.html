			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HERMOSA CRACKS DOWN ON LIQUOR STORES, NIGHTCLUBS  </P> <P> In response to a rising number of citizen complaints about "excessive noise and  unruly behavior," Hermosa Beach police and firefighters soon will start an  aggressive campaign aimed at curbing violations of local and state laws at  liquor stores and nightclubs, Public Safety Director Steve Wisniewski has  announced.  </P> <P> "We're in the warning and notification phase now," said Wisniewski, who serves  as the chief of both the Police and Fire departments. "But in the very near  future, we will turn up the heat whenever it's necessary to gain compliance."  </P> <P> Letters are being sent to bars, restaurants and other establishments warning  owners to observe limits on occupancy and noise, he said, and liquor store  operators are being advised to check the ID of any customer who looks even  remotely like a minor.  </P> <P> Officers will be armed with noise meters when they check out entertainment  spots, Wisniewski said. He advised owners to close windows and doors when a  band is playing and to maintain screens over windows to prevent patrons from  passing drinks to friends outside.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Underage Stings  </P> <P> A couple of months ago, Wisniewski said, police worked for a week with Explorer  Scouts and other youths, who attempted to buy alcoholic beverages at bars and  liquor stores. When the underage "customers" made a purchase, he said, the  owners were cited. When they were turned down, Wisniewski sent the owner a  letter of commendation.  </P> <P> That operation netted 17 citations for selling liquor to minors, he said. He  said fines have ranged from $300 to $1,500 for the violations that have been  processed so far.  </P> <P> More recently, the Lighthouse Cafe was closed down for several hours one night  in the last week of June for exceeding its legal occupancy limit, the chief  said, and officers ordered P. J. Brett's on the Pacific Coast Highway to reduce  its seating capacity. Under the fire code, the limit for P. J. Brett's is 186  patrons, he said, but officers counted 238 stools and chairs.  </P> <P> The managers at both P. J. Brett's and the Lighthouse Cafe declined to comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More to Come  </P> <P> "We'll be doing a lot of this type of enforcement," Wisniewski said.  </P> <P> Councilman Roger Creighton said a joint meeting of the City Council and the  Planning Commission several months ago provided the impetus for the current  crackdown.  </P> <P> "We wanted to send a clear message that Hermosa Beach residents will no longer  tolerate excessive noise and unruly behavior at these places," he said. "The  problem starts when overcrowding is allowed, which leads to customers and noise  spilling into the streets."  </P></p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Indonesia's Astra tumbles 61% ASTRA International, Indonesia's leading automotive company, reported a 61 per cent fall in net profits last year to Rp81.49bn (Dollars 39.3m), including one-off disposal gains of Rp33bn, writes William Keeling in Jakarta. The figures, at the lower end of expectations, seal a turbulent year for the company, which saw the founding Soeryadjaya family reduce its majority stake in order to stave off personal bankruptcy. A reduction in Astra's holding in United Tractors accounted for half the disposals, but the company declined to reveal the identity of other sales. Vehicle sales for the first three months of this year have fallen by 16 per cent year-on-year, to 20,971. Banks are renegotiating Astra's estimated Dollars 800m foreign debt. Brokers estimate the company also has about Rp600bn in local debt and a Dollars 150m convertible bond. Its net debt to equity ratio, not including the convertible bond, rose from 110 per cent in 1991 to 140 per cent last year. However, Astra has maintained its reputation as Indonesia's foremost blue-chip stock, with a price to earnings ratio twice the local stock market average. ***** Coles Myer, Australia's largest retailer, reported a solid increase in third-quarter turnover and appeared to be heading for a strong sales performance for the full year, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said adjusted third-quarter sales had risen 5 per cent to ADollars 3.54bn (USDollars 2.5bn), lifting sales for the first nine months by 4.4 per cent to ADollars 11.46bn. Mr Bartels said sales figures, which had been adjusted for last year's disposal of some of the company's New Zealand interests, reflected a strong performance, against an inflation rate of about 1 per cent. 'We are particularly pleased that the rate of sales increase has been gathering momentum during the year despite the depressed economic conditions,' he said. 'The continuing improvement in performance by two of our major businesses, Coles Supermarkets and K mart, gives us confidence for a good full-year result.' ***** Burns, Philip &amp; Company, the Australian food technology and hardware group, reported higher earnings and sales for the nine months to March, but remained cautious about the full-year result, writes Bruce Jacques. Nine-month net profits rose 22 per cent to ADollars 74.8m (USDollars 52.8m) on a 17 per cent sales rise to ADollars 1.98bn. This was despite a static third-quarter net profit of ADollars 20.3m. Mr Andrew Turnbull, managing director, warned that the company traditionally earned higher profits in its first half. He said the full-year result would depend on the level of consumer confidence. The food and fermentation division was the biggest earnings contributor, lifting profit from ADollars 41.2m to ADollars 63.2m. Hardware division profits rose from ADollars 12.2m to ADollars 13.8m. ***** Australian National Industries, the engineering group, reports near static net earnings of ADollars 38.6m for the nine months to March on a 2 per cent sales increase to ADollars 878.3m, writes Bruce Jacques.</p>

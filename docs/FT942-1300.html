			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Forex dealersexpect stable three months Foreign exchange dealers expect currency markets to be relatively stable in the next three months, according to a survey by Foreign Exchange Letter, a newsletter published by Institutional Investor. More than two-thirds of dealers expect there to be no significant change in D-Mark/sterling, French franc/D-Mark, and yen/D-Mark rates. However, nearly half expect the yen/dollar rate to languish below Y104. (The survey was conducted in mid-June, prior to the recent sharp fall in the dollar.) Among chief dealers, 67 per cent expect to see more portfolio fund management business, and 33 per cent predict more leveraged fund business.</p>

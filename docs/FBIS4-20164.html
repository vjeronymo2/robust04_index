			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has offered  Finland as a mediator in the dispute between Russia and Estonia  over the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. Speaking on  Wednesday [27 April], President Ahtisaari expressed the hope  that Russia and Estonia can settle their differences on their  own, but if their talks become deadlocked Finland could mediate  if both sides asked for help. (?Wilf Stinger) reports: [passage  omitted]    President Ahtisaari said Wednesday that he hopes that the  two  parties themselves can find agreement without outside help. If  Finland were to become involved, he said, the first step would  be to find out if there is a real chance that its efforts would  be effective--if there's actually a solid basis for agreement.  The president described the situation as one which would  require the desire of both sides for the Finns to act as  mediators, and also a desire by both sides to reach a  settlement. President Ahtisaari also pointed out to the press  that (?often) in international disputes the expression of the  need for a mediator is in fact an act of faith in finding a  settlement. The mediator is not always actually needed.</p>

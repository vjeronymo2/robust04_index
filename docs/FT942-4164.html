			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Appointment to top job at Merck surprises industry Merck, the biggest drugs company in the US, yesterday surprised the pharmaceuticals industry by naming the head of a New Jersey-based medical devices company as its next president, chief executive and chairman. Mr Raymond Gilmartin, 53, is head of Becton Dickinson, which makes a wide range of medical products, including syringes, intravenous catheters and blood collecting equipment, and which had sales last year of Dollars 2.5bn. Merck has sales of Dollars 10bn, with such big-selling products as Vasotec, a treatment for hypertension, Mevacor, a cholesterol-lowering agent, and Pepcid, an anti-ulcer drug. The announcement comes after a year of upheaval in which three potential candidates for the top job at Merck have left the company. An appointment from outside had been expected, but the announcement, after the stock market had closed, came as a surprise. 'This will clearly be a substantial surprise, and a continuation of the trend of bringing in outsiders to shake up the company,' said Mr Viren Mehta, an industry analyst. Mr Gilmartin, who has been chief executive of Becton Dickinson since 1989, will take over as Merck's president and chief executive next Thursday, and will become chairman on November 1. He succeeds Mr Roy Vagelos, one of the pharmaceuticals industry's most widely-respected executives, who reaches the company's retirement age of 65 in November. Like other big drugs companies, Merck is facing pressure from managed care organisations, which have forced pharmaceuticals companies to offer big discounts. Mr Gilmartin said Merck 'will remain dedicated to its basic mission of discovering, developing and marketing innovative and cost-effective medicines'. Other executives once seen as possible successors to Mr Vagelos and who have left the company in the past year have been Mr Martin Wygod, formerly head of Medco, a drugs distribution company bought by Merck for Dollars 6.6bn last year; Mr John Zabriskie, one of four executive vice-presidents; and Mr Richard Markham, who left last summer after only seven months as company president.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Party electorate seeks some light in land of the bland: Kevin Brown finds there is little difference between the manifestos of the three leadership candidates So now we know what they stand for. Or do we? The launch yesterday of Mr John Prescott's personal manifesto for the Labour leadership completes a trio of election statements from the candidates to succeed John Smith. As expected Mr Prescott promised to establish a Commission for Full Employment which would recommend a jobs programme to next year's party conference. This body would be on the lines of the Social Justice Commission set up by Mr Smith. If there was a surprise, it lay in the reticence of the normally ebullient shadow employment secretary. He was unwilling to set targets for achieving the full employment policy he has set at the heart of his political programme. In that, however, he was following the lead given by Mr Tony Blair, the modernising shadow home secretary, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's traditionalist interim leader who, with Mr Prescott, is also contesting the deputy leadership. None of the candidates has felt able to challenge the Labour convention that only the party's annual conference may make policy. As a result the manifestos have been bland to the point of banality, leaving the 4.5m voters in Labour's three-part electoral college to scrutinise the candidates' style and language to put some light between them. There are differences, but they are not great. Mr Blair's manifesto is about opportunity and security for individuals in a world where the global economy has demonstrated the limits of government. Mrs Beckett's is about unity and social cohesion. Mr Prescott offers a robust defence of collective action and the state's role in employment creation. With the race half over Mr Blair has a clear lead, assuming that the 154 Labour MPs who nominated him actually vote for him. Mr Blair is keenly aware that he needs to maintain his image as the candidate best placed to win a general election. That means avoiding mistakes between now and the announcement of the result on July 21 - hence his infrequent public appearances and his virtual absence from the cauldron of prime minister's question time in the Commons. Mr Prescott has not given up hope of capturing the leadership, although he thinks he will have to come from behind to win. He believes that the media has misjudged opinion in the constituency and trade union sectors of the electoral college, which together control two-thirds of the votes. There really is no evidence on this either way. There have been few polls and although they have backed Mr Blair they have not distinguished eligible voters from party supporters. Friends say that Mr Prescott has been buoyed by the enthusiastic reception he has received at campaign meetings around the country. Sceptics point to Mr Michael Foot, the former Labour leader, who said much the same thing during Labour's disastrous 1983 election campaign. Mr Prescott's strategy is to win credit by bludgeoning the Conservatives and by arguing for specific policy pledges to build credibility with the electorate. He has a contempt for airy generalisations and freely uses such words as socialism. But his willingness to offer specific commitments has declined during the campaign. Full employment meant no more than 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent of the workforce unemployed - now it is a matter for debate. Mrs Beckett stood for the job because she was annoyed, in part on feminist grounds, that no-one took her seriously as a candidate after Mr Smith's death, even though she was then his deputy. Her campaign has focused largely on her competence as a former minister for schools in the Callaghan government and as the party's deputy and interim leader. The argument has some force. Mrs Beckett performed creditably in the difficult weeks after Mr Smith's death. But there have been poor performances in the Commons, notably after the prime minister's return from the Corfu European summit. Mrs Beckett started by shoring up her support on the left. Lately she has sought broader support by presenting herself as the only candidate able to unify the party's modernising and traditionalist factions. But critics say her decision to run for both the leadership and deputy leadership was a blunder which could lead to defeat in both contests. She has appeared devious in refusing to say whether she really wants to be deputy leader, and ungenerous in refusing to say whether she would serve in the shadow cabinet under the rival candidates. Mr Prescott, by contrast, has been keen to talk about the deputy's job, which he has contested twice before. He has made the tactically astute gesture of affirming that he would be honoured to serve in any post under any leader. Friends of all three candidates say they are confident that the campaign is moving their way. But no-one knows how the union and constituency electors will vote. The assured predictions that Mr Blair will be crowned leader assume that they will follow the MPs' lead. Friends of Mr Prescott and Mrs Beckett say this is a rash assumption. If they are right, Mr Blair will not be the only one with egg on his face. Joe Rogaly, Page 22</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Naira falls as Nigeria forex fears grow: Businesses turn to other sources on worries that supply may run out by end of the year Fears that Nigeria's official supply of foreign exchange will not last until the end of the year have sent the naira tumbling on the black market since late August as businesses turn to other sources of foreign currency for imports. The street value of the naira to the dollar has fallen from N55 to N68 in the past fortnight, while the government continues to allocate scarce dollars at N22, or one-third of the black market value. The Central Bank of Nigeria's allocation of Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) for this month met only 3 per cent of demand and takes the total allocated this year to Dollars 1.4bn. The government has cut its budget for allocations of foreign exchange to the private sector from Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 1.9bn. Many bankers and importers expect another cut in this target by the end of the year, which would leave manufacturers short of goods and materials and further depress the unofficial value of the naira. In January, General Sani Abacha's regime banned the parallel foreign exchange market and centralised all currency transactions through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at an official exchange rate of N22 to the dollar. The US embassy in Lagos recently exchanged dollars at a rate of N62, almost three times the official rate, through authorised banks. An embassy spokesman said the rate was approved by the Nigerian government. This privilege is denied to private-sector exporters wishing to bring back their export proceeds. In May, a committee under Mr Samuel Ogbemudia, labour minister, took control of currency allocations, including 15 per cent of the official supply which went to 'priority users'. These often went through middle men who demanded a premium of about N18 a dollar for an allocation at the official rate. The committee has been disbanded from this month. The black market devaluation also reflects recent political instability and fears that government spending will push up inflation. Western economists say the government deficit is heading towards last year's level of 17 per cent of gross domestic product, despite a budget forecast of zero deficit. Sharp increases in transport and food costs during the recent oil strike and a flood of freshly-minted bank notes are other signs that inflation, which is already running at 60 per cent a year, could rise even further.</p>

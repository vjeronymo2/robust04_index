			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Democratic senators close ranks behind Clinton DEMOCRATIC senators yesterday closed ranks behind President Bill Clinton's budget plan, but Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, who earlier this week broke with the White House, remained adamant in his opposition to the energy tax which is a key component of the plan. Even Democrats from oil-producing states, who share Mr Boren's hostility to the energy tax, rallied behind the administration's plan, criticising Mr Boren's alternative proposals for hurting the elderly. 'The breakaway group broke too far,' said Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, who earlier in the week had been expected to join Mr Boren in his rebellion. Senate Democratic leaders, however, held out the possibility of further concessions to help shield certain industries from the impact of the energy tax, which will be levied on the thermal content of fuels, and Mr Boren, too, opened the door to some form of energy tax. Mr Boren's opposition is enough to block the Clinton budget bill from moving forward from the Senate finance committee, in which he holds a crucial swing vote. The Boren alternative, unveiled with the backing of Senator Bennett Johnston, another Democrat, and two Republicans, would eliminate the energy tax, which is expected to raise Dollars 71.5bn (Pounds 46.4bn) over five years, and replace it with caps on pension and health benefits for the elderly. It stands no chance of passage, because it trips over Senate procedural rules that would require it to win 60 votes, not just a normal majority of 51. But its backers believe it could form the basis for a bipartisan compromise. Town without pity, Page 8</p>

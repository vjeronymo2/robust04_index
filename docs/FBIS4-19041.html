			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] The Rwandan ambassador in Brussels [Francois  Ngarukiyintwali] gave a press conference at noon today. The  ambassador heard from the journalists that his government had  fled from the capital, Kigali. Earlier, the ambassador denied  that there is an anti-Belgian campaign in Kigali. Francoise  Walminck, was that only a rumor?    [Ngarukiyintwali] "It is a rumor. I believe that, for Latin  scholars, it would be necessary to find the etymology of the  word in order to know what it means."    [Walminck] For weeks, Radio Mille Collines, a radio station  close to the authorities, has been broadcasting anti-Belgian  propaganda messages.    [Ngarukiyintwali] "And it is true that yesterday, I was  summoned to the Foreign Ministry by Minister Claes's chef de  cabinet. We spoke about various issues concerning the relations  between Belgium and Rwanda."    [Walminck] But, for the ambassador:    [Ngarukiyintwali] "This anti-Belgian campaign in Rwanda does  not exist."    [Walminck] Worse, the Rwandan Government is accusing the UN  Mission in Rwanda and the UN soldiers of not exercising proper  control at the airport when the attack on the presidential plane  took place, and, even worse, of giving technical support to the  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] rebels and of playing an active  role during the RPF operations against the Rwandan Army.</p>

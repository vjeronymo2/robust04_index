			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / Dublin to ease investment Ireland's 1994 finance bill, to be published today, includes measures to improve the investment climate for small and medium-size businesses. It will also provide additional attractions for the development of Dublin's offshore financial centre and the city's derelict docklands. Mr Bertie Ahern, finance minister, said the overall effect of the measures should have a 'broadly neutral' effect on the government's borrowing requirement thanks to the additional economic activity expected to be generated. The measures include raising the thresholds for VAT registration and increasing relief on capital gains tax, the introduction of capital allowances for the purchase of computer software, and an easing of restrictions on business expansion schemes. Of interest to UK mushroom growers will be the ending of the preferential 10 per cent corporation tax rate for Irish growers from this June.</p>

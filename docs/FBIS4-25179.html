			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Bingguang (7115 3521 0342)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Nanhai West Oil  Corporation of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation  [CNOOC] has adopted a two-pronged operations principle:  strengthening foreign cooperation as well as raising funds and  carrying out exploration and development on its own. It has  made significant progress in developing the vast natural gas  reserves in the western part of the South China Sea.  Development and construction is being undertaken simultaneously  offshore and on land, with well-drilling ships working day and  night on the vast Beibuwan waters, a region that has become a  principal battleground for China's natural gas exploration and  development.    Repeated evidence from Chinese and foreign experts indicate  rich natural gas resources in Yingge Hai and Hainan's southeast  basin, with reserves reaching 1.344 billion [as received] cubic  meters [cu m], or about one-third of China's total natural gas  resources. Of this total, about 2.5-3 trillion [as received] cu  m are resources with economic value. The development of this  vast natural gas reserves area is significant to altering the  energy structure and alleviating energy shortages in the south  as well as quickening economic construction in the southeast  coastal regions.    Since reform and opening up, the Nanhai West Oil Corporation  of the CNOOC has signed 21 contracts and agreements with 26 oil  companies from 10 countries to utilize foreign funds and  advanced technology and equipment, thereby quickening the pace  of exploring offshore oil and natural gas fields. By the end of  last year, $956 million had been utilized. Meanwhile, through  foreign cooperation, the company has trained a group of  scientific and technological teams capable of exploring and  developing offshore oil and natural gas fields independently in  line with international practice and standards.    The new discovery of natural gas reserves in the western  part  of the southern sea has interested many foreign oil companies.  Since 1992, the corporation has signed five new contracts with  ARCO Corporation, Crestone Corporation, and Esso Corporation of  the United States to explore natural gas fields. While  quickening exploration in the vast natural gas reserves region,  China is now carrying out large-scale development and  construction of the vast Ya 13-1 natural gas field project with  ARCO Corporation and Kuwait Foreign Oil Exploration Corporation,  with a total investment of $1.16 billion. According to the  agreement, 2.9 billion cu m of natural gas will be supplied to  Hong Kong annually via submarine pipelines for 20 years  beginning 1 January 1996, while 500 million cu m of natural gas  will be supplied to Hainan Province annually.    Since the beginning of this year, operating contractors  formed by Italy's (Shipeng) Ocean Engineering Corporation and  the European Ocean Engineering Transnational Corporation used an  advanced submarine-pipe-laying ship to lay over 700 km of 28-in  diameter submarine pipelines from the Zhu Jiang estuary to  Yingge Hai, and plan to complete the laying of over 70 km of  submarine pipeline from the Zhu Jiang estuary to Hong Kong's  receiving port in August. The 800-km long trunk pipeline is  Asia's longest submarine gas pipeline. Further, the construction  of a 14-in, 100-km submarine gas pipeline from the platform at  Yingge Hai to Hainan's Sanya City began at the beginning of this  month.    According to plans, reserves of 550-700 billion cu m of  natural gas and 240 million tonnes of crude oil will be added in  the vast natural gas reserves area in 15 years. By the end of  this century, an annual production capability for 10 billion cu  m of natural gas and 1 million tonnes of crude oil will be  developed.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / BAe ousts Royal Ordnance executive BRITISH AEROSPACE has removed the managing director of Royal Ordnance, its armaments subsidiary, in a move revealing further sharp divergences within the group about its business strategies. Mr Peter Kenyon, who had headed Royal Ordnance for three-and-a-half years, has been replaced by Mr David Parry, formerly engineering director of British Aerospace Defence, the company formed this year to pool all BAe's military interests. The Royal Ordnance board was told when it was summoned for a meeting on Monday by Mr John Weston, chairman of BAe Defence. The move is believed to have stemmed from growing irritation at BAe's headquarters over Mr Kenyon's independent approach. It continues a series of top management upsets at BAe, following Professor Sir Roland Smith's resignation as chairman last September amid a row over the handling of a Pounds 432m rights issue. The latest upheaval comes just a month after Mr John Cahill, a former chief executive of the BTR industrial conglomerate, took over as the new BAe chairman. Mr Kenyon's removal took colleagues at Royal Ordnance by surprise. One executive described the atmosphere in the company as 'a bit like a pithead disaster'. BAe however described the move yesterday as 'a routine management change'. It said Mr Kenyon remained employed by the group and was awaiting re-appointment to another job. Royal Ordnance has shown clear discomfort at BAe's efforts to integrate its defence operations, seeking to preserve its own identity and commercial standing. After BAe's flopped rights issue, its management sought to distance the company from the well-publicised problems of the parent group. Mr Kenyon was known to be keen on building up Royal Ordnance's position as supplier of a wide range of army equipment including military vehicles. In April the company bought BMARC, a producer of guns and ammunition belonging to the Astra Holdings group, which had gone into receivership. The deal, understood to have involved a payment of just under Pounds 10m, is being studied by the Office of Fair Trading.</p>

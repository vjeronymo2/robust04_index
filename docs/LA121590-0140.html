			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SKIING / BOB LOCHNER;  </P> <P> ROUGH START FOR U.S. IN WORLD CUP  </P> <P> It's still early, of course, but the U.S. Ski Team appears to be taking a  distressingly familiar course on the World Cup circuit.  </P> <P> So far, the men are nowhere, and the women are almost totally dependent on one  skier, Diann Roffe, who has apparently replaced the retired Tamara McKinney as  the only U.S. hope for high placings against the strong Austrian, German and  Swiss racers.  </P> <P> After four men's events, the United States has six points in the men's  standings -- four for Tommy Moe of Palmer, Alaska, and one each for Kyle  Rasmussen of Angels Camp, Calif., and A.J. Kitt of Rochester, N.Y.  </P> <P> Moe was 13th in a downhill at Val Gardena, Italy, Friday. Kitt, who finished  45th last weekend at Val d'Isere, France, just a couple of days after it was  announced that he had signed a personal representation contract with  International Management Group, was 15th Friday to earn his first World Cup  point.  </P> <P> Kitt, 22, started this season as a solid downhill threat and a possible  medalist in both the World Alpine Ski Championships at Saalbach-Hinterglemm,  Austria, next month and the 1992 Winter Olympics at Albertville, France.  </P> <P> The men race again today at Val Gardena.  </P> <P> Roffe, 23, of Isle La Motte, Vt., is off to an excellent start with 29 points  in four races, enough for third in the women's standings behind Austrians Petra  Kronberger, who has 95, and Sigrid Wolf, who has 35.  </P> <P> It hasn't helped the U.S. cause that Kristi Terzian, who scored points in 17  World Cup races last season, is out for the season after suffering a serious  knee injury in October. But this only underscores the lack of depth on the  American team.  </P> <P> This weekend, the women are racing in downhill, giant slalom and super-G at  Meiringen, Switzerland, although Friday's races were canceled because of fog.  </P> <P> The men, after their downhill today, will remain in Italy for a giant slalom  Sunday at Alta Badia and a slalom Tuesday at Madonna di Campiglio. Fittingly,  an Italian is leading the standings -- Alberto Tomba has 47 points, five more  than runner-up Franck Piccard of France.  </P> <P> An early-week storm dusted Sierra ski resorts, but only eight have enough snow  to operate (from south to north): Mammoth Mountain, Kirkwood, Heavenly Valley,  Alpine Meadows, Squaw Valley, Northstar, Donner Ski Ranch and Boreal. Depths  range from 12 to 36 inches on selected slopes.  </P> <P> Diamond Peak at Ski Incline, on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, is open this  weekend only, through Sunday, pending the arrival of another storm.  </P> <P> In the Southland, a trace of natural powder has been added to the base  accumulated through snow-making at the four operational ski areas -- Mountain  High, Snow Valley, Snow Summit and Bear Mountain.  </P> <P> Brian Head, located in southern Utah, has opened for the season, reporting a  base of 15 inches with more snow reportedly on the way.  </P> <P> Five of seven lifts are running, serving about 65% of the runs on Brianhead  Peak and Navajo Peak.  </P> <P> Skiing Notes  </P> <P> Taped highlights of last Saturday's World Cup men's downhill race at Val  d'Isere, France, will be shown on Channel 7 at 3 p.m. today. The GGP  Sports-produced program will also include freestyle skiing competition at  Tignes, France. . . . Martina Navratilova was one of Bob Beattie's guests on  "Subaru Ski World" Friday on ESPN. "Martina is without question one of the best  skiers around," said Beattie, the former U.S. Ski Team coach. "I'm convinced  that had she chosen the downhill instead of (tennis), she would have been just  as huge a success as she is today."  </P> <P> The U.S. Pro Tour, which took last weekend off, will stop next at Nashoba  Valley, Mass., where races will be held for both men and women today and  Sunday. . . . Greg Mannino of Yorba Linda, Urban Miyares of San Diego and  Jeremiah Landreth of Brea won their divisions in National Handicapped Sports  regional qualifying races last weekend at Breckenridge, Colo. . . . Starting  today, United Express will offer 12 nonstop flights a week from LAX to Aspen,  Colo., and SkyWest Airlines will have a nonstop flight each Thursday and  Saturday from LAX to Telluride, Colo., through March 31.  </P> <P> Friday's scheduled grand opening of Bear Mountain's Big Bear Express was  postponed until Jan. 4 because of construction delays, but the detachable quad  chairlift should be operating for skiers by late next week, according to  President Jerry Blann. . . . Squaw Valley's new Snow King Mountain is now fully  open, according to chairman Alex Cushing.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola  [MPLA] says the government delegation will not accept any of the  demands made by the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] in its latest proposals. MPLA Information  Secretary Joao Lourenco says Savimbi men's proposals are absurd.  There will be no power sharing.    [Begin recording] [Lourenco] UNITA proposals are completely  absurd. It is going too far. As a party which lost the  elections and afterward seriously violated the law by taking up  arms and setting the country alight, it cannot make the demands  it is making in Lusaka today.    [Unidentified correspondent] How far is your statement true?  Are you not saying this just to calm down your voters?    [Lourenco] No, this is not just aimed at calming down our  electorate. We think it is a serious issue which must receive  due importance. We think it would be a bad precedent not only  for future elections in our country but also in other African  countries, particularly southern African countries. What UNITA  should do is to try to win a future election, and it will be  able to head the sectors it has mentioned. If this does not  happen, it cannot make such demands. There is no international  body which can force us to accept UNITA's demands because we won  the elections. [end recording]</p>

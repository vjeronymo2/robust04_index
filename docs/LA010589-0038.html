			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC WILL ATTEMPT TO COME OUT OF TAILSPIN AT CORVALLIS  </P> <P> After losing 3 of its last 4 games, USC's basketball team hopes to bounce back  tonight against Oregon State.  </P> <P> Although the Beavers, 7-3 overall and 0-2 in the Pacific 10, have been  inconsistent, USC Coach George Raveling respects Coach Ralph Miller's team.  </P> <P> "I learned a long time ago that you never count a Ralph Miller-coached team out  of anything," Raveling said. "I'll bet you a guy could have made a good living  over the years going to Vegas before the season started and betting on Miller's  teams."  </P> <P> The Beavers are led by guards Eric Knox and Gary Payton.  </P> <P> Knox, a 6-foot 2-inch senior from Inglewood, is averaging 14.6 points while  coming off the bench. Payton, a 6-3 junior, is averaging 14.4 points, 5.1  rebounds and 9 assists.  </P> <P> "Gary Payton is a lot like Ralph Miller in that he's never gotten the credit he  deserves," Raveling said. "I don't know of a player and coach who have gone  through their careers getting more done and getting less credit for it than  those two guys."  </P> <P> Although USC (7-5, 0-1) has matched its victory total of last season, Raveling  is frustrated with the Trojans' inability to win close games.  </P> <P> "We should be 9-3," he said. "We get ourselves in a position to win and we're  unable to finish it off. It's like going to a party and you get to dance with  the prettiest girl there and you're afraid to ask her for a date."  </P></p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (8): Regulators want answers - Technology, lack of integration hampers many firms / Unmatched systems at product and departmental level can be a nightmare for managers TALK ABOUT technology with anyone in the derivatives business, and it will not be long before the word 'integration' comes up. Integration can mean one of two things. At the broadest level, it means bringing together the computer hardware, database tools and software used in the front and back offices, to create a seamless operational web that allows managers effectively to monitor and control their derivatives operations. In a narrower sense, integration can also mean employing a single software package which can handle the entire range of derivative instruments, including swaps, forward rate agreements, options and all the many variations. Both forms of integration are ideals to which firms aspire. The reality, however, is often something different. Some players in the derivatives market use one system for swaps, another system for options, a third for caps, and so on. Similarly, the absence of integration between front and back offices means that firms use ill-matched systems that are both old and new, home-made and externally-developed, and above all, technologically incompatible. The resulting lack of integration at a product and departmental level can be a nightmare for derivatives managers. More worrying, it raises important questions about a firm's ability to monitor and control what is a complex and risky business. These are questions that regulators, especially in the US, want answered. Mr Chester Feldberg, executive vice-president of the New York Federal Reserve, raised the issue of poor management in the derivatives business, last March, in a letter to banks operating under its jurisdiction. Mr Feldberg said the Fed had become aware of some 'basic internal control weaknesses' within the banks' trading operations, including inadequate accounting and control procedures in the trading of options, foreign exchange and interest rate derivative products. He went on to ask banks to review their risk-management controls and systems, and to take remedial action where necessary to bring them up to standard. What so alarms the Fed is the possibility that banks may lack the technological tools and organisational structures to measure and control adequately the financial risks on their diversified derivatives books. In particular, the authorities fear that some banks - especially the small and mid-sized operators who have rushed into the derivatives business in search of quick, big profits - do not really know the full extent of their exposures. These fears are sometimes stoked by the third-party technology providers - the software companies that specialise in providing banks and securities houses with derivatives management systems. While most players in the market tend to cherry-pick the best software the vendors have to offer - relying on a lot of their own, in-house developed technology to complete the structure - the software companies are understandably keen on preaching the gospel of integration. Mr Rod Beckstrom, a former Morgan Stanley trader who founded C ATS Software, one of the main providers of software to the industry, says integration is sorely lacking in many banks' derivatives operations. 'Many firms still can't mark their entire portfolios to market on a dynamic intraday basis, because their systems lack adequate speed,' Mr Beckstrom told a swaps dealers conference earlier this year. 'Some organisations can't update their accounting books on a daily basis. Some miss payments and must suffer huge penalties. Some firms can administer a swap through its life for about Dollars 2,500, while others spend about Dollars 35,000.' Mr Beckstrom argues that the central problem is the discrepancy that exists between what banks want to do in the way of risk management, and what their existing, non-integrated technology enables them to do. This lack of integration is not just a consequence of using ill-fitting systems - differences between front- and back-office management can create political hurdles that are difficult to overcome. As one derivatives banker puts it: 'In organisations, people have separate sets of objectives, and in many cases heads just clash over this sort of thing.' One way to avoid the departmental rivalries that impede systems integration is to make one senior executive responsible for both the front and back offices. It also helps if the back-office staff are not kept in the dark about what the 'rocket scientists' who design the products and the dealers who trade them are up to. Chemical Bank, in New York, is one place where the distinctions between front and back office have been blurred by integration. Mr Jeffrey Larsen, head of the bank's global derivatives operations, says his back-office staff are extremely sophisticated, and understand what is happening at the sharp end of the business. This sharing of knowledge has created a 'middle office' occupied by systems and operational staff who bridge the gap between the front and back offices. Chemical is one of the few in the derivatives business to rely almost entirely on its technology. Apart from a few remnants of outside software from its early days in the business, everything is designed and built internally. This is because the bank has discovered that mixing internally and externally developed systems is a complicated and not always effective process. Integration is also much easier if everything is done in-house. Mr Larsen admits that the new 'open' systems - which allow banks to take different groups of business computers and integrate them so they work as a whole - are more conducive to mixing. For the sake of cost and consistency, however, Chemical is sticking with its in-house technology, although it is updating its hardware from IBM-compatible PCs (the technology which most players in the business still rely on) to Unix workstations, 'so that we can hook everything together.' The ability to run greater numbers of different applications simultaneously is why more and more firms are moving up to workstations. Although the latest high-end PCs compare favourably with Unix workstations in certain respects, the Microsoft operating systems remains relatively basic when measured against the Unix, which also has superior networking capabilities - an important point for banks and securities houses with big trading floors. Most players in the derivatives business use a combination of their own and vendor-supplied technology. The main software providers - Devon Systems is the market leader, and others include C ATS Software, Quotient, and Renaissance Software - also sell a package that serves both front- and back-office needs. Their software fulfils a number of key functions. In the front office, it is used for transaction structuring and pricing, and for portfolio risk management that enables users to hedge the different components of risk. In the back office, software systems handle payments and settlement processing, and also execute accounting and reporting functions. At its best, the outside vendor should offer the user a package that covers all markets and all instruments, and is fully integrated, enabling front and back offices to work smoothly together. Some of the most sophisticated players do not just use their own technology alongside that provided by vendors; they also take third-party software, and program it to support their own models - and the providers design their products so users can do just that. Vendor-supplied software is probably most effectively employed in the pricing of traders' derivatives books. Because no central exchange exists where dealers can find prices for over-the-counter derivatives, firms have a choice. They either build their own valuation models, or they can turn to an outside vendor, whose technology has been proven in the marketplace. Many choose the latter course, primarily because harnessing software that is widely used in the business gives them the confidence that the models and formulas they employ to value their proprietary trading portfolios are not out of kilter with the rest of the market's. Those banks that rely on in-house developed systems to value books are taking a risk. No one else is using their system, so it is difficult to determine whether they are correctly valuing their derivatives books. In a highly competitive business that thrives on innovation, keeping up with the latest derivatives technology can be expensive. Although it varies greatly, according to the size of each operation, industry observers estimate that a reasonably-sized player in the market can spend anything between Dollars 100,000 and several million dollars a year on vendor-supplied software alone. When the cost of the hardware, or of developing in-house systems, is added, the figures reach tens of millions of dollars. And firms never stop spending on technology. As Mr Patrick Brazel, of Devon Systems explains: 'You pay all the time, because of the rate of change of functional changes in the systems.'</p>

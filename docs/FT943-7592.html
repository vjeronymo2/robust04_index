			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Tokyo Last week's sudden appreciation of the yen against the dollar is likely to keep investors wary, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The impact on corporate earnings is expected to be severe if the US currency remains below the Y100 level. Such concerns may start to materialise this week, as mid-term results leaked to the press ahead of the September book closing will start affecting share prices. Lower than expected half-year results may prompt profit taking in export oriented companies, which have already been battered by the yen's appreciation.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Head of Morgan Grenfell's wider family - Two of a kind: Bankers with unique perspectives speak to David Marsh Mr John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, is a British banker with a difference: he enjoys a unique inside view of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank. Deutsche Bank acquired Morgan Grenfell at the end of 1989 in a Pounds 950m (Dollars 1.46bn) deal, and as a result Mr Craven became the first non-German in the bank's 123-year history to gain a seat on its management board. Like the other dozen board members, he earned an estimated DM1.5m (Dollars 920,000) last year - nearly double the Morgan Grenfell chairman's Pounds 330,000 (Dollars 508,200) salary in 1989. After three-and-a half years of observing his august new parent company, Mr Craven's enthusiasm is palpable. 'It is incredibly well managed and works incredibly well.' He spends two days a week visiting German companies or attending Deutsche Bank meetings, and cites the length of Deutsche's board sessions - which average five to six hours - as an example of the benefits of German thoroughness. Each board member has executive responsibility for a specific operating area. This means, he says, that measures agreed at the top can be implemented through the group with smoothness and decisiveness. Four Deutsche Bank board members, including Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's board speaker, sit on Morgan Grenfell's board, taking part in all strategic decisions. Deutsche Bank this year has increased its influence over the management of Morgan Grenfell's German subsidiary, the country's leading mergers and acquisition specialist. Nonetheless, Mr Craven says his bank has maintained a separate identity within the Deutsche Bank group. Morgan Grenfell's senior executive team has remained largely unchanged since the takeover, even though overall staff numbers have dropped to 2,000 from 2,300. 'Deutsche Bank paid a goodwill sum of between Pounds 450m and Pounds 500m to reflect Morgan Grenfell's history, mentality and people. It would have been foolish to have paid this price and then to have got rid of the people.' The Anglo-German link has brought complementary advantages. After turbulent years during the 1980s, Morgan Grenfell has benefited from Deutsche Bank's financial strength and deal-making contacts. After-tax profits last year, at Pounds 56m, were double the 1990 level. Deutsche has gained access to Morgan Grenfell's financial engineering skills at a time when German companies have been seeking novel responses to the challenges of reunification and recession. 'The strength of the D-Mark, the costs of unification, high welfare payments  - this has all contributed to a situation where parts of German industry have become uncompetitive.' These difficulties, according to Mr Craven, have increased demand in Germany for Morgan Grenfell's expertise in areas such as mergers and acquisitions, disposals and joint ventures. 'Deutsche Bank correctly anticipated that German companies would increasingly use mergers and acquisitions to address strategic objectives. Deutsche Bank didn't have a network of M&amp;A officers. By contrast, we have 300 merger people around the world. 'Three years ago, Morgan Grenfell had an active relationship with less than half a dozen major German companies. Now we have access to a majority of the big German companies - perhaps 50 or 60.' About 30 German corporate deals in which Morgan Grenfell has acted as adviser have been made public. Because times are harder, he believes one central feature of the German economic system - the country's 'universal' banks, playing combined roles as lenders, traders in securities, and long-term shareowners - retains crucial importance. 'A bank like the Deutsche Bank is a bit like a combination of the National Westminster Bank, S. G. Warburg and the Prudential. 'If a company gets into trouble in Germany, the attitude of the Deutsche Bank is: 'How can we assist it to get through this troubled period?' In Britain, the moment a clearing banker knows there is a problem, the reaction is, 'How quickly can we run our exposure down?' '</p>

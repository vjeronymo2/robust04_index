			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Ivan Ivanov and Gennadiy </F> Talalayev]    Moscow January 13 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Georgiy Mamedov said the current U.S.-Russian summit is the most  "intense, businesslike and concrete" of all summit meetings he  had attended.    The main leitmotif of the extended talks between the Russian  and American delegations that took place in the Kremlin on  Thursday can be phrased like this, Mamedov said --  "Russian-American relations have passed the period when  bilateral relations focused on humanitarian and other assistance  to Russia at the initial stage of reform."    "Now they have moved on to macroeconomic partnership,  support  for structural reform in Russia, transformation of relations  between Russia, its neighbours and large countries of the world,  and changes in the attitude of international economic agencies  towards reform in Russia with special attention to be paid to  its social aspects,+ Mamedov said.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Mamedov stressed  that U.S. President Bill Clinton has proposed a whole package of  concrete measures to facilitate, in cooperation with other  countries and international economic organisations, radical  changes in approaches towards Russia to let it into the world  markets and promote relations between Russia and former Soviet  republics.    To exemplify his point, Mamedov said that the U.S. has  persuaded international economic organisations to provide  financial assistance to the CIS states to buy fuel and energy in  Russia at higher prices.    "There is also a program of support for conversion of the  defence industry aimed at preventing further increase of  unemployment. The means released will be used to finance social  programs, including job placement," he said.    During the discussion of the economic situation in Russia  Clinton said that in his opinion based on analyses provided by  American institutions Russia will be able to make a breakthrough  in two years. This may enable it to qualify as the eighth member  of the G-7 group. "But this is a very complicated problem. The  American side said it would welcome such changes from the  political point of view, adding that structural reform in Russia  should lead to the reorganisation of the G-7 group into a G-8  one from the economic perspective as well," Mamedov said.    During the talks earlier today, Clinton voiced support for  the idea of Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade. He also said the U.S. would abolish customs duties  for almost 4,400 types of Russian goods, deputy minister said.</p>

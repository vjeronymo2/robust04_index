			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: ALLERGIES ARE NOT TO BE SNEEZED AT  </P> <P> All of us can recall hearing someone turn down food with this catch-phrase: "No  thanks. I'm allergic."  </P> <P> But are they? Studies show that true food allergies, triggered by reactions of  the immune system, are far rarer than generally thought.  </P> <P> Babies and young children are most often affected. Prevalence for this group is  estimated at between 0.3% and 7.5%. The incidence is believed to decline with  age, down to less than 2% for American adults. Some adults develop an allergy  to food after eating it for years, however.  </P> <P> One problem in determining the extent of food allergies lies in defining terms.  "Food allergy" is often used loosely. It covers not only reactions of  intolerance to foods and food additives but also conditions that produce  symptoms similar to food allergies but aren't food-related.  </P> <P> Symptoms are varied, commonly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract or  respiratory system. They range from mild itching or headache through hives or  stomach upset to a violent asthma attack or the threat of imminent asphyxiation  from anaphylaxis (the swelling of membranes lining the nose, mouth and  esophagus). Symptoms may come on shortly after eating or up to three days  later, and they can vary in intensity in the same individual depending on how  much of the offending food is eaten, whether it's taken on an empty stomach or  whether the person exercises right after eating.  </P> <P> Diagnosis of food allergies is difficult and time-consuming. Most health  professionals agree that food reactions fall into four categories.  </P> <P>  -- Food intolerance. An unusual, generalized reaction to a food component or  additive. Lactose intolerance is an example.  </P> <P>  -- Food toxicity. Caused by a toxic component in the food, as in poisonous  mushrooms, or by contaminating microorganisms, such as Salmonella.  </P> <P>  -- Food idiosyncrasy. An individualized, strong response to a small amount of  a food substance or additive that would have no effect on most people (such as  caffeine, monosodium glutamate or sulfites). The response is unrelated to  metabolic, pharmacologic or immune reactions.  </P> <P>  -- Food allergy. Strictly defined as a reaction involving the body's immune  system. The food substances (antigens) most likely to trigger an immediate  allergic reaction are glycoproteins (a compound of protein and carbohydrate).  Foods most commonly implicated include eggs, milk, white fish, shellfish, nuts  and peanuts.  </P> <P> In diagnosing allergies, the first step is a complete physical examination with  a detailed history of the illness and any possible connection between symptoms  and exposure to certain foods. Occasionally that's enough to pin down a  culprit, but usually it's just the beginning.  </P> <P> An "elimination diet" may be tried as a preliminary step. The patient may also  be asked to keep a food and symptom diary, which might finger a few prime  suspects.  </P> <P> Skin tests are the most usual method. An extract of a specific food is applied  under the surface of the skin. Reddening and swelling within 15 to 20 minutes  indicates an immediate reaction, produced by a specific hemoglobin (usually  IgE). The tests are done in a clinic or hospital, in case of serious reactions.  </P> <P> Skin tests are useful for screening possible offenders, but they can't produce  a firm diagnosis. The same is true of the blood test known as RAST, or  "radioallergosorbent test."  </P> <P> Elimination-challenge testing is the most precise way to confirm a  cause-and-effect relationship. Once previous testing has focused on a likely  candidate, the suspect food is removed from the diet. If there is no  significant improvement after two weeks, either the suspect is cleared or a  stricter diet must be tried, eliminating other factors.  </P> <P> If there is a decided improvement, the challenge phase begins -- very  carefully. This means double-checking by reintroducing the probable offender.  The challenge is done under supervision, in facilities equipped to cope with  severe reactions. The patient should be in good health, experiencing minimal  symptoms and taking little or no allergy medication. For older children and  adults, it's done with the food and a placebo, and the patient does not know  which he's getting.  </P> <P> Once the offender has been identified, the simplest remedy is avoidance. For  people who are violently allergic, the food must be shunned forever. With some  allergies, it may be necessary to avoid other similar foods. Shellfish, for  example, are particularly cross-reactive.  </P> <P> Some people will need substitute foods. Milk-sensitive infants are given soy  formulas. Patients may need lists of prepared foods that contain the offending  substance as an ingredient and special recipes that do not. They are shown how  to spot similar substances on food labels. Whey and casein, for instance, are  milk derivatives; ovalbumin and ovomucoid come from eggs.  </P> <P> It's true that people whose allergy is moderate may eat the food occasionally  or in small amounts without severe reaction. But once a true food allergy has  been diagnosed, it's probably safest to avoid the offender altogether, at least  until rigorous retesting clears the path.  </P> <P> Question: I know that Vitamin D is the sunshine vitamin and that the only other  major source is milk that's been fortified with the vitamin. But do any other  foods contribute any at all?  </P> <P> Answer: Only a few foods, all of animal origin, contain significant amounts of  Vitamin D. And we don't eat most of those often enough or in large enough  amounts to have much impact. Furthermore, the amount present in any given food  varies, depending on what the animal ate and the extent to which it was exposed  to sunlight.  </P> <P> Let's take some examples. Three-and-a-half ounces of fatty fish, such as  herring or salmon, provide 300 international units (IUs) of Vitamin D, or 150%  of the adult Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). If you eat these fish  regularly, they represent a potentially good source. A piece of liver, weighing  3 1/2 ounces before cooking, would contain between 15 and 40 IU; a medium egg,  25 IU; and a tablespoon of butter, 15 IU. By comparison, you can depend on a  cup of milk to give you 100 IU -- half the amount recommended for non-pregnant  and non-lactating adults. So except for people who consistently eat fatty fish,  the source of choice (other than sunlight) is Vitamin D fortified milk.  </P> <P> Q: A friend recently served lobster at a dinner party. When I separated the  tail from the body, I was startled to see a greenish-black, oily, sticky  material on the tail meat that looked most unappetizing. Two of the five guests  at the party had the same thing. Since this experience was new to us, we were  concerned about whether the meat was safe to eat. However, we rinsed it before  eating, and no problems occurred. Did we do the right thing? What is that  greenish slime?  </P> <P> A: Don't worry. The meat was safe, even though it looked unattractive. The  phenomenon you observed is related to an imbalance between a lobster's ovarian  cycle and its molting cycle. Normally, female lobsters carry their eggs in the  tail section for nine or 10 months. In the molting cycle, the lobster sheds its  shell for a larger one. But if this cycle is not properly synchronized with the  ovarian cycle, the eggs are not released. The greenish-black, viscous material,  which gets its color from a protein called lipovitellin, is simply the  unreleased eggs.  </P> <P> Q: What is the difference between white bread flour, all-purpose flour and cake  flour?  </P> <P> A: These types of flour vary in three different ways. The first has to do with  how much of the starchy endosperm of the wheat kernel is used in each. The term  to describe this is "patent." So-called "long-patent" flour contains a higher  percentage of the endosperm, including the more crush-resistant portion, which  is higher in protein than the other parts. Thus, long-patent bread flour has  slightly more protein than all-purpose or cake flour. "Short-patent" cake flour  contains the smallest amount of the endosperm and is lowest in protein.  All-purpose flour falls in the middle.  </P> <P> In this country, with its rich protein supply, the difference in protein  content among these flours is nutritionally insignificant, but it's of great  importance to the baking process. The higher amount of protein in bread flour  leads to the development of a gluten that has the strong, elastic quality  necessary to hold bread together. In all-purpose flour, the gluten is less  strong and elastic. And in the starchy cake flour, the gluten is sufficiently  weak to allow for the delicate texture of cakes.  </P> <P> A second difference among this trio of flours has to do with the size of  particles. Not only are particles largest in bread flour, they're also coarser  and grittier than fine, powdery cake flour. Again, all-purpose flour lies in  the middle.  </P> <P> The last difference relates to the type of wheat used. Bread flour is made  primarily from hard wheat. Cake flour is produced from soft wheat. And  all-purpose flour is usually made from a blend of wheats mixed together to  achieve an appropriate protein content.  </P></p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / A good sport, bad at games: Kenneth Clarke hated playing cricket at school but admits to Teresa Mclean a selective love of the game today I GOT UP grotesquely early in order to talk about cricket with Kenneth Clarke, secretary of state for education and science. The Department of Education and Science is a dreary office block next to Waterloo Station, London, and its employees arrived for work in bits and drabs, looking dismal. The only person with a smile on his face was a very tall, very thin West Indian official who grinned while touching his toes. Between manoeuvres he checked identification cards. I was relieved to be taken to the 12th floor, half asleep, for another long wait before Clarke arrived late and greeted me through clouds of cigar smoke. It was a cigar interview. Clarke launched it, practising his smoke puffs: 'This isn't going to be about politics, is it?' 'No. Don't worry. Only about cricket.' A wave of the arm. 'Sit down. Doesn't matter where.' He was already sitting down. In shirtsleeves, warm, comfortable, well-padded by good dinners, untroubled by anything this world might produce to threaten him. 'I was useless at cricket. Never played it; only if I had to at school. Never wanted to play it.' Clarke's secretary sat at the other end of a long table, taking occasional notes that didn't seem to have anything to do with what he was saying. She gave the impression of filling in time, as did Clarke, who never pretended to know much about the game, just enough to find it 'absorbing and relaxing'. But it didn't take long for his cricketing incompetence to inspire him to some rhetoric. 'Come to think of it, I did play for the Department of Employment against our opposite numbers in the Labour party. That was great fun. It was in a village in the Cotswolds and I played for two years running. The first year was tremendous. I even took some wickets, bowling to some very, very bad batsmen.' 'What sort of bowling did you do?' He was delighted with that question, beamed and caressed his stomach. 'No idea. I just hurled it down.' He went on, enveloped in a swirling smog of mauvish smoke. 'I took a slip catch. The ball was coming straight at me and I couldn't get out of the way fast enough. That game gave me a false idea of my ability. The next year was awful. I hit the ball, somehow, in the direction of square leg, set off down the pitch and collapsed in agony with a torn calf muscle.' I showed concern. 'There's worse to come. The umpire pursued me all the way off the field of play to make sure the scorer, who was my wife, knew that I had scored 0, not 1.' He ended the story on a note of splendid pathos. 'Retired hurt for 0. I hung up my bat.' Since then Clarke has stuck to what he really likes doing, which is watching, not playing cricket. 'I like it because I am a traditionalist. I find cricket aesthetically pleasing.' 'Do you like village cricket?' 'Not much. I don't watch it.' 'One-day cricket?' 'No. I hate it. I like Test and county cricket. I don't find county cricket boring; I find it intriguing, though I seldom have time to go to matches. What I really like is Test cricket.' His favourite Test ground is Trent Bridge - his home ground - where he was taken to county matches as a boy and learnt to love the game. He was born and brought up in Nottingham and is MP for Mansfield, in Nottingham. Clarke's local patriotism is one of the most likeable things about him and one of the few things he talked about with genuine concern. When I asked him who was his favourite cricketer, he chose Reg Simpson, the great Nottinghamshire and England batsman and fielder of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Simpson was a most distinguished hardy perennial of English cricket but he was not one of the glamorous choices I would have expected of Clarke, who described his hero simply: 'He was a marvellous cricketer.' Almost embarrassed to be caught in anything other than his jolly-good-chap mode, Clarke added: 'Reg is on the Nottinghamshire committee now, you know, and I see him whenever I go to Trent Bridge.' He goes as often as he can, which is not as often as he would like, and he was outspoken in his preference for Trent Bridge to Lords, which he finds an unfriendly place. Given that he prefers football to cricket because football is a 'total switch-off', whereas cricket demands attention, he said he can think of few nicer ways of spending a day than watching local lad Eddie Hemmings play in a Trent Bridge Test match. His cigar finished, his smile getting a bit tired, Clarke admitted that sometimes Lords had more to offer than Trent Bridge. There followed an almost caricature-like depiction of himself living the good life. 'I have a friend who is an Indian businessman. He has a box at Lords, in the best possible position, and it is always full of people for Test matches. I go along there and enjoy myself immensely.' It was with this friend that Clarke took part in a bizarre and exotic little escapade of cricket oddity. His secretary and I listened in silent fascination as he told us how he had gone out to stay with his friend in Bombay a while ago and they had suddenly decided, after dinner, to go and look at the Test ground. 'We went to the ground, got in without too much trouble and walked out to the middle. We walked round and round and up and down the pitch. It was midnight and there was a huge, bright moon in the sky. Then some officials came and made us go. 'Next time the politics of education and science strikes you as a trifle on the dull side, conjure up in your mind the image of the present minister walking in the footsteps of the greats of Indian cricket, illicitly, in tropical clothes, on a moonlit night.' Clarke found the image irresistible and mused on it contentedly while I tried to get a few matter-of-fact statements from him about cricket in English schools and the future of English cricket. He forestalled me by admitting all cricket's problems and weaknesses in this country. There was less school cricket than there had ever been before so there was a smaller pool of players for first-class teams to draw on. He did not have the faintest idea what to do about any of these troubles. The nearest he got to a defensive reaction or a statement of policy was his pronouncement, with an air of after-dinner humour, that the obvious answer to the decline of cricket in schools was to make it compulsory in all schools, for both sexes. My parting question was the first one which caught him off guard, floundering around for something to say. I asked him how he would describe himself in politics, using cricketing comparisons. Did he see himself as a hard hitting Gooch-like batsman? A graceful, Gower-like batsman, perhaps? A cunning slow bowler? Or what? He replied: 'What a strange question] I can't see myself as any type of player. I don't fall into any category. All I can say for certain is that I'm not a slow bowler, but anyone can see that for themselves, can't they?'</p>

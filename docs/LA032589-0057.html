			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONGHORN BORER BEETLE FOUND IN THE BAY AREA  </P> <P> The dreaded longhorn borer beetle that has ravaged eucalyptus trees throughout  Southern California has been found in the Bay Area, the first discovery north  of Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Originally from Australia, the inch-long pest has no natural enemies here and  has killed thousands of eucalyptus trees since it was first detected in this  country five years ago.  </P> <P> Forestry officials had hoped to contain its spread by cutting down infested  trees and regulating the transportation of eucalyptus firewood. But since last  month, officials have captured some of the insect's larva in three trees in  Alameda County.  </P> <P> Entomologists are uncertain how well the black-colored insect, which has long  antennas and zigzag markings on its tough outer shell, will adapt to the cooler  Bay Area climate. Some experts say it could kill thousands of trees in what was  once the world's last concentration of eucalyptus groves free of borer  infestation.  </P> <P> "It has a potential of killing a third of all trees" in the Bay Area, said Jim  Laughlin, a state forester in San Bernardino County, where the beetle killed  hundred of trees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wait-and-See Attitude  </P> <P> Bay Area officials say they are taking a wait-and-see attitude about the  significance of the new pest.  </P> <P> "The environment up here is more favorable to the eucalyptus than in Southern  California. So the extent of damage shouldn't be as severe. The truth remains  to be seen," said John Nicoles, a land management specialist for the East Bay  Regional Park District, where eucalyptus groves cover more than 1,500 acres of  parkland.  </P> <P> The true impact of the pest will be felt by homeowners who will have to pay up  to $10,000 for removing eucalyptus trees killed by the beetle from their yards,  Nicoles said.  </P> <P> Forestry officials fear trees killed by the beetle will become fire and safety  hazards.  </P> <P> "Very, very hot fires develop from eucalyptus" and are harder to extinguish,  said David Neff, a state forestry official.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Imported From Australia  </P> <P> Eucalyptus trees were imported from Australia at the turn of the century. The  trees grew well in California's semi-arid climate. The trees are not grown  commercially.  </P> <P> The borer typically attacks trees that are older, unhealthy or under  environmental stress, such as drought and frost damage, said Tim Paine, an  entomology professor at UC Riverside. Healthy trees can thwart the beetle by  drowning its larva with sap.  </P> <P> The beetle attacks the trees by laying its eggs beneath their bark. The hatched  larva bore deeply into the tree, drilling deep holes that eventually kill the  tree.  </P> <P> Paine said the beetle was probably shipped from Chile to California in wooden  crates infested with beetle larva. Though the borer beetle can fly, he said it  most likely made its way to the Bay Area by hitching a ride in a stack of  firewood.  </P> <P> Pesticides are ineffective against the pest, because the larva are so deeply  embedded in the tree, Paine said.  </P> <P> Researchers at UC Riverside are experimenting with introducing some of the  beetle's predators from Australia to keep the beetle population in check.  Researchers have unleashed the Australian beetle-killing wasp, which preys  specifically on the longhorn borer's larva. But so far, the wasp has adapted  poorly to its new environment. "It's simply one of those things you have got to  shrug your shoulders about. We're going to have to live with it," Nicoles said.  </P></p>

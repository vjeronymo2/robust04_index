			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Thomas Linke: "Bad Service to Customers"] </F>   [Text] A new era should have started in the sphere of  aviation this Monday. According to plans, on 10 January a wall  across the Atlantic should have fallen finally and German  Lufthansa (LH) should now be serving the Transatlantic routes  along with its American partner, United Airlines. The LH  passenger arriving at New York should no longer be forced to  wait for hours for his domestic connection in America, but be  ready to change to United Airlines aircraft that are ready to  depart. Similarly, LH flights to New York, for example, and  then to Seattle with United, should be operated under the same  flight number. Through this so-called code-sharing, LH flights  would have been regarded as direct connections and thus be  catapulted by the software to the top of the display in computer  reservation systems.  <H5>  The Spurned Bride Is Slowing Things Down </H5>   However, for the time being all that remains a vision, even  though a breakthrough seemed so close last fall. Federal  Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann and his U.S. counterpart,  Frederico Pena, agreed on a new aviation treaty, while shortly  afterwards Lufthansa and United agreed on cooperation.  Nevertheless, the treaty has not been signed formally yet.    The English version was accepted by Bonn in late October in  time and sent back to Washington with comments; yet, there it is  mainly United's competitors that are slowing things down. There  is the spurned bride, American Airlines, which Lufthansa would  have liked to have as its European partner. Then there is  Delta, which, as an heir and purchaser of Pan Am's former  European connections sees its current competitive edge dwindling.    Although a spokesman for the U.S. Transport Department has  now emphasized that one has acted according to the agreement and  is currently treating it as if it has gone into effect.  However, so long as there are still complaints from U.S.  carriers about the agreement and the cooperation between  Lufthansa and United, which has not been licensed yet,  code-sharing has to be ruled out.    In such a situation both sides do not hesitate to come up  with mutual recrimination. There is the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD] opposition in Bonn, which suggests that the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] transport minister concluded an  agreement that was not legally watertight. Still, sources in  Bonn are blaming Lufthansa and United for the dilemma. As a  result of its unclear ownership situation -- the work force  wants to take over 53 percent of the stock capital -- United is  unable currently to stand up to the other American mega-carriers  as far as lobbying is concerned.    Moreover, Lufthansa was clearly slightly overeager and too  optimistic when it announced the agreement would be implemented  on 10 January. On the other hand, it was the Bonn government  itself that created the impression in the fall that everything  had been settled with the Americans. Only now does one begin to  realize that, for example, the code-sharing rights are unclear  as far as East Europe is concerned. And who would blame  Lufthansa -- in the euphoria of the moment -- for releasing to  its clients a concrete date for the coveted improvements on the  trans-Atlantic route?  <H5>  What Is the Position of Secretary Pena? </H5>   Such ups and downs actually miss the essence of the problem,  which seems to lie with the U.S. Administration. There,  Secretary Pena obviously is far from having the same position  his German counterpart has meanwhile acquired in Bonn. After  all, the negotiations certainly were not made any easier by the  fact that they involved not only the Transport Department but  also the State Department.    Bonn currently is pinning its hopes on the fact that the  Americans have to stick to the aviation agreement because they  have enough problems of a similar nature with Japan, Holland,  France, and England. Further talks between the two  administrations obviously have been scheduled for the end of the  month. Should the drumming on the American side only serve the  purpose of getting as much out of it as possible, it would be a  bad service to Lufthansa and United -- and, in particular, to  their customers.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Arts: Badly in need of good parenting - Cinema A PERFECT WORLD (15) Clint Eastwood CENTURY (15) Stephen Poliakoff ANOTHER STAKEOUT (PG) John Badham A Perfect World, starring Clint Eastwood and Kevin Costner, is set in Texas in 1963. Your starter for ten and no conferring - what famous event also took place in Texas in 1963? And are Eastwood and Costner doomed to spend the rest of their lives re-living it or referring to it? Eastwood, you recall, was a guilt-haunted ex-security man at Kennedy's motorcade in In The Line Of Fire. And Costner, just before fooling us a little by playing a guilt-haunted ex-security man for Reagan in The Bodyguard, played Dallas assassination investigator Jim Garrison in JFK. Hollywood likes to type-locate as well as type-cast its leading men - this saves the audience brain fatigue - so the command went out to the two stars of A Perfect World. 'Stay in the Lone Star state. Keep your clocks at 1963] But this time, guys, the action takes place two weeks before JFK's visit, which is just a distant symbolic stormcloud. At least, that's what the screenwriter John Lee Hancock is telling me right now in my earpiece.' And the story? Kevin is an escaped convict driving across Texas with a fatherless seven-year-old as hostage (TJ Lowther) and he kinda, well, becomes the boy's surrogate Pop. And Clint is the grizzled, seen-it-all-before lawman - same part as usual - who pursues Kev in a loaned-out gubernatorial campaign bus. A what? Well, you see, Governor John Connolly, the Dallas survivor who died this year, is semi-fictionalised here as an electioneering fusspot interested only in getting his battle-bus back unscratched. (De mortuis nil nisi fatuum). But an hour into the film, guess what? The bus is smashed up in the chase] What a surprise. This is written into the script so that lawman and outlaw can shake off their respective techno-military support systems plus telegraphically hopeless cronies - lady criminologist Laura Dern for Eastwood, psychotic sidekick Keith Szarabajka for Costner - before moving in for the final mano a mano showdown. Eastwood himself directed this film, which from the maker of Unforgiven must be accounted unforgivable. He begins promisingly with an eerie-lyrical slow-motion image: Costner lying half-asleep (or dying?) on a patch of breeze-blown grassland, empty but for a white Halloween mask and a drift of dollar bills. This is a 'How are we going to get to this point in the story?' device, but it works. At least for its behind-the-credits minute or two. It lends an air of mystery that the movie then spends 2 1/4 hours unravelling. As cars crunch, guns rattle and corpses queue up for disposal, we learn that Costner is a violent former armed robber driven to crime by bad parenting. (Clint 'Make my day' Eastwood is now making bleeding-heart liberal movies?). And the boy he kidnaps has been brought up as a Jehovah's Witness by a spoilsport single mother, so naturally he cleaves to fun-loving, gun-loving Costner as the Pop he never had. Nor is on-the-hoof psychotherapy confined to the psychopathic classes. Ten miles back down the road is Clint and his busful of career folk, working out or playing out their personality problems. Laura Dern, fresh from palaeo-botany duty in Jurassic Park where her scholarship and feminist chutzah were programmed to disintegrate into little-lady screams, does the same number here. Expert criminologist; but too heavy on the book-learned polysyllables; throws up at first sight of a dead body. As for Clint, he must get over his own bad memories of - yes - negative parenting. So the lessons in life grind on, milling wit, character and drama into readimix messages for morons. The only folks in touch with raw reality in this film are the behind-camera craft-masters, Henry Bumstead (production design) and Jack N. Green (cinematography). Bumstead's no-frills authority - as well as being an Eastwood veteran he designed Hitchcock's Vertigo - turns every set, from grungy diners to giant dilapidated hardware stores, into a kind of Essence of Texas. And Green's camera eye breathes life and movement into a story that, left to itself, would freeze into the postures of moral pedagoguery prescribed by the script. But pedagoguery is the flavour of the season: see Stephen Poliakoff's Century (opening in Britain next week). Nothing makes a more specious milestone than the birth of a new century. Do the human heart and mind change because two digits in the year's number-counter click over to zero? But you cannot stop an artist when he gets a fit of the epochal-apocalyptic. The time is 1900. The Hamlet-like hero is an aspiring doctor (Clive Owen) who puts an emotional rapier into his East European, Scottish-naturalised father (Robert Stephens) before migrating to London to test his metal on father substitute Charles Dance, a leading surgeon-teacher. Looking on from the wings is laboratory assistant Miranda Richardson, part Gertrude part Ophelia, offering sex, work companionship and surrogate motherhood as Owen sets out to blaze his medico-scientific path into a New Age. We know it is a New Age because the film strafes us with visuals to that effect. There is the illuminated 'Welcome To The New Century' sign that eccentric old Stephens erects on a hill, only for the council to order its removal. (No change there in 93 years of British local politics.) And there are the gleaming shafts of enhanced sunlight pouring in through the teaching hospital's windows, making Wagnerian heroes of everyone in sight. Two rival medical subplots fight for centre screen. One concerns Dance's jealous suppression of Owen's breakthrough research work on the human gland; the other, early birth control schemes in the age of Malthus. As we try to discern a connection between the two (there is none), Poliakoff piles on the period colour (frockcoats, beards, cloppity-cloppity street traffic), dances around the fetchingly fish-eyed Dance and brings Robert Stephens back for an encore whenever possible. Stephens is a joy: a whiff of green-belt organic life on a excursion ticket to the movie's inner-city schematism. Watch his ludic, rubicund face; listen to the fluent fun he has with a Scottish-Jewish-Romanian accent (sic). Elsewhere, Century is a large, confused, gas-filled undertaking from a playwright-filmmaker whose last, best movie (Close My Eyes) was a small tale of doomed love which proved that largest thoughts and feelings often come from simplest story ideas. Are you ready for the week's third film about surrogate fathers? In Another Stakeout, the title operation requires undercover cop Emilio Estevez to masquerade as colleague Richard Dreyfuss's son. They and Assistant District Attorney Rosie O'Neill, pretending to be Dreyfuss's wife, play house in a borrowed mansion overlooking the sea-washed hideaway of a fugitive state's witness (Cathy Moriarty). We are on an island off Seattle. Correction: we are in Never-never-land, Disney Studios, Hollywood, where director John Badham and writer Jim Kouf try to magic forth a sequel to their hit cop caper of yesteryear. But where Stakeout had novelty, Another Stakeout has 'novelties'. A funny dog, a funny woman law official (the tuba-shaped Miss O'Neill), a travel-brochure setting. Only in a truly ingenious - and funny - dinner scene, where the masquerade starts fraying right there in front of the neighbours, does wit usurp weariness. After that it is back to pounding the predictable plot. The cops stake out the nextdoor quarries; the dog stakes out the nextdoor cat; Dreyfuss stakes out the flaky Estevez; the audience, picking up the habit, stakes out the exit sign.</p>

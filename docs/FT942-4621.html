			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Berlusconi unveils job creation measures Italy's right-wing Berlusconi government last night announced its first big policy initiative, introducing legislation to boost employment through tax incentives and by reducing rigidities in the labour market. At the same time, share ownership was encouraged by the introduction of a withholding tax of 12.5 per cent, which will replace a more complex assessment structure. Companies were also encouraged to list on the stock market by giving a tax break on the cost of listing. The employment measures are in line with the guidelines released this week by the OECD and mark a radical break with longstanding job protection practices. But they are also intended to underline that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government is 'business friendly'. They centre on a mix of tax breaks, simplifying the tax structure and financial incentives to create jobs. Next week, the government is expected to announce an easing of restrictions on youth and temporary employment. Mr Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister and the tax expert behind the bulk of the measures, insisted that they would come at no extra cost to the Treasury. Trade unions have been consulted about the measures but have raised serious objections over lowering the minimum wage for youth employment and the Berlusconi government's clear desire to introduce part-time jobs. But the government has argued that longstanding rigidities in the labour market are a principal cause of Italy's 30 per cent youth unemployment. Officials have also told the unions that Italy lags well behind the rest of Europe in the use of part-time workers, with only 5.5 per cent of the workforce involved against 12 per cent in France and 15 per cent in Germany. During his election campaign, Mr Berlusconi promised, if elected prime minister, to create 1m jobs. He has since played down this commitment but says that some 300,000 new jobs can be found this year. The measures were the main item on the agenda at a cabinet meeting which began yesterday evening. One of the principal innovations was a tax rebate of up to 25 per cent of salary for any business that hired for 'an indeterminate period' someone who was either unemployed, a first-time job-seeker or handicapped. Tax incentives were also made available for people starting up companies or increasing their investment. First- time entrepreneurs up to 30 years old or those currently unemployed will have a tax holiday for their first six months in business. Taxes will also encourage profits to be reinvested. The measures to boost share ownership mark an important departure. Until now, shares have had to be declared on income tax forms and have been assessed as part of a person's overall income and taxed accordingly. Now, shareholders will pay a single 12.5 per cent tax - the same as that on government bonds - deducted anonymously at source.</p>

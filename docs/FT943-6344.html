			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Arts: MTV lends an ear to the baby boomers 'Hope I die before I get old' ran the too-often quoted line, 'gotta leave a good-looking corpse' urged another; but nobody actually meant it. Rock music has not only come of age, it is staring at its sagging jowls in the mirror every morning and preparing to apply for its free bus pass. And yet, the myths of teenage fervour and adolescent yearning die hard. 'Rock music is part of the passion of being young,' explains Bill Roedy, president of MTV Networks Europe, and he should know; the 24-hour music channel reaches 60 million households in 33 countries, a joyous trans-global celebration of mindless riffing and instantly forgettable pap. But where does that leave the armies of baby-boomers for whom it all meant something more? Faced with the choice of Rolling Stones decrepitude and the infantile whingeing of freshly-forged heart throbs, where does one turn? Do all roads have to lead to Phil Collins? Roedy is sympathetic, and has an eye for a gap in the market. Next month, MTV Europe is launching VH-1 in Britain, a new channel designed to cater for the 25-49 year-olds who form the bulk of today's rock audience. Its slogan - 'Music That Means Something'  - plays unashamedly on the nostalgia felt by the generation who once thought that Country Joe and the Fish were responsible for the US defeat in Vietnam, although at least 50 per cent of the channel's output will be new music. VH-1's director of programmes, Brent Hansen, promises there will be no room for rap, hip-hop, techno or heavy metal. 'We are aiming for people who may occasionally watch MTV, but almost feel like visitors. They need their own heartland, their own emotional base. They don't want to be patronised, and they want to keep in touch with what is happening. We are also talking about the generation which grew up with punk - they have owned the music world.' The success of oldie music magazines such as 'Q' and, more recently, 'Mojo', as well as 18 fruitful months of market research have been encouraging signs for the new channel. Hansen says the research identified a musically literate audience anxious for hard information and pointers to new trends. 'They have gone into all the megastores, they have finished buying their greatest hits compilations and now want to find out more.' Programming will be much less frenetic than that of MTV, with experienced presenters (which include Nicky Horne, Paul King, David Hepworth and Tony Vance) providing background and context to the records they will be playing. 'If we feature a country-rock band, we might look at The Byrds and Gram Parsons, without being too train-spotterish about it,' says Hansen. The channel is currently negotiating to acquire rights to the 'Old Grey Whistle Test' archive, and live footage from the pre-video era will also be used. One unwanted side-effect of the new channel may be to pull young viewers away from MTV. 'That is not our intention, although we are aware that, with young males, there is a heritage angle to this,' says Hansen. Paul Du Noyer, editor of 'Mojo' (slogan: 'The Magazine for People who know Rock'n'Roll') says his readership includes many in the 18-25 age group who are keen to discover for themselves some of the less familiar names of the past, such as Nick Drake or Tim Buckley. 'They believe that the great music of the past has an enduring validity. Consequently, the audience for rock music is ever-broadening.' A happy meeting-point, then, for advertisers, record companies, disposable income and consumers seeking to spice up their entry into middle age. Rock music has achieved the extraordinary and enviable position of constantly re-defining its own standards and borders. On an early pilot of VH-1 shown to groups of potential viewers, a presenter refers to a 'classic' Rolling Stones track from 1981. The truth is that, by 1981, most of the group's fans considered them already to be about 10 years past their 'classic' years. So what does that make them in 1994? Old, old, old.</p>

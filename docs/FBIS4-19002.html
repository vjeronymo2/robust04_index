			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Monday [10 April] representatives  of German human rights groups presented the Foreign Ministry in  Bonn with material which, as they claim, proves the use of  German arms by the Turkish Army in Kurdistan. The pictures and  eyewitness reports document, among other things, the use of  BRT-60 tanks from stocks of the former GDR People's Army (NVA).  Spokesmen for the groups told journalists that this is proved,  among other things, by the special equipment on the tanks and  the NVA signs that are only superficially painted over.    The government in Ankara had stated that people had mistaken  them for BRT-80 tanks, which Turkey bought in Russia. This  argument had also been picked up by Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel, who, however, has meanwhile temporarily suspended the  supply of further German arms. The German observers said that  if Ankara's statement was right, then the 10 Russian "alibi"  tanks would have to be able to show up in many places at the  same time. The Foreign Ministry has not yet commented on the  presented material.    Martin Glasenapp, of the medico international relief  organization, said that some 300 members of delegations from  Germany and other countries "repeatedly" observed "the use of  German arms against the Kurdish civilian population" during the  Kurdish new year's celebrations Newroz on 21 March and the  following days. Apart from BRT-60 tanks, observers saw and  photographed also Leopard tanks, MAN personnel carriers, MTW M  113-type armored vehicles, and special task forces with G3 guns  made by the Heckler and Koch company. Moreover, there were  "innumerous" reports by eyewitnesses on the bloodbaths caused  with these arms.    Angelika Beer, a member of the Alliance 90/Greens Executive  Committee, said that she was an eyewitness to Turkish air  strikes on 26 March against the villages of Besuke and Gaver, in  which 34 people were killed. While Ankara spoke of one bomb  that was accidentally discharged, in reality a total of eight  bombs were dropped on Gaver alone from helicopters and one  aircraft.</p>

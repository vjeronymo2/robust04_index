			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrovna, </F> Vyacheslav Tomilin]    [Text] Shanghai, 28 May -- "The economic zone in Shanghai  is a real miracle, and the Chinese experiment should be put to  use in Russia as quickly as possible," Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin said today after acquainting himself with a  new district of China's largest city. A visit to the Pudong  economic development zone was the main item on the agenda for  the third day of the Russian prime minister's official visit to  China.    After looking at Pudong, Viktor Chernomyrdin told  journalists  of the need to start real work right away on free economic zones  in Russia, perhaps without even waiting for a law on them to be  passed. "We need to start immediately in individual parts, in  the regions," he said. The head of government also stated his  intention to "immediately fly to Nakhodka" where there are plans  to set up a free economic zone and, if possible, to prepare the  appropriate presidential decree. "This should be the locomotive  that will move everything else," Viktor Chernomyrdin concluded.       During his visit to Pudong, the deputy head of  administration  of the district, Huang Qifan, told the Russian prime minister  how the new territory had been exploited. Huge resources had  been invested in Pudong during the four years of its existence.  At present, there are about 2,000 enterprises with foreign  involvement registered here, and the total investment through  concluded contracts amounts to $8.5 billion.    According to Huang Qifan, foreign investment is being  directed not only into the development of industry, but also  into trade and economic and financial spheres. Large resources  -- more than 20 billion yuans -- have been used to set up the  infrastructure. The deputy head of the district administration  gave two reasons for the success: the state's preferential tax  policy and the major investment of Chinese national capital, $10  billion over less than five years.    The Russian prime minister showed special interest in the  conditions of preferential taxation.    The district leaders presented Viktor Chernomyrdin with a  package of documents concerning the functioning of Pudong and  also a symbolic souvenir -- a stone from the Nanpu suspension  bridge, which was crossed by the Russian delegation's motorcade.       Viktor Chernomyrdin also visited a joint Chinese-Japanese  enterprise producing air conditioning systems and the Waigaoqiao  free trade zone.    Then, the head of the Russian government laid flowers at the  monument to Aleksandr Pushkin.    Viktor Chernomyrdin's program in Shanghai ended with a  meeting with the city's leaders.    Tomorrow. the prime minister leaves Shanghai for Dalian.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The war of words in Lusaka has revealed the identity  of those involved in the negotiations. So far, one thought the  government and the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] were the negotiators. It now seems that the  United States is against the government.    The mediator is shuttling between the sides, but to no  avail.  The Portuguese observer does not shuttle, preferring to  indignantly witness the fight between the giants. The Russians  brought in a breath of fresh air by proposing that the  negotiations be restricted. The Americans, however, turned down  the idea. Since then, nobody has questioned the time being  taken.    While UNITA (?takes) its time to form an opinion about the  outcome of the negotiations, the U.S. delegation to the talks  this morning met with the government team headed by Carlos  Feijo, secretary of the Ministers Council. This is the third  time a meeting of this nature has taken place since the start of  the talks on 5 January 1994. Some observers believe such  meetings have been like a tug of war, but others say this  morning's meeting was an indication of flexibility on the part  of the government delegation.    No further details are available, except that Blondin Beye  is  scheduled to embark on a tour in search of international  political backing and that his news blackout continues. In  addition to seriously jeopardizing the role of the reporters,  the blackout has led to differences of opinion between the  negotiators. Opponents of Beye's news blackout say it is  senseless to keep the ongoing of round of talks under wraps, so  much so that Angola no longer features in the list of the  world's main hotbeds of tension. In fact, the world public is  today better informed about recent African disputes, such as in  South Africa and Burundi, though those have not yet reached  one-third the catastrophic proportions that Angola has been  experiencing for over 20 years now. But that is Lusaka--where a  news blackout is in force, although nobody knows why.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: US heads Europe M&amp;A league US investment banks dominate a new league table of advisers on mergers and acquisitions into Europe announced so far this year. CS First Boston leads the list, having been involved in Dollars 11.6bn worth of deals, double the activity of its nearest competitor. Altogether, six of the top 10 advisers are of US origin compared with three last year. The highest placed UK-based house is SG Warburg, in eighth place. While some executives at US investment banks were quick to attribute their success to superior skills and resources, others saw it as a sign of the recent surge of US investment into Europe. 'It's a reflection of high transatlantic activity,' said Mr Klaus Diederichs, co-head of European M&amp;A for J. P. Morgan, which came second in the table. Warburg said it too had enjoyed a series of transatlantic deals, but in the other direction. Securities Data, which compiled the table, showed the it as a leading adviser to European acquirers. Competitors were surprised by CS First Boston's strength, and the firm conceded that in any single period there was an element of luck and that the extent of its lead was artificial. The house has nevertheless, among other roles, advised Boots of the UK on the sale announced last week of its pharmaceutical business to BASF of Germany, and Swiss Re on the disposal of its non-insurance businesses. CSFB has had a reputation as a bond house and it suffered a traumatic reorganisation after the departure of its long-time London head, Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff. It credited its improved position to a doubling of resources in corporate finance between 1989 and 1991, and the European flavour given by its link with Credit Suisse of Switzerland.  ------------------------------------- TOP 10 ADVISERS ON MERGERS INTO EUROPE  ------------------------------------- Adviser              Value (Dollars m)  ------------------------------------- CS First Boston/  Credit Suisse                11,570.4 JP Morgan                    5,241.1 Lazard Houses                  4,641.4 Morgan Stanley                 4,015.2 Goldman Sachs                  2,689.9 Salomon Bros                   2,346.1 Lehman Bros                    1,987.7 SG Warburg                   1,921.4 Kleinwort Benson               1,882.6 Wertheim/Schroder              1,375.1  ------------------------------------- Source: Securities Data  -------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zamboanga City -- An official of the Moro National  Liberation Front said MNLF rebels, not the "Lost Command," were  responsible for the killing of 21 Marines and four militiamen in  an ambush in Tuburan, Basilan, on 9 February last year.    The announcement was made Friday [11 February] afternoon to  the daily, THE MORNING TIMES, by a relative of MNLF Commander  Abdulnasir Samputu Kahalum. The chief of the Marine Forces in  southern Philippines, Brigadier General Guillermo Ruiz,  belittled Kahalum's claim that he led the ambush. He said that,  as far as the military is concerned, all the attackers were  "plain criminals, not MNLF rebels."    "We have never had a lost command in our area; all our men  are MNLF regulars," the man said.    He said the MNLF attackers in Tuburan still have the  firearms, uniforms, boots and other belongings they took from  the slain Marines and militiamen.    "If General Ruiz says Commander Kahalum did not lead the  ambush, how come Kahalum has the Marines' things?" the informant  said.    Ruiz earlier belittled the claim of Kahalum that his group  was responsible for the massacre of the 21 Marine soldiers and  four militiamen at Sitio [village district] Badunggan, Barangay  [village] Candiis, Tuburan.    Ruiz, who now heads the government panel in the joint cease  fire committee with the MNLF, said he did not want to drag the  name of the MNLF into the incident.    "In so far as we in the armed forces are concerned, the  attackers are all criminal elements, whatever group they belong  to, whatever creed they profess to, whatever sect or religion,  they are criminal elements and we have to run after them," he  said.    The general's reaction came after Kahalum, in an interview  with radio station DXLL, confessed that he led Moro fighters in  last year's massacre.    Kahalum said they ambushed the Marines in "self-defense."    He said the Marines were guided by six volunteers of the  Civilian Home Defense Force and were poised to attack their camp  at Badunggan.    "We had no choice but to defend our camp and prove to the  Marines that we could resist them," Kahalum told broadcaster  Jose Mari Bue.    Kahalum made the confession in order to clear the names of  Tuburan Vice Mayor Rajid Sahabat and Tuburan Councilor Alih  Sulaiman, who have been implicated in the ambush.    He said his purpose was also to let the truth come out.    Sahabat has been hiding since the court issued a warrant for  his arrest, saying he could not pay the P450,000 [Philippine  pesos] bail.    The 31-year-old Sahabat, who has sought refuge with the MNLF  regulars, said he will turn himself in to the authorities as  soon as he has money for bail.    Sahabat said he wanted to surrender even if he had to go to  jail but was afraid of what the Marines might do to him.    "I want to go back to my work as vice mayor and to prove in  court that I'm innocent," he said.    Councilor Sulaiman said their being implicated in the ambush  was politically motivated.</p>

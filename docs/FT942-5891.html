			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Dutch PM warns Bonn and Paris on top EU job: Call for open choice on successor to Delors Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister and candidate for the presidency of the European Commission, gave a warning yesterday against the dangers if Germany and France should dictate the choice of a successor to Mr Jacques Delors. In the face of clear signals that Paris and Bonn favour Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, Mr Lubbers appealed to all other EU member states to make up their own minds on who should win the top executive post in Brussels. Mr Lubbers, the longest-serving Dutch prime minister, praised Franco-German co-operation but told the Financial Times he had no plans to drop out of the race, in spite of the apparent Franco-German snub. His determination to carry on may deadlock the European summit in Corfu on June 24-25, when the EU heads of government are to choose unanimously a successor to Mr Delors. But it might also open the way for a compromise candidate to emerge, such as Britain's Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, or Ireland's Mr Peter Sutherland, the outgoing head of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In the interview, Mr Lubbers paid tribute to the Franco-German axis for giving direction to the European Union. But he also said that the political balance of the EU depended on all member states feeling that their views were being taken seriously. Earlier this week, Mr Francois Mitterrand and Mr Helmut Kohl agreed at a Franco-German summit on a joint candidate for the presidency of the Commission. The two leaders did not disclose their preference, but senior officials in both camps said they backed Mr Dehaene, who has yet to declare publicly. 'Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand also have a responsibility themselves in the balancing act,' Mr Lubbers said. He said his candidacy had moved beyond the issue of personalities. It also touched upon the place of the Netherlands in the Union and its status as a founder member. Warning that Dutch enthusiasm for Europe was waning, Mr Lubbers noted that there had been an outcry in the Dutch press this week about reports of French and German opposition to his candidacy. Mr Lubbers said Mr Dehaene had 'excellent qualities', but emphasised that Mr Delors' successor should be chosen by consensus among the 12 EU member states. 'The choice that has to be made now is not only a choice by Bonn and Paris,' he said. The Dutch prime minister, tipped for years as the next Commission president, waited until after last month's general election campaign in the Netherlands to launch his bid for the job.

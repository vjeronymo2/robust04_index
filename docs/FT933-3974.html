			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: BT in plan to buy into Megared BRITISH Telecommunications is poised to break into the internal Spanish data transmission market, loosening the grip on the sector held by Telefonica, the Spanish government controlled group, through a surprise agreement with Banco Santander, the big domestic financial institution. The British telecoms group, which opened a representative office in Spain four years ago, is negotiating the acquisition of up to 50 per cent of Megared, a potentially powerful data transmission company created by Santander in 1989 to serve the banking group's extensive network. Megared has been under-utilised and is seeking to build up its business through attracting outside clients. An agreement on the acquisition is expected as early as next week and it will include the allocation of licences to operate privately-owned data transmission companies within Spain which have been promised by the government in October. The negotiations were fuelled by the government decision last June to deregulate data transmission services to meet the EC directives on the liberalisation of telecommunications. Santander's Megared and BT had independently applied for licences and the decision to unite in a joint venture was viewed by analysts as a highly convenient marriage of interests. In a second deregulation phase, timed for January, the government is set to award licences to operate cellular telephones. Under the liberalisation plans, up to 15 per cent of Telefonica's revenues are expected to face competition. Although voice transmission will remain in Telefonica's domain for the foreseeable future, the deregulation will affect the high growth and high margin areas of the telecommunications sector.</p>

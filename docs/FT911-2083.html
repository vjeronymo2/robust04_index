			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rise on Fed move is trimmed back sharply Wall Street AN UNEXPECTED interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve gave a boost to share prices yesterday, but concern about the slow progress of US economic recovery sharply restricted the extent of the market's gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up a net 10.89 at 2,887.87, having been more than 30 points ahead early in the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, rising at first and falling back at midsession before firming again to end up 1.69 on balance at 375.35. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks declined from the outset, however, and finished down 3.02 at 484.72. New York SE volume expanded from Monday's low 150m shares to reach 205m, while gains led declines by 844 to 751. The initial response to the reduction in the discount rate - the interest rate the Fed charges for loans to member banks - was positive, with the Dow climbing sharply in the first few minutes of trading. Investors hoped that lower rates would spur economic activity and boost stock market sentiment. Most of the gain was clawed back later in the day as dealers and investors pondered the Fed's motives for cutting rates. The Fed said it had eased monetary policy because of continuing weakness in the economy. This evident concern about the slow pace of progress, and yesterday's poor March factory orders data, unnerved the market, which had been looking forward to a recovery in the economy by midsummer. The extent to which the recession has affected US industry was underlined by yesterday's figures from two of the nation's big car manufacturers. General Motors reported a first-quarter loss of Dollars 1.1bn, against a profit of Dollars 710m a year earlier, and Ford unveiled a deficit of Dollars 884m, against a profit of Dollars 506m in the first quarter of 1990. The market had been forewarned that the carmakers were facing difficulties, and both stocks rose in heavy trading. General Motors climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 35 5/8 and Ford put on Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 . Bank shares gained ground in early trading on expectations that profits would climb as banks took advantage of the widening spread between lending charges and borrowing costs. However, as the wider market fell back so did many bank stocks, leaving BankAmerica down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 38 3/8 , Manufacturers Hanover Dollars  3/8 weaker at Dollars 25 3/8 and Chemical Bank Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 20 1/2 . Among those that held on to their gains were Citicorp, up Dollars  1/8 at 15 3/4 , and Bankers Trust, Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 47 1/4 . Over-the-counter stocks fell sharply from the start as investors continued to take profits after the market's first-quarter rally of almost 30 per cent. Leading the way were Apple, Dollars 3 1/4 lower at Dollars 55, Amgen, Dollars 5 weaker at Dollars 126 3/4 , Intel, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 49 1/4 , and Sun Microsystems, Dollars  1/4 off at Dollars 36 3/4 . News of an explosion at one of Marine Power Central's Yankee Nuclear power plants in the northeastern state of Maine left its shares Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 17 1/8 . Canada AFTER A slightly higher opening, Toronto lost ground and then recovered to close little changed after moderate trade. The composite index ended 3.4 off at 3,468.8 as declines edged out advances by 323 to 235. Volume came to 21.4m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices showed modest declines. Gold issues, buoyed by a rise of nearly USDollars 4 an ounce in the New York price for bullion, advanced 2.16 per cent. Domtar, unchanged at CDollars 9 1/8 , reported sharply increased first-quarter losses from continuing operations. Westcoast Energy, off CDollars  1/8 at CDollars 20 3/4 , announced higher first-quarter earnings. Imasco held steady at CDollars 27 following lower first-quarter profits.</p>

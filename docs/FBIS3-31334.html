			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Eight thousand citizens and about 10,000 refugees  on the free territory of the Zepce commune are warning and  addressing the highest state bodies, UNPROFOR, UNHCR, and the  International Committee of the Red Cross about the abandonment  and incorrect treatment of Bosniaks, the Muslims of the region.  On the one hand, the Zepce community is being constantly  ignored when speaking about places with the worst humanitarian  situation and at the same time, the citizens of that besieged  town have been left to the mercy of the extreme wing of the  Croatian Defense Council.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: IMI sells computer offshoot IMI has sold Redwood International, its lossmaking computing software subsidiary, to CP Software Group, a California-based software management and marketing specialist. IMI will receive Pounds 5m, satisfied by the issue of a secured promissory note with a maximum maturity of five years. It will also receive convertible preferred stock and 19.9 per cent of the common stock of a new US company formed by CP to hold its interest in Redwood. IMI is making available up to Pounds 6m of interest bearing loans to support the repositioning and restructuring of Redwood which CP has planned. Redwood incurred operating losses of Pounds 4m in 1993, entirely in the second half, and the loss for the first half of 1994 is expected to rise to about Pounds 8m. The directors said the computer software market was becoming more competitive and the uptake of Redwood's new product range was slower than expected. IMI's second half results will reflect an exceptional charge of about Pounds 16m, which will include a write-down in net assets and the loans referred to.</p>

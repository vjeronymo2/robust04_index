			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Wine: Appetisers THOSE looking for a bottle of champagne for their Valentine may be more flummoxed than usual this year in a climate thick with aspersions cast at the quality and maturity of what we were brought up to think was the only socially acceptable mix of wine and carbon dioxide. The specialist Champagne House of London W2 (071-221-5538) now guarantees that all of its non-vintage champagne (apart from its 'party champagne') has been matured for at least three years in the producer's cellar before being disgorged - a distinct improvement on the imprudently short one-year legal minimum. Prices start at a relatively modest Pounds 13.90 a bottle, but since the Champagne House cannot accept orders for fewer than a dozen bottles, even for Valentine's Day, its new scheme will suit only the extremely or indiscriminately amorous. Wilton's in Jermyn Street, London SW1, has always managed to retain a simple, if expensive, elegance, wonderfully maternal waitresses and a clientele that includes bankers, businessmen and politicians. This year the restaurant celebrates its 250th birthday. It began as a shellfishmongery in Cockspur Street, off the Haymarket, close to a weekly cattle market and a twice-weekly hay and straw market. Wilton's Anniversary Book (Pounds 9.50 from the restaurant, the Savoy and Berkeley Hotels) recounts its history including its sale for Pounds 1,200 in 1942 when a bomb landed nearby. As part of the celebrations throughout 1992 Wilton's, with the advice of English food expert Arabella Boxer, will be offering a four-course dinner menu at Pounds 25 per head. 071-629-9955. One factor which seems to distinguish the English from the rest of Europe is that we are much less keen to travel any distance for a good meal. It is a problem that has been exercising Ruth and David Watson since they sold Hintlesham Hall and took over The Fox and Goose at Fressingfield, near Diss, Norfolk, (037986-247) in the centre of Suffolk. The food and wine now available in this country inn is acclaimed - it was voted County restaurant of the Year in the 1992 Good Food Guide. Commercially, however, the write-ups have not compensated for the lack of bedrooms and the consequent dependance on local trade. Now the Watsons have agreed terms with owners of various bed and breakfasts in the area and can offer package deals that include dinner and a night's accommodation nearby from Pounds 40 per person.</p>

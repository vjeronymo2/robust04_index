			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Retailing trio enliven trading in Brussels - Optimistic company announcements have attracted the investors THE Belgian bourse has only recently shaken off the depressing effect of last November's inconclusive general election. After falling to around 1,060 in December, the Bel20 has since recovered, closing at 1,183.63 yesterday. But confusion over the shape of the next government has not stopped the Belgians shopping. Recent weeks have seen increased activity in the Belgian retailing sector, which accounts for about 5 or 6 per cent of the entire market. Shares in the three principal distribution companies  - GIB Group, Delhaize 'Le Lion' and Colruyt - have all shown strong increases over the last month, in spite of some profit-taking in the last week. This is not a new or short-lived phenomenon. Colruyt and Delhaize have improved relative to the rest of the bourse during the last year, while GIB has managed only a marginal outperformance. 'They are always among the most active stocks,' points out one Brussels analyst. By the middle of January, Colruyt, the smallest of the trio, had outperformed the lacklustre Belgian market by 65 per cent on a yearly basis though it has since slipped back to just over 50 per cent. Belgium's quoted retailers are founded on the supermarket business. For example, although GIB also owns fast-food restaurants, department stores and do-it-yourself outlets (including a strong US presence), some 65 per cent of its BFr205bn (Dollars 6.3bn) turnover in 1990 came from supermarkets and hypermarkets. Recent enthusiasm for the retailers seems to have been spurred by a number of optimistic company announcements. Delhaize - largest of the three - said on January 10 that it was expecting to record a 14 per cent increase in consolidated net profit for 1991, on the back of a 16.4 per cent rise in sales to BFr310bn (Dollars 9.5bn). The principal motor for this growth was the company's Food Lion supermarket chain in the US, which pushed up its sales by 15.3 per cent by opening more than 100 new stores last year. A further 125 are expected to open in 1992. In the same week, GIB announced that it was planning to invest BFr6.4bn (Dollars 198m) during 1992 - up 21 per cent on last year - concentrating, among other things, on the installation of electronic payment and scanning systems in its supermarkets. Colruyt, meanwhile, has been plugging away at the low-cost, no-frills end of the Belgian retail market and paying back debt built up during the difficult years of 1985 and 1986. It, too, has recently unveiled a handsome increase in 1991 turnover - up 19 per cent to BFr34.3bn (Dollars 1.061bn). Such virtues have attracted the attention of investors on both sides of the Atlantic. Delhaize's share price in Brussels has risen partly on the back of its trading performance, but also because of increased interest in Food Lion, which is separately quoted in New York. In turning to Europe, say analysts, US investors are shunning the depressed British retail market and looking to fill their shopping trolleys with undervalued continental stocks. Belgian retailing is still a relatively low-margin business, because of high labour costs. Computerisation of store check-outs and the development of own-brand products - both of which lag behind, say, British supermarket groups - should lead to strong improvement in profitability in the coming years. In this way, the most sluggish of the Belgian trio, GIB, is also the most interesting because it is only now pushing through the investments which other retailers have carried out. '(Buyers of GIB stock) are betting on an adjustment or improvement in the competition in the business,' says Mr Thierry Masset, a retail analyst with Generale de Banque in Brussels. Optimists say that this, in effect, is a one-way bet. Belgian planning law makes it difficult for new groups to win permission to build large supermarkets. 'The only way of getting into the market is to acquire another company,' says one London-based retail analyst. If GIB falls behind with its investment programme or does not develop quickly enough, he adds, then there could well be plenty of frustrated buyers waiting to bid for the entire group.</p>

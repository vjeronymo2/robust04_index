			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Which Banker Lacks a Billion?"] </F>   [Text] The Fourth Congress of the Association of Russian  Banks concluded its work in Moscow yesterday. Perhaps none of  the spheres of the market infrastructure is developing as  swiftly as the credit-monetary sphere. There is a total of  2,041 banks in Russia today, with over 4,000 branches. And  sizeable funds are in circulation in them -- the total assets of  commercial banks exceed 110 trillion rubles [R].    However, both the association's President Sergey Yegorov and  the bankers from the localities who addressed the congress spoke  less about the prosperity of financial affairs, and more,  strangely enough, about the threat to them posed by the state.  Such as, for example, the recent directive on increasing income  tax fivefold in comparison with the first quarter of last year.  Thus, we are not far from utter ruin.    Businessmen are also skeptical about the authorities'  decision to increase the minimum amount of the authorized  capital for new banks to R2 billion. Such money is not  available, particularly in the provinces, which is precisely  where there is an acute need for the creation of new structures.    Speaking at the congress, First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets  announced a project which envisages a significant increase in  banks' contributions to investment purposes. And Central Bank  Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko promised to reduce the discount  rate in the near future, although admittedly on certain  conditions.</p>

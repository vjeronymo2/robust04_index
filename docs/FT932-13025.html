			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Brazil launches plan to stimulate growth BRAZIL is making yet another attempt to stabilise its battered economy with an emergency plan of spending cuts and acceleration of its privatisation programme. It aims - more controversially - to stimulate 3.5 per cent growth this year through a return to subsidies and lowering interest rates. This long-awaited first plan of the six-month-old government of President Itamar Franco was announced at a cabinet meeting on Saturday, broadcast live on television. The plan, Brazil's sixth in seven years, is the first to involve no shock measures such as freezing prices or bank accounts. The plan concentrates more on spending than saving, and is unclear on how to reduce inflation, now 30 per cent a month. Mr Franco's address did not mention inflation as a priority, though finance ministry officials say they hope to reduce inflation to 17 per cent a month by December. The plan will be presented to the International Monetary Fund this week by Mr Eliseu Resende, Brazil's third finance minister in the last six months. Analysts doubt that it will be sufficient to achieve a new IMF accord in the near future.</p>

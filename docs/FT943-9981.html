			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Ireland Having won its third consecutive Eurovision song contest Ireland may be heading for another award this year - fastest growing European economy. The Irish government has just increased its 1994 growth forecast to a racy 5 per cent and judging by last week's figures from AIB the optimism looks well-founded. These showed the bank's Irish loans growing at an annualised rate of 10 per cent in the first half while across the Irish Sea, NatWest's loan book was down. Not everything in Ireland is rosy. Unemployment is still very high though this at least adds to the confidence that the economy can combine such growth with continued low inflation. So confident are some independent forecasters that they predict this benign environment will last to the end of the century. The implications have not been lost on domestic or international investors who pushed the Dublin stock market up by 54 per cent last year. However, this could be seen largely as a correction for the steep fall over the previous two years and with the market 12 per cent off this year's high it is not highly rated by international standards. The biggest problem for investors is the limited range of stocks to choose from. Most quoted Irish companies are either very small or, like Jefferson Smurfit, very international. The one large industrial group that has significant exposure to Ireland is building materials group CRH, whose shares now discount much of the good news. Nor have investors overlooked the two banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, which generate half their profits in their home market. But their shares remain modestly rated compared with their UK banks, operating in a much more difficult climate.</p>

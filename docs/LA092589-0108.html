			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IMPACT OF OIL DRILLING PAINTED AS DISMAL;  </P> <P> STUDY OF OFFSHORE WELLS PREDICTS AT LEAST ONE MAJOR ACCIDENT  </P> <P> Tanker traffic off California would increase 41% if a federal moratorium on oil  drilling is lifted and at least one major accident would result, according to a  study conducted for six coastal counties stretching from Sonoma to Monterey.  </P> <P> "The conclusions are rather grim," San Francisco Supervisor Angela Alioto said  of the report released today. In a statement, Alioto said the counties "wanted  an independent assessment of the impacts from offshore oil drilling."  </P> <P> The $95,000 study -- done for Sonoma, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa  Cruz and Monterey counties -- claimed that oil exploration would be centered  near wildlife areas such as Ano Nuevo State Preserve, a principal breeding area  for elephant seals.  </P> <P> Oil-drilling platforms would be as big as two football fields and capable of  supporting up to 50 wells, the study said, adding that 100,000 tons of  contaminated waste would spill onto the ocean floor over the 15- to 20-year  life of the wells.  </P> <P> The report also predicted that as many as five processing ships would be  permanently anchored along the coast to handle the oil and gas.  </P> <P> It forecast at least four major incidents from offshore drilling, including at  least one tanker accident and one platform leak of 100,000 gallons.  </P> <P> "We were very careful not to exaggerate the risks," said Warner Chabot, the  environmental planning consultant for the regional studies consortium formed by  the six counties. "We retained the same geologists and the same consultants who  prepare studies for the oil industry."  </P> <P> Representatives of the oil industry insisted exploration can be done in an  environmentally safe manner.  </P> <P> Besides, said Larry Shushan, a spokesman for Chevron, "there aren't very many  places that haven't been explored."  </P> <P> The counties would be affected by offshore oil operations in an area known as  Lease Sale 119. The U.S. Department of Interior has been trying to hold Lease  Sale 119 for years. The sale was originally scheduled in 1984.  </P> <P> Two other proposed lease sales off the California coast -- one from Mendocino  County north to the Oregon border, the other from Monterey County to the  Mexican border -- have been shelved indefinitely.  </P></p>

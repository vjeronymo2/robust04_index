A year before, Hong Kong businessman Tsui Bao-jen brought a  case to the provincial higher people's court on the grounds that  Qilihe District Government had violated his rights as an agent  in marketing China-grown lily bulbs in Hong Kong because he had  discovered an advertisement of the Hong Kong Maiya Trade Company  claiming to be an agent in marketing lily bulbs, thus he  demanded Qilihe District Government to acertain his general  agent rights in Hong Kong, while claiming a 12.4 million yuan  indemnity.    Through hearing of the provincial higher people's court, it  was held that the contract signed between the accusant Tsui  Bao-jen and the relavant department in Qilihe district  explicitly stipulated that the term of Tsui Bao-jen acting as  agent was five years. When the term expired, the contract was  not renewed; consequently, Tsui's status of the agent ended  automatically.</p>

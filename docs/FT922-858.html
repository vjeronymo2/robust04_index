			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Names' anger defused: Coleridge apologises for Pounds 2.06bn losses; Views of moderates gain prominence 'WHERE is the contrition?' Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's of London is said to have remarked after seeing an early draft of his speech to yesterday's annual general meeting. Mr Coleridge more than made up for it in the final version. For good measure he punctuated the long question-and-answer session which followed his 45-minute speech with countless apologies for the damage inflicted on Names  -the individuals who underwrite the market - by the insurance market's 1989 losses of Pounds 2.06bn. Many syndicates were overwhelmed by claims on catastrophe reinsurance policies in what Mr Coleridge described as 'one of the darker chapters in the long history of our society'. Mr Coleridge was flanked by his three deputy chairmen as he said he understood the sentiments of 'despair, anger and bewilderment expressed by Names'. Mr Coleridge offered his regrets to dozens of Names who asked questions. He was sorry for his failure to answer letters - he had received 850 in the past two weeks. He apologised profoundly for refusing to meet Mr John Harris, a Name who had suffered losses of several hundred thousand pounds. 'If there is any advantage for you to see me I'll do it in the next week if possible - I'm extremely sorry.' He was 'very sorry' about the fact that Names had discovered details of the new levy in their morning newspapers rather than directly from Lloyd's. The market was going through a period of 'intense media speculation', and any delay risked 'more false and damaging rumours'. Halfway through his presentation Mr Coleridge was congratulated by one Name, Mr Alan Diamond, for his leadership. 'A lesser man would have walked away,' said Mr Diamond. Mr Coleridge would take no credit, though. 'Whatever I do, I know I'm wrong,' he said. 'There will be those of you who will disagree with every word I have said.' Mr Coleridge's approach succeeded in helping to defuse what had been expected to be a tense, angry and even violent meeting. From the outset dissident Names who had promised 'chaos' and 'civil war' were surprisingly quiet. As the day progressed the views of moderates who back Lloyd's Council - the market's ruling body - were expressed more frequently. Ms Pamela Thomas argued for a tougher stand against incompetence and negligence. Mr Coleridge warmed to the theme. 'If there is anything, the whole book will be thrown at them,' he said, reflecting on the possible evidence that might be unearthed by investigations into the losses of catastrophe reinsurance syndicates. On the whole, the meeting was well-behaved, although one supporter of the council could not contain his indignation. Handed a notice of an extraordinary general meeting by Mr Richard Astor, who is pressing for a no-confidence vote in the management, the Name screwed up the piece of paper, spun round and threw it at Mr Astor. 'Scoundrel,' he shouted.</p>

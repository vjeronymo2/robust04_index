			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / People: Banker takes the road to St Ives Bob Gavron, the 61-year-old founder of St Ives, has anointed his successor. Miles Emley, a 43-year-old merchant banker, has been appointed deputy chairman of Britain's leading independent printer. 'After what seems like a lifetime advising people, I am looking forward to acting as a principal,' says Emley, currently head of UK corporate finance at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. However, he stresses that his appointment should not be read as a signal that one of the printing industry's more conservative companies is about to embark on an acquisition binge. Emley, who spent the first 17 years in the City with N M Rothschild, first came to Gavron's attention when Rothschild handled St Ives' stock market flotation in 1985. Gavron says that Emley 'knows St Ives well and will add considerable strength to the development of the group'. 'I don't know if I will want to retire in four years' time,' says Gavron, but adds that it is important to have the next generation of management in place just in case. Noting that Britain's fragmented printing industry tends to be rather short of top management, Gavron says that the company has often tended to recruit outsiders. Gavron, one of Britain's more modestly paid chairmen, was not born into the industry, and Brian Edwards, 42, the managing director, came from Touche Ross in 1978. ***** First Leisure, the UK's largest pure leisure company, has found a replacement for finance director Nick Irens who is leaving to run his own company. Graham Coles, 39, joins after less than a year with Amber Day Holdings, the discount retailer which yesterday issued a profits warning. He had previously spent three years as finance director of BhS, and before that had been with W H Smith. John Conlan, First Leisure chief executive, was unphased by Coles' short stay at Amber Day. 'I am hiring him because of who he is. He has good commercial sense.' ***** Colbeck Murray has been appointed a director of ENGLISH &amp; AMERICAN UNDERWRITING AGENCY. ***** David Bevington-Smith has been appointed a divisional director of SBJ STEPHENSON. ***** Andrew Dykes, previously md of Schinnerer &amp; Co, has been appointed md of STURGE MARINE SYNDICATE MANAGEMENT. ***** Nick Martin has been promoted to the board as development director of SEDGWICK JAMES (LONDON).

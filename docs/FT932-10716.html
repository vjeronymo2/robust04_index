			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: Football in the big league Sir, Many of your readers will have been astounded by Christopher Lorenz's comments on football club management ('A lovable bully falls from grace', May 1). It is, he asserts, 'in a somewhat lesser league than the tasks which such big-time players (Margaret Thatcher, Lord King, Robert Horton) perform.' Surely he is familiar with the words usually ascribed to the late Bill Shankly, sometime of Liverpool Football Club: 'Some people think that football is a matter of life and death - but it's much more important than that'?

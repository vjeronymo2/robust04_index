			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> OC HOMELESS COUNT SEEMS THIN  </P> <P> U.S. Census officials in Orange County said today that the ambitious nationwide  effort to count the homeless went off without a hitch locally but that several  of the 200 census takers who fanned out across the area expressed surprise that  more people weren't discovered living on the streets.  </P> <P> Although final figures had yet to be compiled, census officials said field  enumerators reported spotting far fewer homeless people during the survey than  expected.  </P> <P> Surveys of homeless people in shelters on Tuesday night produced the sorts of  totals authorities anticipated. However, there were relatively few people found  sleeping on the streets when the enumeration effort shifted early this morning  to the back alleys, fields and parks of the county, officials said.  </P> <P> "I think we've read too many stories -- they had us believing the homeless  would be swarming all over the place," said Joe Montes, Fullerton census  district manager. "We could be coming face to face with an exaggeration of the  (homeless) population. We'll find out when we pool our numbers."  </P></p>

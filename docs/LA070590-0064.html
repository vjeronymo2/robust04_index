			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAY BERWICK; TRAINER OF FILM ANIMALS  </P> <P> Ray Berwick, Hollywood animal trainer who put 25,000 animals through their  paces for films like "The Birds" and "Birdman of Alcatraz," has died. He was  75.  </P> <P> Berwick died Monday night at the Westlake Medical Center of a heart attack.  </P> <P> First an animal trainer for circuses and vaudeville, Berwick broke into movies  in 1962 training birds for "Birdman of Alcatraz," starring Burt Lancaster as a  convict who became a world authority on birds.  </P> <P> In 1963, he trained 300 birds for Alfred Hitchcock's thriller "The Birds" about  a California coastal town repeatedly attacked by birds.  </P> <P> Berwick was a pioneer in using positive reinforcement -- food and petting -- to  get animals to perform. He produced Universal Studios' first live animal show  and created shows for the San Diego Wild Animal Park.  </P> <P> "In my work I've trained more than 25,000 animals and I've only lost one in an  accident," Berwick once told The Times. "One of the birds for 'The Birds' was  crushed by a wagon."  </P> <P> Berwick said some of his trained birds or animals were set free after their  performance, others were sold, and a few were kept as his special pets.  </P> <P> Berwick is survived by his wife, Suzanne, a son, Brad David, and a daughter,  Tammy.  </P></p>

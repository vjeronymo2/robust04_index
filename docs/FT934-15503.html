			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Yeltsin calls poll for both houses PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday issued a decree to hold elections to both houses of the Federal Assembly on December 11 and 12, in a further attempt to squeeze opposition in the regions. He had originally announced that only the lower house - the state duma  - would be elected, with the upper house - the federation council - comprising heads of councils and heads of administrations of the regions and republics. However, the virtual suspension of the councils, and the sacking of a number of administrators who supported the parliament in the struggle between it and the president, had rendered the original plan obsolete. Though details of the decree, signed before Mr Yeltsin left for Japan, were lacking, the official Tass news agency said two deputies would be elected to the Federal Assembly from each of the 88 regions and republics in Russia. With this decree, the president has now largely completed a plan to hold a range of council elections in December. However, many believe the time is too short. So far, the president has decreed elections to the state duma (450 seats, with an equal number elected from party lists and single-member constituencies), decreed elections to the Federal Assembly (166 seats), and recommended elections to the regional and republican councils. The functions of the councils have mainly been transferred under the control of presidentially-appointed administrators in the regions pending new elections. A commission is due to report on reform of the regional councils by Friday. Japanese hostility, Page 4</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Feathered herds give heavyweight profits - The rapid growth of US ostrich ranching EVOLUTION DEALT the ostrich a mixed hand. The world's largest, presumably oldest and certainly moodiest bird boasts a protective hide covered with motley coloured feathers, carries around 300lb of red meat and lays delicious eggs. Such impressive physical endowment has, unfortunately for the earth-bound avian, great commercial value. African farmers have long realised the birds' potential. But in the US only recently have ostriches become a hot commodity. In fact, the US supply for this alternative cash crop remains solely in the hands of breeders, who sell the birds at inflated prices to satisfy demand. Since ostriches were first introduced from South Africa in the mid-1980s the number of ranchers raising them has grown to about 3,000. The ranches are usually small, but surprisingly profitable. An adult pair, which can produce between 30 and 120 eggs per year, now carries a Dollars 60,000 price tag, which is still rising quickly. Two yearlings can be bought for about Dollars 12,000 to Dollars 15,000 and chicks, which require much care, are a bargain at Dollars 3,000 each. No wonder many Americans with a backyard and a high fence have at least mulled over this investment. Mr Howard W. 'Bud' Kerr Jr., who runs the one-man (no window) small-scale farming office at the sprawling US Department of Agriculture, says he gets as many as 30 inquiries about ostriches each week. At the Circle M Ranch in south-west Missouri, Mr Bob McKean has been raising ostriches since 1986, when he bought his first pair for only Dollars 8,000. He now owns 35 birds, quite a lot by present standards, which are raised on a 75ft by 120ft plot. Many such breeding ranches are run across the country's farm belt, especially in Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri. It is not clear when the demand will be satisfied, though estimates range from five to ten years. Other large-scale agricultural commodities like Angus cattle and the Texas longhorn also were launched by a breeder's market. The ostriches' potential under normal market conditions has not been questioned. The bird has many uses. Ostrich flesh, already used to make jerky in Africa, caters to the demand for low fat and low cholesterol meat. Large-scale slaughter has not begun, but the meat, now taken from sterile birds, sells for Dollars 6 to Dollars 10 a pound. Health-conscious California has been cited as a possibly fertile future market. The black, blue and white feathers, which on the European market bring Dollars 50 to Dollars 1,000 a pound, are used in feather dusters, fashion accessories, theatre costumes and pens. This is a renewable resource; an ostrich can be deplumed twice a year. But perhaps most coveted is the hide, used to make boots and brief cases. Tanned hides bring Dollars 30 to Dollars 50 a sq ft while custom 'full quill' boots can cost as much as Dollars 2,000. Starting an ostrich farm is easy, farmers say. An estimated 2,000 birds are needed to turn a profit under normal market conditions. For now, however, an operation even smaller than Mr McKean's can do the trick. The birds, unlike cattle, need little space and eat little. They usually live for around 70 years and most of them are fertile. 'They're just large chickens,' says Mr Ronald Mascher, who publishes the Small Farm Today magazine. But they are probably not as smart. Owners warn that the birds must be trained and handled carefully because, with a brain barely bigger than a peanut, the ostrich has an impulsive character. The birds do not stick their heads in the sand to avoid danger - a terribly damning myth, ostrich owners lament - but they are prone to unrelenting pecking, running around at speeds in excess of 45 mph and generating enough force with their two-toed feet to, in the words of one expert, 'disembowel a lion'. There are other problems. Chicks often have a high mortality rate, usually a consequence of indigestion or inclement weather; the market for many ostrich products, particularly meat, remains untested; and prices are highly volatile. Volatility may not be such a drawback, however, as US farmers are well known for having a strong speculative streak.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F> correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen at the Foreign Ministry in  Jerusalem on 30 March -- recorded]    [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres this evening  commented on the negotiations with the Palestinians. He said  that Israel was now seriously considering implementing an early  withdrawal from the Gaza Strip even before the negotiations were  fully completed. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen  interviewed the foreign minister a short while ago.    [Begin recording] [Peres] I think that both sides want to  extricate themselves from this confusing situation and achieve  results. The time is ripe for decisions and an interim period  may only invite further trouble.    [Rosen] Sir, you are about to send armed Palestinian  policemen and an multinational force into the powder keg that is  Hebron. When will the government finally make the decision it  is constantly discussing and inching toward to evacuate some of  the Jewish settlers from Hebron?    [Peres] First of all, I would like to make things perfectly  clear. The Jewish residents of Hebron are not in charge of the  Cave of the Patriarchs. The Israeli Government, through the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces], is responsible for the Cave of  Patriarchs and for guaranteeing freedom of access and worship at  the site. As for Jewish settlers residing in Hebron, the  government has to reach a decision. There is no point in  ministers, including myself, making premature statements. The  appropriate place for discussions is in the cabinet, not the  media. Clearly, we are facing a very difficult problem. It is  not a problem of rights but a problem of relations.    [Rosen] Is Israel ready to consider starting its withdrawal  from the Gaza Strip even before the negotiations are completed  in order to meet the target date of 13 April?    [Peres] I believe that any reasonable proposal will be  examined on an individual basis. I do not want to make any  generalizations, but the Palestinians are not the only ones who  want to enter the Gaza Strip quickly. We also want to transfer  authority to them quickly. There is no point in gaining another  week or two of riots. We have no interest in this. All the  violent confrontations which took place recently cause all of us  pain, and we have no interest in seeing any further bloodshed,  not of Arabs and certainly not of Jews. [end recording]</p>

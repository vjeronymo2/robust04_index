The ambassador was  accompanied by a delegation of senior European officers.    Hambley publicly incited against resistance and said: We had  the opportunity today to meet President al-Hirawi along with a  special military delegation of European officers whose task is  military training. I think the United States strongly believes  that it is very important for Lebanon to have a strong army able  to control all Lebanese territory. He added: President  al-Hirawi is very concerned about developing the Army's military  capability. Our contacts fall within this context and General  (Porman) is with us.    Commenting on the south, Hambley said: This issue is on our  minds. It is important that we should not let these groups  hamper the peace process by continuing attacks, especially those  that inflame things in the south. We are now trying to  concentrate actively on the peace talks in Washington and hope  to work together to avert any complications.    On his contacts yesterday with Prime Minister al-Hariri on a  request from Secretary Christopher, Hambley said: Undoubtedly,  our governments had intense contacts last night. We will  continue these contacts. I do not wish to elaborate on these  talks but our governments are trying to follow up the situation  and make new moves through the Washington talks.    Asked if the request to halt resistance in the south is now  a  United States' demand, rather than an Israeli one, he replied:  This was a misconception of the U.S. message. I stress the  call to halt violence and the need to pursue the talks, because  they are the only solution.    The U.S. ambassador and the European officers delegation met  Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul.    President al-Hirawi earlier received Army Commander General  Emile Lahhud, who briefed him on reports coming into  headquarters from the south. They also discussed issues  concerning the military institution.</p>

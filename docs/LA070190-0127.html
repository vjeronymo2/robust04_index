			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA ENDS TOUR BY PROMISING TO RETURN  </P> <P> Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela ended his 11-day U.S. tour on Saturday  with a promise to return as early as October, and high on his agenda will be  discussions with Native Americans on ways he can "help in their struggle."  </P> <P> Mandela, seemingly buoyed by the warm and celebratory welcome on his final stop  in the United States, nonetheless was forced to cancel an appearance at a  fund-raising dinner Saturday night. His wife, Winnie, skipped an engagement in  Berkeley as the Mandela entourage left at 6:24 p.m. for Ireland, roughly 12  hours ahead of schedule.  </P> <P> Mandela took about 10 people with him on a charter flight out of the country.  Others in his entourage were to leave on commercial flights. Word of his abrupt  departure came as the staff at the Oakland Convention Center were setting up  tables for what was to be his final appearance on the U.S. tour.  </P> <P> "The (scheduling) conflict is that he promised to be in Ireland," explained  Roger Wilkins, national coordinator of the U.S. tour. "He also promised to be  here."  </P> <P> Before leaving, Mandela addressed more than 60,000 people at the Oakland  Coliseum and apologized to a delegation of Native Americans for being unable to  meet with them. The Native Americans had been among roughly 200 people who  greeted him at the Oakland airport.  </P> <P> "I can assure the leaders of the Indian community that I will return in  October," Mandela said, adding that they had given him letters describing their  living conditions. "We will exchange views on what I could do to help in their  struggle."  </P> <P> On his stop here, Mandela repeated his central messages: that the United States  should keep economic sanctions in place, and that funds are needed to continue  the fight against the racist South African system of apartheid.  </P> <P> He acknowledged the strong support his struggle had received in the San  Francisco Bay Area, going out of his way to thank Rep. Ronald V. Dellums  (D-Berkeley), who introduced the first anti-apartheid resolution in Congress in  1971.  </P> <P> REST WAS UP IN THE AIR:About the only rest Mandela received during his tour was  aboard "Air Mandela."

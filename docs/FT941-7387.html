			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Israeli minister expects further drop in jobless Unemployment in Israel fell to 9 per cent in the final quarter of 1993 - giving a full year average of 10 per cent, compared with 11.2 per cent in 1992. The improvement was hailed by Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, as vindication of the Labour government's economic policies. He predicted a further fall in the jobless rate in 1994 to about 9 per cent. The figures, released by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, showed that 101,000 new jobs were created in 1993, an increase of more than 6 per cent over the previous year. Analysts attributed the falling jobless totals to three factors: An increase in Israel's gross domestic product; Israeli workers in the building trade have replaced many of the 50,000 Palestinians from the occupied territories no longer permitted entry into Israel; The slowdown in immigration from the former Soviet Union. From a low of 6 per cent in 1987, unemployment had been growing steadily until last year, fuelled by the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews. A new report issued by the Treasury, meanwhile, predicted 5.6 per cent growth in Israel's GDP for 1994 - a revision of the 5.3 per cent prediction in the budget last October.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lilleshall makes agreed Pounds 2m bid for Historic City Devs Lilleshall, the industrial distribution and building products group, yesterday launched a recommended bid for Historic City Developments, a property company, in an offer which values the target at about Pounds 2.1m. HCD specialises in the development and restoration of offices and shops, particularly on schemes in historic towns and cities in southern England. It owns one property, which comprises three shops - two of which are let - in Salisbury. In the year to April 30 1993 HCD made pre-tax profits of Pounds 132,791 on turnover of Pounds 2.06m. At the year-end net assets stood at Pounds 1.88m, of which Pounds 153,745 was cash. One of the two developments then held has since been sold, boosting HCD's cash to about Pounds 1.34m. The other has been revalued at Pounds 830,000. The offer is made on the basis of 221 new Lilleshall shares of 10p for every 500 HCD shares of 25p held, valuing each HCD ordinary at 70.1p. This, Lilleshall said, represented a small premium over the unaudited attributable net assets as at February 28 last. Lilleshall added that during the 12 months preceding the offer, there had been five recorded dealings in HCD ordinary shares at prices between 18p and 21p. In the five years to December 31 1993, Lilleshall has lifted profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.91m on turnover which has grown from Pounds 30.5m to Pounds 69.5m.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Australian yachtsman Iain Murray has rebutted charges that Dennis Conner was  given inferior sails and led astray by an Australian navigator in the ANZ  12-Meter Challenge series he lost to Murray at Sydney last month, 5-3.  </P> <P> "That is absolute rubbish," Murray told reporter John Roberson of Fremantle,  Australia. "The sails were divided up according to age."  </P> <P> Roberson wrote that Hugh Treharne, the Australian navigator assigned to  Conner's boat, had warned Conner to stay outside of a line to avoid running  aground, but that Conner sailed inside the line before scraping to a halt on a  rock.  </P> <P> Conner's boat manager and crewman, Bill Trenkle, had raised the points in a  Times article when he returned home.  </P></p>

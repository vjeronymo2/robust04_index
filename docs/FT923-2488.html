			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / No aid to unsafe N-reactors CRUMBLING nuclear reactors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are unlikely to get financial aid from OECD countries this winter, following the failure of the Brussels meeting on nuclear safety to commit itself to rescue programmes. Provisional pledges of aid from the Group of 24 industrial countries amounted to Dollars 600m-Dollars 700m, delegates said yesterday, but the meeting, which ended on Tuesday night, extracted no new firm commitments. Although concern about a Chernobyl-type accident has been growing since the extent of the disrepair of eastern power stations emerged, only Dollars 300m in bilateral aid deals has so far been agreed. The Brussels meeting was summoned when a G7 meeting in July failed to agree an Dollars 800m emergency plan. This week's packed meeting, which included representatives from over 100 countries and regulators, rejected the proposal of a central rescue fund in favour of further bilateral agreements. Mr David Kyd, spokesman of the International Atomic Energy Authority, the nuclear watchdog, which will now have a Brussels-based representative, said: 'There was a distinct lack of specifics. Some eastern European countries feel the committee's plans will begin to have an effect in 1993, but that they will be left to muddle through the winter'. Because of electricity shortages, many of the 58 reactors in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe will be run close to full capacity this winter in spite of safety hazards. The committee set up a working party on urgent improvements at Kozloduy, in Bulgaria, which last year was called the most dangerous nuclear power station in Europe, but the Bulgarian delegation said last night that the Brussels meeting had committed no new funds. A small amount of radioactive water leaked out at a Russian nuclear power plant on the Kola peninsula at the weekend, according to an official at the Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, Reuter adds. Mr Risto Paltemaa, a chief inspector, said the Centre had received information about Saturday's leak from Russian authorities following local radio reports. He said the leak, at the Kola nuclear power plant close to the town of Polyarnyye Zori, did not endanger the environment. According to his information, there had not been any leaks outside the building. No increased radiation levels had been detected in the surrounding area and no abnormal radiation levels had been recorded in Finland. Mr Paltemaa said the water had leaked from a tank in a separate building to the reactor.</p>

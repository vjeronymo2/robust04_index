The authorities have  summoned Israeli Ambassador in Cairo David Sultan and handed him  an official letter of protest, demanding an apology by his  government.    Rabin's remarks came in a meeting with Israeli thinkers and  writers the day before yesterday. Rabin said he is not sure  Egypt could remain committed to the peace treaty should the  "terrorist" groups take power. The Egyptian Government received  detailed reports on Rabin's remarks from the Egyptian Embassy in  Tel Aviv.    The Egyptian Labor Federation issued a statement in Cairo  the  day before yesterday calling on its members not to meet an  Israeli Histadrut delegation and confirming the continuation of  the Egyptian federation's boycott of its Israeli counterpart.</p>

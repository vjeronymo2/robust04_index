			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Steelmaker plans sharp price rise UES Steels is increasing the price of its engineering steels by between 7 per cent and 12 per cent from January 1, and warning of probable further increases next year. The company, based at Stocksbridge near Sheffield, is Europe's leading manufacturer of engineering steels used by the automotive, energy, power generation, aerospace and general engineering markets. Its announcement comes 10 days after British Steel said it was raising the list prices of its strip products by between 7 per cent and 10 per cent from January 1. UES Steels said carbon and alloy prices were set to rise at least 10 per cent, with minimum increases of 12 per cent for spring steels. Stainless prices would rise at least 7 per cent. Mr Martin Howell, commercial director, said: 'We anticipate that there will be further increases in the course of 1995. It is vital that the steel industry as a whole achieves the price increases it is seeking in order for the efficient European producers to retun to profitability.' Along with British Steel, UES Steels is trying to take advantage of the recent increased demand for steel. UES Steels was squeezed badly last year between falling prices for its steel and rising costs of the scrap it uses as a raw material. This contributed to a record Pounds 48.1m pre-tax loss last year for its parent company, UES Holdings, which has since returned to the black.</p>

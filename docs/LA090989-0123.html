			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAIRWAY TO SCHOOL WORRIES PARENTS  </P> <P> It didn't take long for Janet and Greg Armstrong to name the steep flight of  steps that their 11-year-old son must climb each day to get to class.  </P> <P> The Laguna Niguel couple have dubbed it "the death staircase" and are praying  that it will not live up to the name.  </P> <P> "I don't want to sound like I'm hoping for the worst," Janet Armstrong said  Friday. "But it's an accident waiting to happen."  </P> <P> Capistrano Unified School District officials, faced with a burgeoning student  population, recently placed 12 portable classrooms on a narrow hilltop that  overlooks Niguel Hills Junior High on Paseo Escuela, near Street of the Golden  Lantern. The stairway is the only access to the elementary classrooms.  </P> <P> The buildings, which opened Thursday, were ordered moved onto the site by the  school board earlier this year to accommodate 300 fifth- and sixth-graders who  are awaiting the opening of George L. White Elementary School, district  spokeswoman Jacqueline Cerra said.  </P> <P> Classes at the new school will begin sometime in January, school officials  said, and the students will be transferred there from the portable classrooms.  </P> <P> But in the meantime, angry parents say, their children must walk up and down  what they consider a hazardous stairway an average of four times a day.  </P> <P> Already having placed calls to several administrators to make their fears  known, the parents have vowed to organize to persuade school district officials  to rip out the cement stairs and install a sloping trail up the 40-foot cliff.  </P> <P> "For us, it's an issue of safety," parent Greg Armstrong said. "We believe that  the staircase is inadequate, unsafe, and (that) our child is at risk (along  with) the children of other parents."  </P> <P> The 68 steps have not been properly "roughed" for good footing during rainy  days, parents contend. And they fear that in an emergency such as a fire,  children hastening down the stairs could be trampled.  </P> <P> School district administrators disagree that the stairs are unsafe, and say  that they have devised a system to monitor the children going up and down. The  children must walk in pairs, each pair four feet apart, and must hold on to  guardrails, Niguel Hills Principal Jean Trygstad said. As many as six teachers  watch them, she added.  </P> <P> "We had no problems the first day," said fifth-grade teacher Laurie Allen, who  stood in front of Niguel Hills Junior High on Thursday morning to greet  elementary students and escort them to the stairway.  </P> <P> "I don't see (the stairs) as a hazard," she said, but added: "We do have to be  really careful."  </P> <P> William F. Dawson, a district assistant superintendent, said that the stairway,  which was completed last week, "meets or exceeds" all city and state Department  of Education building regulations.  </P> <P> "I feel it's very safe for those kids," Dawson said. While acknowledging that  the stairway is considered substandard by district building inspectors, the  inadequacies are all superficial, such as uneven steps, he noted.  </P> <P> "That staircase is structurally sound and safe for use," Dawson said. "We even  tested it with hoses. It didn't get slippery." He confirmed, however, that  there is an ongoing dispute with the contractor who built the stairway for  failing to put a rough surface on the steps, among other things.  </P> <P> He said that the district is withholding payment to the contractor until the  staircase is refinished.  </P> <P> There are also plans for building a ramp beside the stairway, Dawson said. The  ramp, however, will be designed for use by maintenance and janitorial workers.  </P> <P> "I don't think the kids will take the time to use the ramp," Dawson said. "It's  going to be a long trail."  </P> <P> Dawson said that he is surprised to hear that parents began complaining about  the stairway one day after school started. "I was at the orientation (Wednesday  night), and parents didn't know who I was. And I didn't overhear one  complaint."  </P> <P> But several parents who attended orientation night said that they were shocked  to see the staircase.  </P> <P> "I stood at the top and got dizzy," Janet Armstrong said. "It's quite a trip up  those stairs. You could have a heart attack."  </P></p>

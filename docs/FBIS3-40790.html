			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "A Lacklustre Air Show"] </F>   [Text] Bangalore, December 17--The phased array Rajendra  Radar integrated with the Akash missiles, which is India's  indigenously developed equivalent of the Patriot missile system,  the Pilotless Target Aircraft (PTA) and the first full-scale  mock-up of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) were the star  attractions of India's indigenous defence development programme  at the three-day international air show, Avia-India '93, which  started yesterday near Yelahanka, about 20 km from here.    Singapore is understood to have shown interest in the PTA,  named Lakshya, which has been jointly produced by the  Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) and the Defence  Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The Rajendra  Radar, with a C3-I (command control communication and  intelligence) configuration, is undergoing trials and is  scheduled to be set for induction by the end of next year. The  LCA is scheduled to roll out in March 1995 and test flown for  the first time at Bangalore in June 1996.    From the defence point of view, the air show proved to be a  lacklustre affair with a token aircraft representation of two  Mirage 2000C, multi-role fighters of the French Air Force.  Neither Russia, which is India's largest source of defence  equipment and military aircraft, nor the United States or any  other western country had flown in any type of defence aircraft  for either air or static display. For example, there was neither  the much promised Russian Su 27 long-range interceptor nor  either of the U.S. multi-role F-15/F-16 multirole aircraft. The  only other military aircraft for static and air display was the  heavy lift Transol transport aircraft, also belonging to the  French Air Force.    Even the Indian Air Force was not adequately represented at  the air show providing for merely fly-pasts of two types of  fighters--the Jaguar and MiG 29, and three types of  choppers--Cheetah, Chetak and the Mi-8. The air display was  inaugurated by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal  S.K. Kaul.    The Indian Navy was more effectively represented by a  magnificent air display of the Vertical Take Off and Landing  (VTOL) capable Sea Harrier of British origin and the Ka-28,  anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter of Russian origin. The  Navy even managed a fly-past of the impressive long-bodied TU  142 long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft of Russian  origin.    Hindustan Aeronautics Limited displayed a variety of both  indigenously developed and foreign collaborated helicopters and  fighter and transport aircraft. The Army and air force version  of the HAL manufactured Advance Light Helicopter (ALH) provided  both a fly-past and air display. However, the only modern  aircraft that formed part of the HAL's static display inventory  was the Jaguar, a deep penetration strike aircraft (DPSA) of  British origin. The others were the Indian-manufactured Kiran  jet trainer, the HPT 32 basic trainer, the German origined  Dornier 228 transport aircraft, the phased-out Gnat and Marut  fighters, and the Chetak light helicopter.    The most dynamic and heart-stopping performance in the  otherwise unimpressive air display was that of the Mirage 2000C  flown by French Air Force pilots. The mid-air combat manoeuvre  by the fighter version of the Mirage 2000C left the public and  defense officials gaping. The manoeuvres involved the French  pilot stretching himself up to 9g in side and vertical combat  manoeuvres and over -2g in an outward combat manoeuvre.    The other static display of interest was a full-scale  mock-up  of the upgraded version of the MiG 21 (bis) redesignated as the  MiG-21-93. However, the aircraft has the same engine and air  frame although its avionics, weapon delivery system and weaponry  are comparable with the state-of-the-art MiG-29 air superiority  interceptor.    Interestingly, the Israeli Aircraft Industry (IAI) had set  up  a mock-up display of an upgraded cockpit of a MiG-21 (bis),  redesignated the MiG-21-2000, in its indoor stall fitted with an  avionics and weapon systems claiming to be even more superior to  the Russian package.</p>

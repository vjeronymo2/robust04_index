He demanded that the suspect be handed over to the German  authorities.    A German court issued a warrant for the arrest of suspect  Yusuf S. [not further identified] in 1990 for participating in  the attack. The spokesman added that the German court also  accuses him of planning the attack.    On 5 April 1986, a bomb blast at a nightclub frequented by  U.S. military personnel in Berlin killed three people and  wounded 230 others. The United States accused Libya of being  behind the attack and retaliated by bombing Tripoli 10 days  later.    Lebanese judiciary sources said the man being detained in  Lebanon, who is of Palestinian origin, worked in the Jamahiriyah  office in East Berlin. The spokesman added that the man was  arrested in Lebanon in 1992 and has been in custody since. The  spokesman could not say whether he was arrested for the charges  against him or for other reasons.    The spokesman added: "Since then, we have been trying to get  him handed over to Germany to try him." He added: "The German  Embassy received his file in August 1993."    The German authorities were informed of the arrest of Yusuf  S. in Lebanon at the end of 1992 but the information was not  revealed so as to keep the investigation secret.    Another Palestinian, 'Imad Mahmud (37), has been held in  Berlin since November 1992 on charges of planning and  participating in the attack on the nightclub.</p>

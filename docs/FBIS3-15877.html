			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "More Entrepreneurs Please:"] </F>   [Text] A sharp upsurge in unemployment is expected in  Moscow in 1994, and as early as mid-year roughly 600,000 people  can expect to be out of work. This was the focal point of a  session of the Committee for Assisting in the Search for  Employment under the capital's government.    It was noted that at present the city employment service has  40,000 job vacancies for the 16,000 officially registered  unemployed in Moscow. Many of these, however, do not want to  find a job because of miserly wages, increased demands by  employers, and the simple fact of uninteresting work.    The capital's government has drawn up a number of measures  capable of averting a sharp increase in unemployment in Moscow.  Among other things, training for entrepreneurs seeking to set up  their own businesses has been started for the first time.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cautious Dunhill climbs to Pounds 76m DUNHILL HOLDINGS, the luxury goods group, shook off the worldwide recession and the aftermath of the Gulf war to increase pre-tax profits by 3 per cent to Pounds 76m in the year to end-March. At the half-way stage the group had reported an 8 per cent decline in profits. The shares rose 12p to 482p. Lord Douro, chairman, said that trading improved in many areas in the latter part of the year, although in Japan conditions had worsened recently. He said that the figures were creditable under the circumstances. However, the percentage increase was the lowest for 10 years. He expressed caution about the current year. Rothmans International, the tobacco company, has a 57.67 per cent stake. Rothmans is in turn controlled by Compagnie Financiere Richemont, the Swiss holding group. Sales rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 254.6m (Pounds 227.2m). They were boosted by the acquisition in June last year of Hackett, the men's outfitter, and the purchase of a 34 per cent stake in Dunhill's Japanese distributor. Turnover on a like-for-like basis was 5.5 per cent higher. Operating profits were static at Pounds 55.7m (Pounds 55.1m). An increase in net interest received to Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 18.7m) helped pre-tax profits, which were up from Pounds 73.9m. Net cash rose from Pounds 163.8m to Pounds 179.6m. After a slightly lower tax rate, earnings per share rose to 28.4p (27.3p). A proposed final dividend of 4.95p gives a total of 7.7p (7p), which is covered 3.7 times. As well as the Alfred Dunhill brand the group owns Montblanc pens, Hackett, and Chloe, the French fashion and fragrance business. On Monday Dunhill announced the purchase of Karl Lagerfeld, another French fashion house. Lord Douro said that the group had been offered many possible acquisitions but often these were at high prices. The group had decided in the main to invest more in its own brands - through buying more distributors, opening shops and widening product ranges, for example the introduction by Chloe of leather accessories.</p>

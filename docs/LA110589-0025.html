			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition 15.7  </P> <P> Produced and bottled by Sanford Winery, Buellton. The only wine in the tasting  to ring up two perfect 20 scores.  </P> <P> WILD HORSE 1987 SANTA BARBARA COUNTY PINOT NOIR: $13.50: 15.6  </P> <P> Produced and bottled by Wild Horse Winery, Templeton. One wine maker-panelist  wrote "All the right stuff!"  </P> <P> ROBERT MONDAVI 1987 NAPA VALLEY PINOT NOIR:  </P> <P> COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING WITH STYLE;  </P> <P> AND THE WINNERS ARE . . .;  </P> <P> OUR 16TH-ANNUAL WINE TASTING -- OF PINOT NOIR AND SAUVIGNON BLANC -- UNCOVERS  BRIGHT NEW STARS PLUS SHARP VALUES  </P> <P> Most everyone in the wine world -- consumers and producers alike -- knows that  Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are the most popular white and red table  wines in America. Then why, for our 16th-annual Los Angeles Times wine tasting,  did we choose to spotlight Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir?  </P> <P> European wine lovers, to whom Pinot Noir-born Burgundy is the undisputed king  of all wines, and Cabernet Sauvignon the queen, might only wonder at the  audacity of any competition from our young wine land of California. We dared,  and in the judgment of our 18 panelists, all of professional standing, eight  California Pinot Noir wines, from several regions, placed ahead of a 1985  vintage Echezeaux jewel from the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti.  </P> <P> And Sauvignon Blanc? This is the sole grape variety grown in the Loire Valley  responsible for some of the most graceful white wines of France, Pouilly Fume,  vines ribbing the hills of this chateau country of legendary history. It is  also the dominant vine of French Graves, where its sauvage or bold character is  forever tempered with varying amounts of softer, fruitier Semillon, the  dominant grape of Sauternes. In the last few years, with decisive canopy  management of the vines' luxuriant foliage, our viticulturists have made  tremendous strides in taming the wild assertiveness of this varietal, and wine  makers, too, have carefully etched a new personality for this less costly, but  definite rival to the preeminence of Chardonnay at wine-selection time.  </P> <P> These bright new stars, of engaging difference, none with outrageous  grassiness, emerge from regions as diverse as Monterey and Mendocino counties,  Lake County and Livermore, and of course, Napa, Sonoma, and the Central Coast  regions. Among our 33 winners are some fabulous discoveries. Though the choices  of our tasting jury may be controversial, treasures of taste abound in the  following results, and the value scale is remarkable.  </P> <P> Panel members for the 1989 tasting included, in addition to the author, Dr.  William Bond, Byron Kenneth Brown, owner/wine maker of Byron Vineyard &amp;  Winery; Bruno d'Alfonso, wine maker of Sanford Winery; Fred Dame Master of  Wine; Jill Davis, wine maker of Buena Vista Winery; Steve Doerner, wine maker  Calera Winery; Richard Graff, president/wine maker of Chalone, Inc.; Dwayne  Helmuth, wine maker of Callaway Vineyards &amp; Winery; Ben Lane of Wine  Futures Exchange Inc.; Jerry Luper, wine maker of Rutherford Hill; Bruce  McGuire, wine maker of Santa Barbara Winery; Lew Mitchell of Lew Mitchell's  Orient Express; Michael Mondavi, general manager of Robert Mondavi Winery;  Victor Hugo Roberts, wine maker of Creston Manor Vineyards &amp; Winery; Piero  Selvaggio of Valentino Restaurant; Steve Wallace, wine merchant, and importer  Winston Wilson.

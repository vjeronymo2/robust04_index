			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: 'THE TWO JAKES' -- IT'S ALL JAKE NOW  </P> <P> After 16 years, one false start, a couple of shattered friendships, a rewritten  script, a new ending and enough other rumors to keep a private eye busy  full-time, Paramount Pictures' sequel to "Chinatown" is about to open. But with  less than two weeks to its Aug. 10 release date, director-star and Jake Gittes  alter-ego Jack Nicholson has been back in the studio recording eight pages of  narrative dialogue for "The Two Jakes."  </P> <P> "I always wanted to have a whack at (a narration)," Nicholson tells us. "It's  the toughest piece of writing I've ever done."  </P> <P> Like "Chinatown," "The Two Jakes" is complicated: set in 1948, 11 years after  the events of "Chinatown," it has Jake embroiled in a murder case that both  links the sequel to the original film and pivots on a complex scam to rip off  oil beneath the L.A. basin.  </P> <P> "We didn't put (narration) there to explain the story," Nicholson says, "but to  give audiences a point of reference. This is not a popcorn movie; audiences are  going to have to work for it and we wanted to let them know that it's all  right, they're going to get it."  </P> <P> Nicholson admits that adding narration to the already thickly woven Robert  Towne script made him nervous. So Nicholson invited his "idol," Billy Wilder --  the king of film noir narration ("Double Indemnity," "Sunset Boulevard") -- to  a screening of the narrated version "to see if he thought narration helped or  hurt the picture."  </P> <P> "Two good lines of narration can save you a half-hour of a boring picture,"  says Wilder, who gives Nicholson's "Two Jakes" narration a thumbs up.  </P> <P> "It's a very cerebral picture, it's way above the usual 'Die Hard' level,"  Wilder says. "(Nicholson) asked me should he have the narration or not. I  thought he should. I thought it was excellent." Jack Mathews  </P></p>

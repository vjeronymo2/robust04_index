			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said here today that the modified Murkowski  Amendment is absolutely unacceptable and urged the U.S.  Government to abide by the principles of the three Sino-U.S.  Communiques and take effective measures to keep the Sino-U.S  relations from serious harm.    The modified Murkowski Amendment adopted by the joint  conference of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the  U.S. on April 19, asserts that the Taiwan Relations Act takes  primacy over the Sino-U.S. August 17 Joint Communique.    The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said that the Murkowski  Amendment,  which asserts that sections 2 and 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act  take primacy over statements of U.S. policy, including  communiques, regulations, directives and policies based thereon,  is designed, in essence, to negate the Sino-U.S. August 17  Joint Communique, undermine Sino-U.S. relations and erect  obstacles to the great cause of the peaceful reunification of  the Chinese people.    It is absolutely unacceptable and the Chinese Government and  people are firmly against it, Wu said.    "We demand that the U.S. Government take this case  seriously, abide by the guiding principles of the Sino-U.S.  relations as set forth in their three joint communiques, live  up to its promises and take effective measures immediately to  keep the Sino-U.S. relations from serious harm," Wu said.</p>

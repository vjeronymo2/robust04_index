			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 16 SAPA -- An Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] branch chairman on the East Rand and a member of the  Katlehong Peace Committee were killed on Sunday when the taxi  they were travelling in came under fire from unknown gunmen. The  latest in a resurgence of violence on the East Rand, the  killings prompted the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  regional government to propose community policing be introduced  in the region.    Police spokesman Capt Janine Smith reported the IFP's  chairman at Simmer and Jack Mines near Katlehong, Wilson  Buthelezi, 43, and Katlehong Peace Committee member Muzi  Sithole, 31, were shot dead when men with AK-47 rifles opened  fire on their taxi at 5.30PM on the road between Zonkesizwe and  Palmridge.    The attackers fled in a white Toyota Corolla.    Reacting to the killings, IFP East Rand regional organiser  Thabani Dlamini said in a statement: "We call on the African  National Congress East Rand region to meet with us so that we  can work hand-in-hand to defuse the anger of the people of our  region who have suffered so much in the recent violence through  these senseless killings".    Mr Dlamini said neither organisation gained anything from  the  violence. "We are distressed by the wave of violence sweeping  through the East Rand townships, particularly Tokoza and  Katlehong, and we call upon everyone in these communities to do  everything possible to rebuild peace."    PWV Public Safety and Security Minister Jessie Duarte called  for urgent attention to be given to the implementation of  policing that included the involvement of self-defence units,  SABC radio reported. Ms Duarte was speaking after a visit to  Tokoza, where 12 people were massacred at the weekend.    The IFP has attributed the flare-up in violence to new  soldiers not knowing the location of trouble spots.</p>

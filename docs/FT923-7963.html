			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: MMC takes the shine off shoe polish merger THE CONCLUSION by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that the merger of the Cherry Blossom and Kiwi shoe polish brands might act against the public interest was based on a fear of a substantial increase in prices. The MMC was primarily concerned about the 'self-selection' market, essentially sales through grocery outlets. It said that Sara Lee's acquisition of the Cherry Blossom brand from Reckitt &amp; Colman last October had increased its share of that market segment from 44 to 74 per cent. That was 'a significant reduction in competition in the supply of shoe polish products to the self-selection market', which would give Sara Lee 'the opportunity . . . to introduce substantial increases in prices to retailers without constraining forces being brought into play.' The MMC said that would be against the public interest, although 'shoe polish products are low-value items, infrequently purchased, and demand is largely insensitive to price'. Also it found that consumers' brand loyalty was not particularly strong. Professor Patrick Minford, the economist and a member of the panel reviewing the merger, said in a dissenting report that 'there is considerable countervailing power from supermarket chains' and a 'large array of alternative suppliers.' He said there were no barriers to imports, except transport costs which were low. However, the MMC took evidence from supermarket chains, some of which said that competition would weaken. Only J Sainsbury and Superdrug have own-label shoe polishes. In evidence Tesco said that 'in its experience where a supplier had a dominant market position that position could be exploited against a company like Tesco.' The MMC concluded that the threat that Sara Lee would close its factory in West Yorkshire, which employs 90 people, and move to France if required to divest, was insufficient to outweigh the benefits. Professor Minford disagreed. 'Loss of output and employment in Yorkshire, an area of high unemployment, would clearly be a serious damage to the public interest.'</p>

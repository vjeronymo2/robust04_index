According to the rules, China should resume its GATT status  before the package of GATT agreements go into effect, thus  becoming a member country of the world trade organization.    Gu said this while answering a question at a press  conference  held by the information office of the State Council.    China, which was originally one of the signatories of GATT  and withdrew from it for various reasons, formally applied in  1986 to restore its original status.    Gu said that after seven years of negotiations, the Chinese  delegation has clearly explained China's economic and trade  system to the member countries of GATT, which have got an  overall knowledge of it.    During the period, great reform has been carried out in  China's economic and trade system. As a result, the system is  very close to the principles of GATT now, Gu said.    Thus, he said, it is high time to discuss concretely the  text  of the protocol for the resumption of China's status in GATT.    Most of the signing member countries hoped that the  negotiations would achieve rapid progress, Gu said, adding that  some countries have begun or declared they will begin  negotiations with China on tariff problems.    One of the difficulties facing the work is that some major  signing parties' high demands exceed China's economic ability,  Gu said.    Gu expressed his hope that the major signing countries will  actually support China's effort.    On the timetable, Gu said that China of course would like to  return to GATT at an early date, and that the Uruguay Round of  trade talks, which wound up on December 15 last year,  objectively provided a timetable for China's resumption of its  status in GATT.</p>

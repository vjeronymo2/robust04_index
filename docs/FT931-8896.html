			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Claremont reaches settlement with J&amp;J Fashions designer MRS JENIFER Rosenberg, the clothes designer who built up J&amp;J Fashions before departing acrimoniously following the company's takeover by Claremont Garments (Holdings) last year, has reached an out-of-court settlement with Claremont. Under the settlement, Mrs Rosenberg will receive a payment of about Pounds 100,000 and be freed from a service agreement signed when Claremont bought J&amp;J. In return, she will remain bound by certain restrictive covenants signed as part of the acquisition agreement. However, the two sides seemed to disagree yesterday about the scope of the restrictions. For example, advisers to Mrs Rosenberg believed she was able to design blouses for suppliers to Marks and Spencer, J&amp;J's main customer, while Claremont's advisers believed she was not. There was further confusion as to whether she could work as a designer of children's wear and coats. Claremont, which is also one of Marks and Spencer's main suppliers, paid Pounds 27m for J&amp;J in June last year. But the relationship with Mrs Rosenberg turned sour and Claremont terminated her service agreement, which was due to run for two years, in October.</p>

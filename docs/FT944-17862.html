			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Names spurred on by Gooda judgment Action groups of Lloyd's Names held up in the legislative queue to claim damages yesterday seized on Tuesday's Gooda Walker judgment to urge the professional agencies they are suing to agree out-of-court settlements. The success of the Gooda Walker action group in the High Court in winning compensation for negligent underwriting during the late 1980s has led others to believe their hand has been strengthened. But the Gooda Walker case has also highlighted the limited pool of errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance cover held by members' agencies being sued. Claims for negligence would be paid by this cover. Lloyd's Names earlier this year rejected the insurance market's settlement worth Pounds 900m. Lawyers for E&amp;O insurers yesterday refused to discuss publicly the possibility of settlements. But Mr Alan Porter, chairman of the Devonshire Names Action Group, which is claiming Pounds 174m on behalf of 1,140 members, said the Gooda Walker verdict provided a basis for a possible settlement for other 'spiral' cases, where underwriters agreed to cover others against excessive losses from catastrophes. The next 'spiral' case, mounted by Names on the Feltrim syndicates, starts later this month. Mr Josceline Grove, secretary of the Secretan Names Association, urged Lloyd's, which so far has said only that it would facilitate a deal, to take a stronger lead in forging a settlement.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Portugal Socialists head for victory Portugal's opposition Socialists were headed for a big victory over the ruling Social Democrats of Prime Minister Anbal Cavaco Silva in nationwide municipal elections yesterday, according to forecasts after three-quarters of the votes were counted. The vote, which came mid-term in the legislature of Mr Cavaco Silva, appeared to represent a humiliating defeat for the centre-right government, with a significant rise in the vote for left-wing parties. The Socialists held on to the cities of Lisbon, Oporto and Coimbra, and were forecast to win a majority of the country's 305 municipal councils. The votes counted by late last night gave the Socialists 35.38 per cent of the total vote nationwide, compared to 32 per cent in the previous 1989 election. The Communist party had polled 13.15 per cent, while the Social Democrats had 34.21 per cent. Mr Jorge Sampaio, a Socialist, was re-elected mayor of Lisbon with a forecast 67 per cent of the vote.</p>

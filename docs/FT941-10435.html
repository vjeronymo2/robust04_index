			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sculley claims his technology 'gem' was flawed - The former Apple chief's resignation from Spectrum and subsequent lawsuit By resigning as chairman and chief executive of Spectrum Information Technologies, Mr John Sculley fulfilled the predictions of many in the computer industry, who said his decision to jointhe small communications technology company last October was hasty. After just four months with Spectrum, he abruptly resigned on Monday and filed a lawsuit against Mr Peter Caserta, Spectrum president and former chief executive, alleging Mr Caserta lured him to Spectrum with 'fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions'. The lawsuit also alleges a plot by Mr Caserta to reap profits from stock sales after Mr Sculley's hiring sent Spectrum stock soaring. Mr Sculley is seeking at least Dollars 10m in damages, noting his reputation has clearly been sullied by the events of the past four months. The question remains, however, how Mr Sculley, a prominent US business leader, former chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, and former Pepsi executive, could find himself in such a position. Industry analysts suggest he was so dazzled by the technology that his business judgment evaporated. At Apple, Mr Sculley became so enamoured with the potential of Newton, Apple's hand-held personal digital assistant, that he appeared to loose touch with the company's core personal computer business, critics charged. However, he believed that in Spectrum he had found a technology 'gem'; a company with key patents covering technology for linking computers to cellular telephones to enable wireless data communications. Yet the 10-year-old company, with 1993 revenues of just under Dollars 100m, has never returned a profit and has a history of aggressive self-promotion, legal disputes with competitors and problems with regulators. Mr Sculley 'could have had his pick of jobs in the industry' when he left Apple last year, said one former colleague. But Mr Sculley said he had 'caught the Silicon Valley entrepreneurial bug'. He saw Spectrum an an opportunity to build a company, and talked of plans to make it as well recognised as Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company or Microsoft, the personal computer software leader. By his own admission, he 'stumbled on to Spectrum'. He was entranced by a demonstration of the company's technology, staged by Mr Caserta, at Mr Sculley's Connecticut home. Initially, according to Mr Sculley and Mr Caserta, Spectrum's interest was in licensing its technology to Apple Computer. 'I never had any negotiations about joining them or anything else until after I separated from Apple,' Mr Sculley said in October. Immediately after his resignation from Apple, however, Mr Sculley flew overnight from California to New York and initiated talks with Mr Caserta about joining Spectrum. Then followed four days Mr Sculley described as 'the most gruelling of my life'. Working day and night, with a team of engineers and patent attorneys he hired to examine Spectrum's technology, Mr Sculley drew up an employment agreement with Spectrum. On the following Monday morning he announced he was joining the company. 'Of course, I did my own due diligence before I joined up,' Mr Sculley said at the time. But this focused almost entirely on Spectrum's technology and the validity of its patents, a spokesman for Mr Sculley said this week. Mr Sculley says he did not know, when he joined Spectrum, that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Neither was he aware Spectrum had used questionable accounting practices - booking revenues from licensing agreements in advance of receiving payments. Spectrum asserts, however, Mr Sculley was 'fully aware of the circumstances that he now cites as his reasons for departing' both before and during his time at Spectrum. On Monday, the company restated its earnings to deduct Dollars 6.4m from second and third-quarter revenues. The same amount will be added in subsequent periods, the company's new accountants said. Whether or not Mr Sculley was told of Spectrum's current problems, it seems the company's past dealings should have alerted him. While Mr Sculley says he was not aware of an SEC probe, he did know that Spectrum was facing related shareholder lawsuits when he joined the company. The SEC's investigation of Spectrum is believed to focus on an episode last year, when Mr Caserta announced the company expected 'tens of millions of dollars' in patent royalties from a new licensing agreement with AT&amp;T. Spectrum's stock price soared, then crashed the next day when AT&amp;T challenged Spectrum's claim and said it expected royalty payments to be much lower. Spectrum had a reputation for aggressive promotion. Its former chairman, Mr Dana Verrill and a former boardmember, Mr Gene Morgan, had appeared on television 'infomertials' touting the company. In 1990, the National Association of Securities Dealers removed Spectrum from its listings when its capital fell below required minimums. The company was relisted in 1992 after a stock offering. It has also had to restate its earnings in the past, due to accounting problems. Last May it made an adjustment for 'correction of inaccurate accruals of certain items into income (in 1992)'. However, industry analysts felt Mr Sculley had minimised the damage by his quick departure. Numerous technology companies will still be vying for Mr Sculley's attention, predicted one analyst, 'but perhaps he will be more cautious in choosing his next position'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Deputy Foreign Minister  Alexandr Vondra told the North Atlantic Assembly (NAA)  representatives visiting the country that the Czech government  is shortly to debate a document expounding its conception of  cooperation with NATO in the framework of the Partnership for  Peace. The Czech Republic joined the Partnership for Peace  program in March this year.    The document will cover both cooperation in peace-keeping  activities, such as the present participation of a Czech  contingent in the UNPROFOR [UN protection] force in  ex-Yugoslavia, as well as questions of funding and legislation,  he said. Vondra was speaking after his meeting with NAA  Chairman Loic Bouvard and Secretary- General Peter Corterier.    Parliamentary Chairman Milan Uhde told journalists it was a  huge lesson in solidarity that the Czech Republic, although  feeling threatened by no country, was intensively interested in  collective European security.</p>

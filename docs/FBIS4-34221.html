			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari </F> by XEW correspondent Felix Cortes in Cartagena de Indias; date  not given; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Cortes] At the conclusion of the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit here in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia,  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will not prepare for  the fifth summit, which will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina,  in a year. Mr. President, I would like to have a human reaction  on the part of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a political  assessment. How does it feel to leave a creature, in whose  gestation, birth, growth, and development you had a primary  role, now that that creature has learned how to walk.    [Salinas] The most important thing is for initiatives to  become institutions. For the first time in history, in fact,  all the chiefs of state and government of the Ibero-American  nations met in 1991 in Guadalajara; this served as a formidable  backdrop. The residents of that city showed their generosity,  enthusiasm, and hospitality and served as an exceptional  framework for that first Ibero-American summit. For me it is  truly encouraging that what emerged first as an idea, as a mere  proposal, later became in Guadalajara this Ibero-American  initiative, confirming that Mexico does not forget its roots  when it envisions the future.    [Cortes] A document, which all the participants at the  Cartagena de Indias summit signed, recognizes the work of Mexico  and the work of Carlos Salinas de Gortari in being capable of  convoking what has turned out to be a reality, which someone  five years ago would have said was impossible to achieve. The  mere gathering of diverse personalities -- often showing  unnoticeable differences and other times a marked contrast --  sitting down at the same table is a triumph. Specifically,  however, what were the achievements of the previous three  summits and this one in Cartagena de Indias in particular?    [Salinas] The specific agreements are twofold. The first is  that it was confirmed that a state of pluralism in the  representation of chiefs of state and government at this  Ibero-American summit could exist and still yield common goals.  In other words, common purposes can be built amid diversity. I  have always believed in pluralism. I also believe that  diversity can be transformed into a similar purpose to achieve  better living standards for our peoples. This was demonstrated  in the Ibero-American summit in Guadalajara and in subsequent  summits: the one in Madrid in 1992, the one in Salvador de  Bahia, Brazil, in 1993, and this one in Cartagena de Indias in  1994. This is the first concrete result. Political dialogue  within the framework of pluralism permits achieving common  objectives. The second concrete result is that, through this  framework of achieving consensus and dialogue, which have marked  the Ibero-American Summit, we have managed to secure concrete  initiatives. This has resulted in the opening of bigger markets  and the possibility of selling more of our products and  increasing trade and has meant the creation of more jobs and  more opportunities for more Mexicans.    [Cortes] Mr. President, all of those who have been sitting  around that table during these two days agree on the  fundamentals. They agree on the necessity of free trade,  cooperation, understanding, exchanges, rapprochement, and  cordiality. When one reaches a thorny topic, as is the Cuban  political system, then not everybody has similar views. Would  you say, as some observers have said, that this Ibero-American  community, although it sits at the same table, is divided?    [Salinas] I would say that we never sought uniformity. What  we sought, I repeat, recognizing the pluralism of systems in the  region, was to find common points of agreement. The results  show that it is possible to find similar goals, despite the  diversities and differences in the political systems of the  region. If there is respect and recognition of the existing  pluralism -- we have demonstrated they exist -- one can reach  such consensus. We never intended to have any country similar  to another or to be a clone of another system. No, recognizing  the differences, we wished to stress that we have common roots  and similar desires.    [Cortes] Finally, Mr. President, are you saddened by the  fact  that you will not continue to attend these meetings?    [Salinas] Well, the meetings will continue to be held as  part  of their institutional structure. I must tell you that I am  leaving very animated by these meetings. I am stimulated by the  existing recognition of our Mexico. It is important to  underscore this, because in recent months we have experienced  difficult times, tragic and sad moments. Despite this, however,  there is broad recognition internationally of what Mexico has  constructed with great effort in recent years. Without failing  to recognize the challenges and problems that we face, we can  count on the fact that there is recognition of our work and of  Mexican realities, which are many and varied in different  fields. That is truly encouraging.    [Cortes] Don Carlos, thank you very much.</p>

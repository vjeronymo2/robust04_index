			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Doubts rise over pit by pit coal sale PRIVATISATION of British Coal on a pit by pit basis is emerging as the least-favoured option in the government's plans to sell the industry. Ministers have doubts about the viability of individual pits taking on contracts they might later be unable to fulfil. There is also concern that National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, would have an unfair advantage if they were negotiating with a number of small individual companies. While the present board of British Coal would like the industry privatised intact, there are pressures on the government to privatise it in regional units, providing greater flexibility than if the industry were left as a single entity, even in the private sector. Moreover, a suitable buyer for the corporation as a whole might be hard to find. Ministers emphasise that no final decisions have been taken about the form in which the industry would be sold. Nothing could be decided anyway until agreement was reached on the contracts between British Coal and the electricity generators which will come into effect in April. Mr Tim Eggar, then energy minister, said earlier this year that he hoped agreement could be reached before the House of Commons dispersed in July, but ministers are now more wary of setting a deadline. The new contracts will inevitably be less advantageous to the industry than those now in force. Those agreements, put in place by the government before the electricity industry was privatised two years ago, enable British Coal to earn almost all its money through selling 65m tonnes of coal a year to the generators at artificially high prices. The shape of the industry will be critically affected by the scale of the reduction in amounts that the corporation is able to sell to the generators. The volume of coal in the contracts is expected to be 45m tonnes in the first year, falling to 30m in the third year and possibly less after that. Estimates of the size of a slimmer industry range from 10 to 30 of the existing 50 pits. Both the government and British Coal have said they are keen to privatise the largest possible viable industry.</p>

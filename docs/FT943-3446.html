			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / People: Watmoughs plans its succession Patrick Walker is planning to hand over the reins at Watmoughs, the Bradford-based printer, after almost 50 years with the company. Watmoughs was founded in 1888, when it started publishing Fur and Feather, a magazine for budgerigar, rabbit and guinea pig breeders. When Walker joined as a cost clerk in 1948, the company was still a publishing operation with a printer attached. He became managing director in 1965 when the group was floated. By then, 65 per cent of the business was printing the catalogue for Empire Stores. 'Everyone said how clever we were,' he recalled yesterday. 'They would run a mile now.' Watmoughs is still the biggest UK printer of mail order catalogues, along with newspaper supplements, tabloids and many other products. Walker, who became chairman in 1977, has guided the group's strong growth into a company with operations in Hungary and Spain and a turnover last year of almost Pounds 150m. He is relinquishing his role as chairman and chief executive in January to become executive chairman until January 1997, when Declan Salter (left), who has been promoted from md of Watmoughs, to joint managing director of the group's UK operations, will become chief executive. David Burn, md of Varnicoat, will be the other joint md until the changeover; he will continue as a director until he retires in August 1998. Walker will remain non-executive chairman throughout 1997 when he will finally retire at the age of 66. He plans to devote a lot more time to his interest in 18th century English furniture, and English and Italian drawings.</p>

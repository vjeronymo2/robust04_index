Mancino offered to quit saying that Rome prosecutors had  gathered documents which could lead to his being investigated in  connection with the Sisde (intelligence service) affair  involving corruption in the funding of the secret services.    The documents in question had been sent to the three  investigating judges who could launch legal proceedings against  him, officials said.    But Ciampi said in a statement that he had "full confidence"  in Mancino, adding that the transfer of documents for  consideration by the judges "is an obligatory measure, which  does not constitute a formal charge."    Mancino was implicated in the Sisde affair along with three  former interior ministers, including current Italian President  Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, by former members of the secret services.</p>

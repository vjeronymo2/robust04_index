			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine accused of 'discourtesy' to MPs MR MICHAEL Heseltine came under renewed fire for his handling of the government's energy review yesterday when he was charged with 'grave discourtesy' in the Commons by the Labour chairman of the trade and industry committee. Mr Richard Caborn made the charge after the trade and industry secretary's decision to use a recent debate on manufacturing to comment on the committee's recent report on coal. Mr Caborn was supported by Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the House, who said she was 'delighted' at the committee's decision to raise the matter directly with Mr Heseltine. The criticism came as it emerged that the cabinet could get its first chance to discuss plans for saving coal pits next week, after what appears to be a concerted expectation-lowering exercise in Whitehall. Firm decisions seem unlikely until the week after at the earliest. However, indications are that the results of the government's energy review will not be delayed beyond this month. The government yesterday underlined its rejection of proposals which would curtail the amount of electricity supplied from France via the French interconnector. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, assured his French counterpart it was 'not legally possible' to prevent the import of French electricity via the link. But Mr Eggar said he made it clear to Mr Andre Billardon, the French energy minister, that Britain anticipated 'growing exports' of electricity to France. He said Mr Billardon had confirmed that access to the French electricity market was available to UK suppliers on a non-discriminatory basis. Further discussions on the non-leviable status for supplies of electricity from France would take place early next week. The Commons committee, among 39 proposals, recommended that electricity supplied from France would cease to be non-leviable and that Electricite de France's ability to negotiate contracts to supply baseload electricity from 1993 should be conditional on UK generators having non-discriminatory access to the French electricity market. Ministers and officials are emphasising the extremely narrow range of options available to Mr Heseltine, particularly as no contracts have been agreed yet with the electricity generating companies. There is hope in Whitehall that the threat of a strike by miners has tempered some of the sympathy among potentially rebellious Conservative backbenchers.</p>

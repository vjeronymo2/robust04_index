			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Market-Testing in Whitehall: Cold draught of competition in Whitehall corridors - The implications for lawyers and accountants of the government's proposals ACCOUNTANTS and lawyers are geared up to compete for substantial contracts as a result of the government's market-testing proposals. The large accountancy firms have already been active in advising the public sector on the scope for contracting out services. Now they are poised both to advise and to take on the services themselves. A number of firms have cut their teeth on advisory work for local government and non-governmental organisations. They have also been active in the growing private-sector market, offering accounting and tax compliance functions previously run internally. Many central government market-testing opportunities will be in similar areas, covering internal audits, payroll, accounting and pensions administration. Most of the work to date has been strategic. Mr Malcolm Coster, head of consulting at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said his firm had won a contract from one department worth nearly Pounds 1m to advise on quality assurance and the supervision of its market-testing programmes. The contracts themselves present more of a difficulty for the firms. Mr Clive Williams, head of consulting at Ernst &amp; Young, rules out what he calls the high-volume, low-value-added services many of the contracts would involve. He said: 'Our strategy is to concentrate on advisory, high-value-added work.' Others are less adamant. Mr Brian Pomeroy, head of consulting at Touche Ross, says his firm is already involved in financial management projects and is looking at other areas. Mr Richard Gledhill of Price Waterhouse also does not rule out competing for some market-tested functions. Andersen Consulting has been particularly involved in running computer systems contracted out from organisations such as the Stock Exchange, as well as from companies such as BP. The question is how far accountancy firms will be able to manage a highly diverse workforce conducting relatively low-margin long-term work, in contrast to their traditional higher-margin work by a relatively homogeneous professional staff. Lawyers in private practice have called the government's plans for market-testing legal services unduly cautious. Market-testing of legal services has been confined to conveyancing services in the Department of the Environment, all legal services at the Department of Social Security and services worth Pounds 30m, involving 1,400 mainly administrative staff, at the Lord Chancellor's Department. As part of a review of enforcement agents, the government is also planning to contract out the work of county court bailiffs. The government had been expected to go much further. The Health and Safety Executive's routine health and safety prosecution work, the pollution inspectorate's prosecution work and the Employment Department's local advice work in the regions were all expected to be candidates for early market testing. City lawyers said yesterday the government's caution might stem from lack of interest by the private sector in competing for government work. One lawyer said that with such high overheads it was 'virtually impossible' for central London law firms to make government legal work pay. The white paper also confirms the government's intention to press ahead with compulsory competitive tendering for local-authority white-collar services, including 33 per cent of legal services. Mr Paul Thomas, of the Law Society's local-government group, said local-government lawyers had expected the extension of compulsory competitive tendering to legal services. Local-government lawyers were specialists in this area and were confident of winning most of the available work.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan fights off invading locusts THE PAKISTANI government said last night that the country's locust emergency was over. Mr Salman Farooqi, the secretary general of the agriculture ministry in Islamabad declared: 'The whole thing has been contained in the desert,' adding that up to 400 swarms which had entered Pakistan had been wiped out in an army-backed spraying operation. He said, however, that the country would continue to monitor an area of some 50,000 sq km in the deserts of Thar (Sindh) and Cholistan (Punjab), in preparation for any other swarmlets entering from the Indian state of Rajasthan. An international appeal for assistance of up to USDollars 1.3m towards the anti-locust operations, has so far received yielded Dollars 850,000 000 and another Dollars 600,000 is expected in the near future, senior officials say. Meanwhile, Mr Zahoor Ahmed, head of Pakistan's leading cotton research station in the city of Multan, said that at least 11.5m bales of cotton were expected from the crop this year, which is due to be harvested, next month. That would be close to the government's target of 12m bales. The locust attack had raised concerns over the future of Pakistan's cotton output which is considered to be crucial for the country's economy. Some officials argue that this year's alarming situation should encourage the government to intensify vigilance and store large supplies of pesticides to deal with any new threats. 'This year, we were lucky, next time we may not be,' said one official.</p>

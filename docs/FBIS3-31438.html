			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 17 (AFP) -- Russian troops are not  neutral and are "not welcome" on the Bosnian Serb frontlines in  Sarajevo, Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said Thursday [17  February].    Ganic was asked for his reaction to Thursday's agreement for  the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weaponry from Sarajevo,  following Russian mediation. In return, the Russians are to  send peacekeeping troops to Bosnia.    Ganic said: "The Russians are not neutral and have never  agreed with NATO on the demilitarisation process of Sarajevo.  Therefore, they are not welcome."    Ganic said that if the Russian troops were deployed in the  Sarajevo region, he would prefer "to see them guarding Bosnian  heavy weapons placed under UN control rather than Serb weapons."    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has threatened to  bomb  the Serb artillery from 2400 GMT Sunday if it were not withdrawn  from around Sarajevo or put under control of the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR).    The Bosnian army is mainly Moslem. The Russian government  has come under domestic pressure to support the Serbs who are  fellow Slavs and orthodox Christians.    Ganic added that the Russian initiative was "clumsy from a  diplomatic point of view because it shows a lack of trust in the  UNPROFOR", the UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, speaking in Athens  on Thursday, said the Moslem side should now make concessions.    "The time has come for the West to prove that it knows how  to  do something better than an ultimatum, by encouraging the other  side to undertake what we have obtained from the Serbs," he told  journalists before holding talks with his German counterpart  Klaus Kinkel.</p>

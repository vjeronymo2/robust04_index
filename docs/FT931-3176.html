			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Tax change which will move markets - John Plender says reforms to ACT may be esoteric but will have far-reaching effects Changes in the treatment of advance corporation tax (ACT) may sound esoteric, but they are among the most important reforms in the budget. This is partly because anomalies in the current system greatly distort corporate investment decisions. For many of Britain's larger companies which have substantial tax liabilities in foreign countries as well as in the UK, the impact of ACT incorporates a powerful incentive to incur high costs overseas and to generate high profits in the UK. One result of this quirk, which British multinationals have frequently brought to the Treasury's attention, is that there is a temptation to move knowledge-intensive activities such as research and development to foreign subsidiaries. But Mr Lamont has used the opportunity presented by this problem for a more fundamental reform of the tax credit arrangements that apply to companies and shareholders. This will have implications both for the stock market, and for the income of institutional investors and higher rate tax payers. The ACT problem began when Britain shifted from a 'classical' corporation tax to an 'imputation' system under the Heath government in 1973. In the classical system, the company pays corporation tax on its profits. Then, when it pays a dividend, the shareholder pays income tax on the receipt. The disadvantage of this system is that the owner's profit is taxed twice - once in the hands of the company, then in the hands of the shareholder when distributed. Under an imputation system this double taxation is eliminated. Today British companies pay corporation tax at 33 per cent on profits. They then deduct 25 per cent of the gross dividends paid out, in what amounts to an advance collection of income tax. But the deduction is called advance corporation tax and can be offset against the mainstream corporation tax liability of 33 per cent on overall profits. The problem of unrelieved, or surplus, ACT arises where company dividends are larger than the mainstream corporation tax bill in the UK. In the present recession, companies that are paying dividends out of reserves fall into this category. But the more important group consists of companies that earn most of their profit overseas. Since their UK tax liability is usually reduced by the amount of foreign taxes they pay, they can find themselves with inadequate mainstream tax against which to offset the ACT. So their foreign profits are taxed twice, abroad and at home. Such companies will be pleased that the Chancellor has responded to their complaints. He proposes that dividends paid out of overseas profits should be separately classified as 'foreign income dividends'; companies would be entitled to a refund if the dividend payment gave rise to surplus ACT. But no tax credit would be available to shareholders on the dividend, which raises a question about whether dividend-conscious institutional investors might find such shares less attractive. The more fundamental reform suggested by Mr Lamont is a reduction in advance corporation tax for all companies in two stages, from 25 per cent to 22 1/2 per cent in 1993-4, and 22 1/2 per cent to 20 per cent in 1994-5. At the same time the chancellor proposed to reduce the tax credit granted to shareholders in one go from 25 per cent to 20 per cent in 1993-4. This is bad news for pension funds, which are exempt from tax on dividends. Until now, as owners of companies, they have been taxed at 33 per cent on a company's retained profit and 8 per cent - the difference between the tax credit of 25 per cent and the corporation tax of 33 per cent - on profit paid out as dividends. Henceforth, they will pay 13 per cent rather than 8 per cent on distributed profit. They will yield Pounds 1bn a year to the exchequer as a result of the change. In theory, the pension funds will benefit, in the sense that the companies they own are expected to enjoy a cash flow benefit of Pounds 2bn from the changes over the next two years. The capitalised value of the potential tax relief to companies with surplus ACT problems should also, in theory, increase the value of the shares. But actuaries value pension fund assets on the basis of their income. And this will be reduced by the changes, implying, other things being equal, a lower yield on equities for the biggest group of share owners. This could help the government's funding problems by slightly altering the relative attractions of gilts against equities. It could equally be seen as a backdoor way of reducing the cost of the tax reliefs granted on pension contributions. But then the Treasury has long been keen to find a way of clawing back some of this tax break. The other possible losers could be bankers and brokers in the City. Finding UK acquisitions for companies with surplus ACT problems has produced a steady stream of lucrative fees for mergers and acquisitions specialists.</p>

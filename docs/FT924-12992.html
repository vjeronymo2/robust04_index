			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Pension for a wife I WAS divorced in 1984 but the decree nisi was never made absolute. Am I still married and entitled to my husband's pension rights and occupational pension? You should where consult your own divorce lawyer about the overall situation. But on the more general point about your rights under your husband's occupational pension scheme - and you do not say if this is a company plan or a self-employed/personal pension policy - we can say this. If you are still married legally, there is a possibility that you remain entitled to a surviving widow's pension under the rules of your husband's company pension plan (if his plan is one of these and if he dies before you). Some plans allow the trustees to pay a survivor's pension to a dependent other than the legal spouse if the dead member has expressed such a preference by letter or in an 'expression of wish' form to the trustees. The Pensions Management Institute is conducting a major national enquiry into the problem area of pensions in divorce with a view to making formal recommendations for legislation to the government. It is looking for comments, recommendations and well-presented case histories in order to ensure that its study is as comprehensive as possible. Its address is: Pensions Management Institute, PMI House, 4-10 Artillery Lane, London El 7LS. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

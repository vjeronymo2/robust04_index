			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UMBERG'S OCCUPATION AND PRINGLE SUPPORTERS' LAWSUIT  </P> <P> The current controversy over the ballot designation of Thomas Umberg "Pringle  Partisans Sue Umberg Over His Title on Ballot" (Aug. 23), has overtones of  "Alice in Wonderland."  </P> <P> At the time Umberg filed his campaign papers and selected a ballot designation,  he was employed as an assistant U.S. attorney. Because of the law, he had to  resign that position in order to run, and his resignation letter was being  processed.  </P> <P> However, as of the date on the filing of the campaign papers, his designation  was completely accurate.  </P> <P> According to the logic of Curt Pringle's lawsuit, it would appear that Umberg  should have used a crystal ball and designated himself as "unemployed."  </P> <P> FREDERICK T. MASON  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

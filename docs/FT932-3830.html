			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (14): Insurance chief is an unlikely business hero - Profile, Marinus Daling MARINUS DALING, chief executive of Sankorp, the group that manages the strategic investments of the Sanlam insurance group and driving force behind the Gencor unbundling and Metropolitan Life black empowerment announcements last month, is an unlikely business hero. He has no profile outside the investment community, does not have a compelling physical presence, and is far too well-mannered to make the grade as a ruthless corporate buccaneer. Also, anyone in search of ground-breaking initiatives in the South African corporate world would have been most unlikely to commence his investigations in Bellville, home of the giant insurer. Its image has been that of a conservative, Afrikaans organisation, dominated by grey men in grey suits wearing grey shoes. Some of these judgments must now be revised. Mr Daling may hail from the small Northern Transvaal town of Nylstroom, and speak with a thick Afrikaans accent, but there is nothing hick about his thinking on corporate structure and investor strategy. He deserves praise, too, for encouraging decisions - not without risk - which not only have favourable political resonances in the new South Africa, but show that South Africa is coming more into step with international business norms. Though not denying the outcome, Mr Daling is emphatic that neither decision was politically driven. 'Any businessmen who tries to take fundamental decisions with a political agenda must have his head read.' Instead, particularly with the Gencor deal, he has the institutional investor at the heart of his thinking, stressing two needs: he wants to compile his own portfolio (that is, not have managers of a conglomerate, such as Gencor, do it for him); and he wants to invest in shares with a predictable behaviour. 'We have to make sure that we give him counters that satisfy the need. The only thing you got out of Gencor was spread of risk' (countered by uncertainty as to where next a conglomerate might invest - anathema to the focused investor who wants to know where his money is going). Mr Daling concedes that in the early 1980s he, like many other South African executives, was overly concerned with control. The issue now, he says, is: What can we do to add value? His answer - create vibrant businesses, exposed to market forces, where management are given room to develop with definite focus. He talks like one liberated of a great burden. 'If you concentrate on control there is an end to the road. It is a finite experience. If you talk of adding value there is no end. It is like the search for quality.' Although Mr Daling says there was no Damascus experience, he does admit that Derek Keys - now finance minister - who he brought in to run Gencor in 1986, 'played a major role in forming my personal ideas about how you see the business world.' As to the Metropolitan Life deal (Sankorp is selling 10 per cent of Metlife for R140m to a new company that will not only be controlled by blacks, but which will also have effective control over Metlife) Mr Daing describes it as a 'genuine attempt to try and do something for the sake of the economy. If we're going to have a good future we have to have all the people participating in the economy. Our policyholders' money is in this country. We have to make it work. We have no choice.' He cites two reasons why people shouldn't be surprised at this initiative coming from Sanlam - first, when formed 75 years ago, Sanlam was a vehicle for economic empowerment of the Afrikaner. 'We (Mr Daling is Afrikaans) know the power of the life assurance industry to empower economically.' Second, the formation of Gencor was made possible by a similar act of corporate statesmanship from Anglo when it gave the Afrikaans community the opportunity to entrench its foothold in the mining sector. Mr Daling believes South Africa will see more unbundling and black economic empowerment initiatives 'because both are commercially sound transactions'. Although unwilling to prescribe to other conglomerates, he makes one telling point. 'In decision-making you must go to where the knowledge is. But knowledge is decentralised and in some conglomerates the decision-making power is on top, so you have a short circuit.'</p>

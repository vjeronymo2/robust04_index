			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- A top government official  expressed hope Friday [27 May] that a burgeoning campaign to  drum up support for enactment of a redistricting bill before the  next general election is held might scare the opposition away  from submitting a no-confidence motion against the  administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    The signature-gathering campaign "has made it difficult for  them to table a no-confidence motion before bills for political  reform are legislated," the official said on condition of  anonymity.    Although the Diet enacted bills in January to replace the  current multiseat electoral system in the 511-seat House of  Representatives with a mixture of 300 single-seat electorates  and proportional representation, enactment of a redistricting  bill must be in place before an election can be held under the  new system.    He said opposition moves to force the administration to call  an early election under the current multiseat system could be  scuttled by a growing intraopposition rift over the wisdom of  forcing a vote before an electoral redistricting bill is passed.    He said that as many as 42 Liberal Democratic Party  legislators and 21 Social Democratic Party [of Japan -- SDPJ]  lawmakers have signed the petition objecting to the holding of  elections before the redistricting bill.    At present, the LDP and SDPJ leaderships are studying a  strategy of submitting a no-confidence motion immediately after  the Diet passes the long-overdue fiscal 1994 state budget.    The official said that, meanwhile, the ruling coalition is  stepping up its efforts to convince the SDPJ to return to the  fold of the anti-LDP coalition.    The SDPJ stormed out of the coalition April 26 after  coalition parties abruptly announced a decision to form a new  parliamentary bloc in the lower chamber excluding the SDPJ. The  withdrawal rendered the Hata administration to a fragile  minority government.    "The time will come when we will review the current  combination of coalition parties without having it entail the  disbandment of the whole cabinet," the official said.    He said the coalition "would not be able to accomplish tax  system reforms if it remains a minority government," in apparent  reference to a controversial agenda of raising the rate of the 3  percent consumption tax.    In a related development, a leader of the Democratic  Socialist Party, a minor coalition partner, blasted the  opposition for plotting to scuttle the Hata administration  before the redistricting bill is enacted.    "The righteous political argument is that the general  election should be called after the electoral redistricting bill  is legislated," DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa said.    "If (the LDP and SDPJ leaderships) try to force the election  under the multiseat constituency system, each of the two parties  would face intraparty dissenting voices who will rap such moves  as attempts to crush political reform," he said.    Proponents of the single-seat system have argued the system  would clear up Japan's money-dominated politics, as it would  eliminate the intense competition among candidates from the same  party as seen under the current multiseat system.    Critics of the single-seat system argue, however, that it  would intensify the race among only a few candidates seeking to  grab the sole available seat, thereby tempting candidates to  wine and dine voters or raise murky funds to cuddle voters.</p>

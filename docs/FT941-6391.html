			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Rover displaces Ford at top of motor league Rover Group, whose sale to BMW of Germany is expected to be approved by British Aerospace shareholders on March 15, was the UK's biggest vehicle maker last year - a status it lost to Ford more than a decade ago. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show Rover as the biggest producer even when Ford's commercial vehicle output is included. However, the US multi-national's production exceeded Rover's by about 2,000 units if the figure for Jaguar, now a Ford subsidiary, is included. The figures, which show that UK car production reached its highest for 20 years, emerged on the day that Ford announced that short-time working had ended at its Transit van plant at Southampton and that output of Escorts from its Halewood plant was being increased. This year Ford should close the gap on Rover, whose output of cars and leisure/utility four-wheel-drive vehicles rose 7.39 per cent last year to 408,804 from 378,797 in 1992. Although Rover's output of vehicles classified as light commercial is confined to some Land Rover models and a few Maestro vans, the 19,940 it produced last year lifted its output to 426,744. This moved it well clear of the 398,858 cars and vans produced by Ford itself, although Jaguar added a further 29,587 units to Ford's tally. Rover has led Ford in car output for some time but until last year Ford's commercial vehicle output kept it ahead. Last year the commercial vehicle industry suffered its worst for output since 1948. Total car output last year continued on its rising trend, up 6.47 per cent to 1,375,524 units, the highest since 1974. This was in spite of lower output at Vauxhall and Peugeot. The main factor in the increase, apart from Rover, was higher output from Nissan's Sunderland plant and the start of production at the Toyota and Honda plants.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VAN OUTPUT DECLINES AS CARS SURGE AHEAD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      1993          1992      1993/92                                   Jan-Dec       Jan-Dec     % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           1,375,524     1,291,880        +6.47 Rover (British Aerospace)         408,804       378,797        +7.39  -cars***                         358,280       339,054        +5.67  -Range Rover/Discovery            50,524        39,743       +27.13 Ford group                        301,380       322,946        -6.68  -Ford                            271,793       302,145       -10.05  -Jaguar                           29,587        20,801       +42.24 General Motors group              273,916       319,094       -14.16  -Vauxhall                        232,589       287,884       -19.21  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)*         41,327        31,210       +32.42 Nissan                            246,281       179,009       +37.58 Peugeot                            72,902        85,821       -15.06 Toyota                             37,314             -            - Honda                              32,139         1,001            - Rolls-Royce (Vickers)               1,263         1,258        +0.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMERCIAL VEHICLES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                             193,487       248,453       -22.13 Ford                              127,085       119,234        -21.7 General Motors group               20,488        31,129       -34.19  -Vauxhall                         12,216        14,112       -13.44  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)**         8,272        17,017       -51.39 Rover (British Aerospace)          19,940        20,864        -4.43  -car-derived vans                  2,572         3,238       -20.57  -Land Rover Defender              17,368        17,828        -2.59 Leyland DAF Vans                    9,269        20,090       -53.87 Iveco-Ford (Fiat)                   5,598         6,443       -13.12 Leyland Trucks                      5,174        12,450       -48.45 ERF                                 2,284         1,904       +19.96 Dennis (Trinity Holdings)           1,370         1,282        +6.87 Seddon Atkinson (Fiat)                738         1,028       -28.72 Volvo Bus                             295           458       -35.59 Renault VI                          166           819       -79.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *   Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. **  Medium and small vans sold in Europe variously under Vauxhall,     Isuzu, GME Bedford and Suzuki names. *** Includes Honda Concerto.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

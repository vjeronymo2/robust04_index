			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Pension surpluses face probes The pensions ombudsman said yesterday that he would be willing to investigate complaints from members of occupational schemes about the way surpluses are used - one of the thorniest issues for pension schemes. Among the cases already brought before Dr Julian Farrand, the new ombudsman, is the return of a Pounds 200m surplus from the pension schemes of the former nationalised bus companies to the Department of Transport. Dr Farrand, who took up his post on September 1, said a group of six former scheme members had filed a complaint about the surplus. The previous pensions ombudsman, Mr Michael Platt, had excluded from consideration all complaints regarding the exercise of trustees' discretion, including the disposition of surpluses. He had felt he could not investigate complaints of this nature because the law was too unclear about who owned a surplus. Trust law, which governs occupational pension schemes, gives broad powers to trustees to decide benefits, and in most instances scheme members have little legal right of challenge. While several court cases  - and the operators of most occupational schemes - have suggested that surpluses belong to the employer, case law is limited and ambiguous. Dr Farrand said he would no longer refuse to consider complaints about transfer values for people who leave schemes, and other disputed actuarial calculations which are also left to trustees' discretion. The government's advisory panel on pension law reform, the Goode committee, noted that few employers took the value of discretionary benefits - those not contained in the trust deed but accorded to members as a matter of practice - into account when calculating transfer values. This has the effect of significantly reducing transfer values and deprives departing members of implicitly promised benefits, and the Goode committee had urged that the practice be changed. Dr Farrand said: 'It is often overlooked that trustees and employers have a fiduciary duty to scheme members. This may be controversial but the fact that it is controversial is no reason not to review it.' Scheme members or sponsors who are unhappy with his decision on the disposition of a surplus could appeal to the higher courts, thus establishing some UK case law on the question of ownership.

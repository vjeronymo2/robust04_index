			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's message from President Levon Ter-Petrosyan to </F> the Armenian people--live]    [Text] Dear compatriots, I do not want to hide the fact  that it is difficult to make an appropriate (?toast) to the  presidential message on the occasion of the new year.    I want to analyze the current situation without any  (?intention) of self-justification or escaping criticism.    In my yearly report to the parliament a few days ago [words  indistinct]. I think that deputies should be generally  satisfied with the (?explanations) given.    The situation in our newly independent state is very [words  indistinct]. Not only our daily tables but also the festive  tables are poor or almost empty. And we could still face new  difficulties and even graver days. Hard work [word indistinct]  will remain an inseparable part of our lives for a long time to  come.    This is the result of the state's emergence from the fall of  empires. [words indistinct] Scores of years are needed for the  creation of a secure and prosperous state. If anyone promises  you something else, do not believe him. They have fed you for a  long time with talk of miracles, but miracles happen only in  fairy tales.    At present, as a people and government we are solving one  single problem: evading the (?revival) [word indistinct] of the  Soviet Union. We must note with utmost pride that we are  successfully solving that problem. That success is evident in  Armenia's balanced foreign policy, the full governability of the  situation, and the internal stability in the Republic. The  (?collapse) of any of these three political factors is fraught  with far graver consequences than the ones generated by price  increases and the fall in the standard of living, which are  temporary phenomena that can be corrected.    Armenia's successes [words indistinct] become more  conspicuous when compared to the countries sharing the same  fate. It is an undeniable fact that not only Georgia,  Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, which were more or less at our  level, but also strong Russia could not escape internal tremors.    Armenia's success was not mere chance, but above all the  result of wisdom displayed by the people and hard work by the  state structures. Despite all the defects and shortcomings, the  state's role cannot be (?denied) in this success. While proudly  noting this fact, we must protect and deepen this valuable  success in the coming year because times are still very  dangerous and the situation is extremely (?complex).    At this moment I do not want to touch on current affairs,  such as the stabilization of industry, regulation of the  currency circulation, promotion of trade, elimination of  irregularities, economic reforms, and wage indexation. This is  not because I do not think that these problems are important,  but because it is impossible to talk about them since other more  fundamental problems are the main cause of these difficulties.    The first is the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict,  or more correctly, the establishment of peace in  Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite the success of the Karabakh  self-defense Army, the continuation of the war is fraught with  serious danger that threatens the Armenian people's security and  prosperity.    Because of the war, Armenia is being subjected to a blockade  imposed not only by Azerbaijan and Turkey but also by  international financial organizations, who are imposing open and  covert sanctions. Therefore, to talk about Armenia's economic  development and improvement in the people's living conditions is  tantamount to engaging in self-delusion or political  speculation, which is being successfully implemented by certain  opposition forces. Because the war is continuing, no  substantial improvement can be made in the Republic's economy  and the people's standard of living no matter who is in power.    The Armenian authorities' position on the Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict has been and continues to remain the same: The  peaceful settlement of the conflict and a mutually agreed upon  solution. The Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh authorities have  given a positive reply to the CSCE Minsk Group's peace plan, as  well as to the mediation initiative of the Russian Federation.  Therefore, the establishment of the peace depends not on the  Armenian side but on Azerbaijan's position and on the  coordination of the peace efforts of the international community  and Russia. I can inform you that there is movement that  inspires hope in both directions.    The second fundamental problem facing us is the adoption of  the Armenian Constitution. Its centerpiece is the legislative  guarantee of human and civil rights, the clear division of  power, and the ensurance of the unimpeded and effective  functioning of the government. At first glance this problem  looks academic, in view of the burden of numerous daily  problems, but it also has practical significance. The adoption  of the Constitution will undoubtedly discharge the atmosphere of  the political conflict and will give the opportunity to [word  indistinct] redirect our people's spiritual and intellectual  potential towards constructive and creative labor.    And, finally, the third main problem affecting our normal  course is to ensure energy independence for Armenia. Under the  conditions of the blockade, the work on this matter means  continuing to find alternate energy sources. We hope that the  drilling work to find the Republic's underground resources will  begin soon. However, the possibility of reopening the Armenian  nuclear power plant is the most concrete and realistic source of  energy. The preliminary work connected with its reopening has  already been completed and I want to inform you with pleasure  that in the opinion of experts this work is (?satisfactory).  The production of power by the nuclear plant is scheduled to  begin toward the end of next year.    That is peace, Constitution, and nuclear power plant; these  are our slogans for the new year, 1994.    Happy new year to you.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: A collector stuck in his age - The 19th-century folly of Robert Vernon is timeless Don't make the mistake of presuming that an exhibition of a collection of British art presented to the nation a century and a half ago has no relevance to the making and collecting of the art of today. Robert Vernon's gift of some 157 paintings and eight sculptures to the fledgling National Gallery in 1847 was intended to prompt the foundation of a Gallery of British Art (the national British collection opened at the Tate 50 years later). To that patriotic end, Vernon purposely sought works by the founding fathers of the British School and by his most acclaimed contemporaries. His collection, a selection of which is currently on show at the Tate Gallery, offers a number of salutary lessons. It begs the question of how best to define and represent British art as the debate continues on the future of the Tate's modern and British holdings. In his acquisition of works of art, Robert Vernon exhibited all the flair of a modern museum committee set on pleasing everyone. The collection of this 'Maecenas of Modern Art', as Vernon was dubbed at the time, shows no evidence of personal passion or real discernment (certainly Pickersgill's portrait presents him as a dour and bloodless man, and the most unlikely looking horse dealer). Instead it smacks of the shopping list. Here are the worthies from the accepted pantheon of British art - Gainsborough, Reynolds, Benjamin West and Richard Wilson  - plus the most fashionable painters of the day. The inventory reads as a grim warning of the extent to which each age inevitably fails to be its own best judge. There are four glorious works by J. M. W. Turner, an artist who was never knighted, alongside nine landscapes by Sir Augustus Wall Callcott. There are 12 paintings by the eminent figure painter and colourist William Etty, eight by Sir Edwin Landseer, five by Sir David Wilkie. Messrs Constable and Bonington are each represented by one picture while Samuel Palmer fails to find a place. Even a collection catholic enough to embrace Sir Charles Lock Eastlake's leaden 'Christ Lamenting over Jerusalem', Henry Perronet Briggs' 'The First Interview between the Spaniards and the Peruvians', Maclise's 'The Play Scene in 'Hamlet' ', one Theodore Lane's 'The Gouty Angler' and Turner's ethereal 'The Dogano', cannot claim to be encyclopaedic. There may be historical and allegorical pictures, genre scenes, landscapes and topographies, even lowly still-lifes, but Vernon displays the prejudice of his age in not deeming portraiture as the stuff of Fine Art. Such prejudice pales beside the intellectual bigotry of our own art establishment for whom Minimalism seems to reign supreme and no other means of expression is regarded seriously. A study of the condition of Vernon's collection should be as sobering for contemporary artists as for curators of 20th-century collections. There is a world of difference between, say, the near-enamel finish and pristine hues of William Mulready, a consummate technician, and the blackened surfaces of the five history paintings by William Hilton the Younger that are far too scarred and ravaged to exhibit. Some 30 years after the execution of the latter's 'Edith and the Monks Searching for the Body of Harold', once regarded as one of the gems of the Vernon collection, the artist Richard Redgrave and his brother described it as a 'seamed wreck of his genius'. The staff at the National Gallery were obliged to turn the picture from time to time so 'that the eyes and limbs may float back again from whence they had slipped'. The 18th and 19th century was a great age of technical experimentation and of secret systems and recipes allegedly passed down from the great Venetian colourists. Those, like Hilton, seduced by the prospect of succulent, mellow colour and perfectly translucent glazes ignored the warnings of the chemists and continued to use volatile and destructive materials such as bitumen and megilp. Museums are already spending vast sums conserving ill-made art less than a decade or two old. What kind of shelf-life can we expect from today's favoured media of mud and blood? It is pure arrogance to refuse to learn from history and presume that the judgments of the 20th century will remain immutable. The reputations of the likes of Hilton and Eastlake were no more over-inflated than those of today's chic avant-garde. The latter have jumped on the Establishment bandwagon with as much calculation as any 19th-century French academic painter. We may shudder at the sentiment of Landseer's 'The Cavalier's Pets', and smirk at Etty's preposterous and titillating allegory of life, 'Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm', but these follies are likely to be as nothing to the mass of the work that is now entering the Tate's modern collection in large quantity. The Vernon Gift, sponsored by Sun Life Assurance, continues at the Tate Gallery, London, until October 31.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: UB takes control of Wiltshire Brewery UB Group, India's largest brewer and distillery group, has taken management control of The Wiltshire Brewery which it plans to develop into a significant UK drinks company. Wiltshire, which brews only about 3,000 barrels a year of beers like Old Grumble and Stonehenge, has paid Pounds 6.7m to expand its estate from 40 to 77 pubs after UB's refinancing. Mr Vijay Mallya, UB chairman, will become executive chairman of Wiltshire and his family will take a 15.5 per cent interest in the group. 'It is is a unique opportunity to get into distribution of spirit and beer products in the UK,' said Mr Mallya. 'UB has long talked about the globalisation of its interests in India.' As part of the deal, Bass, the UK brewery group, takes an 8.6 per cent stake through conversion of Pounds 700,000 of debt. It has also extended what Wiltshire calls a favourable new supply agreement. The new pubs are being financed partly through a Pounds 4.77m subscription of new shares, subject to clawback for existing Wiltshire shareholders, and a share placing with Mr Mallya and UB. Of the acquired pubs, 28 come from a portfolio of foreclosed properties held by Allied Irish Bank Properties while two are being sold by Bank of Ireland Properties. Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance is advising Wiltshire. UB currently has a limited presence in the UK, distributing Kingfisher lager through a joint venture with Shepherd Neame. Wiltshire will move its brewing operations from sites in Stourbridge and Tisbury and consolidate them in a premises leased from UB group near its UK headquarters in Buckingham. Consideration for this lease is being satisfied by 1.8m shares. Mr Mallya said he plans to increase the tenanted estate to more than 100 pubs within six months. 'When UB started in India it was one brewery, today it has 10; it was one distillery and now it has 26,' said Mr Mallya. 'The focus is not just distribution, it is the development of a drinks business.' UB is India's seventh largest corporate conglomerate.</p>

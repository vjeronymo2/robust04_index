The cost of sales doubled to Pounds 16m as did distribution costs to Pounds 4.16m. Earnings per share emerged at 11.3p (16.2p) but a final dividend of 2.7p (2.5p) makes a 4.7p (4.375p) total. Group debt at year-end totalled Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 3.6m), representing 21 per cent of shareholders' funds. The shares closed 4p lower at 110p.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / A friendship splits over the way forward / A look at issues behind the Lonrho board dispute THE disagreement between Mr Tiny Rowland and Mr Dieter Bock over the appointment of non-executive directors to Lonrho is more than an arcane dispute over corporate governance. If tomorrow's board meeting gives the go-ahead to the appointments, the balance of power within the company would swing irrevocably in favour of the German financier. It would also signal a radical shake-up at the top of the company. The new directors would establish an audit committee to monitor its financial performance and take a fresh look at the remuneration of existing executive directors. Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that the board opinion is finely balanced. The allegiance of Mr Rene Leclezio, Lonrho's chairman, is not in doubt, but Mr Rowland can only be confident of retaining the continued support of enough other directors to give him a majority of one on the 12 man board. It is a far cry from the arrival of Mr Bock when he acquired his 18.8 per cent stake at the start of the year. Then the joint chief executives described themselves as 'indivisible'. Mr Bock left the delicate task of changing the board's structure until after he had completed restructuring most of the group's complicated mix of businesses. Restructuring had the enthusiastic support of Mr Rowland, who has been able to spend more time in Africa. Mr Bock was confident that Mr Rowland was ready to approve the appointment of two non-executives. But a board meeting earlier this month put off a decision under pressure from Mr Rowland who felt the full-time directors should first meet Mr Bock's proposed non-executives. If tomorrow's board meeting does not approve the appointment of Lonrho's first non-executives for two decades, Mr Bock may put the issue to shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting. He would only risk this as a last resort since it would publicly set the two men against each other. Some analysts are surprised Mr Bock did not expect opposition from Mr Rowland. The latter has been opposed to non-executives ever since the 'straight eight' directors unsuccessfully tried to remove him in 1973. However, earlier this year, he indicated his support for the 'right' candidates who would make a positive contribution to the running of the board. Then over the last few months internal politics began to give the issue a new significance. Key Lonrho directors began to shift their loyalty from Mr Rowland, who has run the group for more than 30 years, to Mr Bock. The beginnings of a split have developed on the board which broadly reflects the different working patterns of the two chief executives. Mr Bock likes to be at his desk by 8.30am. By the time he arrives for work he often finds Mr Robin Whitten and Mr Philip Tarsh, both accountants with special responsibility for finance, and Mr Nick Morrell, another director, are already in their offices. The three directors have formed a strong bond with Mr Bock. In contrast, when Mr Rowland is in London he usually arrives at the the group's Cheapside headquarters at around 10.30am. This is the preferred starting time of two of his most loyal directors: Mr Robert Dunlop and Mr Paul Spicer. Two years ago Mr Rowland promoted them to joint deputy chairman. Yet Mr Bock was still taken by surprise at Mr Rowland's decision to delay the appointment of non-executives. Mr Rowland had announced in January that he was planning to retire in three years. He also continued to say that Mr Bock's appointment as joint chief executive had solved the group's succession problem. But the 75 year-old entrepreneur has a habit of falling out with old friends. After Mr Rowland won his battle with the 'straight eight' he became friends with the Kuwaiti Sabah Brothers, Sheikhs Nasser and Hamed, who took a stake of about 26 per cent. But in 1975 they sold their shares after many of their demands, including the appointment of non-executives, had been ignored. Even Mr Mohamed Al-Fayed, who Mr Rowland never forgave for winning control of the House of Fraser, was once a friend and appointed to the Lonrho board. Mr Rowland will soon be 76, though, and may not relish the prospect of another row. Furthermore, Mr Bock remains emollient, softly-spoken, and respectful of Mr Rowland, which may lessen the chances of a feud. This is part of the reason why Mr Bock remains confident that Mr Rowland will tomorrow agree to the appointment of the two nominated non-executives. A number of Mr Rowland's close directors, however, are unlikely to urge him to agree to Mr Bock's demands. They are aware that new directors would radically change Lonrho. The non-executives plan to join the group's remuneration committee and re-evaluate directors' pay. They will also determine what to pay Mr Bock, who has not drawn a salary since becoming joint chief executive. They would almost certainly bring an end to Lonrho's practice of allowing directors to draw their pension as well as their salary when they reach 65. Mr Roland, Mr Leclezio and Mr Spicer are all understood to be drawing their pension as well as their annual salary. They will also set up the company's first audit committee. A reduction in the estimated Pounds 20m annual costs of running the headquarters is likely to be one of its first tasks. One way to achieve this would be to cut head office staff from the current 160 and to cut executive board members, currently 12, by half. Mr Rowland's closest directors are not eager to vote for the appointment of non-executives who may hasten their own departure. The outcome will depend on whether Mr Rowland is willing to cede control of the company he has dominated for three decades.</p>

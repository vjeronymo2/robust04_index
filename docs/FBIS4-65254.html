			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Sir Leon Brittan, European trade </F> commissioner, by Lucy Walker in Brussels; date not given]    [Text] The last time I met Sir Leon Brittan in his office  at the European Commission he was extolling his "favourite  village" -- Spennithorpe, in his sleepy rural constituency of  Richmond in North Yorkshire -- while simultaneously outlining  his plans to shape the then-European Community's competition  policy.    Since then, he has abandoned the intricacies of competition  policy for the international stage as the Commissioner for  external economic relations, and moved from the asbestos-ridden  Berlaymont into the Commission's new home, the Breydel building.    Sir Leon, the former British trade secretary forced to  resign  over the Westland helicopter scandal, has unquestionably made a  professional success of his five and a half years in Brussels,  and his continued enthusiasm suggests that it has been a  personal triumph as well.    Billed before his arrival as little more than the prime  minister's poodle, Sir Leon has proved his critics wrong. In  the tradition of Britons abroad, the disgraced ex-minister went  native early, surprising Commission staff and earning the ire of  Margaret Thatcher, who found her poodle's bite at least as bad  as its bark.    Sir Leon defends the goal of a single currency and is  campaigning for the inclusion of minimum social laws in  international trade agreements -- enough to leave him not only  out of step with the British government, but dancing to an  altogether different tune. However, it is his very nativeness  which has made him London's choice to succeed Jacques Delors,  who in January steps down as Commission president after ten  years.    At a time when many are alarmed by a "democratic deficit" --  and at the horse-trading over the appointment of Delors'  successor -- Sir Leon is sanguine. Sinking into a deep-red sofa  in his office overlooking the Parc Cin-quantenaire, he defends  the selection process, dismissing the notion that the president  should be directly elected. "I think that would be a complete  change in the balance of the institutions," he says.    If the European Parliament, directly elected by universal  suffrage, is the Union's democratic anchor, the Commission is  only the motor, and the Council of Ministers -- comprising  representatives of member states' governments -- is both the  brake and the throttle.    "It is precisely because the Commission is not a  democratically- elected body that others are entitled to put on  the brakes," he insists, with a hint of fatigue. Perhaps it is  the job -- he is midway through a programme taking him to  Moscow, Brussels and Kiev inside 48 hours -- or the rounds of  interviews which are tiring him.    Sir Leon would dearly love the president's job, but he faces  stiff competition from Ruud Lubbers, the former Dutch premier,  and the Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. And other  member states are nervous of a Briton in the driving seat when  Westminster has signed up to neither a European social policy  nor a future single currency.    He is anxious to play down the depth of Tory rifts,  dismissing reports that leaving the EU [European Union] for some  less- threatening free trade arrangement is an option now  favoured by a Euro-sceptic minority. "I don't think there has  been the slightest intention or desire in any serious political  body to do this," he says.    There is no official campaign for the presidency. But Sir  Leon, 54, is on the hustings, squeezing hurried interviews to  promote his first book into his already hectic schedule, and  there is no doubt that Europe: The Europe We Need, already  translated into French and soon to be published in German and  Italian, is a manifesto for Europe's most controversial job.  Sir Leon has used its 246 pages to expound his support for a  single currency, for the swift enlargement of the Union, and for  more radical plans to streamline the Commission itself, turning  the 17-member college into a cabinet- style hierarchy of senior  and junior Commissioners. This is the nearest to a public  debate that the contest for the appointment of a new president  has ever come.    The new president, whoever it is, faces two inescapable  priorities: reforming the EU's institutions to accommodate its  swelling ranks -- Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway are due to  join next year -- and laying the path for further membership to  the east and the south.    Sir Leon wants swift enlargement but warns against setting  artificial deadlines. He says there are "moral, economic and  political" reasons, for speeding the integration of six former  Soviet satellites, but insists that they should join on the same  terms as existing members. The incorporation of micro-states  such as Malta and Cyprus need not create new problems: "The  question is not do we have them in or not, but how to  accommodate them," he says.    Asking the right questions must, he says, be the priority  for  the next inter-governmental conference (IGC), due to start in  1996. The last IGC which spawned the Maastricht treaty, was not  -- as some have argued -- rushed, but it did lack direction.  Public scepticism over Maastricht could not have been avoided  simply by prolonging the process, and there is no reason why the  next IGC should not be completed by the end of 1996.    Adamant that reforms are urgently needed to accommodate an  EU  of 16 or more he reasons: "We must use the IGC to decide what  changes are needed to ensure enlargement doesn't slow down our  capacity to act." But on whether the IGC should also tackle a  wholesale reform of the Commission -- perhaps along the lines  laid down in his book -- he refuses to be drawn.    With uncharacteristic coyness, the man who would be  president  declines to even hazard whether he will be given the chance to  put his plans into practice.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The next step in housing WHEN THE chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, meets representatives of the leading building societies this afternoon, he and his ministerial colleagues will no doubt be given reassuring news about repossessions in the housing market. And there is indeed room for modest reassurance: while repossessions remain at historically high levels, the trend has unquestionably improved in the first few months of the year. Yet it could hardly have been otherwise. Since the government and the building societies agreed in December on a package of measures to help stabilise the housing market, nominal interest rates have fallen further and income support for mortgage interest has been paid direct to lenders, automatically reducing the risk that borrowers will go into default. In addition the societies have recognised the advantages of keeping overstretched mortgagors in the property. With the aid of counselling and renegotiation, otherwise shaky borrowers have been kept afloat to the benefit of both parties. What is clear at this point is that the improvement in the figures owes precious little to the attempt to encourage defaulting mortgagors to become housing association tenants in the former owner-occupied property. Those who have escaped the problems of the rented sector for the financial strains of home ownership appear singularly reluctant to rejoin the tenantry. The scheme has anyway been criticised for its legal complexity. And from the building societies' point of view the economics look unfavourable, since former owner-occupied property does not enjoy the grants that enable housing associations to charge low rents on new property. Enormous pressures That said, it is hard to see a chancellor who faces enormous pressures on public finances being prepared to contemplate the cost of equalising the financial position of these two forms of tenure. Nor does it seem likely that Mr Lamont will accede to the demands of those who would like to see his temporary relief against stamp duty extended beyond the summer. If it has failed to kick-start the market into a significantly higher level of transactions by now, its point has been lost. The question is why it has failed and what else the government should do, if anything, to help. By past standards the relationship between house prices and earnings, which was distorted during the boom of the late 1980s, is back to its long-term trend level. House prices appear affordable again. Yet buyers remain elusive. Affordable prices One explanation might be the caution-inducing persistence of high real rates of interest after a decade in which the personal sector doubled its indebtedness in relation to household income. Another could be that buyers expect prices to look even more affordable in due course. That is far from implausible if the first big fall in nominal house prices since the war causes the speculative investment premium in housing to disappear - an outcome that could be reinforced by the erosion of the real value of mortgage interest relief and the less favourable trend in household formation that is expected later in the decade. Against that background, house prices might well be expected to settle at a lower multiple of earnings than hitherto. A more tangible factor behind the low volume of transactions is that between half a million and a million buyers are reckoned to have a negative equity in their homes, whereby the mortgage exceeds the value of the house. They are stuck on the bottom rung of the housing ladder and unable to move. It is here that the housing market slump is doing economic, as well as social, damage. In the absence of a more flexible private rented sector, job mobility is reduced. Existing legislation prevents the building societies from transferring mortgages to a new property by stipulating that they cannot lend more than 100 per cent of value. Where housing equity is already negative this prudential requirement is academic. It also acts as a needless constraint on labour market flexibility. The chancellor should explore the case for a limited relaxation of the legislation to cope with this unexpected consequence of the collapse in house prices.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Compromise hope on Mideast peace Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, appeared yesterday to be preparing the way for a compromise with Israel in the deadlock over implementing the outline peace accord signed by the two sides in September. At the conclusion of a two-day visit to London, Mr Arafat expressed optimism that a solution would be found and referred to his problems with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, as 'a common misunderstanding'. The two leaders failed at their Cairo summit meeting on Sunday to make sufficient progress for Israel to begin its troop withdrawal on schedule from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Mr Arafat had earlier insisted the December 13 deadline was sacred and the negotiations were at a crisis point. Mr Nabil Shaath, who heads the PLO team in the negotiations with Israel, said yesterday Mr Arafat would meet Mr Rabin again in Cairo next Wednesday or Thursday. The PLO leader said before leaving for Dublin that he hoped the intervening period would provide sufficient for them to reach a deal 'so that we are capable of implementing the agreement very carefully and very honestly'. The main sticking point has been the PLO demand that it should control the crossing points between Gaza and Egypt and Jericho and Jordan. Mr Rabin has insisted that the declaration of principles gives Israel full responsibility for external security and this includes the border crossing points. 'We are not going to give the keys to reach Tel Aviv to anyone but Israelis,' he said yesterday. Meanwhile, nearly 200 Palestinians deported last year to southern Lebanon returned to the West Bank and Gaza yesterday. They were among the 415 expelled by Israel, amid international condemnation, for allegedly belonging to extremist Palestinian groups. On a visit to military bases in Gaza, Mr Rabin warned the returning deportees against getting involved again in action against Israel. In further violence in Gaza, Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian who tried to attack a soldier and 10 Palestinians were wounded in other clashes. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, was due in Paris yesterday to meet Mr Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), the PLO official who signed the peace agreement in Washington.</p>

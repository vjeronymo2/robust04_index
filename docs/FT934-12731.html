			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (22): Technology and green sites for sale  -Bitterfeld was synonymous with the GDR's industrial pollution. Now it is courting new investors IF AN investor is considering locating in Bitterfeld in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, it would be best to ignore the raised eyebrows and comments from those who have not seen this large 1,500 acre industrial site since unification, writes Judy Dempsey. Instead, it would be more useful to read a short novel, called Flugasche, by Monika Maron. As a young writer and journalist, Ms Maron was commissioned in 1978 to write an article extolling the virtues of socialist state planning in eastern Germany's chemical sector, which was concentrated around Bitterfeld. In those days, the only thing that glowed in the region was the flames rising out of the vast furnaces, which in turn contaminated the atmosphere and filled the air with a stench so foul that breathing was often difficult. Ms Maron did not stick to her editor's brief. Horrified at what she saw, she chose to tell the truth about Bitterfeld: the hazards; the working conditions; the way eastern Germany's chemical sector was managed. She paid the price. Three years later she had to leave for west Germany. More than a decade later, the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry, embarked on an ambitious programme aimed at turning Bitterfeld into a site for tomorrow's high technology entrepreneurs. The enormity of the challenge is obvious when set against Ms Maron's novel. The question is whether the agency will achieve its ambitious goal. The agency inherited an extraordinary complex of chemical industries which produced more than 3,000 different items ranging from chlorine, potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide, to magnesium-aluminium alloy. It also inherited a workforce of 29,000. In 1988, Bitterfeld's annual turnover was about 4bn Ostmarks. The sales were targeted on eastern Germany's large manufacturing sector, as well as exports to eastern Europe. But monetary union, and the collapse of Comecon, the socialist trading bloc, quickly exposed Bitterfeld's uncompetitiveness. By 1991, the workforce had been cut to 11,000, and turnover had fallen to DM490m. By the end of this year, the labour force will have been further reduced to 2,300, turnover will have dipped to DM300m, and losses will total DM80m. In order to make Bitterfeld attractive for investors, the Treuhand decided not to sell the sector as one big block. Instead, as Mr Dieter Ambros, head of Chemie AG, the Treuhand-backed holding company for this sector, explains: 'We decided to put up different parts for sale'. This meant first breaking up the giant Kombinate, or original company, into 135 units, and then preparing each one for privatisation by introducing an accounting system, hiring managers to run them, and restructuring them. So far, the Treuhand has privatised 45 per cent of Bitterfeld's assets, which total DM2bn. In addition, it has attracted DM2bn in private investment. Above all, it has managed to bring to the region some of western Germany's leading chemical and pharmaceuticals, including Bayer, and Heraeus Quarzglas. The latter is the first plant in Europe which will produce synthetic quartz glass for semi-conductors, and for the optical fibre industry. The 64-year-old Mr Ambros, a former manager of BASF, who came out of retirement because he believed he could use his skills to modernise the eastern German economy, has used every possible contact to bring investors to Bitterfeld. 'Those who invest bring other people,' he says. But there is still the nagging question as to why investors should come to Bitterfeld, particularly when they can go to eastern Europe or remain in west Germany. Mr Klaus Schucht, a member of the Treuhand's board, who is responsible for eastern Germany's entire chemical and mining sector, sums it up. 'We want to turn Bitterfeld into a modern industrial parkand we want to make the region competitive.' To achieve this aim, the agency has adopted a four-pronged strategy: modernising the infrastructure, maintaining a high level of incentives, introducing a mix of industry, and minimising red tape. Along with the costs of restructuring the chemical industry, the Treuhand has allocated about DM11bn in cleaning up the site, installing new waste water treatment plants, and a solid toxic waste disposal recycling centre spread across 175 acres. 'A modern infrastructure is the key to attracting investments,' says Mr Ambros. He adds that Bitterfeld now includes, besides some of the most modern recycling and waste disposal units, its own digital telephone and satellite network. In other words, the fact that the region has had to be completely restructured has meant that it is now equipped with some of the most modern infrastructure. The Treuhand has also put in place crucial investment grants. These include 8 per cent bonuses for procurement and production of new, depreciating moveable real assets; subsidies up to 23 per cent for commercial enterprises; and special depreciation allowances of about 50 per cent for procurement and production of immovable assets, expansion, and subsequent construction works. In short, an investor can write off 45 per cent of costs through tax relief, investment allowances and subsidies. Diversification is also important. As Mr Ambros argues: 'We are working towards establishing here a mix of industry: a third concentrated on chemicals, a third chemicals-related, and a third on other business, such as services.' But products produced at Bitterfeld need markets. At a time of world-wide recession in the chemicals industry, and a recession in west Germany, surely the idea of expanding to or locating in this potential industry park is fanciful. 'In Germany, the problem is a structural one. The Germans are God-damn lazy. They have the shortest working hours and the longest holidays. We do not intend to repeat those traits at Bitterfeld,' says Mr Ambros. In contrast, he cites the administration at Chemie which, with local councils, has cut through bureaucracy, red tape and endless delays in planning, a common feature in west Germany. Chemie will continue to privatise local services, such as heating and maintenance. The Chemie head concedes that investors can go across the border to eastern Europe. 'But what we offer is very high technology. Greenfield sites here will be turned into the most efficient and modern in Germany,' he says. 'You have to remember that there is a century-old tradition of chemists in this region.' (IG Farben, dissolved after the war because of its mass use of slave labour to aid Hitler's war effort, was based at Bitterfeld.) Mr Ambros reckons his work will end by the middle of next year. By then, a new holding company structure will have been created, giving managers of the privatised companies membership on the board. He hopes to privatise most of the remaining services, which will have the effect of reducing the current DM80m losses. But the Treuhand's work at Bitterfeld is not yet over. About 15 per cent of the site has still to be privatised. The agency might have to liquidate those enterprises which have little chance of survival, thus pushing up the unemployment rate, or else subsidise them for some time yet. In the meantime, Mr Ambros remains confident that Bitterfeld can slowly attract investment and expertise. 'We expect to have 3,200 new jobs by the end of 1995 once some of the large plants are up and running,' he says.</p>

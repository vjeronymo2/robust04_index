			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian parliamentary delegation, led by  Parliament Speaker Ceslovas Jursenas, left Damascus this morning  at the end of a visit to Syria that lasted for several days. He  was seen off at Damascus International Airport by People's  Assembly Speaker 'Abd-al-Qadir Qaddurah, and a number of ranking  people's Assembly officials.    Before departure, Jursenas made a statement to a SANA  correspondent in which he expressed pleasure at meeting with  President Hafiz al-Asad.    He added: As we leave Damascus, we take with us a good  impression. We understand the positions and nature of Syria's  policy more than before, especially those dealing with the peace  process. We support Resolution 242, and stress that Israel  should withdraw from the occupied Arab territories.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: New market growth boosts Oriflame Strong growth in new markets has helped Oriflame International, the door-to-door cosmetics group, to lift interim profits by 17 per cent in spite of a slight decline in sales. Pre-tax profits for the six months to end September rose from Pounds 5.39m to Pounds 6.3m on turnover of Pounds 40.5m (Pounds 40.9m). Direct sales, through more than 70,000 operatives, accounted for Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 24.7m) of total sales. Shares in the group rose 12p to close at 269p. Mr Robert af Jochnik, chairman, attributed the growth in profit to higher sales in Finland, Chile, Mexico and Portugal. He sees further growth in Spain and Portugal, and regards Latin America as the market most likely to expand rapidly, with Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela targetted for next year. 'The toughest markets in direct selling are in western Europe and the US, where retailing is so developed,' he said. 'It is different in the emerging markets, where people are looking for earning opportunities and retailing is not developed.' The group is also hoping to move into the Indian and Chinese markets. 'We are confident of being in one or both of these markets in the next couple of years,' said Mr af Jochnik. The fall in total sales reflected the suspension of loss-making operations in France and Germany; restructuring in the UK and US; a switch from finished to bulk sales to the eastern Europe operation, which opens a new factory in Poland next summer; and a drop in mail order sales to Sweden. The pre-tax figure was struck after Pounds 446,000 (Pounds 432,000) in interest and foreign exchange gains and losses. The group, which hedges currencies on the futures markets, ended the period with gearing down from 27 per cent to 19 per cent. Earnings per share were 9.7p (8.4p), and the interim dividend is raised from 4.3p to 4.6p.</p>

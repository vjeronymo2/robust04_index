			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and visiting French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe have held talks today on bilateral  relations, and international and regional issues.    Qian said the two prime ministers held very good talks  Thursday [7 April] and had reached an extensive agreement on  many issues while Juppe described the talks as very positive and  constructive, saying the French side was satisfied with the  results.    The two foregin ministers agreed that China and France have  cooperated very well on the question of Cambodia and both have  made contributions to the settlement of the issue. Such  cooperation should continue, Juppe said.    Qian noted that the United Nations' actions were successful  in Cambodia where a new government has been formed. He pointed  out that the Cambodian issue has now been settled as an  international issue, therefore the domestic issues are internal  affairs of Cambodia and those issues should be settled by the  Cambodian people themselves. Juppe shared Qian's view.    Qian reaffirmed China's continuing support to King Sihanouk  as the leader of Cambodia.    Briefing Qian on the latest development in the Bosnia and  Herzegovina region, Juppe said a new situation has emerged in  Sarajevo where the residents have begun to live a normal life.    However, there is still a long way to go before the final  settlement of the problems, and an overall view is needed by all  the parties concerned, Juppe said. Qian hoped that the efforts  for a settlement of the Bosnia and Herzegovina question make new  progress through negotiations.    Qian briefed Juppe on China's position on the question of  Hong Kong.</p>

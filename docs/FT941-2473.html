			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Campaign launched for injured tunnel workers A campaign to win compensation for former tunnel workers suffering from a crippling bone-wasting disease caused by incorrect decompression procedures will be launched today by the GMB general union. The GMB in the northern region believes that thousands of workers employed on big tunnelling projects in the area since the early 1960s may be suffering from osteonecrosis. The campaign was triggered by advice staff at the Wallsend People's Centre, part of the TUC's network for the unemployed, who noticed many men with knee and shoulder problems. About 100 men in north-east England have now forward but the GMB believes that many more suffering stiff, painful joints as their bones crumble may be victims of incorrect decompression. A number of those identified worked in the 1960s on the Tyne tunnel, in which compressed air was used to keep water out of working areas. The length of time allocated to decompression was crucial to avoid the formation of bubbles in the body. The union is also investigating more recent projects, including the Tyne and Wear Metro. One of the GMB's test cases is Mr John Hedley of Wallsend, a 57-year-old steel erector on the Tyne tunnel in 1964. Mr Hedley, now on invalidity benefit, said: 'Some of the chaps are crippled. It's attacking the knee joints in my case.' Edmund Nuttall, the main tunnelling contractor on the Tyne tunnel, said; 'The matter is in the hands of our insurers.' Last month a miner now suffering bone necrosis who worked in the mid-1970s on construction of the Dartford road tunnel won almost Pounds 200,000 in an out-of-court settlement. The GMB's campaign will be drawing on personnel records compiled during a 20-year Newcastle University research project on tunnellers' health, started in the late 1940s. Professor Joe Pooley, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, has agreed to provide free screening for potential victims. The GMB has engaged Brian Thompson and Partners, solicitors specialising in personal and industrial injury cases, to prepare compensation claims.</p>

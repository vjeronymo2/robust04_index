			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Asylum bill hits new legal pressure LORD TAYLOR of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, last night added to the pressure on the government to drop its proposals for removing the right of would-be visitors to Britain to appeal to the courts if refused entry, Ivor Owen writes. His strong opposition was revealed by Lord Woolf, another law lord, during the second reading debate on the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill in the House of Lords. Lord Woolf explained that Lord Taylor, who was unable to attend the debate, had authorised him to express his concern over the 'draconian' removal of the right of appeal. Lord Woolf said 'His view is the same as mine - that an inevitable consequence of the present proposals if they are enacted is that they will lead to a substantial increase in the number of applications for judicial review'. Claims made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, that removal of the right of appeal from would-be visitors would enable cases concerning those seeking permanent settlement to be dealt with more quickly and efficiently were disputed by Lord Donaldson, the former master of the rolls.</p>

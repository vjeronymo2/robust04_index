In another development, U.S. President Bill Clinton last  night said that he discussed with the head of the Syrian regime  the possibility of dispatching U.S. troops to the Golan Heights  in a peace-keeping mission, as he claimed.    In statements to journalists on board the presidential plane  that took him back to Washington following a meeting with Hafiz  al-Asad in Geneva, Clinton said that al-Asad stressed the need  for mutual assurances in the peace process, and that the Syrian  president has clearly committed himself, during the talks, to  establishing amity with the Zionist entity.    A Zionist source said that Dennis Ross, coordinator of the  peace process, last night briefed Zionist Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin on the two presidents' talks in Geneva. The U.S.  President also held a telephone conversation with the Zionist  prime minister to brief him on the results of his meeting with  the head of the Syrian regime. Clinton has also held a telephone  conversation with the head of the Egyptian regime, Husni  Mubarak, and agreed with him to continue consultations on the  settlement process.</p>

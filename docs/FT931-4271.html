			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (15): How to save time, effort and money - EDI is a simple idea with big business implications / Analysis ELECTRONIC data interchange (EDI) is a simple idea which both users and service suppliers see as a direct path to the goals of just-in-time trading and business re-organisation. On the surface it is simply the exchange of routine business documents such as orders, acknowledgements and invoices between computers run by suppliers and their customers. This itself is enough of a justification for companies to move into EDI, as the case studies in the following pages show. It has been estimated that 50-70 per cent of all computer output becomes computer input. Without EDI, information is keyed into one computer, printed as an order, posted to a supplier and keyed in again. And this process is repeated down the supply chain. At each stage there are delays as documents go through the post, get passed between departments and are keyed in. The greater the human involvement, the greater the risk of error: research shows that 15 per cent of the value of invoices raised in the UK is lost because of errors or misplaced documents. EDI can remove all human involvement and transfer documents in seconds. Tesco has automated its business chain to such an extent that orders, invoices and payments are all triggered off by shoppers passing through supermarket check-outs - and there is no other human involvement at all in the entire chain. There are clear benefits here from the elimination of paperwork. In addition, the huge cuts in the time between identifying a need for more stocks and getting an order processed and delivered have paved the way for just-in-time ordering and manufacturing. This, in turn, is leading the EDI pioneers into closer partnerships with their suppliers, in some cases invoicing themselves for goods received and providing information such as sales forecasts. At the same time, EDI is adding an extra dimension to price negotiations, with customers arguing for bigger discounts because their suppliers are saving money with EDI and getting prompt payment through EDI banking services. 'EDI presents the opportunity to modify the relationship between business partners which recognise their mutual dependence and endeavour to build on it together for greater success,' says EDI consultant Mr Jon Sasserath of computing services group CMG. As with the early days of the fax machine (and, indeed, the telephone), the extent to which the benefits outweigh the costs depends on the number of partners that a company can trade with electronically. EDI is used by only around five per cent of companies in the UK, which is far ahead of all other European countries. This issue is summed up by Mr Martyn Daniels, systems strategy controller at the B&amp;Q DIY chain and chairman of the user group for the Tradanet EDI service: 'We don't want to have to run two finance departments and two logistics departments, one manual and the other electronic.' This understandable attitude has led to accusations that big companies have pushed their suppliers into EDI with threats of cutting off their business. Two medium-sized suppliers to big groups, interviewed for this survey, both used almost exactly the same words when asked about justifying the costs - 'we didn't need a cost-justification, because the cost of not going EDI would have been no more business.' However, these and all the other companies interviewed were well-satisfied with EDI and looking to expand their use, both in their relationships with their major customers and in trading with their own suppliers. Mr David Andrews, head of the Andersen Consulting's Financial Services Division, looks at the influence of the big companies from another angle. He argues that each big trading community needs a controlling body or sponsor. Without it, there is a danger that the EDI service company can be in charge, locking trading partners in, he says. David Andrews points to cases such as that of Tesco, where a big customer leads the development and helps its smaller trading partners, and to other areas where rival companies have got together to set up a trading community through a single EDI service supplier which they monitor through a management committee (there are examples of such communities in the following pages). All the companies interviewed by Soft ware At Work found the move into EDI was fairly straightforward technically. Service suppliers, software companies and even the big EDI trading partners offer software packages which handle links into the different services and the conversion of data from business systems into the correct message format standards. Users seem unconcerned about the fact that different industries and groups of users follow different standards. There is a general gradual move to the international Edifact standard but the various EDI services already provide conversion from one standard to another if required, so users see themselves little affected. As Jon Sasserath at CMG puts it: 'Implementing the technology is a piece of cake, especially when compared with defining, planning and implementing the strategic business move that EDI should represent.' David Andrews at Andersen Consulting agrees: 'Businesses need to aim for a more efficient processes, a whole step change. This goes well beyond EDI, which is not a solution but a very important tool.' And Mr Sasserath concludes: 'EDI is the way forward. The future prosperity, even survival, of a business may depend on implementing it successfully. EDI may be inflicted on companies or it may be a mutual decision. But the old adage still applies: there will be those who make it happen, those who let it happen - and those who wondered what the hell happened.'</p>

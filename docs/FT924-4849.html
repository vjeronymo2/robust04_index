			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Cork Gully case disclosure TWO PARTNERS from Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, gave 'inadequate' information to the court considering their application to be appointed administrators to Polly Peck International, the fruit-to-electronics group, their professional body said yesterday. Mr Michael Jordan, head of Cork Gully, and Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance, were both found guilty of misconduct on two grounds by the professional conduct committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. They sought and accepted appointment as administrators while failing without good reason to follow their professional ethics guidance, and when they should have known there was, or appeared, to be a conflict of interest between the firm, Polly Peck and Mr Asil Nadir, its chairman. The charges came in the details of proceedings of the committee, made public yesterday, a month after the two men were each fined Pounds 1,000 and asked to pay Pounds 1,000 in costs. The committee said the men offered no satisfactory explanation for the inadequacy of information they provided to the court on October 25 1990. Had they made proper inquiries, the fact they had a 'clear continuing professional relationship' would have been clear, it said. It also emerged that the statement issued yesterday was shown to Coopers before it was released, and that alterations were made as a result. Two footnotes to the judgment were removed - one which reproduced an extract from the professional code of conduct, and another stating the maximum fine which could be imposed at the time of the hearing was Pounds 1,000 per person. Mr Douglas Llambias, a council member of the Institute and its disciplinary committee, said yesterday's statement should have been released at the time of the original findings against the two men.</p>

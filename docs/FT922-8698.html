			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Elswick edges ahead to Pounds 2.25m ELSWICK, which is focusing on print and packaging after divesting from bicycles, slightly improved pre-tax profit last year, but was unable to pay a final dividend because of below-the-line losses. The pre-tax figure went up to Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 2.22m) on sales of Pounds 59.9m (Pounds 58.2m) in the year to January 31. A small decline in operating profit to Pounds 3.29m (Pounds 3.4m) was offset by reduced interest payments of Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 1.17m). In December the group sold Falcon Cycles, ending more than 100 years of involvement in the bicycle industry. Operating losses as well as the deficit on the disposal were included in extraordinary charges. The Pounds 3.66m total also took in the cost of closing a US domestic lawnmower business. After a Pounds 2.15m drain on reserves, the group was left with a deficit on its profit and loss account, preventing a final dividend from being paid. Mr Bill Cross, chairman, said this was a 'technical glitch'. The share premium account would be used to eliminate the deficit and dividend payments should resume with this year's interim. The core print and packaging division, involving self-adhesive labels, garment labels and foil, made an operating profit of Pounds 2.64m (Pounds 2.61m) on sales of Pounds 26m (Pounds 24.3m). Mr David Cross, chief executive and son of the chairman, said about Pounds 16.5m had been spent between 1987 and 1990 on acquisitions to establish the division. Capital spending amounted to more than Pounds 13m in the past five years and a further Pounds 2.8m was scheduled for this year. The equipment and services division saw profit fall to Pounds 644,000 (Pounds 1.01m) on sales of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 23.9m). The benefits of cost-cutting and reorganisation should begin to flow through next year, he said. The businesses were being run as 'cash cows' and would eventually be sold. Bank borrowings fell from Pounds 4.96m to Pounds 518,000 with the help of the disposal and cuts in working capital. However, counting about Pounds 4.5m of loan notes, year-end gearing stood at 77 per cent on shareholders' funds of Pounds 6.54m (Pounds 8.8m). Diluted earnings per share fell to 0.98p (1.02p). Omission of the final dividend leaves shareholders with just 0.22p (0.6p) for the year. COMMENT While there might be some investor annoyance at the failure to pay a final dividend, welcome by-products are a Pounds 1m saving and a lower base from which to rebuild cover. Last year should also have been a low point for pre-tax profit, with benefits to come from the expansion of print and packaging, margin improvement in equipment and services and lower interest costs. A rising tax charge should be the only drag on earnings. The turnround story has been rather drawn out since the present management came to the rescue in 1985. With bicycles no longer putting a spoke in the wheel, the ultimate proof of the strategy will be the delivery of significant profit increases from print and packaging. A forecast pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.8m gives a prospective p/e of nearly 11 on yesterday's close of 10 1/2 p, not expensive for the sector.</p>

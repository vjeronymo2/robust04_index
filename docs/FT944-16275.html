			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Plea for a new Atlantic alliance Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, yesterday called for a new 'Atlantic Community' to intensify co-operation between the nations of the European Union and North America, Peter Norman writes. He said the community, which 'need imply no new diminution of sovereignty nor loss of independence' would promote common interests such as free trade and democracy and tackle common problems such as terrorism, international crime and militant Islamic fundamentalism. He proposed the cross-posting of civil servants between national administrations to achieve 'the broadest input to problem solving' and to build 'a network of administrative trust and informal communications' to cement the community. The Atlantic Community would rest on four pillars: defence and security as represented by the Nato alliance; belief in the rule of law and democracy; liberal capitalism and free trade; and the 'shared European cultural heritage' of North American and the European Union. Mr Rifkind said: 'The European Union, Nato, the US and Canada are all the product of many centuries of European progress and civilisation. An Atlantic Community would be a historic and appropriate initiative as we approach a new century and the third millennium.' Mr Rifkind told a meeting of the Tory Reform Group that the community should facilitate 'the intimate co-operation, consultation and co-ordination necessary to protect the common interests' of its members.</p>

A news conference was held after the founding  assembly. Jasminka Bogdanic reports:    [Bogdanic] At the news conference, Stjepan Mesic, chairman  of  the Croatian Independent Democrats, explained the reasons for  forming this new party on the Croatian political scene and  presented its guidelines.    [Begin Mesic recording] What we want to achieve by forming  this party is for a law-governed state to function, for Croatia  to join Europe's processes of integration, for our system to  become compatible as soon as possible with developed European  democratic systems and, finally, to correct what has been wrong  in policy, which is the attitude toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now  there are attempts to block the implementation of the Washington  agreement. We want that agreement to be honored and  Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain a single country. [end recording]    [Bogdanic] Stjepan Mesic said that with respect to foreign  policy, the HND will contact and cooperate with all European  parties which have the word democratic in their names.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Smith seeks air strikes on Serbs MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, last night responded to growing public alarm over Bosnia by backing for the first time 'punitive' United Nations air strikes against Serb supply and communication lines, Ralph Atkins writes. He said an ultimatum should be issued to Serb forces in Bosnia threatening that unless they agree to an immediate ceasefire 'the UN will begin air strikes. . . consistent with the proposals being made by Lord Owen, the EC peace envoy'. His remarks broke the near-consensus between the Labour and Conservative front benches that has prevailed so far. Mr Smith also called for an immediate UN Security Council meeting to intensify economic and military sanctions. His decision to step up Labour's demands reflects pressure within the party for a more aggressive stance. Two frontbench spokesmen yesterday urged sending ground troops to Bosnia - an escalation of UN involvement greater than Mr Smith has envisaged. Mr Keith Vaz, local government spokesman, and Mr Tony Banks, spokesman on London, said troops should be sent to enforce peace. Separately 17 Labour MPs issued a letter calling for 'the active engagement of troops on the ground' if required.</p>

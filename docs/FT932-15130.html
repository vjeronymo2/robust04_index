			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Sea 'could provide 20% of energy': Experimental tidal power station to be developed TIDEMILLS to harness fast-flowing sea currents around the coast could supply almost one fifth of the UK's electricity needs, says a report commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry. The report, by a group led by Engineering and Power Development Consultants, a subsidiary of Balfour Beatty, the civil engineering group, says the main potential for 'tidal stream energy' lies in the Pentland Firth, between the Scottish mainland and Orkney - where tidal currents can run at up to 12mph - and around the Channel Islands. The Pentland Firth alone could supply three times as much electricity as hydro-electric power stations, at present Britain's biggest source of renewable energy, with 1,000MW of installed capacity. Other areas with significant potential include the Bristol Channel and parts of the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland, together with smaller sites off Port-land Bill in Dorset and off Scotland's west coast. The report recommends the use of proven technology, mainly derived from offshore engineering and windpower expertise. It envisages arrays of 'tide mills' using underwater propellers with diameters of 20 metres. These would either be fixed towers tied to the seabed, dropped from sea surface floats or suspended in mid-water below wave level, using a small-scale adaptation of the technology used in 'tension-leg' oil platforms. The authors are cautious about costs, stressing that these are tentative as no tide-mills yet exist. However, they believe that some of the best Pentland Firth sites could produce power at under 10p per kilowatt. Mr Peter Fraenkel, one of the authors, says experience of other renewable energy research suggests that costs could be cut to half or less of estimates once tidemill generating sets were mass-produced. This summer his 12-strong company, IT Power, will co-operate with Scottish Nuclear and NEL - formerly the National Engineering Laboratory of East Kilbride, near Glasgow - in installing the world's first sea-current power station on an experimental basis in the Corran Narrows in Loch Linnhe, near Fort William. The 10KW unit is regarded as 'a proof of concept' experiment costing just under Pounds 200,000. Mr Fraenkel said power from sea currents was '100 per cent predictable, making it far more reliable than electricity wind energy farms or wave power sites, which produce nothing when the air or sea is calm'. The study was carried out for the DTI by Engineering and Power Development Consultants, with civil engineering consultants Binnie and Partners and builders Sir Robert McAlpine as part of the Renewable Energy Research and Development Programme managed by the Energy Technology Support Unit.</p>

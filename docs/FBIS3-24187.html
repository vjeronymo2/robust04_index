			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by V. Maltseva under the rubric "Press Conference": </F> "Siberian Agreement: Concept of the Region's Development"]    [Text] Vladimir Ivankov, general director of the  Siberian Agreement interregional association's executive board,  held a press conference on the results of the association  council meeting that took place in Moscow.    This was not the first time Moscow was selected as the place  for a "large gathering" for reasons of convenience: This time  heads of oblast administrations--association members--came to  the capital for an expanded session of the government. It is  also important that, as a rule, high-ranking statesmen take part  in Moscow conferences of Siberian Agreement: On 4 March it was  Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. In his address he spoke  against raising electric and transportation rates, which was  supported by Siberians. The deputy prime minister detailed his  trip to Norway, where he was familiarized with the practical  side of taxation. The tax policy of our northern neighbors is  aimed at supporting their own producers, and this, of course, is  the main lesson for our legislators, through whose efforts  domestic industry continues to remain in a difficult situation.    Representatives of Siberian territories who spoke at the  council asked the government rather pointed questions. Their  meaning was that along with delegating to Siberian regions  responsibility for conducting reform, rights should be delegated  that would make it possible to proceed more effectively with  this process. So far there is not even a government concept of  economic reform in the Siberian region. Speaking of the  interdependence between the European part of Russia and its  eastern territories, in this respect the scales are revealingly  tilted. Siberia needs only one-tenth of the electric power  produced here, one-hundredth of the aluminum, and does not need  as much oil, gas, and coal... But if Siberia works for Russia as  a whole, there should be a corresponding attitude toward it. So  far, however, no such line is seen in economic policy.    An example is the allocation of credit to back up  agricultural campaigns. Novosibirsk Oblast currently can cover  only one-third of its countryside's needs for fuel and  lubricants. Keeping in mind that only one-third of the needed  fallow land area has been plowed, one may assume that spring  plowing will "eat up" the fuel quite fast. The outcome is well  known: You reap what you sow. It appears that it will again be  cheaper to buy Canadian grain than to grow our own...    A score of current problems were discussed at the Siberian  Agreement council, regarding which decisions were made,  agreements signed, and so on.    One of the main items was the document "On the Socioeconomic  Development of Siberian Regions and the Course of Economic  Reforms," which was adopted after the discussion following the  report by the association council chairman, V. Zubov, "Siberia  and Economic Reform: Concept of a Development Strategy."    This decision states the need to prepare documents  corresponding to the strategic goals of Siberia's development.  The first line in this list is "On Principles of Siberian  Regional Policy."    Although it was said both at the meeting and in the back  rooms and at the press conference that Moscow cannot survive  without Siberia, Siberian Agreement intends through its  activities to prove not so much this idea as a more fruitful  one--that of restoring the eastern territories through joint  efforts, protecting them from demographic expansion on the part  of contiguous states. This danger is quite real: Siberians are  dying out or moving away, and population centers are being  filled with new residents; in some places, for instance, there  are twice as many Chinese as there are Russians.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fu Jian: "New Assessments Aim To Raze Inefficiency"] </F>   [Text] The government plans a national system to ensure  investments are being used efficiently. Vice-Minister of  Finance Jin Renqing said this will help ensure the quality and  efficiency of new State-invested projects.    Evaluations have been conducted for several years in China,  but it is time to make the process more scientific and  authoritative. We should establish a standardized system," said  Jiang Weixin, vice-director of the Major Construction Department  of the State Planning Commission (SPC).    Hao Jun, managing director of China International  Engineering  Consulting Corporation, which is China's leading group  conducting the evaluations, said such projects have been  partially checked for years but no comprehensive monitoring was  done until the mid-1980's.    During the previous 45 years trillions of yuan was invested  in capital improvements by the government.    But without an effective evaluation system in place to  examine the wisdom of the investments, the system was  susceptible to abuse.    Under the leadership of the State Planning Commission, China  International Engineering started examining major projects  involving government outlays in 1988.    In 1990, regulations for conducting the evaluations were  stipulated by the State Council for trial implementation,  according to vice-director Jiang. So far, 33 projects involving  45.6 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) of investments have been  examined by the consulting corporation.    These include 24 major construction projects and nine that  involve foreign investments.    Most of the projects involve raw materials, energy, power,  and transportation; other projects are in agriculture,  broadcasting, and education.    Loans have been extended by the World Bank and foreign  governments to help complete these assessments.    Usually, the assessment follows an interim period after the  project has been started; sometimes its done after construction  is completed.    The assessments cover such things as:    --Whether a project has been correctly decided.    --Whether the design, construction and production of the  projects emulated past successes and avoided past failures.    --Whether the efficiency of the project was enhanced by  using  figures to evaluate if the project would be of use and how long  it would take to recoup the investment.    -Whether the project has been useful to the nation. For  example, has it protected the environment or raised employment?    To do the assessments, data received from the projects are  compared with data from previously designed projects. Through  the comparison, the success or failure of a project can be  evaluated. A work unit of professionals is assigned to check  the accuracy of data supplied by a construction firm.    About 95 per cent of the projects surveyed by the consulting  corporation have proved to be efficient and have achieved  planned levels of productivity, according to Xia Tongqing, chief  engineer of the corporation.    Only one project, said Xia, was found to be seriously flawed  and causing irretrievable loses.    Problems such as exceeding the budget during construction,  inability to predict fluctuation of interest and foreign  exchange rates, and lack of co-ordination among related projects  have been revealed through the evaluations.    The appraisals are sent to those who had endorsed and  constructed the projects so they can examine whether their  decisions were correct. They then can make adjustments on the  remainder of the project.    In 1994 assessments will be conducted on more than 10  additional projects designated by the SPC and the State Economy  and Trade Commission.    Besides the SPC, other organizations such as the Ministry of  Agriculture, Ministry of Communications, the People's  Construction Bank of China and provinces such as Heilongjiang,  Liaoning, Gansu, and Yunnan have also conducted assessments of  their own projects.    The State Auditing Administration also assesses projects  each  year. But such assessments usually cover only a few aspects.    "A unified and standardized system is needed to make the  evaluations more comprehensive and scientific," said Hao.    As the government reforms the investment system to adjust to  a market economy, it has focused its attention on improving the  effectiveness of the government's investments.    "Advanced practices of project assessment in the world,  which  have developed since the middle 1970s, can be used as  references,!' said Xia.    Developed countries and international organizations such as  Britain, Australia, and the World Bank, have aided China in its  research.    The World Bank has just announced that it will donate  $400,000 as the first step in helping China establish the  assessment systems.    According to the World Bank, an efficient system needs close  ties with government plans, publicity, and serviceability.    For the Chinese system, specific organizations should be  established nationwide firstly. Then a series of methods will  be developed in accordance with the real situation of China and  a number of specific staff workers will be trained.    An outline for the system is to be decided by the State  Council and measures suited to the Chinese situation are still  to be developed. But the result will surely be the creation of  a unified, independent organization to survey projects,  according to Vice Minister Jin.</p>

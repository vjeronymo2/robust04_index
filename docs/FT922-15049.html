			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Letter: Labour tax plans will drag down south-east Sir, In assessing the alternative economic policies of the main political parties, their differential regional impact must not be overlooked. In particular, there are serious risks inherent in Labour's shadow budget because of the potential damage to the UK's most important economic region of south-east England. Average earnings for non-manual male workers in the south-east were Pounds 22,100 pa in 1991. This is the level at which Labour's income tax and National Insurance increases would start to bite. In Greater London, more than 10 per cent of the white collar male workforce earn over Pounds 40,000 pa and would face the top tax rate of 50 per cent (plus 9 per cent NI contributions). Average earnings in London and the home counties are higher elsewhere in Britain, but so too is the cost of living, especially housing. We saw in 1989-90 the crippling effect of high interest rates on heavily mortgaged households in the south-east. With the Institute of Fiscal Studies predicting that one-quarter of London's households would be worse off (in many cases, significantly so) under Labour's tax plans, the risk to consumer and housing markets is clear. The real 'double whammy' for the south-east would be if Labour's fiscal shock for higher earners were combined with higher interest rates needed to support sterling in the ERM. In the early 1980s the south-east led the economy out of recession. This time the region was hit first and hardest in the downturn, dragging the rest of the economy down with it. If Labour's new tax regime weakens south-east consumer and housing markets further, this could hold back national recovery.

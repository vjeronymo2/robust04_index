			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Senate yesterday approved a  bill on constitutional reform that will be confirmed by popular  decision on 28 August. The possibility of voting for one  candidate nationally and for another candidate departmentally  (multiparty vote system) and several provisions on departmental  governments are prominent among the constitutional reform  innovations.    Even though the Senate vote was unanimous, it is not clear  that all parties will campaign for the "Yes" ballot. At least  two parties will not campaign for it. The Broad Front has yet to  decide on this issue and the Batlleist Forum representatives  pointed out that it does not support the multiparty vote system,  but it does support advancing the plebiscite's date.    There were bitter arguments between the Battleism List 15  faction and the Battleist Forum, which at times jeopardized the  atmosphere of political agreement that surrounded the debate and  vote on the constitutional reform bill.

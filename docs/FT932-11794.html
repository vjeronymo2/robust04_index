			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / De Klerk signals apology for apartheid SOUTH AFRICAN President F W de Klerk, in twin gestures of conciliation, yesterday apologised for his National party's imposition of apartheid and said African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela had presidential qualities, Reuter reports from Cape Town. Mr De Klerk said in an opening statement at a news conference unveiling the party's new colours he 'deeply regretted' that apartheid had deprived blacks of their dignity and potential to develop. Pressed to say whether this amounted to an apology, which he had so far refused to give, he said: 'Yes, we say we are sorry.' Mr de Klerk unveiled a new blue, white and green flag showing a yellow sun in place of the powderhorn that has been the party's symbol since it came to power in 1948. Earlier, Mr de Klerk said in an interview with CNN television that Mr Mandela, his main political rival, had presidential qualities. 'I think Mr Mandela has the typical qualifications, personal qualifications and qualities, expected of people who fill high office. I respect him,' he said. He said, however, that the ANC lacked the experience necessary to rule South Africa. 'To me they are unacceptable because of their adherence to communism. I think they need direction,' Mr de Klerk said.</p>

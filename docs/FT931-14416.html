			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Pilkington prices to increase 8% PILKINGTON, the glass group, has told UK customers that its prices will rise 8 per cent from February 1. Its glass is used by the motor and construction industries. Glass prices have fallen sharply through the recession, and with volumes declining as well, Pilkington's UK operations fell into loss. UK float glass prices have fallen more than 20 per cent since September 1990 and last summer the group cut its dividend. Previous attempts to increase prices failed as imports undercut Pilkington. Following the fall in sterling last autumn, however, Pilkington has started to rebuild market share in the UK and is now more optimistic that a price rise will hold. Pilkington shares rose 4p to 111p yesterday.</p>

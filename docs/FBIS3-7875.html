Moravcik says that another sources of uncertainty about  Slovakia are "some politicians, especially the series of  ambiguous statements by Mr Premier Vladimir Meciar."    Turning to Hungarian-Slovak relations, Moravcik says that  the  conclusion of a general treaty, which would confirm the  inviolability of the state border, is the most important thing  at the moment.    He also stresses the need for international standards of  protection of the rights of ethnic minorities to be worked out.  The internal political aspect of the problem is to seek  consensus with minorities' political representatives, Moravcik  says.    He points out that opposition political parties have already  entered into negotiations with the Hungarian political parties  represented in the Slovak Parliament, though solutions the  questions at issue have not been found yet.    Moravcik says that he has ended his diplomatic career for  the  time being and will now devote himself to home politics. Though  the creation of a new political party is still in the phase of  considerations, talks on the creation of the strongest possible  "grouping of the center" have already started.    He added that the grouping would also embrace supporters of  former foreign minister Milan Knazko, ousted by Meciar last  March, and of Lubomir Cernak, who was stripped of chairmanship  of the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) in mid-February.</p>

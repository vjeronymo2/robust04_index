			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sanofi shifts centre of gravity  -The drugs group has taken a big strategic step Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, chairman of Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group, compares his company to a locomotive. After last week's deals, which bring it the prescription drugs business of Eastman Kodak of the US and involve the sale of its own bio-activities division, the locomotive has been firmly shunted towards a new destination. 'It is a major strategic step,' declares Mr Dehecq, arguing that the centre of gravity in the company would now shift squarely towards pharmaceuticals. The group's cosmetics division, which include Yves Saint Laurent and Yves Rocher, will remain a core business. But even here, cashflow will be used to help finance the company's pharmaceuticals ambitions. The bio-activities division, until last week the third pole of the company, will be used to provide a much quicker source of finance. The businesses, ranging from food additives to veterinary products, will be sold to pay the bill for the Dollars 1.68bn acquisition of the prescription drugs business of Sterling Winthrop from Kodak. So what lies behind the strategic step? Mr Dehecq has long expressed a desire to expand in the sector and push his group, a subsidiary of Elf-Aquitaine, the recently-privatised oil company, into the ranks of the world's largest pharmaceuticals groups. This week's deal propels Sanofi into the top 20 international drugs companies, with annual sales of FFr3.2bn (Dollars 570m) and a base in most of the world's biggest markets. Such ambitions lay behind the strategic tie-up with Sterling Winthrop. Formed in 1991, the alliance gave inexpensive access to markets in the US, Latin America and Asia. But Kodak's announcement in May that it would sell its healthcare activities to focus on core businesses signalled the end of the alliance and gave Sanofi the opportunity to go it alone by buying parts of its US partner. Kodak's decision also gave Sanofi a strong bargaining position. 'Sanofi was effectively a poison pill in Sterling Winthrop because of the alliance agreements,' says Mr Peter Smith, pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel. This helps explain what most analysts regard as a good price for the acquisition. 'The amount they paid was at the lower end of what we were expecting,' said one. But the price will only prove reasonable if the logic of the deal can be proved. 'We are making a bet on pharmaceuticals,' admits Mr Dehecq. He believes the odds are tilted in his favour because the acquisition will expand the company's direct presence in international markets, from the US to south-east Asia, provide an outlet for products in the pipeline, and because economies will be achieved through merging the businesses of Sanofi and Sterling Winthrop. 'We will not be a Merck,' admits Mr Dehecq, 'but we will have a foot in the door to market our new products.' As for cost-savings, Mr Dehecq argues that the merging of the businesses will provide economies not available to the joint venture with Sterling Winthrop. Head office functions can be combined, as can marketing and development budgets. These synergies, he believes, combined with the profits of Sanofi's new businesses will soon feed through to the bottom line. 'Earnings per share should be 10 to 15 per cent higher in 1995 as a result of the acquisition', he estimates. Such forecasts should be welcomed at Elf-Aquitaine, Sanofi's parent, which last Friday forecast a fall in operating profits of up to 20 per cent in the first half of the year. As with any important strategic decision, however, there are question marks. In this case, many relate to the disposals necessary to finance the deal. Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman of Elf-Aquitaine, has issued strict instructions to subsidiaries to the effect that debt must not be increased. Neither did Elf want to see its 52 per cent stake in Sanofi reduced through a capital increase. As a result, Mr Dehecq must sell assets. He says he is confident that buyers will be found for the bio-activities division, and Sanofi has already been contacted by almost a dozen potential suitors. With a gearing ratio of 20 per cent, and net debts of between FFr2bn and FFr3bn, a bridging loan can be easily arranged, he says. An additional challenge is that Sanofi is far from alone in seeking to expand in pharmaceuticals. The plethora of recent acquisitions and mergers in the industry are evidence of stiff competition in the sector. Mr Dehecq argues that prescription drugs are not exposed to the low price competition of non-prescription over-the-counter drugs and that new products over the next few years will allow the group to expand from its newly-gained bridgehead. That, alone, will determine whether Sanofi can stay on track.  -------------------------------------------             RESULTS 1991-93 (FFR)  ------------------------------------------- Total sales  -------------------------------------------        1993        1992        1991     48.45bn        43bn           -  ------------------------------------------- Net profits  -------------------------------------------        1993        1992        1991      1.17bn      1.05bn        950m  ------------------------------------------- R&amp;D expenditure  -------------------------------------------        1993        1992        1991       2.3bn      2.07bn      1.86bn  ------------------------------------------- Sales breakdown by division 1993  ------------------------------------------- Human healthcare:               FFr24.9bn Bio-activities                  FFr11.4bn  ------------------------------------------- (including Entremont, cheese-making activity, which is not to be sold.)

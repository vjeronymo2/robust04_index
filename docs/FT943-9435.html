			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Chart gives true picture Sir, Professor Wynne Godley (Letters, August 8) claims that a Bank of England chart cited by Lex on August 1 is misleading. The chart - contained in my article on company profitability and finance in the August Quarterly Bulletin - shows the development of industrial and commercial companies' investment as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1975. Prof Godley claims that it is misleading because the sector now includes privatised industries which were previously nationalised. Indeed, the sector has become wider, as the article fully acknowledges, but the national accounts data do not identify separately investment by privatised industries. Nevertheless, the chart is not misleading: an alternative chart of whole economy non-residential investment, covering both private and public sectors, in relation to GDP would show broadly the same pattern.

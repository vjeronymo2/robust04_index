			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / So who would win and who would lose?: Public-sector workers will need increases of at least 3 per cent in 1994-95 merely to maintain their standards of living, say pay analysts WILL THE government get away with a second year of severe downward pressure on public-sector pay? And if it does, who will be the winners and losers in the public sector? Public-sector union leaders, and many of their members, were genuinely angry yesterday, but one advantage of announcing the policy so far in advance is that come the 1994-95 pay round the protest may have blown out. Some union officials were careful to talk of a national day of action to focus broader political discontent with the government rather than a return to widespread industrial action which would hurt the public and might turn opinion against the unions rather than the government. Some analysts say that several groups might do quite well out of the new pay policy, especially those which could improve productivity. At both British Rail and the Post Office, for example, the employer is keen to reduce staffing levels further and needs to keep a highly unionised workforce compliant. Similarly, the local government employers stressed yesterday that firefighters - representing only 2 per cent of the local government pay bill  -would return to their special pay formula in 1994-95. Manual and white-collar local government employees are likely to get some national-level pay rise, but that could be supplemented at local level by private-sector-style productivity bargaining. A bigger question mark hangs over relatively privileged groups such as teachers and nurses who have done well in recent years from the pay review bodies. Many schools are likely to have no money for increasing salaries and it is difficult to increase teacher productivity. The demand for nurses is also in decline as the job is restructured and many hospitals will try to target money on patients before staff. Both groups do have public sympathy, however, and several teaching unions were yesterday threatening action. The Civil Service is also likely to feel the squeeze, although the shedding of jobs through market testing might allow for some quite big rises. Civil Service unions yesterday complained that they were being denied access to to this year's Whitehall productivity gains and so would be unable to bargain in line with government strictures. Mr Alan Johnson, leader of the UCW, the main post union, complained that as pay was already linked to productivity improvements it might be in the union's interest to pull out of the existing bargaining arrangements and go for a big one-off pay rise. Mr Jimmy Knapp, head of the RMT rail union, said that productivity improvements depended on investment.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHO GETS WHAT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage increases in pay in financial years                         1988/89    89/90    90/91    91/92    92/93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Local government           6.20     7.80     8.80     7.75     4.80 Civil service              6.25     6.60     9.15     7.50     4.50 Police                     8.20     9.00     9.50     9.00     7.30 Armed Forces               6.40     6.90     7.70    15.30     5.60 Health                     7.95     7.15     8.20     8.75     6.50 Education                 10.10     6.00     7.50     9.60     8.80 Weighted average           8.00     6.00     8.30     9.75     6.50 INFLATION                  6.00     7.50    10.00     5.10     3.75 Private sector             9.10     9.50     9.60     7.25     5.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Council Workers     41.1% rise since 1988 Pounds 343.8 ave. weekly pay* Civil servants      38.8% rise since 1988 Pounds 392.4 ave. weekly pay* Police officers       51% rise since 1988 Pounds 429.7 ave. weekly pay* Nurses             45.22% rise since 1988 Pounds 304.6 ave. weekly pay* Teachers            41.4% rise since 1988 Pounds 431.2 ave. weekly pay*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * average gross weekly earnings for full-time males  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Quotes of the day 'I am sure there are people here who take the view that the Labour party can form the government after the next election. I should tell you, though it may come as some surprise, that there were people in Harrogate last week who thought the Liberal Democrats could form the government after the next election.' Menzies Campbell Liberal Democrat MP '(Under Maastricht) any Labour chancellor might just as well hang a notice on his door saying 'Gone on Holiday'.' Diane Abbott 'Trades unions by and large don't like the dominant position they have at the party conference. There is a lot of misunderstanding about this.' John Edmonds, general secretary, GMB 'You let the Labour party loose on writing a new constitution and the year 2050 beckons fairly rapidly.' Edmonds again 'I will try and grunt my way through the next 10 minutes.' John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, addressing a fringe meeting 'The backdrop to this conference platform says everything. How many shades of grey are there?' Delegate during debate on election campaign</p>

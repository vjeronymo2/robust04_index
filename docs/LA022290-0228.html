			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHICAGO MINDS IF ADS SMOKE  </P> <P> The Chicago Board of Health has proposed a ban on cigarette advertising on  outdoor billboards, buses, trains and taxicabs, the Chicago Sun-Times reported  today.  </P> <P> The board voted unanimously Wednesday to draft an ordinance that could be  presented to the City Council as early as next month.  </P> <P> The proposal came on the heels of a new federal anti-smoking proposal.  </P> <P> Billboard companies said they will form an advisory council to negotiate  voluntary restrictions on tobacco and alcohol ads around schools, as well as to  guide anti-drug ad campaigns.  </P> <P> "Why would cigarette companies spend money putting up billboards? They must  feel it's effective advertising," board President Whitney Addington said. "I  think it's such a health threat that the Board of Health has to fight it."  </P></p>

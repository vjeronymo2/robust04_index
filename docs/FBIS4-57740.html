			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 23 May (DPA) -- Former President Daniel  Ortega, via an apparatus that remained loyal to him during the  Special Congress that ended here today, has led his party into a  stage of purging those Sandinist leaders who were promoting the  change and renewal of the Sandinist National Liberation Front  (FSLN).    As Ortega exerted control over the party and was reelected  to  another three-year term as FSLN secretary general, he was able  to convince his delegates to purge the leader of the Sandinist  bloc, writer Sergio Ramirez Mercado, who heads a  reorganizational current that identifies itself with "a  Sandinist party that is returning to the majority."    The "overwhelming number" of delegates loyal to Ortega also  purged Commander of the Revolution Jaime Wheelock Roman, who is  currently attending Harvard University in the United States.  Ramirez, as well as Wheelock, were members of the FSLN National  Directorate.    The purge also affected the highest decisionmaking  organization within the FSLN (the Sandinist Assembly), which  previously had 120 members, 57 of whom (48 percent) were purged  from their posts within the assembly. Some 15 new posts were  created for members closely connected to the orthodox group,  whose improved position in the body will have a negative effect  on eight deputies, a minister in Violeta Chamorro's  administration, and Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) President  Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren.    Some 78 percent of the highest FSLN organization are now  members associated with Daniel Ortega's orthodox current.  Meanwhile, the reorganizational sector only garnered 22 percent  of the posts in the elections held at the Sandinist session,  whereby the statutes and internal regulations of the party were  reformed.    The FSLN National Directorate, which previously had nine  members, was enlarged to 15 members during the Congress. Tomas  Borge, former interior minister during the Sandinist regime;  Daniel Ortega; Bayardo Arce; Rene Nunez; Henry Ruiz; Victor  Tirado Lopez; and Luis Carrion were reelected as National  Directorate members. Meanwhile, Monica Baltodano, Lumberto  Campbell, Victor Hugo Tinoco, Rene Vivas, and Dorotea Wilson,  all from the orthodox current, as well as peasant Benigna  Mendiola, Deputy Dora Maria Tellez, and Mirna Cunningham, all  from the reorganizational sector defeated by the conservative  current headed by Daniel Ortega, were elected as new members of  the Sandinist Directorate.    After Sandinist bloc leader Sergio Ramirez was purged by the  orthodox group, he reported hegemonic practices were carried out  at the Congress, and, in turn, he informed journalists that the  party is already divided, which will prompt yet another crisis  within the FSLN bloc in Congress.    Because of reforms to the FSLN statutes, Daniel Ortega was  granted maximum authority that could even help him occupy  Ramirez's seat in the Parliament, thereby replacing his main  ideological enemy. This situation could trigger the division of  the FSLN bloc.    Only five of the 39 FSLN deputies are loyal to Daniel  Ortega,  which indicates that should the reelected secretary general want  to install himself as chief of the FSLN legislators by ignoring  the regulations established by the deputies to reelect their  leader, the Sandinist bloc could join other legislative blocs  that make up the Political Bloc Council, thereby leaving  deputies loyal to Ortega in a minority bloc.    The FSLN Special Congress also will prompt purges in the  mouthpieces of the party, especially in BARRICADA, run by Carlos  Fernando Chamorro Barrios (President Violeta Chamorro's son),  who belongs to the reorganizational current of the FSLN.    As she hinted that Ortega will appoint himself or another  FSLN deputy as leader of the Sandinist bloc, Monica Baltodano,  new member of the Sandinist Directorate and representative of  the orthodox current, said the editorial line of the  aforementioned newspaper will be revised.    Only 487 of 566 national delegates attended the Sandinist  Congress. Daniel Ortega is controlling most of them.    Sandinist sources reported that nothing focusing on the  unification of the party was discussed at the Congress, although  in speeches by orthodox members, including the closing speech by  Daniel Ortega himself, Ortega was depicted as an advocate of  party renewal. As he talked about those purged within his party,  he pointed out that these people personify the bitter results  that must be accepted under Sandinist democracy.    The Sandinist session, which took place at a convention  center in Managua, and which was guarded by nearly 100  plainclothes and armed police officers, cost the party $350,000.</p>

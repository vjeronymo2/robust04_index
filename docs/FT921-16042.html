			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 10m buy-out at Samuel Banner Samuel Banner, the solvent and chemicals blender, has been bought by its management in a Pounds 10m deal, after running out of Banner family members willing to run it. The buy-out was brokered by Rickitt Mitchell &amp; Partners, the Manchester-based corporate finance adviser, and backed by 3i and Charterhouse Development Capital. The company had about 60 shareholders, all descended from or related to or connected with the founders. About half the equity was held by Mr Christopher Banner, managing director for 17 years, and his family. Mr Banner will stay on as non-executive chairman.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The youth and student  department of the Central Committee of the South Korean National  Democratic Front (Hanminjon) called on the youth and students to  invigorate the anti-U.S., anti-fascist nation-saving struggle  for independence, democracy and reunification on the 34th  anniversary of the April 19 resistance, the Seoul-based radio  Voice of National Salvation reported.    In a letter titled "Let Us Effect a New Leap in the Movement  of Youth and Students" Hanminjon said for the present the South  Korean youth and students must draw the masses into the movement  "To Defend Our Rice," activate the struggle for a stop to the  introduction of Patriot missiles and against the pressure on the  North over nuclear inspection and against nuclear war exercises  and expand this struggle to a struggle for the withdrawal of  nuclear weapons and U.S. troops.    "The youth and students must attach primary importance to  the  struggle for the abolition of the `National Security Law' and  disbandment of repressive tools and, at the same time, staunchly  wage the anti-fascist, anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle to frustrate  parliamentary approval of the enforcement schedule of the  Uruguay Round accord," said the letter.</p>

However, Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds has asked O'Reilly to have a word with Digital's chief executive, Robert Palmer. What will O'Reilly have to offer that wasn't already offered by Ruari Quinn, Ireland's minister for employment and enterprise, when he met Palmer in Boston on Monday - tickets to the Irish-Welsh rugby match on March 6, perhaps?</p>

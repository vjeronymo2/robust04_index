			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Czech capital inflows rise The Czech National Bank has revised sharply upwards its estimate of foreign capital inflows for 1994 from Kcs60bn (Pounds 1.38bn) to Kcs100bn, but stressed that the inflationary effect would be broadly neutral. The pace of foreign capital inflows has pushed up M2 money supply to a preliminary 7.4 per cent in June from 3.7 per cent in April, and an average 1.3 per cent in the first quarter of 1994. Year-on-year inflation in June was 9.7 per cent, up from 9.3 per cent in May and 9.2 per cent in April, and close to the target of 10 per cent set by the CNB at the beginning of the year.</p>

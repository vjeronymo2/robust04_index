			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Bonds: 3M makes a rare visit with Dollars 200m two-year offering Continued strong demand from European retail investors for short-dated bond offerings tempted borrowers into the US dollar and Australian dollar sectors of the eurobond market yesterday. However, new issuance was light with borrowers and investors winding down for the Christmas period. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, the diversified US manufacturing group, better known as 3M, and a rare borrower on the eurobond market, launched a Dollars 200m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield 9 basis points over US government bonds. Traders said the pricing was aggressive but lead manager JP Morgan said that 3M was keen to tap the market before favourable swap levels closed in the new year. JP Morgan said that the 7 3/4 per cent coupon was the highest available in either the two or three-year areas of the dollar sector for an AAA rated name, bar GECC's Dollars 200m offering launched last week with a 7.875 per cent coupon. Syndicate officials said the issue found firm demand among Swiss and Benelux retail investors. 3M last borrowed in the eurobond market in May with a Dollars 200m three-year offering that is now trading in the secondary market at 20 basis points through US Treasuries, JP Morgan said. Yield spreads in the eurodollar market narrowed slightly after widening sharply last week. Traders in the sector said that spreads over US government bonds on paper in the two-year to five-year maturity range closed in by about three basis points after widening sharply by about five basis points on the fear that the financial crisis in Orange County, California, would lead to the liquidation of its bond portfolio, resulting in a flood of bonds on to the secondary market. In the Australian dollar sector, the World Bank launched an ADollars 100m issue of three-year bonds offering a coupon of 10 1/8 per cent. New South Wales Treasury Corporation launched a ADollars 100m offering of three-year bonds which were sold almost entirely into Japan, lead manager Nomura said. The lead said that Japanese investors are currently attracted to the Australian market by the prospect of a strengthening in the country's currency against the yen as the Australian economy continues to grow. In the lire sector, Deutsche Bank Finance, the big German bank's external financing vehicle, launched a L200bn issue of three-year bonds offering a coupon of 11 per cent. The bonds were sold to Italian retail investors, Belgian funds and German investors, traders said. The Republic of Argentina is set to make its debut in the euro-French franc market this week with a FFr1bn issue maturing on January 6, 1998. An official at Societe Generale, which is leading the deal, said that the issue will yield some 240 to 250 basis points above French government bonds and will have a coupon of 9.5 per cent.</p>

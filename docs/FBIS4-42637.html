			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Liberators, Protectors, </F> Pacifiers"]    [Text] D-Day was the beginning of the end of the Nazi  dictatorship, the beginning of Europe's liberation. Hitler was  dead nine months later and the 12-year-old Reich one week later.  This is common history.    However, the "Longest Day" was more than just the military  turning point, more than just the largest landing operation of  all time, which will be reenacted in military academies for  centuries -- like the battles of Cannae or Agincourt. In the  first place, 6 June was also a political dividing line in  Europe's history. It was the day on which the United States  became a European power -- with enormous historical consequences  on which the "Old Contingent" has lived for half a century.    Originally, this was not intended. The GI's who stormed the  beaches of Normandy at dawn were only supposed to follow the  footsteps of their fathers in World War I. They had gone to the  "Great War" in 1917 -- and were back home again as early as in  1919. While the United States lapsed into furious isolationism,  Europe was going to the dogs slowly and then increasingly  quickly. The victors -- England and France -- were drained of  their life's blood and demoralized; instead of the dreamed-of  peace system, a power vacuum developed and Europe fell easy prey  to totalitarianism, which started a second, far more terrible  world war only 20 years later.    In 1944, the Americans also wanted to play the role of the  legendary lonesome cowboy who appears from nowhere, cleans up  the town, and rides out into the sunset again. In February  1945, in Yalta, Franklin Roosevelt still confided to his ally  Josef ("Uncle Joe") that the U.S. troops would stay in Europe at  best for two years. Once again, the United States wanted to  return to the tradition that former President James Madison had  cast into a resolution in 1783: "The United States' real  interest requires that it gets entangled in the European  nations' policies and quarrels as little as possible. "  Congress unanimously agreed to this first document of  isolationism.    The United States finally broke, though still unknowingly,  with this tradition on 6 June 1944. After Roosevelt's death,  his successor Truman asked the simple, but correct question, the  answer to which was to determine the United States' policy  toward Europe for half a century: "What is better for our  country -- to spend $20 billion or $30 billion on the  preservation of peace in the next four years or to repeat what  we did in 1920, in order to be later obliged to pay $100 billion  for four years of war?"  <H5>  The U.S. Double Role </H5>   The fact that the Americans invested in peace in their own  interest -- that is, that they stayed with their soldiers in  West Europe -- does not alter the fact that the Europeans  benefited enormously from this mission. Europe, the country of  the 30-Years' and the 100-Years' Wars, where "peace" was only a  break between two passages of arms for centuries, suddenly  became the isle of the blessed (apart from the Soviet repressive  actions in the GDR, Hungary, and the CSSR). Without stability  made in the United States, the happy ending of 1989/90 would  have certainly not gone down in the history of the continent.    However, historical speculations have to go into it even  more  deeply and throw light on the U.S. double role: not only as a  protector, but also as a pacifier of West Europe. After all,  the question is: Why did the Germans and French shake hands in  friendship after 1945, instead of flying at each other's throats  again like in 1870, 1914, and 1940? Why were the small ones --  the Netherlands or Belgium -- able to embark on the beneficial  adventure of integration with the big ones who had treated them  so often as strategic playthings in the past?    The answer is simple: Because suddenly a power that was  bigger and stronger than all of them together was anchored in  the European system. The Pax Americana worked on both sides:  outside and inside -- it protected the West Europeans from  others and from themselves. Guaranteed security both inside and  outside was the foundation on which it was possible to erect the  great structure of European unification. The West Europeans no  longer had to relapse into the old game of distrust and rivalry  because the great reinsurer, the United States, was among them.    Dean Rusk, a U.S. secretary of state, expressed it in this  way: "The presence of our troops also promoted inner-European  cooperation. However, without the visible securing by a weighty  U.S. contingent, old frictions could be revived and Europe be  destabilized again." That was in 1967; is this insight still  valid today?  <H5>  "Ami Go Home?" </H5>   Apparently yes, because today nobody chants "Ami go home" --  although the Soviet Union does not exist any longer, and the  last Russian troops will go home this summer. The left-wingers  who have grown older, who demonstrated against the Pershings  only 10 years ago, and against the Vietnam War in their youth,  are advocating with warm words that the D-Day offspring, whose  number is rapidly decreasing to 100,000 and might even decrease  further, stay.    The paradox is easy to crack. The Germans, the old  bogeyman opponents in Europe, benefited strongly from the  Americans' comforting presence. Today -- at least the clever  Germans know this -- the gentle U.S. counterweight is also in  the interests of the "greater Germany." For power can be  exercised all the more easily if it is embedded in a stable  balance of power that does not even permit the spreading of  distrust.    Moreover, the classic insurance function of the U.S.  presence  has not yet been invalidated. Russia is on the road to reform,  but it continues to be an unpredictable variable in the European  security equation. In former times it was Russia's strength,  today it is its weakness -- its inner instability -- that weighs  on Europe. Here a reliable counterweight is always useful and  this is hardly conceivable without the inclusion of the Atlantic  superpower.    The United States' presence in Europe has not always been  easy for the Europeans since the friendliest elephant is an  inconvenient fellow because of its sheer power. However, if the  advantages and disadvantages are added up, a sound surplus,  which calls for gratitude, remains on balance. D-Day was really  the beginning of the liberation, also and exactly, of the  Germans. They also owe it to the Americans that they were so  quickly accepted back into the community of nations after  Hitler's horrors. The fact that West Europe preserved its  freedom also cannot be separated from the United States'  anchoring role. And what about the future? Here, only the  insight from the history of the bloodiest of all European  centuries remains: Europe has fared better with the United  States as an anchor of stability than without it.</p>

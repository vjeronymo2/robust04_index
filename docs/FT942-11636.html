			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK offers Pounds 100m aid package to S Africa Britain is to provide a Pounds 100m aid package to assist the new government of South Africa over the next three years, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, announced yesterday. He told the House of Commons that Pounds 60m would be in the form of bilateral aid and the remainder through programmes arranged by the Commonwealth Development Corporation and the European Union. Mr Hurd was joined by Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, and MPs of other parties in congratulating the people of South Africa on the conduct of the election. The foreign secretary said he would be discussing how the aid could be best used when attending the inauguration of Mr Nelson Mandela as president on May 10. The Pounds 100m will be made available by the Overseas Development Administration from its existing budget. Mr Hurd envisaged that priority would be given to helping with policy formulation and projects in education and health. Other aims should include enhancing productive capacity and employment. Mr Hurd urged British businesses with interests in South Africa to study the opportunities and prospects opening up.</p>

Ciller in the message conveyed her impressions to the  leaders  she viewed during her visit to Bosnia on Feb 2 saying "the  developments in Bosnia up to now showed that the aggressor was  allowed to gain territory by force."    The message went on saying "the aggressive powers continue  their actions to devastate the multi-cultural structure of  Bosnia and a mortar attack of Serbians which killed 68 people  and wounded 200 others targeted the Bosnian civilians. She  added that the attack was a challenge to all civilization values  and initiatives for a peaceful solution.    Ciller described the recent letter of the UN General  Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali sent to NATO which called for an  air operation and protection of Sarajevo against Serbian attacks  as "late but favorable."    Ciller said such an air operation will protect Sarajevo from  Serbian attacks and will give an open message to the aggressors.    She said if NATO fails to take necessary measures after this  letter, it will lose its credibility.</p>

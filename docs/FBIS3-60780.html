			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gabriel Freire] </F>   [Text] The "Raul Pellegrin" detachment, an offshoot of the  Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR), was crippled for all  practical purposes following the arrest by the Investigations  branch of its three top leaders, the military, political, and  logistics chiefs. Seven other persons were also captured in the  police operation, as well as a sizable arsenal which was  examined yesterday, 25 November, by prosecutor Humberto Espejo.    The persons arrested were identified as Esteban Burgos  Torrealba, military chief; Alejandro Placencia Urrutia,  logistics chief; and Ariel Saenz Bont-Martens, political chief.  Also arrested were a married couple, Luis Emilio Lopez Sandoval  and Iris Galleguillos Donoso, and Claudia Mella Mateluna,  Gabriel Venegas Escorza, Leslie Maxwel Narvaez, Jacqueline  Navarette Mellado, and Paola Orlando Orlando.    According to a senior civil police official, the police  operation was the culmination of extensive intelligence work  that began last June with the arrest of Jose Saa [sic] Gerbier,  30 years of age, the top leader of the extremist movement.    After obtaining as much information as possible from the  interrogation of Saa Gerbier, units of Intelligence and of the  Second Assault Police Station raided four residences on the  night of 23-24 November, located at Neptuno 101, Pudahuel; Cabo  de Hornos 0545, Maipu; Pasaje Salitre Peregrino 0882, Puente  Alto, and Pasaje Corcega 940, La Cisterna.    In the first three, the police seized handguns and  shoulder-fired weapons, and at La Cisterna they captured an  extensive arsenal that included LAW rocket launchers.    Following the arrest of Saa Gerbier, the government  requested  a visit by a prosecutor to investigate the subversive  organization. The prosecutor designated was Magistrate Humberto  Espejo Zuniga who, after a 10-day period of detention for the  presumed extremists, conducted a visual inspection yesterday of  the house at La Cisterna followed by an inspection of the  captured weapons and explosives at the main offices of  Investigations.    Espejo described the quantity of armaments that the group  possessed as impressive, when asked about the result of the  police operations. As to their eventual use, he said that it was  "evidently for a terrorist plan. We cannot guess what they  planned to do, but there is no doubt that they were destined for  terrorist acts."    When asked whether documents with specific plans were found,  he said "no, because these people rarely keep written planning  records. It must be understood that these are terrorist  organizations and the chiefs think about what they are going to  do, at most they will write down some information, an address,  but they never write down plans."    As for crimes that might be attributed to the group, the  prosecutor said that "approximately 24 high voltage towers have  been blown up since last year, which is what started this  investigation. That is for what concerns terrorist acts, but  there is also a very large number of crimes for gain, about 32  or 33 crimes, robberies of banks, finance offices, and  supermarkets. A guard was killed, and there could be some  connection with the death of a gendarme." (Jose Cortes, on 11  October, in the motor vehicle section of the Gendarmeria.)    He said that this group was an offshoot of the FPMR and that  "the size of the band" was being investigated, that there was no  evidence to indicate that this was the group that had freed  Maritza Jara, on trial for the kidnapping of Cristian Edwards  del Rio, from San Miguel prison.    The "Raul Pellegrin" detachment, which came into being in  1991 as a result of the breakup of the FPMR, subscribes to the  thesis of the armed revolution. Its leader uses the name of  "Commander Rodrigo" in memory of the leader found dead together  with Cecilia Magni in the mountains of the Seventh Region,  following the attack on the village of Los Quenes in 1987, in  which the carabineer Juvenal Vargas was killed.  <H5>  [Box, p 14] </H5> <H5>  Arms and Explosives Captured </H5>   In the residence at Pasaje Salitre Peregrino 0882, Puente  Alto, the police seized an SHE submachine gun, model P 25, 9 mm  Parabellum, and two Llama revolvers, Comanche model, .38 caliber  special. There were also three magazines for the submachine gun  with a capacity of 40 rounds each, and a large quantity of  ammunition for the revolvers.    In Neptune 101, Pudahuel, police seized a Rossi .38 caliber  special revolver, a large quantity of ammunition for the weapon,  and a 50 mm anti-aircraft round.    In Cabo de Hornos 0545, Maipu, police found a Spanish  grenade, a revolver and a CZ pistol, 9 mm short, and ammunition  for both weapons. There were also two detonators, one with 15  centimeters of black fuse.    Finally, in Corcega 940, La Cisterna, police found an  extensive arsenal consisting of more than 15 kg of paint grade  aluminum powder, used for making homemade bombs; ammonium  nitrate; potassium chlorite; laminating powder; 300 meters of  detonating cord at 10 grams per meter, which is also an  explosive; homemade detonators; a large number of booby traps,  T4 explosive plastic, electric-type detonators, seven LAW's with  their rockets, all live or in working order; seven M-16 rifles  with a large quantity of ammunition, approximately 30 magazines  with 30 rounds in each one; sawed off shotguns, revolvers, and  electric detonators.    When asked about the destructive power of this arsenal, the  chief of the Ballistics Department of Investigations said that  "if we only consider the damage that a LAW rocket can do, we  have a warlike arsenal able to cause damage of an incalculable  magnitude. If we add to this the firepower of the M-16's and the  amount of ammunition seized, we cannot measure the consequences."</p>

The head of the department of  information and publicity in the Western Cape, Mr. Bulelani  Ngcuka, and parliamentary candidate Jay Naidoo told a news  conference that building another parliament would be a waste of  resources. They said the ANC's priorities were jobs, housing,  electricity, and health services, not putting up new public  buildings.</p>

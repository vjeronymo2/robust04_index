			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / House prices 'up 0.4% in month' House prices rose 0.4 per cent last month compared with December, Nationwide, the country's second-largest building society, said yesterday. A similar survey due to be published tomorrow by Halifax, the biggest mortgage lender,is expected to show a small fall in prices in January. Nationwidesays the price of an average home rose last month to Pounds 53,763  -up 2.4 per cent on the corresponding month last year. Mr Brian Davis, the society's operations manager, said the results reflected 'the modest rise in activity in thehousing market in 1993'. He added: 'Our estate agents are already seeing a large increase in viewing figures for January, and some locations are reporting the need for more properties to satisfy potential buyers. We feel that conditions are now in place to see a sustained improvement in the housing market in 1994.' It will not be the first time that Halifax and Nationwide have disagreed on monthly price movements. Halifax's survey, based on a larger sample of mortgage loans, has indicated a slightly more subdued recovery rate. Last month Halifax reported that house prices in 1993 rose on average by 1.2 per cent, the first annual increase reported by the society since 1990. This compared with an annual increase of 3.3 per cent reported by Nationwide. Halifax is expected to report a similar annual increase of about 1 per cent in its figures for January. It says occasional month-on-month price falls may continue to occur, but expects prices on average to rise by about 5 percent this year. Nationwide is forecasting a similar rate of increase for 1994.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Picking president proves tough task for Italy's political parties WITH tomorrow's presidential election looming, Italy's political parties yesterday intensified their efforts to agree on a candidate. Since Mr Francesco Cossiga resigned as the country's eighth president on April 25, the main parties have been torn by internal divisions and doubts about the type of person who should become head of state when the two houses of parliament, plus 58 delegates from regional councils, meet to vote tomorrow. The politicians are having to take account of the profound public disaffection with the Italian political system and demands for serious institutional reform evidenced by the vote in the April 5 general election. This has made it difficult for the outgoing coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals to push through their own candidate without a broader consensus. The Christian Democrats, as the largest parliamentary party and with a strong claim to the presidency, have come under pressure to make the first move. However, they have been shaken by the general election when their vote fell below 30 per cent for the first time. Much of the blame has fallen on the the party's two heavy-weight contenders  -Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing premier, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the party secretary. Before the general election, Mr Andreotti had made it clear the presidency was the last great office he had not held and his candidacy would be a fitting conclusion to more than 40 years in politics. The Socialists for their part have been badly tainted by the municipal corruption scandal in Milan, the power base of the party leader, Mr Bettino Craxi. Last night, the city's mayor, Mr Piero Borghini, announced his resignation after the muncipal council had become unworkable as a result of the political impact of the affair in which the Socialists are allegedly heavily involved in the channeling of funds from rigged contracts to political parties. The broad-based council administration automatically resigned with him and last night it was unclear how the city would find durable government without fresh elections. Mr Borghini, a former editor of the Communist daily, L'Unita and left-wing independent, agreed to take-over as mayor barely 100 days ago. The city's two previous mayors are currently being investigated by magistrates for alleged corruption. But there has been no suggestion of Mr Borghini's involvement in the affair, which has lead to 26 local politicians, businessmen and officials being arrested. The scandal has damaged Mr Craxi, and although he has mainly had his eye on the next premiership, he has been a presidential possible. However, in what appeared to be an acknowledgement that he was out of the running, Mr Craxi last night nominted Mr Giuliano Vassalli, a former Socialist justice minister and current member of the constitutional court, to be the party's candidate. Whatever deal is cut on the presidency, it is likely to be part of a broader arrangement over the formation of a new government. Since the president's powers are largely formal, involving the dissolution of parliament and nomination of prime ministers, the main parties may be willing to let a lesser figure or someone from a minor party hold the office. There are three other Christian Democrat possibilities: Mr Ciriaco de Mita, party president and former prime minister; Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, recently elected leader of the Chamber of Deputies; and Ms Tina Anselmi, a veteran parliamentarian with substantial cross-party support. Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the Republic's interim president, must stand a good chance. As a former prime minister he is a skilful political consensus builder and has a good public image as an amiable father-figure. The Party of the Democratic Left (former Communist party) is proposing Ms Nilde Iotti, for 11 years leader of the Chamber of Deputies. Of the outsiders, the best known is octogenarian left-wing philosopher Norberto Bobbio. But Mr Cossiga is also on the side-lines ready to be recalled. In the first three votes a two-thirds majority is necessary; thereafter a simple majority. On previous occasions such has been the disagreement that the voting has gone to 23 sessions. This time the individual votes of politicians in 16 different parties will have to be taken into account by the lobbyists.</p>

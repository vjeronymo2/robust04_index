			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Azerbaijan president fleesas rebels close on capital FORMER communist leader Mr Heydar Aliyev yesterday took over as Azerbaijan's leader after the president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, fled the capital of Baku. Mr Elchibey did not officially resign, but said he was leaving to avoid bloodshed as armed rebels demanding his resignation closed in on the city. The rebels, led by charismatic former businessman Mr Surat Husseynov, were reported to be within a few miles of Baku yesterday evening. However, the Turkish ambassador to Azerbaijan told a Turkish news agency that Mr Aliyev had managed to persuade Mr Husseynov not to enter the city in view of the president's departure. At the same time, ethnic Armenians in the western region of Nagorno-Karabakh were advancing against Azerbaijani troops on two fronts, near the towns of Agdam and Martakert. The civil war has been the central issue in two-years of political upheaval in Azerbaijan. At the head of his 3,000-strong army, Mr Husseynov may demand a high political price for halting his rebellion. Mr Husseynov's revolt on June 4 against Mr Elchibey, in which he seized Azerbaijan's second largest city, Gyanja, triggered the political crisis in which five senior government ministers have resigned and Mr Aliyev has returned to power as parliamentary speaker after six years of political oblivion. At 2am yesterday, Mr Elchibey was said to have ordered a government aircraft to his home village of Kelaki in the region of Nakhichevan. Government officials said the president left the capital without warning, and left no instructions to his subordinates. Mr Aliyev said he also was not alerted. In parliament, Mr Aliyev said Mr Elchibey told him in a telephone conversation late yesterday afternoon that he left to avoid bloodshed in the capital. Mr Aliyev quoted the president as saying, 'whenever you want I can come back. The decision rests with you'. Mr Aliyev said the president had left him in charge until he returned to Baku. 'The main thing right now is not to decide who is head of government,' Mr Aliyev told the parliamentary deputies. 'First, we must find the way out of the tense situation in the country.'</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTLING DIFFERENCES OVER HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Regarding an article on the Project Area Committee in Hollywood (Times, Jan.  18):  </P> <P> Councilman (Michael) Woo's declaration that his "community representatives" are  there to "serve at his discretion" and "whose views" on redevelopment "are  compatible with my (Woo's) own," is the problem in a nutshell. They are Woo's  representatives, not the community's, as the elected PAC has stated all along.  Recent events in Eastern Europe have shown the fallacy of such claims that  appointed community representation is better than elected representation.  Unless, of course, you have something to hide.  </P> <P> The PAC took on immediate issues of concern, challenging projects presented by  large campaign contributors because of their impact on the community. We  didn't, and still don't, bury our heads in the sand dreaming about "plans" for  10 to 20 years from now when the real issues in Hollywood are being decided  now. Long-term goals and plans are needed, but rarely followed. Hollywood has  been studied to death, while implementation and action has either been with  smoke and mirrors, or a sledgehammer.  </P> <P> The PAC made over 130 specific recommendations for the plan, but discussion and  implementation has been stifled by the Community Redevelopment Agency, which  prefers to see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil of redevelopment. I've  attended over 250 public meetings in the past four years regarding "cleaning up  Hollywood," listening to the same problems and the same officials pointing  fingers.  </P> <P> What is Councilman Woo's "vision" for Hollywood? More studies that are almost  two years late and hundreds of thousands of dollars over budget?  </P> <P> I am encouraged by Woo's comments to The Times that he would like the two  advisory groups to "make amends somehow." Our conflict is not between the two  groups, but in his attempts to silence elected community representatives when  they oppose him. For the record, we have always been open to "make amends" if  the councilman is willing to talk to us about it (as I have told him).  </P> <P> Let's quit the petty politics in Hollywood and get on with restoring the  world's most famous community in a fair and open manner benefiting everyone.  </P> <P> ROBERT W. NUDELMAN  </P> <P> chairman, Project Area Committee  </P></p>

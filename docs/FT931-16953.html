			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television If you missed Tornado Down the first time around, this thought-provoking documentary is back tonight on C4 at 9.00. Flight Lieutenants John Peters and John Nichol were shot down on the first day of Operation Desert Storm and subsequently paraded on Iraqi TV - not perhaps one of Saddam Hussein's more astute propaganda moves. The two airmen describe their captivity at the hands of the secret police and the experience of breaking down under torture. The Name of the Room on BBC2 at 7.20, sets out to trace the evolution of the British dwelling from the mead-halls of Beowulf's era to the modern semi. A good idea, although a mere four programmes looks a little short for such a complex subject and one so rich in social snobbery. Tonight's programme starts with rooms intended for public show - parlour, lounge, drawing-room, depending who you are . . . Horizon's Awakening of the Frozen Addicts (BBC2 at 8.00) looks at Swedish research into a cure for Parkinson's Disease using transplants of foetal tissue. It follows scientists along a complicated research trail opened up a decade ago.</p>

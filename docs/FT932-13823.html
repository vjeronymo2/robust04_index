			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Major to join attack on EBRD spending MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is expected on Monday to use the keynote address of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development annual meeting to criticise the bank for its lavish spending on new London offices. He is also expected to back the call from Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, for greater openness at the bank when he addresses the EBRD's governors' meeting on Monday in London. Mr Major's criticisms are expected to be diplomatically worded but indicate government concern that the bank has acted insensitively. It also emerged yesterday that Mr Don McCutchan, the only director of the EBRD to vote against its 1993 budget, is being removed a year and a half earlier than he expected. Mr McCutchan, a Canadian, has been one of the most consistent critics of the bank's expenditure on its office furnishings, parties, entertaining and administration. On December 14, he was the only director to vote against the 1993 budget of Ecu136m (Pounds 108m) for administrative expenses, up from Ecu103.5m in the previous year. The bank's 23 directors are public officials representing the 56 countries and international agencies which own the bank. On March 5, Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, and Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, met in Ottawa. An EBRD director said that days later, Canadian officials arrived at the bank to conduct an inquiry into Mr McCutchan's fitness as a director. EBRD directors said Mr McCutchan was exonerated by the report. 'If anything, it made him appear too good, like Mother Teresa,' commented a director. A Canadian government spokesman said yesterday that Mr McCutchan would hold his post until this summer and then return to Canada as part of the normal rotation of diplomatic officers. However, a friend of Mr McCutchan said he had not been expecting to return to Canada until the summer of 1994. The EBRD refused to make any comment on Mr McCutchan. At the weekend, Mr Attali said Mr Mulroney had 'just telephoned me to express his support', after widespread criticisms that the bank's internal expenditure had run out of control in its first two years of operation. Mr Attali yesterday met Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Mr Lamont said the bank's audit committee, composed of eight directors and independent of the bank's day-to-day management, should inquire thoroughly and quickly into reports of excessive spending on fitting out the bank's new headquarters in London and other costs, such as hiring private aircraft to ferry Mr Attali to appointments. Britain supports demands by directors that the committee should have external help in carrying out its investigation rather than relying on the internal auditors used normally by the bank. The outside help could be provided by a firm of accountants or chartered surveyors. During the meeting, Mr Lamont said it was vital the issues raised by the EBRD's spending did not interfere with its efforts to help establish market-based economies in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</p>

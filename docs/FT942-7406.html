			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (5): An upbeat identity can help - Inward investment Seated in a Shanghai airport lounge not long ago, Mr Allen Neel, Tennessee's deputy commissioner for economic and community development, could hardly believe his ears. Country and western music was playing over the piped music system. To Mr Neel, this not only proved the worldwide appeal of Tennessee's best-known export, but it also meant that the chore of marketing Tennessee to international investors could get a lot easier. After all, he had a state with an identity: the home of country music. Amid the clamour of US states seeking investors, a state with an upbeat musical identity seems to have a helpful advantage. At least it is a conversation opener. But Tennessee has largely staked its fortunes on other more solid, un-glitzy attractions: low wages, a central US location, tax incentives, a modest cost of living and a pro-business, anti-union climate. Such allures have been sufficient to draw Dollars 12.4bn worth of investment in just the past five years - more than a quarter of which, Dollars 3.6bn, was foreign. And, over the past decade or so as the motor industry has moved increasingly into the US south-east, Tennessee has netted a very sizeable chunk. Japan's Nissan and General Motors' Saturn chose Tennessee and many of their suppliers are spread around the state. 'Ten years ago, there wasn't a single auto made in Tennessee,' said Mr Billy Stair, a top aide to Governor Ned McWherter. 'Today, Tennessee ranks third (among US states) in autos.' If state officials have their way, Tennessee will further expand its automotive investment by capturing suppliers for the plants of BMW and Mercedes in, respectively, nearby western South Carolina and northern Alabama. To potential European and other suppliers of BMW and Mercedes, officials are emphasising that Tennessee is within one day's drive of every big auto manufacturing plant in the US. This is part of a larger campaign to attract foreign investment. In an effort to capitalise on its new direct air link between Tennessee and London, the state began in April to market itself to more than 100 countries with a commercial on CNN International. Yet Tennessee has had two key concerns about its industrial recruitment. It wants to keep its economy diversified, and it wants to spread the prosperity that comes from more investment to poorer regions of the state. For diversification, Tennessee is looking for a variety of non-auto investments, particularly in high technology. With a substantial scientific community - largely related to defence work - around Knoxville, Tennessee can offer brain power. In the past year, it has created a Science and Technology Council, with the participation of top defence contractor Martin Marietta, to develop a strategy about where the state should go in high technology. It is also in the process 'of thinking through where we are going in telecommunications,' according to Mr Neel. The state installed an extensive fibre optic network largely to serve its more sophisticated manufacturers. But it has yet to determine how best to take advantage of its improved telecoms ability. If the state's economic strategy doesn't seem to have caught up with its potential, this is in part because fast-paced economic progress in Tennessee is of recent vintage. Only since the arrival of important car industry investment in the 1980s has Tennessee pulled away from the South's traditionally languid growth rate. Between 1982 and 1991, it had long-term employment growth of 18 per cent. In March, 'Biz', a Dow Jones magazine, ranked Tennessee's economy as the healthiest among the 12 south-eastern states. An example of Tennessee's economic fizz is that metropolitan Nashville added 14,000 jobs over the past year while New York City lost 27,000 and Los Angeles 70,000. Yet, while the state's unemployment rate today runs about a full point below the national average, there is concern over economic disparity and a desire to reduce it. When Mr McWherter took office seven years ago, much of the job creation had centred around the four leading cities of Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga. Of the state's 95 counties, 40 were determined to be 'economically depressed,' with long-term unemployment rates of more than 12 per cent and per capita incomes of less than 75 per cent of the state average. Governor McWherter set out to even out Tennessee's prosperity. He built roads to physically connect depressed areas with big interstate highways, and he improved their schools and healthcare facilities. He also offered special tax incentives to businesses creating jobs in depressed areas. As a consequence, more than Dollars 1.4bn in private investment went to the poorest 40 counties during the past seven years, including 163 new manufacturing plants. Today, state officials say that only two counties have double-digit unemployment. This will no doubt be a difficult record to match for whoever wins this year's gubernatorial election. But officials are hoping that many more investors, particularly foreign ones, will be humming country and western tunes.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAME, SHAME  </P> <P> Have you no shame? Is nothing sacred? Two years ago you wrote an excellent  article on Strasbourg, the beautiful city in Alsace (April 24, 1988). You spoke  of La Petite Francaise, the cathedral, the boat ride on the L'ille River. And,  there is the European Parliament, which is worthy of a visit.  </P> <P> Please, sir, no more. The Route du Vin (by Jerry Hulse, Dec. 3, 1989) will  become as (crowded as) the Hollywood Freeway and as popular as Disneyland.  Leave us in peace, please. Wines, cheese, French bread, chocolates and our  beautiful countryside may be all that is left of civilization. We'll give you  Gorby, even Paris, if you will but leave Strasbourg and the Route du Vin from  your columns.  </P> <P> THOM HENDRICKSON  </P> <P> Rosheim-Mutzig, France  </P></p>

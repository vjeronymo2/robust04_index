The FPLS is led by Mohamed Anako, a 30 year-old indigene of  the Agadez region (750 km northwest of Niamey), who presents  himself as a "moderate federalist" in his demands, the same  sources indicate.    Niger Interior Minister Ousamane Oumarou, in an interview  with AFP, stated that the government had "only learned" of the  emergence of this movement. "We have not been informed  officially. We therefore do not know the reasons for its  establishment and do not have any information on its members,"  he added. [passage omitted]</p>

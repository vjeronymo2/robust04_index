			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Li urges economic consolidation Premier Li Peng yesterday told China's annual parliamentary session that political stability and further consolidating economic reforms were the main priorities in the year ahead. Mr Li's 'state of the republic' address placed heavy emphasis on combating inflation, reducing unsustainable rates of economic growth and ensuring public order in the face of a widening income gap between country and city. 'Economic development is the centre of all our work,' Mr Li told some 2,800 delegates to the National People's Congress which convenes once a year. 'Social stability, in turn, is an indispensable prerequisite for economic development and smooth progress in reform.' Mr Li's remarks reflect the leadership's increasing concern about an erosion of the central government's authority and widespread disillusionment with Communist rule. 'In some areas public order is poor, and not enough has been done to combat social evils,' Mr Li added. 'The corrupt practices of a few government functionaries . . . have impaired the close ties between the government and people.' China's premier acknowledged 'mistakes' in the government's performance, including a 'fairly sharp rise in prices'. He pledged additional efforts to restrain price rises, but gave little indication of what steps might be taken to curb cost-of-living increases. He announced few new initiatives in his 90-minute address, but reminded delegates that China in its present phase of explosive economic growth was 'presented with a rare historical opportunity'. Among his main points were: China's GDP growth target for this year is 9 per cent. China forecast 8 per cent growth in 1993, but the economy grew by 13 per cent last year and shows little sign of slowing. State enterprises in 'dire straits' would receive some assistance, but in the end 'must rely on their own efforts to extricate themselves from their predicament'. Attempts would be made to accelerate enterprise reform. New capital spending would be restricted to construction projects already under way with special emphasis on China's infrastructure requirements. China should proceed gradually with banking reforms aimed at ensuring that commercial banks are relieved of their policy-lending obligations. A National Development Bank for infrastructure is to be established. Mr Li won applause for remarks that amounted to a slap at Britain over Hong Kong. 'No matter what happens, the Chinese government and people are determined and able to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled and to ensure long-term stability and prosperity there. 'British colonial rule in Hong Kong is coming to an end. No force can stop that.'</p>

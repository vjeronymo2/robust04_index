			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 25 May (AFP) -- A tax on luxury items  (between 10 percent and 30 percent) and wholesale transactions  (10 percent); a new tax code; reforms to the income tax; and a  new fiscal stamp law were approved on Wednesday by President  Rafael Caldera's administration, it was officially reported in  Caracas.    The approval of these taxes and laws complete the package of  new fiscal mechanisms proposed by Caldera. Part of these  mechanisms had been approved earlier -- a tax on bank debits  (0.75 percent) and new laws for the concession of public works  and for a budget.    Caldera received special powers from Congress approximately  one month ago for the implementation of this series of taxes and  tax laws. The powers are valid through today and they authorize  him to issue a decree approving these laws instead of submitting  them for parliamentary discussions.    Upon reporting the approval of these new taxes, with which  the government expects to overcome this year's fiscal gap --  calculated at approximately $6 billion -- Finance Minister Julio  Sosa said the Venezuelan economy is leaning toward  stabilization. Sosa also said that the currency could be  revalued in about two weeks. The bolivar, whose exchange rate  has dropped considerably for a month, has been devalued 30.93  percent, and its parity with the dollar is currently 182  bolivares. Nevertheless, Sosa said that parity could rise to  150 bolivares in approximately 15 days.</p>

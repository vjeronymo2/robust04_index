			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $135 MILLION IN SHAM PROFITS CITED AT LINCOLN S&amp;L  </P> <P> Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan generated $135 million in sham profits  through overpriced sales of land to "straw" buyers, an accounting expert  testified Friday in U.S. District Court here.  </P> <P> About half of Lincoln's earnings between 1984 and its seizure by the government  in 1989 came from the dubious sale of land in the Phoenix area, said Roger  Johnson, a witness for the federal government.  </P> <P> In a separate proceeding in federal court in Los Angeles, the brokerage firm  Drexel Burnham Lambert and its one-time junk bond guru Michael Milken were  added as defendants in a class-action lawsuit against Lincoln Savings Chairman  Charles H. Keating Jr. that claims investors lost $200 million investing in  worthless securities sold by the thrift's parent.  </P> <P> Neither Drexel Burnham nor Milken could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The investor suit charges that Milken knew that Lincoln's parent company --  American Continental Corp. of Phoenix -- was no longer able to issue debt  through the traditional means of an underwritten public offering and instead  chose to sell its debt illegally through its Lincoln branches in Southern  California.  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham underwrote American Continental debt, and American Continental  purchased junk bonds from Drexel Burnham. The suit said Milken aided American  Continental and Lincoln in engaging in false commercial real estate and  securities transactions.  </P> <P> The failure of Lincoln may ultimately cost the government $2 billion to  liquidate or dismantle the institution, the costliest case in the massive wave  of S&amp;L shutdowns. American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection last  April 13, and Lincoln was seized by federal regulators the next day.  </P> <P> In Washington, American Continental is suing the federal government to overturn  the seizure of Lincoln. Judge Stanley Sporkin is conducting a mini-trial  dealing with some of the complex real estate and tax transactions. He is trying  to determine whether American Continental should be entitled to a full trial on  its complaint that regulators acted unfairly in seizing Lincoln in April, 1989.  </P> <P> Johnson, who spent a full day on the stand for direct testimony and cross  examination, said he was "shocked" by Lincoln's "contrived transactions" in the  sale of land. The S&amp;L "ended up having more paper than cash" after its  dealings with various companies, said Johnson, a partner with Kenneth Leventhal  &amp; Co., an accounting firm.  </P> <P> After examining 15 transactions for which Lincoln claimed $135 million, "I felt  no profits should be booked," the accountant said. The buyers "did not have  sufficient cash" in the properties purchased from Lincoln, he said. The buyer  "has to have his own cash in the deal," and if the market goes bad, he will  still be "motivated to complete the deal," according to the accountant.  </P> <P> One of Lincoln's main land projects, the Hidden Valley ranch in an undeveloped  section of Maricopa County west of Phoenix, is unlikely to be developed for the  remainder of the century, Johnson testified. Lincoln bought the land at an  average price of $3,000 an acre in 1985 and 1986, and began selling it at  $16,000 an acre in 1987 and 1988, the witness said.  </P> <P> Johnson described the complex transactions enabling Lincoln to record hefty  profits.  </P> <P> In March, 1987, Lincoln had an appraisal on 1,000 acres of its Hidden Valley  property saying the land was worth $8.5 million.  </P> <P> On March 31, Lincoln sold the land to Westcontinental Mortgage &amp;  Investment, or Westcon, for $14 million and recorded a profit of $11 million.  Lincoln received a $3.5-million cash down payment and a note for $10.5 million  from Westcon, a company that originally had a net worth of $30,000 and assets  of $87,000.  </P> <P> How could the buyer, Westcon, "service that type of debt?" Johnson wondered.  </P> <P> On March 30, a day before the land sale to Westcon, Lincoln loaned $19 million  in cash to E. C. Garcia Co., a Tucson development firm. E. C. Garcia, in turn,  gave a $3.5-million loan to Westcon, providing the cash needed as down payment  for buying the Hidden Valley land from Lincoln.  </P> <P> Westcon "was operating as a straw buyer . . . (with) none of their own cash  involved," Johnson said.  </P> <P> In June, 1988, E. C. Garcia Co. assumed the $10.5-million note owed by Westcon  to Lincoln. "I can find no evidence there was ever a payment by Westcon or  Garcia on the $10.5-million note," Johnson said.  </P> <P> The accountant described another deal in which Lincoln sold $6 million worth of  land to Hidden Valley Limited Partnership. The partnership "was basically a  shell set up with $100 in capital," Johnson said, using funds transmitted  through a series of transactions from American Continental.  </P> <P> United Press International contributed to this story.  </P></p>

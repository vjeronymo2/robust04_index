			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] The violent incidents that have taken place in  recent days because of illegal departures from the country  highlight the harmful effects of the immigration policy of the  United States, a place where certain Cubans would like to go,  whether temporarily or permanently, but they are prevented from  traveling there because of obstacles erected by Washington.    The Cuban Foreign Ministry has explained the reasons for  tightening security measures around some embassies in Havana  following the forceful entry by 121 Cubans into the Belgian  ambassador's residence, from where they are demanding to be  permitted to leave the country.    The Foreign Ministry has also reported that two Canadian  citizens were arrested because of their participation in an  illegal departure attempt that resulted in the death of two  people.    Saturday [4 June], a group of Cubans seized a sand barge in  the port of Mariel. This action resulted in an incident in  which a National Border Guard boat pursued the vessel until it  reached international waters.    At the end of May, a Cuban couple died after being swindled  by a person who convinced them that he could guide them through  the mine fields around Guantanamo Naval Base, where they were  attempting to go in a bid to reach the United States. Both  within and outside of Cuba, there are those who encourage  illegal departures of people who do not believe they can travel  to the United States legally.    In 1993, only some 1,600 Cubans received visas to travel to  the United States directly, despite a bilateral agreement that  permits the granting of 20,000 visas annually. More than 60  percent of the visa requests from people under the age of 40 are  rejected each year by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.  Coincidentally, most of the people who cross the Straits of  Florida in fragile boats are young people between the ages of 20  and 30.    It should not be overlooked that some Cubans are attracted  to  the United States because of the possibility of improving their  economic situation. They try to get there by any means, leaving  behind undeniable limitations in Cuba.    As a result of the Readjustments Act, any Cuban, regardless  of his reasons for or mode of arriving in the United States, can  receive refugee status in that country. All these people have  to do is reach U.S. territory and stay there for one year.    As long as the United States grants these privileges and  prevents those Cubans who adhere to legitimate procedures from  traveling to the United States for economic reasons or to visit  their relatives, drastic actions that almost always end  tragically will be possible.</p>

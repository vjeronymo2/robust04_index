			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Samir Ghawshah, member of the </F> Palestinian National Authority and the PLO Executive Committee,  in Tunis by Fawzi al-Jundi in Cairo; date not given; from the  "Dialogue from Afar" program--recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, what is the status of  the preparations for the Palestinian National Authority [PNA] to  assume its duties in Gaza and Jericho and for President Yasir  'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule areas?    [Ghawshah] Preparations are continuing for the arrival of  brother Abu-'Ammar and members of the Palestinian leadership and  PNA in the homeland in the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip to  assume their duties, embark on a new phase in the reconstruction  process, and continue the negotiations for Israel's withdrawal  from all the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, including  the city of Jerusalem. We hope that the Palestinian leaders  will arrive in the homeland in the next few days.    [Al-Jundi] Have enough security measures been taken to  ensure  Abu-'Ammar's arrival in the self-rule areas, especially  following recent threats by Israeli elements?    [Ghawshah] We believe that these statements aim to create  confusion and to prevent implementation of the agreement. But  we are confident that our people will foil all the settlers'  attempts to disrupt the implementation of the agreement. The  PLO, backed by our people, will undoubtedly put an end to all  the plots and the plans to endanger the lives of our people and  leaders.    [Al-Jundi] The issue of Palestinian establishments in  Jerusalem has recently been raised. Is there is an intention to  let these establishments continue their work or will they be  moved to the Palestinian self-rule area in Gaza and Jericho?    [Ghawshah] The whole world, including the United Nations and  international legitimacy, have issued several resolutions  stressing that Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian and Arab  territories occupied during the June 1967 war. Therefore, we  are holding on to all our national establishments in Jerusalem.  On the other hand, we believe that the Declaration of  Principles agreement has stipulated that no changes or  alterations should be made on the status of Jerusalem and that  this issue will be discussed when the negotiations over the  final phase begin.    [Al-Jundi] It was recently announced that secret talks were  held between Palestinian and Israeli officials on the Jerusalem  issue. How true are these reports?    [Ghawshah] I have no information about any secret talks. Our  stance on Jerusalem is firm and well-known, namely that it is  part of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967.    [Al-Jundi] The development process in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho undoubtedly requires a serious commitment from the donor  countries. The Palestinian side expressed satisfaction with the  recent meeting in Paris of the committee coordinating aid to the  Palestinians.    [Ghawshah] The aid and support we are talking about is  partial because the reality facing us is this: Our homeland was  occupied by Israel for 27 years during which the infrastructure  was completely destroyed, its economy damaged, and its  establishments hit. Therefore, we regard any aid to be partial.  Of course, we are grateful to all those who have given aid,  regardless of the amount. But this is just the beginning and it  is part of much bigger needs. Our people's efforts and resources  will provide the major share of what we need. We believe that  the partial aid given so far is necessary for beginning our  work. But we stress that these sums are not enough. Therefore,  all Palestinian resources must be mobilized while welcoming  every Arab and international effort and backing to continue the  process of establishing our national authority toward the goal  of creating our Palestinian independent state with Jerusalem as  its capital.    [Al-Jundi] Is there a specific strategy for Palestinian  action in the coming stage on the comprehensive development  process that the Palestinian self-rule area in Gaza and Jericho  requires?    [Ghawshah] The PNA members are preparing a draft plan on all  the requirements of the development process to mobilize all  resources and intensify all efforts to carry out a correct and  sound building process and exploit every cent in the right way  to alleviate our people's pain and build our homeland.    [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, thank you from the Voice of  the Arabs.    [Ghawshah] You are welcome.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: EVERT EXPECTING; FRAYN BOMBS; ROONEY WRITING  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT: Chris Evert and husband Andy Mill, who according to  Wimbledon tongue waggers, are expecting a little racqueteer before the year  ends. . . . Popular British playwright ("Noises Off") Michael Frayn's new one,  "Look, Look," had to be looked at very quickly indeed. It lasted a fast four  weeks in London's West End. . . . Director Ingmar Bergman's daughter, Anna, who  has been engaged five times in the past 11 years, says she plans to throw  caution to the wind and wed London accountant Douglas Allen in August. We'll  see. . . . In Las Vegas, they are wondering where Frank Sinatra will perform  after he leaves Bally's in September. Sinatra never stays at one watering hole  too long. The smart money bets Ole Blue Eyes will appear next at the Riviera. .  . . Mickey Rooney, penning his memoirs for Random House, is writing without the  aid of a ghost. The Mick says he's tired of movie stars coming out with books  they really didn't write. . . . Paul McCartney, now in the midst of a  tremendously successful tour, tells friends he wants to take it easy after this  grind is all over and sail around the world with wife Linda for a couple of  years! Well, Paul can afford it. He's the wealthiest ex-Mop Top.  </P> <P> NASTASSJA KINSKI is NOT getting a divorce, and she is NOT pregnant. That's what  Kinski's esteemed agent, Robert Lantz, emphatically told us. Reports to the  contrary are untrue. The actress is just wrapping a film in the Soviet Union  and will soon be joining her producer-hubby Ibrahim Moussa and their two  children at the family's villa in Rome. Everybody's together and happy. So  there.  </P> <P> OSCAR-WINNING composer John Barry ("Born Free," "A Lion In Winter," "Out of  Africa") has been signed to compose and direct the score of Kevin Costner's  labor of love, "Dances With Wolves." Costner is the star, director and producer  of this tale of a Sioux Indian tribe during the Civil War.  </P> <P> AVA GARDNER and Barbara Stanwyck died within five days of each other early this  year -- two of the great and, to our mind, often underrated ladies of the  screen. Stanwyck seemed always to trail Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the  public consciousness, though her talent and versatility were equal. Gardner's  beauty and her high-velocity private life were so overwhelming that critics  were often blinded to her genuine ability.  </P> <P> Now these wrongs have been redressed somewhat in the current issue of Film  Comment, which contains an extraordinarily perceptive tribute to Ava and  Barbara titled "Farewell My Lovelies" by Kathleen Murphy. This is must reading  for fans.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 12 November the Science and Technology Agency  signed an agreement for a Japan/Russia cooperation plan that  includes among other things installing an abnormal sound  detection system in a Russian nuclear reactor. This is part of  Japan's policy to provide aid to Russia in improving safety in  reactors of the former Soviet Union (RBMK reactors).    The abnormality detection system involves installing a high  temperature-resistant, radiation-resistant microphone in the  reactor containment vessel. It works by detecting abnormal  sounds produced by leaks, etc., inside the reactor and warning  the operators with an alarm. The system has a signal processing  device to distinguish abnormal sounds from the sounds caused by  vibration, etc., that accompany normal reactor operation, and it  uses an acoustic filter to detect only the abnormal sounds.    This is implementation of cooperative research based on the  Japan/Russia Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. The detection system  with the microphone will be installed in the Sosunoviboru  [phonetic] NPP II (formerly Leningrad NPP II) by the end of  1996. The costs for the first year are expected to be about  &yen;960,000,000.</p>

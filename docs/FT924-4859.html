			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on ERM NOBODY can say for certain that tensions in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism are over, and there will be a strong focus this week on the D-Mark's performance against the weaker ERM currencies, writes James Blitz. The Irish authorities will continue to make a concerted effort to defend the Irish punt this week, and overnight rates are due to be set at around 100 per cent from today. There may be more intense pressure on the French franc. The French currency fell through the FFr3.40 to the D-Mark level last week. Many analysts continue to think that if there is strong pressure on the currency it will come in the New Year, because dealers do not want to keep positions open for long towards the year end. The market remains undecided about whether the dollar can make a concerted break through the DM1.61 level this year. Despite the uncertainties over the ERM last week, the dollar failed to break through this level. But according to strategists at IBJ International, there is a growing perception that the currency will strengthen on further signs of economic recovery. Friday's non-farm payroll figure will give some further indication of the scale of the economic upturn. However, the figure would have to be particularly bad to prompt any easing in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Sterling was mostly sidelined last week, with strong support at DM2.42 and resistance at DM2.44. With relatively little economic data due out this week, the currency is likely to be confined to these ranges. The sharp rise in Canadian prime lending rates in the last two weeks has strengthened the Canadian dollar. There will be caution ahead of the government's economic statement on Wednesday.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / The Long View: Britain's rebalancing actor WHERE IS Europe going? I spent a fascinating few days last week in Paris at the congress of the European Federation of Financial Analysts' Societies, a meeting originally planned to focus upon the integration of Europe's capital markets but condemned in the event to rake over the half-dismantled debris of the exchange rate mechanism. Yet the view from Paris is very different to that from London. Per Westerberg, the Swedish minister of industry and commerce, gave an impressive exposition of the determination of a small non-EC country (but aspiring member) to stay with the DM at any price and to retain international credibility. 'Our currency must be defended by any means necessary,' he said, not quite the attitude of our own Norman Lamont. Elsewhere the French finance minister Michel Sapin was cocky and triumphalist as he declared final victory in the battle of the franc. But French companies, it should be said, were becoming quite apprehensive at the thought of what the victory might cost them. It is a short five months since the dream of convergence was unexpectedly shattered by the Danish referendum result. Suddenly the politicians and the financial markets were forced to look at the facts, and it was clear that too many EC member states were not converging at all. Now the UK and Italy are out in the cold and Spain hangs in the ERM only with the aid of a devaluation, exchange controls and 15 per cent interest rates. You can argue that the mid-September crisis was just the first step towards a more or less complete breakdown of the ERM. Once the true consequences of over-valuation of the DM become clear even France will be forced to stand aside, leaving only a few small countries bordering Germany - and more or less integrated into its economy - linked to the DM. The historical parallel would be with the 1930s when France obstinately stayed on the gold standard until 1936 but suffered grievous economic damage as a consequence. A quite different interpretation, however, is that the ERM is actually much stronger for having got rid of its weaker participants. Convergence among the remaining nine members may now proceed much more rapidly, and effective monetary union could be attained even more quickly than has been suggested by the Maastricht timetable. The Bundesbank, on this line of reasoning, will now be much more responsive to the needs of Germany's remaining partners than it ever was to Italy and the UK which, with some justification, it placed in the second rank. However, the ability of Spain, Portugal and Ireland to stay the course must be in doubt. Moreover the populations of the UK, Italy and Spain together add up to nearly half the EC's 340m total. If Germany, France and the rest go on to the monetary fast track there would be a clear risk of splitting the EC in half, a division that would be accentuated if would-be members like Sweden, Switzerland and Austria were subsequently admitted, helped by their close-to-impeccable monetary credentials. The prospects for the UK rejoining the ERM look pretty slim, and the nationalists in the Commons (and the Lords) are enjoying a spell of intoxicating publicity for their anti-Continental prejudices. After all, life does not seem so uncomfortable outside the ERM club. What the Treasury said only a few months ago was impossible has happened: interest rates (the short-term kind, anyway) have been reduced outside the mechanism, and are lower than in Germany. People have not yet been hit by higher prices and higher taxes. Nevertheless, I think that the UK will eventually rejoin the ERM for the same reason that we originally entered in 1990, that life had become too difficult outside. The big difference will be that whereas last time we joined almost as a favour to the rest of Europe and at an exchange rate which we barely bothered to notify, let alone justify, to the Bundesbank, next time we shall enter on our knees and humbly accepting a string of conditions. It is unlikely to happen in less than four years, and will depend upon a substantial fall in German short-term interest rates, but sometimes events can move faster than you expect. Suppose that there is a further big fall in the value of sterling, and interest rates have to go up sharply to prevent a collapse of confidence? It might be necessary to look around for external support. Remember that after sterling was floated in 1972 it took just four years of economic mismanagement to take us to the door of the IMF. For the time being, unlike Italy, which is in a still worse economic plight, the UK has been able to cut short-term interest rates. But we cannot reduce long-term rates, which remain higher - in some cases substantially so - than in Germany, the US or Japan. There is the risk of a public sector funding crisis next year which foreigners will not be at all keen to assist in solving; there are few natural overseas holders of sterling any more, now that it carries no ERM badge of quality. City estimates of 1993-94's public sector borrowing requirement are creeping up past Pounds 50bn, and that is without reckoning the cost of the industrial or financial bailouts which are becoming all too likely. For the international financial analysts the UK has now become peripheral. Global investors like to simplify their task by dividing the world into blocs, and countries which stand outside them may have to bear a risk premium. In the case of Italy this is already large, and Italian government securities are coming to be regarded as junk bonds. Britain is a long way further up the creditworthiness league table, but analysts in Paris, Frankfurt and Zurich will note that Norman Lamont is 'rebalancing' policy away from the control of inflation and towards growth. They will understand what that means in any language.</p>

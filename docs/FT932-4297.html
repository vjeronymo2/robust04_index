			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / US urges EC to curb high-tech sales to Iran THE US yesterday pressed the European Community to curb sales of high technology to Iran on the grounds that the Tehran regime is seeking to develop nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, launched the initiative during a meeting with EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg in which he implicitly criticised European companies for selling 'dual use' technology to Iran - items with both civilian and military applications. Mr Christopher noted pointedly that the US had curbed its sales in this area 'at considerable cost' to its export industries. He urged the Europeans to support the idea that Iran should not enjoy normal commercial relations. After the meeting, both sides agreed to launch a joint EC-US study on Iran's effort to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the problem of nuclear non-proliferation. This will include sharing of intelligence, and is intended to be part of a collective western effort to prevent more countries joining the nuclear club. Mr Christopher painted Iran as the lead villain in its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction. He called non-proliferation 'the most important issue of the 1990s.' In the past 12 months, the US has become increasingly concerned about Iran's effort to develop nuclear and chemical weapons technology. But it has tended to direct its warnings more at China and Russia rather than the EC. In the 1980s, both US and European companies sold dual-use technology to Iraq to bolster President Saddam Hussein during his war with Iran. The sales were carried out with the approval of western governments, including the Bush administration, because of the fear of the spread of Islamic fundamentalism into the Middle East. The US focus on Iran appeared to take aback some EC member states. Though all of the Twelve agree with the need to step up non-proliferation efforts, the consensus is that other countries such as Syria and Iraq also need to be put on the watch-list.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ILLEGAL ALIENS DRAWN TO 'LUCKY' AUSTRALIA  </P> <P> Thousands of people sneak into Australia every year, lured by its image as the  "lucky country" where space and wealth are easy to find.  </P> <P> Illegal immigrants, given scant attention in the past when they were relatively  few in number, are receiving increasing scrutiny as a result of an emotional  public debate over the influx of Asians into Australia's predominantly white  society.  </P> <P> Although most illegals are Europeans who have overstayed tourist visas, concern  over immigration generally has focused attention on Asians and South Pacific  islanders.  </P> <P> Almost half the visitors from mainland China, tiny Tonga and Fiji drop out of  sight when their visas expire.  </P> <P> Most illegal immigrants find it easy to get regular jobs because of the relaxed  local approach to rules and regulations, but many find it equally easy to key  into Australia's social services.  </P> <P> The government is now facing a bill of up to $380 million in social service  costs every year from illegal immigrants who use health services and draw  unemployment benefits without paying taxes.  </P> <P> The total number of illegal immigrants is not certain but government and social  service agencies estimate it at between 80,000 and 100,000 -- among 17 million  people scattered around a land the size of the continental United States.  </P> <P> About 750,000 visitors arrive legally every year, mostly tourists and business  people. Immigration service figures show that most illegal immigrants are  simply people who have overstayed their visas by as little as one day.  </P> <P> Only a handful actually enter the country illegally to join the estimated  15,000 people who overstay or breach their visas. About 4,000 of these are  tracked down and deported, officials said.  </P> <P> Drug-runners and fishermen exploit the vastness of Australia's desolate  northern coastline to drop the more gullible would-be new Australians into one  of the least welcoming environments in the world. Few escape attention long  enough to slip from the Outback into the cities.  </P> <P> Government amnesties for some 15,000 illegal immigrants in 1976 and 1980 have  encouraged hopes of further truces.  </P> <P> "But after the amnesties, more illegal immigrants entered Australia hoping for  further amnesties. There will never be an amnesty again and we regularly spread  the message through our foreign missions," a senior immigration official said.  </P> <P> The fact that the majority of illegal immigrants are from Britain has done  little to dispel popular concern that Australia is facing a major problem with  Asian immigration.  </P> <P> Australia accepts about 140,000 immigrants every year, and about 40% of the  population are immigrants, or their descendants, from 140 countries.  </P> <P> Up to 1945 some 90% of Australians were of British or Irish origin. Only about  20% of the 115,000 immigrants who arrived during 1986 and 1987 came from  Britain and Ireland. The biggest group, 32%, was from Asia, according to latest  official statistics.  </P> <P> The trend has given rise to anti-Asian sentiment here, almost 16 years after a  "White Australia" policy favoring English-speaking Anglo-Saxons was officially  buried.  </P> <P> Race Discrimination Commissioner Irene Moss said the illegal immigrants make  her job more difficult because of the general fear that they are mostly Asians.  </P> <P> A dozen members of a racist group, linked to the extreme right-wing Australian  Nationalist Movement, were recently charged with more than 100 offenses ranging  from the fire-bombing of Chinese restaurants and assault to housebreaking.  Their cases are pending.  </P> <P> The government has no power to deal with racist groups until they commit a  physical act of discrimination. Distribution of racist leaflets and other  material is not illegal.  </P></p>

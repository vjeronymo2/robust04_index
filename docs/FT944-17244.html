			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Iraq Menaces Kuwait: Washington takes no chances No-one in Washington finds it easy to believe that President Saddam Hussein would try to repeat his 1990 invasion of Kuwait, particularly at a season when clear skies would leave his army, bereft of air cover, at the mercy of US and allied aircraft. But no-one wants to take a chance on it. Iraq's reinforcement of the troops it already has in position near its border with Kuwait has left US officials in considerable uncertainty. 'We can't afford to assume that this is just a bluff. That's why we're taking the actions we're taking,' Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said on Saturday. Those actions include sending 4,000 US troops to reinforce the Kuwaiti army  -although this is clearly not a large enough contingent to repel a full-scale assault on its own. More important, the US has moved aircraft and cruise missiles within striking range. 'We clearly have the capacity to go to downtown Baghdad,' said Lieutenant General John Sheehan, operations director at the Pentagon. US officials are anxious to ensure that Mr Saddam has not miscalculated President Bill Clinton's willingness to emulate the firmness his predecessor, George Bush, showed in 1990, or the degree to which the US military involvement in Haiti might limit its willingness or ability to respond to Iraqi aggression. 'I want to make clear one more time: it would be a grave error for Iraq to repeat the mistakes of the past, or to misjudge either American will or American power,' Mr Clinton said on Saturday. Although the Iraqi troop build-up in itself does not breach the terms of the ceasefire imposed after Operation Desert Storm drove the Iraqi army out of Kuwait in 1991, the US is also anxious that Baghdad should not conclude that such threatening gestures are the best way to persuade the UN Security Council to ease its economic sanctions, notably a ban on oil sales, which remain in place today. 'If Iraq really is trying to say in some insistent way that what they want is relief from the UN sanctions, there is a clear way for them to achieve that relief: simply comply with the United Nations resolutions,' Mr Clinton said. Some diplomats suggest that Mr Saddam has concluded that the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia will never allow the sanctions to be lifted so long as he remains in power, regardless of the extent to which Iraq complies with the resolutions. This may be true, though US officials tend to reverse the argument, and say they doubt that Iraq will ever comply with the resolutions so long as Mr Saddam remains in power. Whatever the truth, Baghdad has never come remotely close to testing the hypothesis. Although a system to monitor Iraq's weapons programmes has been set up - Mr Rolf Ekeus, the head of the United Nations special commission in charge of the monitoring, is due to report to the Security Council today - Iraq still refuses to comply with important segments of the UN resolutions. Most notably, Baghdad still refuses to recognise Kuwaiti sovereignty or the border between the two countries mapped out by the UN. The US, meanwhile, does not want to overreact to what may prove to be simply posturing, but wants to be prepared in case tension should escalate. The forces the Pentagon has moved to the region, though well short of the massive expeditionary force of Desert Storm, are believed to be enough to react strongly to any provocation.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian company acquires S African platinum prospect INTERNATIONAL Platinum, a Canadian exploration company that has so far confined its efforts to North America, has acquired control of a platinum prospect in South Africa. IP is buying Jamestone Exploration, the main shareholder in which is Mr James Hamilton, a South African geologist. Mr Jamestone has in turn exercised an option on a property previously held by Britain's RTZ, near the Northam platinum mine in the western Transvaal. Mr Glen Varty, IP's president, said that IP is now looking for a partner to carry out further drilling work on the property. Part of the funds for the exploration work will come from the proceeds of a recent CDollars 305,000 (Pounds 150,000) private placement, which has resulted in an Australian company, Turnbull Doyle Resources of Melbourne, acquiring a 20 per cent stake in IP. The chairman of Turnbull Doyle is Mr Neville Wran, who was premier of New South Wales from 1976 to 1986. IP, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange and on Nasdaq, has nine platinum exploration properties in Canada and the US state of Michigan. But Mr Varty said that with the improved political situation in South Africa, 'it's attractive to be back down there'.</p>

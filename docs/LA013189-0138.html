			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTIAGO STILL CHALLENGING DESPITE ADVERSITY  </P> <P> Given the Rancho Santiago College basketball team's propensity toward injury or  illness this season, one would figure the Dons to be at the bottom of the  Orange Empire Conference standings.  </P> <P> But with determination and a few bandages, the players have been able to hang  together to remain only a game behind conference-leading Riverside.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago (15-8 overall, 5-2 in conference), with 4 consecutive  victories, plays host to Cypress Wednesday while Saddleback is at Riverside.  The Dons travel to Riverside Saturday.  </P> <P> Troubles began for Rancho Santiago with the start of the season, when freshman  center Corie Blount suffered an ankle injury and decided to redshirt.  </P> <P> Just about the time conference play began in early January, forward Mike Hunter  came down with the flu and missed a game. Starting center Matt Lien and reserve  guard Tommy Villanueva were also slowed by the flu the past 2 weeks.  </P> <P> Starter Tony Smalley missed 2 games with a groin injury. Smalley, a sophomore  forward, has played in a reserve role in the last 2 games.  </P> <P> Another starter, freshman guard Craig Rice, hurt his ankle and has missed the  last 2 games. And sophomore guard Chris Martin injured his wrist during  practice, but is playing with it wrapped.  </P> <P> "Someone asked me if we would be better once everyone was healthy," Rancho  Santiago Coach Dana Pagett said. "If that happens, then I will have a problem  of not knowing who to play. Actually, this might be better for us. We have so  many players that are even that it really helped push the freshmen into  playing."  </P> <P> One of the freshmen who have emerged during this difficult time is guard Alvin  Loftis, who scored a career-high 22 points as Rancho Santiago defeated  Fullerton, 69-59, Saturday.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of guys out," Loftis said. "It gave me my chance to start and  things have worked out pretty well since then."  </P> <P> Ready for spring sports? Well, wait no longer. The baseball season starts  Friday. Cypress and Orange Coast, the early picks to contend for the Orange  Empire Conference title, both begin play in the College of the Desert  tournament.  </P> <P> The teams shared the tournament title last season and OCC won it the year  before.  </P> <P> "I'm ready to get started," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. "It will be nice  to start playing games that mean something."  </P> <P> Cypress opens with Chaffey at Angel Stadium in Palm Springs at 2:30 p.m., and  OCC plays at host College of the Desert at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago, runner-up in the state to Sacramento City last season, opens  Friday at San Diego Southwestern at 2 p.m. Saddleback is at Rio Hondo Friday at  2 p.m.  </P> <P> Saturday, Fullerton plays host to Los Angeles Valley at noon, and Golden West  is at San Diego Southwestern at 1 p.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Community College Notes  </P> <P> Sophomore point guard Elbert Davis of Golden West is leading the state with 8.6  assists per game and already has set a Golden West career record with 411  assists. Davis, from Santiago High School, set the Golden West single-season  assist record with 195 last season and has 216 so far this season. Davis'  teammate, sophomore Markus Muller-Stach of Corona del Mar High, has scored  1,140 points in his career and is in third place on the Golden West all-time  list. He needs 18 points to tie second-place Truiett Hatton (1978-79 and  1981-82). Chris Thompson (1969-71) heads the list with 1,441 points. . . . Ian  Donnelly, a freshman forward at Cypress, injured his knee last week and no time  is set for his return. Donnelly, who started 7 games, averaged 7.7 points and  4.2 rebounds. He was 38 of 40 from the free-throw line. . . . With 5 games  remaining, Mike Varos has tied the Cypress single season and career records  with 56 3-pointers. Varos has equaled the mark set by Andy Olivarez, now  playing at USC, during the 1986-87 season. . . . Visiting teams continue to  hold the advantage in Orange Empire Conference men's basketball games. The  visitors are 14-10 through the first 24 games.  </P></p>

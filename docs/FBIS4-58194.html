			<p>BFN     [Text] During its meeting held on 1 May, the PLO Executive  Committee discussed the dangerous situation in Jerusalem. This  holy city is being exposed to the most serious isolation by the  occupation authorities with a view to cutting it off from the  rest of the Palestinian territories and dividing the Palestinian  land itself.    The occupation authorities have taken unprecedented measures  by depriving the Palestinian nationals of their natural right to  enter the city of Jerusalem, including the right to visit holy  Islamic and Christian sites to perform their rites.    These authorities have gone so far as to violate the most  basic rights and human values, including the right to life.  They are preventing doctors, teachers, and employees from  working in the city in their hospitals, schools, and other jobs.  They are also preventing students living outside the city from  going to school. They are preventing women, families, and  couples, some of whom live in the city and others outside it,  from being together.    Discrimination, oppression, and violation of human rights  are  taking place while the Israeli Government is claiming that it  intends to start a new page in its relationship with the  Palestinian people. However, these measures and this harassment  have become more vicious over the past few days under the guise  of steps aimed at preparing for the signing of the first  practical Palestinian- Israeli peace accord.    The PLO regards the encirclement, isolation, repressive  measures, and continuing settlement in Jerusalem and its suburbs  as incompatible with the essence, the foundations, and the texts  of the peace accord, including Israel's commitment through the  exchange of letters not to touch Jerusalem and its civilian and  religious institutions and the rights of Palestinian nationals  in general.    The PLO stresses that these Israeli measures will eventually  undermine the peace moves because Jerusalem's future is a basic  element in the peace process. The PLO also calls on the Arab  and Islamic states to adopt a firm position toward the danger  that is threatening the future of holy Jerusalem and its  steadfast population, especially when Israel is calling for,  under the guise of the peace process, moves toward the  normalization of relations and the lifting of the economic  boycott. It is doing this while it is continuing its dangerous  measures to determine the future of holy Jerusalem by imposing a  fait accompli.    The PLO holds the cosponsors and the states contributing to  the peace process, particularly Russia, the United States, and  the European Community, responsible for this dangerous situation  and its effect on the future of the entire peace process. The  PLO will take a series of measures to protect the future of the  holy city and the population living there and the inalienable  rights of our people in the city. These rights have been  stressed by all of the resolutions of international legitimacy.</p>

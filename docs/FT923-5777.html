			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Conference agrees basis for Bosnian peace deal A TENTATIVE first step towards a long-term solution of the Yugoslav conflict came yesterday, when the London peace conference ended with agreement by all combatants on a framework for a negotiated settlement. But there was still deep scepticism about whether the bitter war waged by Bosnia's Serbs against the Moslem community would allow the survival of an independent Bosnian state. The conference, sponsored by the United Nations and the European Community, agreed on an end to violence and sieges of towns, recognition of current borders, speedier delivery of humanitarian aid, and closing of detention camps. There is to be tighter enforcement of existing sanctions against Serbia. It was also confirmed that Lord Owen - once Labour foreign secretary and former leader of the Social Democrats - would head the EC's Yugoslavia peace effort. He will succeed Lord Carrington, who gave up the role on the eve of the conference. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, said a lengthy period of negotiations lay ahead. They will start in Geneva on September 3, when six committees will start work on the future constitutional status of Bosnia, the role of ethnic minorities in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, and other issues. Mr John Major, the prime minister and co-chairman of the conference, insisted that while there would be 'setbacks', the two days of negotiations had brought closer a peaceful solution of the conflict. But he warned that pressure would continue to be brought to bear on all the warring factions, including tougher sanctions, to press the case for peace. 'We cannot rely on the goodwill of the parties,' he said. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the acting US secretary of state, attempted to reassure Bosnia's Moslems after he delivered a tough message to Bosnia's Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic. 'We will never accept any of the (territorial) gains by Bosnia's Serbs,' Mr Eagleburger said. Earlier in the day, Mr Karadzic had said he was prepared to give back 20 per cent of the land seized by his forces. By threatening tougher sanctions against Serbia, the conference appeared to have made progress despite the fighting in Bosnia. In the latest outbreak, nine people were reported killed when a mortar shell exploded into a queue in a residential part of Sarajevo, the capital. Pressure against the Serbs will be maintained when the nine-nation Western European Union meets in London today. It is expected to impose a naval blockade of Serbia. The agreement reached at the London conference includes: The cessation of violence in Bosnia. This includes the early lifting of sieges of towns and cities; international supervision of heavy weapons; a ban on all military flights and identification of all headquarters and commanders of all armed units, including paramilitaries in the republic. The conference has already asked Mr Boutros Ghali to recommend that the security council posts observers on the Bosnia-Serbian borders and deploys observers in Bosnia to monitor the withdrawal of all heavy weapons. Humanitarian aid. Delivery of aid is to be speeded up by using more international monitors. In addition, refugees should be 'progressively returned' to their homes. Detention camps. All detention camps are to be dismantled and closed immediately. Aid organisations will look at ways of providing temporary accommodation for those released but whose homes have been destroyed. Sanctions. Trade sanctions against Serbia are to be more tightly enforced by monitoring traffic on the river Danube and sending international experts to Serbia's neighbours. The security council will be asked to prevent illegal transfers of financial assets to Serbia and Montenegro and eliminate diversion of goods in transit. First light in bitter imbroglio, Page 2</p>

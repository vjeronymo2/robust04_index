			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [DDP/ADN/ND report: "`Erlangen Model' Against Right-Wing </F> Extremists"]    [Text] Erlangen -- Politicians from Erlangen, who run for  the Bundestag, the Landtag, or the District Council, have  rejected right-wing extremist organizations across all party  lines. In the "Erlangen Model," which is to be copied  elsewhere, 12 politicians from the Christian Social Union [CSU],  Social Democratic Party [SPD], Free Democratic Party [FDP], and  Alliance 90/Greens commit themselves not to participate in  rallies to which members of the Republikaner, the National  Democratic Party of Germany, the German People's Union, "or  similar right-wing extremist organizations are invited as  speakers or as participants in a discussion."    The declaration presented today is based on the "smallest  common denominator," Hans-Hermann Hann of the "Alliance of  Bavarian Town and City Councils Against Xenophobia and  Right-Wing Extremism" stated. The alliance, which was founded  in 1992, groups about 1,500 Bavarian town and city councils.  The signatories certainly can have differing positions. Thus,  the assessment of the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] is not  unanimous. The CSU wanted to extend the declaration to the PDS  and "other left-wing extremist organizations," but the other  parties refused. The CSU signed the declaration nevertheless.</p>

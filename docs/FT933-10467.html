			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / People: Taking the wheel at Cosworth Vickers has turned to the Rover group to fill two gaps in the top management of its Cosworth Engineering subsidiary. Chris Woodwark is ending a 22-year career with Rover and British Leyland, to take over as chief executive of Cosworth, while Rob Oldaker, Rover's chief chassis engineer, is to become engineering director for Cosworth's road engines. Woodwark is making a big leap to the world of high performance engine manufacturing from his present role as managing director of Rover International, where he has been responsible most recently for sales of Rover and Land Rover vehicles in all markets outside Europe. His appointment follows the retirement of Peter Nevitt. Unlike Nevitt, a respected engineer, Woodwark's career has been almost exclusively spent on the commercial side of British Leyland and Rover. He joined British Leyland in international marketing in 1971, and later held jobs such as sales director for Land Rover in Africa, managing director of Leyland Zimbabwe and sales and marketing director of Leyland Trucks. The post at Cosworth will now keep him firmly in touch with the North American market, where he has enjoyed mixed fortunes in recent years. He has currently been planning a big expansion for Land Rover in North America with the expected launch there next year of the successful Discovery fourwheel drive vehicle. At end of the 1980s, however, his US experience was less happy as he struggled in vain to turn the tide for Sterling Motors, Rover's abortive car sales venture in the US. At Cosworth, the outlook is more promising, with Nigel Mansell driving successfully with the Ford Cosworth engine in US IndyCar racing, and Cosworth profits doing their best to compensate for the losses at Vickers' other automotive businesses, most notably Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Turkey promotes hardliners to cabinet THE Turkish government last night announced key cabinet changes, promoting hardliners to both defence and interior ministries in the face of growing public criticism of its handling of the Kurdish crisis. Mr Mehmet Gulhan, a minister of state, is taking over as defence minister and Mr Nahit Mentese, education minister and an old colleague of President Suleyman Demirel, is taking up the law and order brief at the Interior Ministry. The announcement comes in the wake of bloody fighting near Lice in the Kurdish speaking south-east, after the killing of the Diyabakir gendarme commander on Friday sparked off a two-day battle. Security forces used tanks and armoured personnel carriers to regain control of the town. The cabinet changes appear to end any hope that the government may move on further democratic reforms in a bid to undermine growing popular support for the PKK Kurdish separatist party. The government move follows a weekend of intense consultations in Ankara, with Prime Minister Mrs Tansu Ciller meeting army chiefs and the National Security Council. The prime minister says she will travel to the area herself in the next few days. A curfew was still in place in Lice last night, after the government claimed the PKK killed 14 children and eight women in their attack on the town. Mrs Ciller is anxious to appease right-wingers in her party concerned the army may use the latest crisis to call for the reimposition of martial law in the region.</p>

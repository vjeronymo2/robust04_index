An employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit in writing a proposed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt, and the agreement must be in such form that it is legally enforceable. The agreement must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Be in writing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Be signed by both the employee and the creditor agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Specify all the terms of the arrangement for payment; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Contain a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default by the debtor, but such an increase may not result in a deduction that exceeds 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to deduction of a greater amount (5 CFR 550.1104(i)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any proposal under paragraph (a) of this section must be received by the official designated in the notice of intent within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The creditor agency will review a timely and properly submitted repayment proposal by the employee debtor and notify the employee whether the proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable.

			<p>BFN     [Text] It is possible that Sweden will give Estonia  support, both for dismantling nuclear reactors in Paldiski and  for helping the Russian retired officers moving back home from  Estonia. This was revealed during Prime Minister Carl Bildt's  two-day visit to Estonia. Our correspondent in Helsinki  Christina Gustafsson reports:    [Gustafsson] The Baltic News Service, BNS, reports that  Prime  Minister Carl Bildt said -- somewhat surprisingly -- that  Estonia should not sign an agreement like the one between Russia  and Latvia. Prime Minister Bildt did not say which aspects of  the agreement should be different. The Estonian criticism of  the agreement between Russia and Latvia has mainly been that all  retired officers are allowed to stay in Latvia. Ever since the  agreement was signed, the Estonians have stressed that such an  agreement will never be topical for Estonia. Estonia cannot  accept the fact that those officers who have, for example,  worked in the intelligence services, the KGB, or the GRU, would  be allowed to stay on Estonian territory. This constitutes an  all too great security risk, according to the Estonians.    Parallel to Prime Minister Carl Bildt's visit, there was a  new round of talks on the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Estonia. Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin headed the  Russian delegation. He expressed a certain optimism when the  talks were over. He did not think it impossible that an  agreement will be reached enabling the Russian soldiers to leave  Estonia before the last day of August. During the last few  weeks, this timetable has been questioned by the Russians,  because time is starting to run out. The negotiations will  continue next week in Moscow.    The training submarines at the Russian military base in  Paldiski, with two nuclear reactors, are another growing problem  in the negotiations. Prime Minister Carl Bildt visited the top  secret base today and said later that it is easily possible to  tear it down in a couple of weeks. The Russian side says that  it will take from three to 10 years to dismantle the base.  Because the Russians consider that Paldiski contains military  secrets, neither Estonian nor foreign experts will be allowed to  enter the base. The Estonian negotiators are of the opinion  that Paldiski and all other bases should be handed over to  Estonia on the last day of August.</p>

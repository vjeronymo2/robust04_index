			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti job losses played down The receivers to Ferranti International, the UK-based defence electronics group which collapsed on Wednesday, yesterday played down suggestions that up to 14 per cent of the worldwide workforce may lose their jobs. In plans drawn up by management in advance of the company's collapse after the General Electric Company withdrew its takeover bid, 500 employees of the 3,600 workforce were being considered for redundancies. The team of more than 60 receivers from accountants Arthur Andersen have been holding meetings with union representatives to prepare them for possible job losses. Most of the losses would be in the UK, which has a workforce of about 3,000. However, Mr John Talbot, one of the joint receivers and head of insolvency at Andersen, said: 'We are optimistic about the group and the ability to sell many businesses as going concerns.' He said he had received 'lots of expressions of interest' from possible buyers of Ferranti businesses, but that he would not be considering any serious offers until after he had completed more detailed investigations and developed a strategy for the company's future. Sales of some parts of the group would need clearance from the Ministry of Defence because many contracts are for highly sensitive military equipment. A number of companies within the Ferranti group are continuing to trade and have not entered receivership, including the joint ventures and most of its overseas operations. Mr Talbot also confirmed suggestions that he would consider demanding more money from customers on any lossmaking contracts Ferranti was currently undertaking. He said it was 'quite possible' that some customers had already been approached to discuss the position.</p>

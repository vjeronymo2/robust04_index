			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Isabel Becerril] </F>   [Text] Jaime Serra Puche, secretary of commerce and  industrial development, reported that the manufacturing sector  has grown 3.4 percent and the economy 2.9 percent annually over  the past five years. He added that the economic recession hit  bottom in the last quarter and that the economic recovery has  now begun.    Serra Puche said the price index decreased 17 percent  between  1987 and 1992 as a result of the economic opening. He also  reported that between 1989 and 1992, labor productivity  increased by 6 percent annually, a higher rate than that  observed in the United States.    Exports of manufactured products grew more than 225 percent  from 1985 to 1993. In the countries known as the Asian Tigers,  the increase was 170 percent.    According to Serra Puche, such results show that  considerable  progress has been made. "But we cannot stop here. We must  consolidate those achievements and continue to make the efforts  that microeconomic reforms entail," he stressed.    Speaking to Mexican industrialists, Serra Puche said the  country's productive sectors must fully assume their respective  roles in accomplishing this task.    The government, he said, should see that reforms are  implemented at the federal, state, and municipal levels.  Productive sectors must do their part by striving to modernize  and increase competitiveness.    Serra Puche added that attaining superior levels of  competitiveness is a permanent and unavoidable task of all  nations which, like Mexico, are committed to affirming their  sovereignty, promoting growth, and substantially improving the  welfare of the majority.    He said that the experiences of all countries confirm that  competitiveness is the only way to ensure the economic growth  that will allow a better distribution of income and the  satisfaction of housing, health, education, training,  investment, and employment needs in the long term.    He stressed that those are the real demands of social groups  striving to overcome backwardness and neglect and to join modern  life.    Serra Puche noted, however, that lasting solutions to just  social demands will only be found by eliminating the obstacles  to sustained progress in competitiveness and employment. It is  therefore urgent, he said, that productive sectors redouble  their efforts to give all Mexicans broad opportunities for  personal development and individual and collective improvement.    In summarizing his ministry's actions to benefit the  industrial sector, Serra Puche said that the office in charge of  fighting illegal practices issued more than 157 antidumping  resolutions in 1993. The resolutions can be broken down as  follows: 82 in the initial phase of the investigation; 40  provisional resolutions; and 18 final resolutions, five which  have been appealed and 12 of which were dismissed.    He also noted that Nafin [National Financial Bank] funds  totaling 11 billion new pesos have been channeled to benefit  more than 22,500 companies in various sectors. Bancomext,  [National Foreign Trade Bank] also issued credits for more than  24 billion new pesos benefiting 5,300 companies.    Serra Puche said deregulation programs will continue and  will  be strengthened at the federal level. He added that in the last  pact it was agreed to ask state governments to pay special  attention to deregulation measures, particularly those regarding  requirements for opening and operating companies and for cargo  transportation and fares.    In the financial area, the secretary said that efforts were  made from the outset to grant credits to small and medium  enterprises. For that purpose, business cards were issued,  specific lines of credit were created, and other special  mechanisms were established.    The active interest rate, in real terms, remains high, and  in  that sense the financial situation continues to be a matter of  concern for small and medium Mexican enterprises. Nafin,  however, is making great efforts to confront the problem.</p>

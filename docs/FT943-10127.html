			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Truth of the Matter: England's God Why was Sussex vicar Anthony Freeman sacked? Was it a question of theology at all or something altogether more worldly? Don Cupitt, the intellectual founder of the Sea of Faith movement to which Freeman belongs, gives a typically robust and distinctly non-metaphysical response: 'It is all a question of power. 'There is considerable anxiety in the Church because of its financial crisis which makes it turn on those who do not quite fit, people who are homosexual, people whose beliefs are regarded as threatening. Now there is the move to abolish the parson's freehold, which will give the bishops absolute power over people's jobs and housing. 'It is coming as a shock to the English clergy that the legal protections they have always enjoyed are disappearing and that they are now as vulnerable as Catholic priests. There are parallels with what is happening to university teachers, and even the BBC. This is a kind of Birtism.' Welcome to Cupitt's ever-shifting world of free association, conspiracy theory, random signs and stripped illusions. Although sympathetic to the fate of Freeman and other followers of his ideas ('I feel awful that they are getting into difficulties'), he has the slightly detached air of one who can afford to speak freely on a subject which, away from the confines of his Cambridge college, is causing bitter divisions among ordinary Anglicans: can one talk of a non-objective, anti-realist God and still call oneself a Christian? He acknowledges the distance between senior common room and congregation: 'I am trying to bring creativity back into Christian thinking, to make it plural and adventurous, while people seem to want stability and to cling to the old philosophical values. So much of our culture is so old and exhausted, and it is very hard to renew.' Cupitt's own attempt at renewal, beginning with the publication of Taking Leave of God in 1980, has seen him work in the tradition of radical continental philosophy which has not been popular in England; yet he finds this puzzling. 'The talk of English men is in the very highest degree mild, devious, allusive, ironical and indirect . . . it is the strangest paradox of English culture that while we remain intellectually in bondage to Plato and Aristotle, our manner of speech among ourselves has for a century and a half been postmodern,' he wrote in Creation Out of Nothing. Yet the established Anglican Church, far from exploiting this temperamental affinity with radical ways of thinking, has buttoned up; Cupitt looks instead, and improbably, to Rome and the untapped potential of Liberation Theology: 'There are signs in the Roman Catholic Church that the present Pope is so repressive that things are bound to loosen up in the next Papacy.' If, as Cupitt says, we create God and reality from language, rather than the other way around, it is obvious to him that any attempt to police that language must fail. 'Language is oblique and complicated, rather like the conversation between a husband and wife, who respond to the sub-texts in what they are saying, rather than to what is actually said. Language will always find a way of escaping censorship.' Does he not feel insecure about the proposition that language is all there is? 'We need to get used to holding our beliefs lightly, to continually improvising. There is a western metaphorical tradition which emphasises stolidity, down-to-earthness, heaviness, a vocabulary of ponderousness, of a thickly-furnished universe. You only need to compare all those heavy western landscapes, from Rubens to Constable, with the lightness and beauty of Japanese flower and landscape painting. Perhaps only Monet reached that quality, in his final years. The western tradition sees landscape as a lost paradise or in terms of property.' The move from pulpit to pallette is effortless; Cupitt's philosophy sees no meaningful distinction between a religious view of the world and that of the artist. His regret is that the Cubists, the Dadaists, the abstract expressionists of theology have been so comprehensively marginalised. Perhaps they can be eased into the fray by events of the past week; perhaps they will finally be ejected altogether. As England reaches the end of its sweltering spell of thunderous weather, its Church's storm has only just begun.</p>

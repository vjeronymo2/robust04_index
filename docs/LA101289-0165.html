			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS PRICES SLIP AS TRADERS CASH IN GAINS  </P> <P> Stock prices declined for the second straight session Wednesday in selling  attributed to new worries about interest rates and uneasiness about pending and  rumored buyouts.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 6.08 Tuesday, dropped  another 11.97 points to 2,773.36.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones more than 2 to 1 in nationwide  trading of shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> The market got off to a shaky start after Japan announced a higher discount  rate, a move that signaled concern about inflation and surprised traders.  </P> <P> Analysts said traders also found it hard to resist the temptation to cash in  gains from the market's rise to record highs last week and Monday.  </P> <P> The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a dimming of hope that  the Federal Reserve Board will relax its credit policy any time soon.  </P> <P> Interest rates, which had been dropping in recent days in anticipation of  stimulus from the Fed, rose in Wednesday credit-market activity. Hope for lower  rates had been one reason for the market's recent robust gains.  </P> <P> "I would attribute this (market weakness) to (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan,"  said James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott.  "His remarks were absolutely negative, and people are just now realizing what  he's saying."  </P> <P> High interest rates choke off investment and make stocks less attractive than  bonds and other, more liquid assets such as money market funds.  </P> <P> Other analysts said the market was due for a pullback and that Greenspan's  comments just provided a timely excuse.  </P> <P> "I think the market was a little overly aggressively bought earlier this week,  and this is a technical setback," said Lewis Smith, a technical analyst at Bear  Stearns.  </P> <P> On the mergers and acquisitions front, AMR shares fell 4 1/4, to 97 1/8, in  active trading, on word that the company was asking for legislation to help it  ward off investor Donald J. Trump's takeover bid.  </P> <P> In other airline stocks, USAir Group fell 2 5/8, to 46 1/2, and Delta Air Lines  was down 2 5/8, at 77 1/8.  </P> <P> Ramada Inc. fell 2 1/4, to 11. The company said it was taking off the market an  offering of debt securities that had been part of its restructuring plan.  </P> <P> Gulf States Utilities, the most traded issue on the Big Board, tumbled 2 1/8,  to 12 1/8. A Louisiana judge rejected the company's attempt to raise  electricity rates to cover $1.4 billion in costs associated with a nuclear  power plant.  </P> <P> Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1/4 at 45, American  Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1/2 at 42 1/2, International Paper, down 1 at  54 3/4, and International Business Machines, down 1/2 at 107 3/4.  </P> <P> Big Board volume was 164.07 million shares, up from 147.56 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The surprise hike in Japan's discount rate threw the Tokyo stock market for a  loop, but it landed nearly right side up and investors said the market would be  back on track after a few days. The Nikkei index of 225 key issues plunged  370.60 points on news of the rate rise, but closed just 136.28 points off, at  35,240.07.  </P> <P> In London, share prices closed unchanged, largely due to gains in key blue chip  stocks rather than any change in sentiment about Britain's high interest rates  or the weak pound. The Financial Times 100-share index closed at 2,218.8,  unchanged from Tuesday's closing.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices declined Wednesday in dull trading.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell about 1/2 point, or $5 for  every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price declines,  jumped to 8.05% from 8.01% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said some traders continued to take advantage of gains from last  week's rally, but there were no fresh developments to affect the market.  </P> <P> "Nothing is going on in our market," said Elizabeth Reiners, a vice president  at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "It doesn't seem to want to move; it needs new  information to move it one way or another."  </P> <P> Market participants were looking forward to Friday's scheduled government  report on September wholesale prices as a potential factor in bond prices.  </P> <P> Traders are "looking with some apprehension" toward the report, said John  Sebastian, executive vice president of Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in  Chicago. If the data show a resurgence of inflationary pressures, they could  knock down bond prices, he said.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government  issues slipped 1/32 point to 1/16 point; intermediate maturities declined 3/32  point to 5/16 point and long-term issues fell 9/32 point to 1/2 point,  according to figures from Telerate Inc., a financial information service.  </P> <P> Movement of one point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks,  was quoted late in the day at 8.813%, down from 8.875% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Frozen pork belly futures climbed sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  boosted by stronger cash markets, shrinking supplies and bullish technical  signals.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, livestock, energy and precious metals were mostly  higher and grain futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Frozen pork bellies settled 1.10 to 1.22 cents higher, with the contract for  delivery in February at 47.72 cents a pound. The rally erased most of the  losses of the three previous sessions.  </P> <P> Pork belly prices have been recovering slowly since early September. They slid  to 18-year lows during the summer as supplies piled up in warehouses, partly  due to declining consumption of bacon.  </P> <P> The government's decision to add pork bellies to the U.S. program of food aid  to Poland helped get the market moving again last month, as did a drop in  retail prices for bacon that some consumers apparently found irresistible.  </P> <P> The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday reported a 2.4-million-pound  decline last week in supplies of pork bellies stored in warehouses outside of  Chicago.  </P> <P> "As much as anything, the bellies are getting energy from fairly good  out-movement," said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with AgriVisor Services Inc. in  Bloomington, Ill.  </P> <P> Live cattle futures settled 0.10 to 0.35 cent higher, with October at 73.20  cents a pound. Feeder cattle were 0.20 to 0.60 cent higher, with October at  83.15 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.30 cent lower to 0.40 cent higher, with  October at 47.62 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Gold futures rose slightly. Silver made substantial gains on New York's  Commodity Exchange. Analysts said the silver price had been due for a  correction since it fell 23 cents an ounce in the last four sessions.  </P></p>

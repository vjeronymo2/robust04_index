			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel down Eurotunnel's announcement that revenue for 1994 would be in the region of Pounds 34m, and not the Pounds 137m forecast at the time of the May rights issue, left the shares down 7 at 221p, the lowest level since February 1988. This was far worse than even the most pessimistic London analyst had expected and the company now has very few friends in the City. UBS reiterated a sell notice which has been in place for a record-breaking seven years. Few houses had any clear idea of where Eurotunnel's trading patterns go from here. The general consensus was that if another immediate cash call has been avoided there could yet be painful decisions early in the new year.</p>

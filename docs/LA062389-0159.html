			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH SIDESTEPS CIVIL RIGHTS STAND;  </P> <P> FAMILIES OF WORKERS SLAIN BY KLAN GET NO COMMITMENT  </P> <P> The families of three civil rights workers slain 25 years ago by Ku Klux  Klansmen said they pressed President Bush today to back legislation to offset  recent Supreme Court rulings "that have so badly eroded civil rights in this  country," but he offered no commitment.  </P> <P> "I believe the President doesn't want to commit himself in the way we need a  commitment to the work that needs to be done to ensure the dignity of all  citizens of the United States," said Rita Schwerner-Bender, the former wife of  one of the slain young men, Michael Schwerner.  </P> <P> "Yes, I am disappointed," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'American Heroes'  </P> <P> In a written statement, Bush called the three men "American heroes." He said  the best way to honor their sacrifice is "to ensure the arrogance and bigotry  that took their lives never again exists in America."  </P> <P> But spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the President told the families he has not  committed himself to the legislation because he is waiting for the Justice  Department to complete a review of the new Supreme Court rulings.  </P> <P> The families of Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, both white New Yorkers, and James  Chaney, a black Mississippian, visited the White House before heading to  Capitol Hill for a commemorative ceremony on the anniversary of their  disappearance June 21, 1964.  </P> <P> In a photo session with the family members before the meeting, Bush declined to  answer reporters' questions on civil rights matters, citing his rules against  taking questions at such times.  </P> <P> But Schwerner-Bender spoke up, telling reporters the group was going to ask  Bush to "support bipartisan legislation to deal with the Supreme Court cases  that have so badly eroded civil rights in this country."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Volunteerism Pushed  </P> <P> Later, speaking to reporters outside the White House, she said Bush had talked  about volunteerism to solve pressing problems such as housing, education and  medical needs.  </P> <P> "I think he believes that a group of volunteers will solve the problem. I  don't," she said.  </P> <P> She added that she asked the President if he envisioned inviting a homeless  family to live in his Kennebunkport, Me., summer home to help solve the housing  problem and he replied negatively.  </P> <P> The families were on a bus caravan from Philadelphia, Miss., where the three  were killed, to Washington and New York to retrace, in reverse, the civil  rights workers' journey to Mississippi.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chrysler Announces Incentives on '91 Models: Chrysler Corp. said it would  continue incentive programs on a wide variety of its cars and light trucks.  Cash rebates, ranging from $500 to $1,000, are available on all domestically  produced vehicles except minivans, convertibles and standard-size vans and  wagons -- plus some import models. As an alternative to rebates, a consumer may  choose low-interest financing plans with interest rates keyed to the term of  the loan.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Freedom Front is to involve international  observers in all agreements that are entered into before the  election. Party leader Gen. Constand Viljoen said in Bethlehem  last night that international involvement was a safeguard that  would be used to put pressure on a future government to respect  agreements. Peter Theron filed this report:    [Begin recording] [Theron] The meeting in Bethlehem was the  beginning of the Freedom Front election campaign in the [Orange]  Free State. Gen. Viljoen told the large crowd of people in the  town hall he believed the election should be postponed to ensure  kwaZulu's participation, and allowed time for unity among the  right wing. He remained confident that substantial support for  a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] would be obtained in the  election.    [Viljoen, in Afrikaans] I think we will get enough people,  enough numbers through provincial votes to prove that there is  sufficient support [for a volkstaat]. [end recording]</p>

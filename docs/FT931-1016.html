			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Study of finance regulators urged FINANCIAL REGULATORS have expanded into areas which should have nothing to do with regulation and their activities need to be re-examined, says a report from Professors Julian Franks and Stephen Schaefer of the London Business School, released yesterday. But they conclude that the direct costs of regulation in the UK are broadly in line with costs in the US and France. The report is to be published on April 2 as part of the City Research Project, set up to examine the competitiveness of the UK as a base for financial services business. Threats to investor protection in the past stemmed 'almost exclusively' from fraud, misappropriation and malpractice, the two professors argue. Regulation should be focused on these areas, they say, rather than on improving standards in the industry or developing capital adequacy rules to protect investors when an investment business is wound up. Their comments precede publication of a far-reaching review of investment regulation by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board. In the UK, there are about six regulators for every 1,000 people employed in the securities industry, compared with nearly 12 in the US. Regulatory costs total 0.53 per cent of the industry's costs, excluding interest expenses, compared with 1.34 per cent in the US. Investment management is more expensive to regulate in the UK, however. Costs amount to 0.43 of a basis point (hundredth of a percentage point) of funds under management, compared with 0.16 bp in the US and 0.11 bp in France. There are 6.8 regulators for every 1000 employees, compared with 1.7 in the US and 1.3 in France. The Costs and Effectiveness of the UK Financial Regulatory System. Corporation of London.

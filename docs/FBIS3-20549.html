			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cheng Guoyou (4453 0948 2589): A Plain </F> Discussion of Structural Corruption"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I hold that corruption can be  divided into the two general categories of nonstructural and  structural. So-called nonstructural corruption  refers to the exploitation by some of their job conveniences and  authority to engage in corrupt actions that directly encroach on  and damage the interests of others or of society, such as graft,  bribe-taking, and fraud. As such corrupt behavior directly  violates the law, it can be punished by law and, as long as the  party and government pay it great attention and control it  strongly, it is very easy to root out. But so-called  structural corruption refers to the exploitation by  certain people of their regular job conveniences and authority  in particular social, political, and economic structures, due to  management systems and regulations being imperfect and unsound,  and premised on not affecting their own organizational interests  and ensuring that their own organizations operate normally  according to practice, to engage in certain behavior for private  gain, such as trading power for profit, exchanging power for  money, trading power for material, using public monies for  entertaining and gift-giving, traveling abroad at public  expense, using public vehicles for private purposes, using  public office for private gain, and indulging in extravagance  and waste. Such corrupt behavior is necessarily much more  covert than nonstructural corruption. It may apparently not be a  direct violation of laws and regulations, or be a violation that  is very hard to expose, as long as "only a few know about it."  Due to this feature of structural corruption, it is very hard to  investigate and punish, as well as being very liable to  spreading quickly once the climate eases. And it is only when it  abets the growth of nonstructural corruption, or corrupts  overall social values, or has a significant impact on overall  public interests, that it arouses great attention by the general  public. As China's political and economic management systems are  still not perfect and sound in many areas, structural corruption  occupies a key position in corrupt behavior. This is precisely  why the phenomenon of corruption has always been hard to curb.  Having investigated the case records of a certain province for  1991, I have discovered that most of the cases handled were  nonstructural corruption (direct violations), mostly graft,  while there were very few cases of structural corruption,  showing that structural corruption is very covert and hard to  investigate and punish.    China's current structural corruption can be roughly divided  again into the following four situations.    1. Corruption caused by shortages. Shortages in  the field of economics show up as demand exceeding supply for  certain goods (funds) with designated prices. When the  macroeconomy is not controlled or uncontrollable, the choice of  clients by functional departments of enterprises, commodity  departments, or officials in charge of certain commodities or  fund distribution becomes a kind of power which, under existing  conditions, easily turns into a certain individual's power. As  the choice of client does not in any case affect the  department's normal operations, the individual exploitation of  such power for private gain falls within the normal range of  responsibililty, with very little likelihood of severe censure,  so that quite naturally, the choice of whoever makes the most  gifts is also logical.    Shortages in the field of social organization are also  widespread, showing up mainly as demand exceeding supply for  officials, cadres, and workers, or limited positions with many  wishing to become officials, cadres, and workers. This gives  great power to organizational, personnel, and labor departments,  or certain other departments and individuals with jurisdiction  over personnel, which power, without democracy, openness, or  effective restraint, is very easily exploited for private  purposes. As whoever is chosen does not directly impact the  organization per se, being part of the organization's normal  work responsibility, such conduct for private purposes is hard  to uncover. And while it might be condemned by outsiders (which  condemnation is very dangerous), it is very difficult for it to  be genuinely investigated and punished.    So shortages obviously create power. Since the individual  exploitation of such power does not directly endanger normal  organizational activities, as long as democracy is imperfect and  individual power is not effectively restrained by organizations,  it will be widely exploited for private gain, leaving such  corruption to spread.    It needs to be pointed out that under our traditional system  before 1979, while shortages were more severe than at present,  the pheonomenon of corruption was certainly not as serious.  This was because the state exercised strict control over areas,  such as personnel, wages, prices, and markets, putting more  limits on such corruption.    2. Corruption caused by irregular competition.  Competition was the product of our development of a commodity  economy, being an inevitable social development. Reasonable  competition can make excellence even better, and transform  inferiority into excellence, contributing to economic  development, the display of pent-up talent, and social progress.    But when rational competition mechanisms are still  imperfect,  certain people will actively draw or depend on certain powers to  give themselves an advantageous position in competition, while  also granting certain benefits to powerholders. This power in  turn helps them to further strengthen their advantageous  position in competition, forming the logical equation of power  plus competition equals success. On the other hand, competitors  who have not found any patronage are left in a disadvantageous  position, finding it either impossible or difficult to go on.  The current dual-pricing system's "official" and "private"  corruption are typical examples of power combined with  competition. Most of the economic entities now being run by  certain government organs or functional departments are also  suspect due to this.    3. Corruption caused by imperfect power-oversight  mechanisms per se. Perfect power-oversight mechanisms  should include internal oversight mechanisms, external oversight  mechanisms, and oversight mechanisms for the overseers  themselves. But China's current power-oversight mechanisms are  very imperfect. 1) We have neither internal or extenal  oversight mechanisms, not to speak of any oversight of the  overseers. While there are certain written prohibitions and  regulations at times, there are no genuine oversight organs or  personnel. For instance, bank credit officers have the three  powers of investigation, examination, and approval concentrated  in one post, with certainly no oversight or restraint organs.  2) Even when there are internal and external oversight  mechanisms, there is certainly no oversight of the overseers.  In addition, the poor quality of certain overseers saps the  oversight function, which can be seen in certain public servants  violating the law in its enforcement, not acting in accordance  with the law, and not enforcing the law strictly. 3) When  there is only internal oversight but no external oversight or  oversight of the overseers, certain organs of power become the  enforcers as well as the overseers of power. [passage omitted]    For instance, while government departments have internal  supervision bureaus and party committees have  discipline-inspection commissions, their external oversight is  generally only through written prohibitions and regulations by  upper-level governments or party committees without any  substantive oversight-enforcement organs.    With such imperfect oversight mechanisms, it is actually  very  hard to stop the exploitation of public power for private gain  and striving for small-group interests, and neglecting current  activities, such as the private use of public vehicles, the use  of public office for private gain, the use of power for private  purposes, and light punishments for serious crimes, not at all  surprising. Certain powerholders also dare to state recklessly  that: "I will not act without advantage, I will act with  advantage, and I will do anything for more advantage," the crux  of which is "orders that are not followed, and prohibitions that  do not work."    Not only are oversight mechanisms imperfect, but party and  government organs are bloated and overstaffed. So certain  departments overstep their jurisdictions, exploiting their power  actively, by looking for matters to handle where there are none,  seeking for power to exploit where there is none, and  artificially setting up obstacles in political and economic  activities to create shortages and power to exploit for private  gain. For instance, actions, such as inspecting, evaluating,  setting up blocks, and issuing documents to restrict X, or  exerting invisible pressure on certain sectors, are precisely  the root of the spread of "arbitrary charges, fines, and  apportionments" and other unhealthy tendencies.    4. Corruption caused by dependency connections among  powerholders. China's current cadre-appointment  system-model is mainly one of "connections" and appointments by  superiors, with the appointments and powers of lower-level  officials controlled not by the people, but rather by the  superior pertinent leaders, with certain subordinate interests  also controlled by certain upper-level departments and leaders.  So subordinate officials, in order to protect their powers or  partial interests, often do no hesitate to entertain or make  gifts to their superiors at public expense, in order to  harmonize upper and lower connections, consolidate their own  positions, or gain local benefits. This is probably one of the  causes of the much-prohibited yet unstoppable entertaining and  gift-giving at public expense. [passage omitted]</p>

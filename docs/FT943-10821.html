			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Bank sticks to inflation forecast but sees short-term decline The Bank of England yesterday admitted that inflation had turned out to be lower than expected in its last quarterly report and reduced its short-term forecast of underlying inflation. Nevertheless, its latest quarterly inflation report warned that, unless base rates were increased at some point in the months ahead, underlying inflation would be in the top half of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range in two years. That would conflict with the government's aim of reducing such inflation to the lower half of the band by the end of this parliament or no later than the second quarter of 1997. The Bank expects underlying retail price inflation (the so-called RPIX, which excludes mortgage interest payments) to fall to about 2.3 per cent over the next three months from 2.4 per cent in June. Underlying inflation will be lower than previously thought until the end of 1995 before peaking above 3 per cent in the first quarter of 1996. The Bank's own measure of core inflation, RPIY (which also excludes local authority and indirect taxes) fell to a record low of 1.6 per cent in April. The report lowers the forecast for RPIY, which is expected to remain below 3 per cent in the next two years. Three factors have caused the Bank to alter its projections. The first, says the report, is that 'inflation has been lower than expected over the past three months. The squeeze on profit margins, which started in the fourth quarter of 1993 in food retailing, has spread.' Second, the Bank now says that the disinflationary pressure has proved greater than anticipated. In particular, the squeeze on retail margins is unlikely to be reversed in the near future. The third factor cited by the Bank is in the direction of faster inflation. It says: 'GDP data suggest that output was closer to potential by the end of last year than previously thought.' In spite of the downward revision in the short term, the Bank's view of the annual inflation rate in two years is virtually unchanged. It will still be in the top half of the target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent in 1996 if base rates are not increased. Furthermore, the report argues that new inflationary risks have emerged in the last three months. In its May report the Bank cited three inflationary concerns, rapid money-supply growth; a rise in nominal earnings; and high inflation expectations in the financial markets. While those risks have not worsened, and money-supply growth has in slowed, the report adds three more dangers. The first is that 'commodity prices will continue to rise rapidly, pushing up producers' output prices.' The Bank says that 'because world demand is still sluggish, big increases in commodity prices are unlikely to continue for long enough to have a serious impact on domestic inflation'. But it adds: 'Further supply-side shocks would alter the outlook.' The second risk is that profit margins, particularly in the retail sector, may rebound after all. 'It is not clear yet,' says the report, 'whether the structural changes in retailing which have helped to reduce margins are permanent.' The third danger is that the economy may be closer to its full potential than has been projected. The Bank says this possibility has been raised by 'recent increases in land prices and costs in the construction sector'. It also cites reports of recruitment difficulties in some sectors. The Bank admits, however, that the risks are not all on one side. The recent unexpectedly good retail price figures could result in a reduction of inflation expectations. And it says says that headline unemployment figures may be 'exaggerating the speed at which the labour market is tightening and thus exaggerating the upward pressure on earnings'. The Bank ends by restating that 'the stance of monetary policy must be set on the basis of a judgment of where inflation will be in some two years or so. This is especially important at turning points in official interest rates.' The report warns that 'the pressures for higher inflation in the future may be building up even as the published inflation rate for the past continues to fall.' Inflation Report August 1994.

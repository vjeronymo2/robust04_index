			<p>BFN     [Text] Further details have been reported on the military  operations carried out by the Islamic Army. Quoting an official  source in the Afghan Defense Ministry, the BAKHTAR INFORMATION  AGENCY military correspondent reports Golboddin's militias in  the areas around Konduz Province, along with Dostam's militias,  resorted to an unsuccessful offensive, supported by heavy air  bombardment and missiles attack, to disturb peace and security  in the Konduz Province surroundings. The militias caused  trouble to the people, plundered properties, and resorted to  actions against our religion and traditions. The Islamic Army  forces resorted to a retaliatory attack against the militias and  embarked on military operations in the district of Chardara.  During these operations, the militias were pushed back towards  Tashghorghan from the areas of Konduz Province. The militias  were cleared from Chardara District and the surroundings of  Konduz. As a result of these operations, more than 100 militias  of Golboddin-Dostam were killed, more than 120 arrested, and a  large number injured. The enemy lost 700 pieces of light and  heavy weapons, and two of their tanks were burned down. One  BM-21 system and two ZK-1's also were destroyed.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Theft in a shop is no less a crime Sir, Your recent photograph of a Covent Garden scene referring to 100 arrests being made as a result of a paging initiative continues to talk about 'shoplifters' ('Arrests in Covent Garden increase as a result of initiative with Mercury Paging', August 24). The success which the police and the retailers are enjoying in combating shop crime is not helped if the euphemism 'shoplifter' continues to be used. We are not talking about a naughty schoolboy nicking a packet of sweets for a lark, although that itself often leads to worse crime and a belief that it is fair game. What is under discussion is wholesale and often violent theft by groups of people stealing to order and costing the honest customer money in the long run. Someone who steals from a bank is not called a banklifter, he is called a thief or worse. What we are combating is professional shop theft and we should all start saying so.

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTECS CAN'T SUSTAIN EARLY SUCCESS, LOSE FINAL  </P> <P> Fourteen minutes into Thursday night's Texaco Star tournament championship game  against Villanova, San Diego State guard Michael Best trotted over to Coach Jim  Brandenburg during a break.  </P> <P> The juices were flowing, the ESPN television cameras were rolling, and Best had  a request.  </P> <P> "I need the ball," he pleaded.  </P> <P> It was that kind of half. Best had just converted a three-point play, but he  wasn't particularly hot. It was just that, if you were wearing a white Aztec  uniform, you wanted the ball. They had the lead, they had momentum, and most of  all, they were having fun.  </P> <P> But in the end, the Aztecs couldn't quite pull the upset off. Final score:  Villanova 57, SDSU 52 in front of 4,940 at the San Diego Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Revenge? Not tonight. Villanova had already defeated SDSU this season, 66-58,  in the Maui Classic on Thanksgiving weekend. Before that, Villanova defeated  the Aztecs in the 1982 Cabrillo tournament championship (before it became the  Texaco Star), 63-57.  </P> <P> With this in mind, the Aztecs battled all of the man-to-mans and zone traps and  presses Villanova threw at them Thursday. They scored the game's first 12  points and never trailed in the first half.  </P> <P> They played through the foul trouble of center Marty Dow (fourth foul with  14:39 left in the game) and Best (fourth with 12:59 left), and they watched  7-feet-3 Villanova center Tom Greis foul out with 4:37 to play in the game.  </P> <P> But Villanova guard Chris Walker hit three three-point shots in the second  half, the first two keeping Villanova close and the third giving the Wildcats a  49-47 lead with 4:18 left, a lead they would not relinquish.  </P> <P> The Aztecs had the ball and trailed by three, 55-52, but Arthur Massey missed a  shot with 13 seconds left, and Villanova's Calvin Byrd blocked Dow's follow  with 10 seconds left to force a jump ball. Byrd made two free throws with eight  seconds left to finish off the Aztecs.  </P> <P> For the game, Walker made five of seven three-pointers and finished with 17  points. Best had 16 to lead SDSU, Jamison added 12 and Dow 11.  </P> <P> It was SDSU's fourth Texaco Star tournament championship appearance in four  years. Last year, SDSU lost to Tennessee, 77-75; two years ago, the Aztecs won  the title over Texas Tech, 72-63, and three years ago SDSU lost to Mississippi,  88-77.  </P> <P> Overall, it was SDSU's ninth championship game appearance. The Aztecs have won  three.  </P> <P> SDSU never trailed in the first half. Villanova managed one tie, 26-26, when  Walker made a three-point shot with 4:34 left before halftime.  </P> <P> Other than that, the first half fluctuated between SDSU dominating and hanging  on.  </P> <P> It started with the Aztecs dominating. Maybe Villanova was flat after defeating  Clemson in the tournament's opening round Wednesday. Maybe the Wildcats were in  a funk because a rare San Diego rainstorm Thursday dampened their holiday  excursion. Whatever, SDSU stormed to a 12-0 lead with 15:59 left in the half.  </P> <P> During that span, the Aztecs made five of seven field goal attempts and turned  three Villanova turnovers into seven points. Villanova made just two field  goals in the first 8 1/2 minutes.  </P> <P> But SDSU then turned cold and let Villanova back into the game. The Aztecs went  through a spell in which they missed just one shot in 13 possessions -- they  made seven -- but turned the ball over five times. Pretty soon, the score was  tied.  </P> <P> Dow made two free throws, and forward Vern Thompson swished a 15-footer to give  the Aztecs a 30-27 halftime lead. Combined, SDSU and Villanova made just two of  their final 12 shots in the half.  </P> <P> The Aztecs made 11 of 26 field goals (42%) in the first half. Villanova made  just eight of 20 (40%).  </P> <P> Clemson easily won the third-place game, defeating Niagara, 85-65.  </P> <P> The biggest surprise came at the opening tip, when Clemson's 6-foot-11 center,  Elden Campbell, was sitting on the bench.  </P> <P> "Three words -- concentration, aggressiveness and production," Tiger Coach  Cliff Ellis said.  </P> <P> Campbell eventually got a grip on those three things, scoring 21 points and  grabbing 11 rebounds. But it was guard Derrick Forrest's night. Forrest tied a  career high with 23 points.  </P> <P> "It was just one of those special nights," he said. "I just said I was going to  go out and get ready for the conference season."  </P> <P> Clemson opens Atlantic Coast Conference play Wednesday at North Carolina State.  </P> <P> Clemson took a 6-0 lead before Niagara scored 13 of the next 15 points to go  ahead, 13-8. It stayed even for most of the first half, and Clemson led at the  intermission, 39-33.  </P> <P> This was despite the urging of Niagara's 26-year-old Jack Armstrong, the  youngest Division I basketball coach in the country. With his constant  screaming, waving and stamping, he was easily the most demonstrative coach of  the tournament. And when Rollie Massimino is here, that's quite an  accomplishment.  </P> <P> Midway through the second half, Armstrong had coaxed all he could out of  Niagara, and Clemson's superior athletic ability surfaced. Clemson opened a  58-45 lead and was never again in danger.  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said the Aztecs will likely red-shirt freshman  forward Courtie Miller, a former standout at Torrey Pines High School. "I'd say  that's where we're headed," Brandenburg said. "We'd like not to use up a year  of his eligibility, because we value his talent and his potential so much."  Miller has played a total of just eight minutes in four games this season and  he hasn't played since Dec. 6 against the University of San Diego. He is  limping on a sprained ankle now and is recovering from a hamstring pull. Since  he has played in four games, NCAA rules stipulate that he can only be  red-shirted for medical reasons. SDSU is red-shirting two other players this  season -- Nelson Stewart, who played in three games but has a bad knee, and  Terrence Hamilton (Patrick Henry). . . . Entering Thursday's game, SDSU had won  seven games in a row in the San Diego Sports Arena -- five this season and  their final two last season. . . . Shawn Jamison's 91% shooting from the floor  in Wednesday night's SDSU victory over Niagara was a tournament record.  </P></p>

Mr. Keating repeated that Australia would not  enter any bilateral arrangements that were detrimental to Japan,  but said this was different to taking sides. He said the  tension between Tokyo and Washington reflected fundamental  underlying differences.    [Begin Keating recording] The U.S. and Japan will work that  out. We shall create a new institution to work it out within,  and that is APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]. APEC  gives the United States and Japan a chance within an umbrella  organization to look at their policy and trade differences, but  they will always do it bilaterally as well as in any other  framework.    There is a lot of serious thought about this relationship,  and it is in terms of their current account -- that has had a  problem for years -- and this tension underlines the savings  imbalance between the two countries. Now, it is going to take  time to work this out, but it is working itself out in the sense  now that the United States is enjoying very rapid growth of  exports into North and South Asia. So the dependency of Japan  upon the U.S. as a market is diminishing and, like most  problems, they tend naturally to work themselves out. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Solchaga's nomination splits Socialists MR FELIPE GONZALEZ has precipitated a split in the ruling Spanish Socialist party (PSOE) by forcing through the nomination of Mr Carlos Solchaga as party parliamentary spokesman. Mr Gonzalez risked his survival as PSOE leader by confronting the party's powerful deputy leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra, during a heated weekend meeting of the Socialist leadership to decide the pivotal post. Jettisoning the traditional show of consensus over top party appointments, the Socialist executive voted 15-13 to support Mr Gonzalez's nomination of Mr Solchaga, the economy minister in the outgoing government. The nomination must now be endorsed by the party's MPs today. By selecting Mr Solchaga, whose economic policies since 1985 have made him deeply unpopular with the unions and with the left wing of the PSOE, Mr Gonzalez has given the clearest indication to date of what sort of government he intends to form. He has also signalled that he intends to take on the PSOE party machinery, which Mr Guerra turned into his personal power base after resigning as deputy prime minister in the wake of a corruption scandal in 1991. The nomination of Mr Solchaga, overriding the Guerra camp in the PSOE, sets the stage for Mr Gonzalez to bring new faces, loyal to him and independent of the party, into his forthcoming government. But it also raises the prospect of a serious division in the Socialist ranks when the PSOE holds its next party congress. Mr Gonzalez will, in all likelihood, be forming a minority government because the Catalan nationalists have declined his offer to join him as junior coalition partners. The survival of his government will depend on his ability to negotiate legislation with the opposition parties. Supporters of Mr Gonzalez said at the weekend that the party congress, which meets every three years and must be held before November 1994, could be brought forward to this November in order to secure Mr Gonzalez's ascendancy over the PSOE. The immediate political agenda, however, focuses on the opening of the new parliament tomorrow, when a speaker, possibly a non-Socialist, will be elected. Also, King Juan Carlos and party leaders will begin formal consultations to propose a candidate for prime minister. As leader of the biggest party in parliament, Mr Gonzalez is certain to be the monarch's choice to form a government. He will face an investiture debate, probably in mid-July, and should he obtain the confidence of the house he will subsequently announce his cabinet.</p>

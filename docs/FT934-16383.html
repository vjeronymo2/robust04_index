			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities lifted by European gains Wall Street RISING European markets, buoyed by the apparent resolution of the Russian political crisis, provided US share prices with an initial lift yesterday, but losses in semiconductor stocks kept any gains to a minimum, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.50 at 3,587.26. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.13 lower at 461.21, while the Amex composite ended up 0.10 at 461.68, and the Nasdaq composite down 2.61 at 762.23. Trading volume on the NYSE was 285m shares, while rises and declines ran neck and neck at 986 to 988. Stocks moved higher at the opening bell as investors and traders reacted positively to news of substantial gains on foreign equity markets. Stocks in London, Frankfurt - where they rose to a record high - and Paris were all higher yesterday morning as investors breathed a sigh of relief at the victory of President Boris Yeltsin over the anti-reform hard-liners who had occupied the Parliament building in Moscow. Overseas stocks were also lifted by talk of a more positive outlook for European economies, something which also contributed to early gains in US prices. Among individual stocks, Daimler-Benz made its debut on the NYSE yesterday - the first German company to obtain a full listing on US mar kets. Amid much publicity, trading began with Daimler's ADRs (every 10 ADRs represent one Daimler share) rising to Dollars 47, close to their equivalent price in Frankfurt. By the close, the ADRs had eased back to Dollars 46 3/4 , in volume of 1.4m shares. Semiconductor and technology stocks, which had been in demand lately, suffered a setback yesterday when Advanced Micro Devices reported third quarter earnings of 61 cents a share, up from 51 cents a share a year ago but well below analysts' estimates. The news left Advanced Micro down Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 21 7/8 in volume of 7m shares. It also depressed Texas Instruments, down Dollars 4 7/8 at Dollars 70 1/2 , Motorola, down Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 98 1/2 , and Hewlett-Packard, down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 67 5/8 . Paramount Communications rose initially as investors reacted positively to Monday's late announcement that Nynex, the regional telecommunications group, was investing Dollars 1.2bn in Viacom, the cable television company which has made an agreed Dollars 7.5bn bid for Paramount. The investment from Nynex was seen as giving Viacom more room to increase the size of its bid, and possibly match a rival Dollars 9.5bn offer made by QVC, the home shopping television network. Later in the day, QVCN announced it had completed the financing for its bid. The day's events left Paramount down Dollars 1 at Dollars 76 3/4 , Viacom down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 57 1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and QVC up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 55 7/8 on the Nasdaq market. Safeway climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 19 3/4 after the retailing group announced third quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, double last year's comparable figure. Canada TORONTO prices closed higher in busy trading, as the TSE-300 index strengthened its position above the 4,000-point level. It rose 12.08 points, or 0.30 per cent, to close at 4,014.11. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 365 to 345 while volume was 68.78m shares, up from yesterday's 38.43m shares. Trading value rose to CDollars 620.6m from CDollars 418.2m. Twelve of 14 sub-indexes closed higher. The real estate group jumped 3.2 per cent, led by Intrawest Development, up CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 13 5/8 . The day's volume was boosted by Falvo Corp., which closed up CDollars 0.04 at CDollars 0.29 on volume of about 8.5m shares.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PINIELLA ISN'T PANICKING, BUT REDS LOSE 2  </P> <P> Manager Lou Piniella says there is nothing to worry about, but the Cincinnati  Reds are no longer looking like an outstanding team.  </P> <P> On June 1, the Reds had a 31-12 record. They were leading the National League  West by nine games. They had everything going for them. They combined hitting,  pitching and defense.  </P> <P> But for the last 10 days the Reds have not played well. They were at their  worst Tuesday night at Cincinnati, losing a doubleheader to the Atlanta Braves.  </P> <P> In the opener, Greg Olson hit a grand slam and Tommy Glavine (3-4) went the  distance and the Braves won, 8-3.  </P> <P> Ron Gant, who had two doubles in the opener, had a triple and a home run in the  nightcap as rookie Tommy Greene, recalled from from the minors, won, 3-2.  </P> <P> In their last 11 games, the Reds are 3-8.  </P> <P> Greene, who was with triple-A Richmond until Sunday, gave up three hits before  being replaced in the sixth inning with none out.  </P> <P> Glavine, one of the league's top left-handers, has had a circulation problem  that has caused his left hand to become numb. Between innings he kept the hand  in hot wraps.  </P> <P> It must have helped because he went the distance for the first time in 12  starts. He gave up seven hits and struck out six.  </P> <P> In the second game, Ken Griffey hit his first home run of the season, but it  came after the Braves took a 3-1 lead.  </P> <P> "I told the team to forget the road trip and go get the Braves," Piniella said.  "Maybe they didn't hear me. On the trip, we didn't score runs. And we fail to  hold the lead in close games.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's anything to get excited about. We're too good to go sour  for any length of time. The poor trip doesn't bother me, because, after all, we  won 17 of our first 21 away from home."  </P> <P> Despite losing twice, the Reds, with nearest pursuer San Diego losing, still  lead the West by five games. But the Braves cut the margin between first and  last to 12 games.  </P> <P> New York 19, Chicago 8 -- There was a 25-m.p.h. wind blowing out at Wrigley  Field, but only the Mets took advantage of it.  </P> <P> The Mets hit four home runs, two of them by Kevin McReynolds, and the Cubs  didn't hit any.  </P> <P> With his team scoring four runs in each of the first two innings, Dwight Gooden  (4-5) didn't need to pitch well. He didn't. He lasted seven innings, giving up  a career-high 11 hits and six runs, perhaps his worst performance of the  season.  </P> <P> In his four victories, Gooden's teammates have scored 44 runs.  </P> <P> The team with the worst batting average in the league hammered the Cubs for 21  hits, 12 of them for extra bases.  </P> <P> Dave Magadan, who had driven in only six runs in 75 at-bats, had four hits,  including a home run, and drove in six runs.  </P> <P> "I've been scrambling for playing time," Magadan said. "It's been a frustrating  season."  </P> <P> Tom O'Malley, who didn't get into the game until the fourth inning, had three  doubles for the Mets.  </P> <P> San Francisco 7, San Diego 2 -- Rookie Rick Parker and veteran Gary Carter hit  home runs for the Giants at San Diego.  </P> <P> Although they lost another pitcher when Don Robinson had to leave the game  because of a leg injury, the Giants won for the 10th time in their past 11  games.  </P> <P> The Giants, 14 games behind the Reds on June 1, are now only 7 1/2 games out of  first place.  </P> <P> Mark Thurmond took over for Robinson (2-0) after six innings and gave up the  final San Diego run in the ninth inning.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 7, Montreal 2 -- Ken Howell is merely carrying on tradition. For  many years former Dodger pitchers have pitched with success throughout  baseball.  </P> <P> Howell, who couldn't make it as a relief pitcher for the Dodgers, has become  the ace of the Phillies' staff.  </P> <P> Howell won his sixth in a row and improved to 8-3 with a strong eight innings  at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Rookie Dave Hollins, benefiting from early batting practice, hit a three-run  home run in the second inning and Howell made sure the Phillies ended their  five-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Montreal Manager Bob Rodgers was impressed by Howell.  </P> <P> "He got stronger as the game went on," he said. "I though we'd get him, but he  got us."  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 6, St. Louis 3 -- Despite his fine record, left-hander Neal Heaton  had been having trouble lately. He had not won since May 27.  </P> <P> But Heaton (9-1) ran his record to 5-0 lifetime against the Cardinals in this  game at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Heaton went seven innings, giving up all three runs and seven hits, but joining  Frank Viola of New York as the only nine-game winners in the league.  </P> <P> Bobby Bonilla had two doubles and a single and first baseman Sid Bream was four  for four.  </P> <P> The Cardinals, who have lost five of their last six games, got a two-run home  run by Todd Zeile.  </P> <P> The victory increased the Pirates' lead in the East to 3 1/2 games.  </P> <P> The Cardinals, in last place in the East, fell 11 1/2 games behind.

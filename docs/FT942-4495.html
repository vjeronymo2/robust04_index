			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chemring at Pounds 2.85m after exceptional Chemring, the maker of anti-missile chaff, distress rockets and waterproof clothes, yesterday reported reduced profits in the six months to April 1. The pre-tax figure fell by 2.3 per cent to Pounds 2.85m (Pounds 2.92m) on increased turnover of Pounds 24m (Pounds 21.3m). Operating profits rose by 5.3 per cent from Pounds 2.96m to Pounds 3.12m after a Pounds 173,000 charge this time for 70 redundancies, mainly at Pains-Wessex, the distress signals maker. The pre-tax figure was struck after losses at associated undertakings of Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 57,000) and net interest charges of Pounds 161,000 (credit Pounds 19,000) because of changes in the Ministry of Defence order methods which increased pressure on the company's cashflow. Net borrowings stood at Pounds 1.5m at the half year. Mr Philip Billington, chairman, said that overall the company was performing well and had maintained margins. He said the redundancy costs were a one-off and that the work-in-progress pressure should improve in the second half. Business from commercial markets had been maintained but orders from the defence markets, which account for 55 per cent of Chemring's business, were taking longer to come through. UK turnover was up 15 per cent at Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9.04m) while exports rose 11.3 per cent to Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 12.2m), with better sales in east Asia, the US and South America. The interim dividend has been lifted by 8 per cent to 3.24p, compared with 3p from earnings per share which fell from 9.69p to 9.35p basic or to 9.15p (9.49p) fully diluted.</p>

			<p>`Springboard'   for Drug Trafficking   <F P=102> PA1906225994 Guatemala City SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 15  Jun 94 p 12 </F>  <F P=103> PA1906225994 </F> <F P=104>  Guatemala City SIGLO VEINTIUNO </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza] </F>   [Excerpts] Nearly 1,800 military men could be transferred  to the civilian security forces once they are trained to protect  the people, the defense minister, General Mario Rene Enriquez,  said yesterday.    According to the minister, the number of police members  should be increased, and the police have to be properly trained  and equipped to meet society's demands for protection.    He also said the reorganization plan devised by the Army for  those times when there is no counterinsurgency work to do  includes the relocation of units. For instance, seven military  detachments could be deployed in Peten Department to protect  natural resources. [passage omitted]    The minister believes Guatemala is ceasing to be a  springboard for international drug trafficking. A positive sign  is the use of drugs is not as common as in other countries.    We have not captured a single plane, from Colombia or  wherever, carrying cocaine during the past few months. The drug  capos have apparently departed for another country, he said.    The minister said drug trafficking continues over land and  sea, albeit at much lower levels, as the result of the security  forces' coordinated efforts.    Concerning arms trafficking, the minister said an arms cache  recently discovered in Suchitepequez with 22 AK-47 rifles in  perfect condition proves the URNG [National Guatemalan  Revolutionary Unity] does not lack arms but, rather, militant  members.</p>

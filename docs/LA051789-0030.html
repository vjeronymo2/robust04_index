			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EAGLE ROCK KEEPING TAFT COMPANY;  </P> <P> BEHIND WONG'S 70, EAGLES TIE TOREADORS AFTER 1ST ROUND OF CITY GOLF FINALS  </P> <P> Jason Gordon of El Camino Real High stood behind the 10th tee at Harding Golf  Course at Griffith Park on Tuesday and looked at the cast on his fractured  right hand. Then he looked at the cast on the golf course.  </P> <P> Neither one exactly thrilled Gordon, the defending City Section individual golf  champion who was forced into a spectator's role this year after breaking his  hand in a freak accident 10 days ago.  </P> <P> "I think it's a down year," said Gordon, who won last year's title as a junior  with a total of 72-73 -- 145. "Some of these numbers are real high."  </P> <P> Those weren't just sour grapes. Despite perfect weather, only six players broke  80 in the first round, and, with 18 holes to play, upstart Eagle Rock moved  into a tie for first with perennial contender Taft in the team competition at  408.  </P> <P> Eagle Rock senior Gerald Wong was the only player to break par, finishing at  one-under 70. Wong had three birdies on the back nine and finished with a  three-under 31. Cameron Broumand of Palisades is second at 73.  </P> <P> Taft was led by Ryan White, who shares third place at 77 with Josh Oring of  Granada Hills and Tony Bordwell of El Camino Real.  </P> <P> White, a bespectacled freshman, says he has grown eight inches since enrolling  at Taft in September.  </P> <P> "It's messed me up some," said White, who now stands 5-foot-9. "But there are  touring pros who are 5-3 who hit it 300 yards. The secret is to hit it straight  and make putts."  </P> <P> Despite his inexperience, White managed to finish the round with no sixes on  his score card. Bordwell, a junior, stayed in the hunt despite a balky putter.  Bordwell missed birdie putts of eight feet or less on each of the last two  holes and did not have a birdie.  </P> <P> "Twelve pars, six bogeys," he grumbled. "And three of the bogeys were on missed  two-footers."  </P> <P> Taft, the 5-A League champion that last season was upset in the team final by  El Camino Real of the 4-A League, now faces a stiff test from Eagle Rock, the  3-A League champion.  </P> <P> It took an 82 from Taft's No. 6 man, freshman Sheldon Mink, to move the  Toreadors into a tie for first heading into today's final round at the more  difficult Wilson Course.  </P> <P> All four girls in the field qualified individually, led by Eagle Rock's Leann  Wong, Gerald's freshman sister. Wong shot 83, three shots better than Carol  Jensen of North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Louise Leftinger of Van Nuys, a foreign-exchange student from Sweden, shot 88  and Monica Chant of Birmingham had 99. All individuals under 100 qualified for  the second round.  </P> <P> The top six teams advanced to the final 18 holes. Trailing Eagle Rock and Taft  are Granada Hills (427), University (438) and defending champion El Camino Real  (442).  </P></p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: US banks poised for merger TWO leading US regional banks are expected to announce a merger today in a move that would create one of the country's biggest and most geographically diverse banking groups. Shares in both KeyCorp, based in Albany, New York, and Society Corp, of Cleveland, Ohio, were suspended late on Friday pending unspecified announcements from both groups. A merger would create a unit with assets of more than Dollars 50bn, putting it among the 12 largest banks in the US and making it one of the leading 'super-regionals,' which combine operations in a number of states. KeyCorp has already grown rapidly through acquisition in recent years, putting together a string of banks in eight northern states, including Alaska, Oregon and Washington. Its operations are concentrated in the north-east and north-west of the country, leaving a gap which would be filled by Society, based in the mid-west. Mergers among regional banks in the US have picked up in recent months as consolidation in the banking industry has gained momentum. Some of the country's largest banking groups, including NationsBank and BankAmerica, are also reported to be hunting for acquisitions to extend their networks into new states. Both KeyCorp and Society ranked among the country's top 30 banks in terms of assets at the end of last year. They were also among the most profitable, with a return on equity in excess of 17 per cent.</p>

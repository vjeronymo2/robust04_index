			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Another Postponement: "Nick and Nora," a musical version of "The Thin Man,"  will not open on Broadway until next spring because the producers have not been  able to finance the $5.6-million production. The musical, starring Barry  Bostwick and Joanna Gleason as Dashiell Hammett's famous detective couple, was  to have opened in February. It is one of the most highly touted musicals of the  season, one of the few big American shows expected to compete with the British  blockbuster "Miss Saigon."  </P></p>

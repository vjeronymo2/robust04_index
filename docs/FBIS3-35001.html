The offense began when Hizballah launched  katyusha rockets at targets in the eastern sector of the south  Lebanon security zone. Most landed in open areas without causing  either injuries or damage, with Hizballah continuing the attack  with RPG antitank rockets. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and  SLA [South Lebanese Army] hit back with tank fire, and according  to Lebanese radio reports battle helicopters strafed the area of  Kafr Shuba in the security zone, while war planes patrolled the  skies.    Other areas hit by RPG, machine-gun fire, and light weapons  fire were al-Hamra' bridge in the western sector, and around  Marj 'Uyun. Shaykh Musawi, one of the most prominent Hizballah  leaders in the south, died when his car was hit by Israeli  helicopter fire near his home in Jibshit. [passage omitted]</p>

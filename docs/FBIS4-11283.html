			<p>BFN     [Text] Electric power self-sufficiency in the sugar-growing  sector is of vital importance to the national economy. Sancti  Spiritus Province is among the best in the nation in  self-sufficiency. The goal of ceasing to be a burden to the  national electric power system is being consolidated in Sancti  Spiritus Province, when we consider that they already generate  90 percent of the electricity they need. The huge Uruguay [sugar  mill] in Jatibonico is outstanding in this accomplishment, which  produces 108 percent of its electricity. The (?FNTA) and Ramon  Ponciano mills are also self-sufficient. However, the  potentialities could be even greater if capabilities were used  to greater advantage -- these potential capabilities are a  fundamental factor -- and if exploitation of the installed  turbogenerators was to be improved.    The national average is 20 kilowatt-hours per ton of cane  ground, while Sancti Spiritus' nine mills surpass 22. Other  elements for self-sufficiency in energy are to be found in the  search for alternative measures, such as at the Ramon Ponciano  Agroindustrial Complex, where the cane chaff grinder is yielding  very good results. This chaff makes decent levels of combustion  possible.    This has been a report by Rafael Daniel from Sancti  Spiritus.</p>

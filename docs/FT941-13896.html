			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Travel: Mugged by the magic of Rye - Nigel Andrews admits to an addiction Henry James called it the 'ceremony known as afternoon tea' (first sentence, The Portrait of a Lady). Many believe it was the main reason he settled in England. We can picture the great man, his vast egg-like face surveying the British landscape until he espies - ah] Rye] For here, on a hillock overlooking what was once the sea, stood and still stands the most beautiful town in south-east England and the perfect place for the pluperfect repast. Cobbled streets clamber past half-timbered tea rooms. The hiss of kettles swells like a siren at 3.45pm. And when you have been stung for the price of a cuppa in Elizabethan surroundings, you can move happily off to be stung by the antique shops all around. I am a Rye addict and probably incurable; a regular visitor ever since studying HJ at university. Scholastic zeal took me to the Georgian corner house where the master dictated his late novels and entertained the illustrious: Joseph Conrad, Edith Wharton, Rudyard Kipling and Co. Lamb House is a must. Its frozen, limpid dignity tells us much about Henry James, good and bad, and the garden is a delight on a summer's day. But if I came for James I stayed - or kept returning - for Rye itself. Here is that rarity, a town that lives in the present while still seeming to breathe with the lungs of the past - a town so unscarred that it needs no gussying up by its tourist board. In fact, the 'Rye Tourist Initiative' has been going to the other extreme lately and risking infamy by official vandalism. The body in question is thinking of removing the famous cobblestones - I ask you - from Rye's thoroughfares, including Mermaid Street, its masterpiece of the cobbly-picturesque. This uphill river of stones surges past historical-architectural gems before washing up against the fabled, fabulous Mermaid Inn: a brick-and-timber former smugglers' hostelry that creaks and tilts and winks and boasts a prize main bedroom called Dr Syn's Bedchamber (named after Romney Marshes' top smuggler), last notably slept in by the Queen Mother. Rye's greatness lies in its having survived time and trouble and tourism initiatives for nigh on 1,000 years. Back in the 16th century it was the foremost town in Sussex; 400 years before that it was eminent enough to become, with neighbouring Winchelsea, one of the two prestigious Ancient Towns attached to the Cinque Ports. Now lapped by flatlands, Rye was lapped centuries ago by the English Channel. In Tudor times 400 ships lay at ease in her waters and Queen Elizabeth I stopped by to dub the place 'Rye Royal'. Old pictures and prints show the same beautiful, huddled-housed, church-crowned promontory. You must make sure, if you have only a day, to see the following landmarks: Land Gate and Hilder's Cliff. After threading the 14th century archway, you climb a rising street that overlooks marshland, fishing craft and, far off, the oddly magical bulk (on the right day) of Dungeness power station. The Old Grammar School. A 'masterpiece of brickish aplomb', as one guidebook says. A wine-red 17th century building in the Kew Gardens Dutch style, it towers over High Street, unhumbled even by its present status as a discount shop. Ypres Tower. 700 years old and looking every minute of it, this mini-fortress and one-time prison was built by Henry III. For the first half of this century it was a mortuary; now it is a museum. St Mary's Church. Reformation and pre-Reformation styles mix in the building that crowns Rye's hill. What else should you do before sunset and dinner at, I suggest, the succulent Landgate Bistro? Probably dash to the town hall to check out its handsome facade and weird cache of memorabilia, including a gibbet-cage and a pillory; eyeball two picturesquely jettied buildings, the Flushing Inn and Fletcher's House; and wander up and down, down and up, the High Street. I have taken friends to Rye. I have astonished them with the cobbled streets (who will dare to remove them?), refreshed them in quaintly gnarled tea-rooms, expounded the town's history, and generally tried to mug them with its magic. It always works. Rye is not so much a place out of time, more a place where different times are conjurable and vivid every time you turn a corner.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Leading Article: RPI RIP THE BRITISH pride themselves on scoring own goals; and nowhere is this more true than in economic statistics. The Retail Prices Index has probably been responsible for more own goals than most. The particular fatuousness of the RPI lies in the fact that when the government increases interest rates to combat inflation, the immediate impact is to make inflation even worse. This arises because mortgage interest rates feature in the RPI. There is an equally adverse effect when interest rates are reduced. The net result is to produce violent swings around the trend. Governments would have to grin and bear it if the RPI represented some kind of final truth. But to present the RPI as an accurate measure is simply laughable. Most countries do not count mortgage interest payments. Instead, house prices or rents enter one way or another. With the gradual revival of the rented market in the UK, this method might be used for the British RPI. It is therefore good, if belated, news that the chancellor is to refer the treatment of owner occupiers' housing costs to the Retail Prices Index Advisory Committee. But loud cheering is not the order of the day, for there are fundamental fallacies behind the RPI and the Advisory Committee. The first is that there is a single method of measuring the price level of goods and services which is equally suitable for economic policy, uprating benefits, updating taxes, indexing gilts and using in pay negotiations. It is for instance often argued that the RPI has an inflationary bias because prices would appear to rise by about 2 per cent a year simply as a result of quality improvements in products included in the index. But if 2 per cent were docked off social security benefits for this reason, hardship would soon result, as the majority of hidden quality improvements probably take place in products such as hi-fi systems beyond the reach of beneficiaries. But the biggest anachronism of all is the Advisory Committee itself, which is a survival of the 1960s and 1970s, and represents many vested interests who are determined to get as much out of cost-of-living compensation as possible. Better to leave the job to the Central Statistical Office, subject to ministerial supervision and parliamentary scrutiny. If anyone fears that the government would then tamper with the index for political reasons, he or she need only glance at the immense powers of the cabinet secretary to make sure that the rules of the game are obeyed. And if anyone believes that the cabinet secretary's disapproval would remain discreetly hidden, he has a lot to learn about how government works in the world's oldest semi-democracy.</p>

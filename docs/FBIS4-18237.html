			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["dos"-signed report: "German Oil Production Too Expensive"] </F>   [Text] Hannover -- Despite great efforts to reduce costs,  oil production in Germany has become extremely unprofitable.  According to the Economics Association for Oil and Natural Gas  Production (WEG), the structural disadvantages of domestic  production are having a greater effect now in view of the  decline of international prices for oil. In this sector, all  companies are showing very high deficits, said Gerd Eichhorn,  chairman of the WEG Board of Directors.    In 1993, approximately 3.1 million tonnes of oil were  produced from domestic reservoirs, which is 7.6 percent less  than the year before. Among other things, this was due to the  early closing of 15 fields and wells, which had become  unprofitable. Meanwhile, almost 40 percent of the 2,940 usable  production wells have been closed. This trend will continue this  year with the planned closing of 12 oil fields.    The situation is more favorable in natural gas production,  which remained almost stable at 17.7 billion cubic meters. A  total of 92 percent was produced in Lower Saxony and another 7  percent in Saxony-Anhalt. Domestic production contributes 22  percent to covering the domestic demand of natural gas. The  most important suppliers are the CIS with a share of 32 percent,  the Netherlands with 31 percent, and Norway with 14 percent. As  in the case of oil (50.5 million tonnes, following 57 million  tonnes), domestic natural gas reserves went down by 7.5 percent  to 303 billion cubic meters. Eichhorn: "We are beginning to  live off the substance."    The need to reduce costs has not only lead to a further  reduction of employees by approximately 1,000-8,000 on annual  average. Expenditures for exploration and field development have  also been reduced. One indication is the decline of drilling by  13 percent to a new record low of 70,600 meters. Utilization of  drilling equipment is 62 percent.    WEG harshly criticized the "completely insufficient"  reduction of the production royalty on natural gas from 16 to 14  percent. It is certain that the revenues for natural gas will  clearly shrink in 1994 in the course of adjustment to the prices  for heating oil. This is one of the reasons why a "substantial  reduction" of the production royalty (in 1993, 214 million  marks) would have been useful to stimulate exploration. The  liberalization of the European network of pipelines, which  permits third parties to transfer gas through the country, is  not acceptable either, it was said.</p>

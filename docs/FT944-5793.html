			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (17): Scottish house expands - Regional fund / Murray Johnstone As the management buy-out of Ferranti Technologies entered its final stages last week, it marked yet another step in the emergence of the Scottish finance house Murray Johnstone in English venture capital markets. The question is why Murray Johnstone was once again leading a significant, high profile deal - this time with Pounds 1m of equity - to secure more than 300 jobs at the old Cairo Mill in Oldham. The company makes electronic equipment and highly specialised gyroscopes for the defence industry. The risk is small compared with the Pounds 11m of equity capital put into the management and employee buy-out of Greater Manchester Buses North earlier this year, but the Ferranti deal is typical of what the fund manager is up to. Scotland, however, has little to do with it. Success is emanating from Manchester, where the Glasgow-based Murray Johnstone decided in 1988 to open an office. It was bidding to manage Ventures North West, a Pounds 20m regional fund backed by the Pounds 2.5bn of superannuation monies of the 10 Greater Manchester local authorities, the police and similar regionwide bodies. Jonathan Diggines, then a 35-year-old Manchester solicitor who had impressed when acting for corporate clients, was head-hunted to take charge. Murray Johnstone won the beauty parade to run Ventures North West but it soon became clear that the arrangement was likely to offer something more than an average-sized regional fund could offer. It piggy-backed into northern England access to Pounds 200m of funds managed by Murray Johnstone generally. This has made a decisive impact on the way Mr Diggines and two other Manchester-based investment managers have been able to operate. No regional fund invests more than 10 per cent of its pot in any one venture, and most would regard 5 per cent as the prudent upper limit. This limits the scope for driving deals, confining many regional players to playing second fiddle in syndicates. Mr Diggines, however, has been able to take the lead with a freedom denied to many of his counterparts. The result is that Ventures North West's Pounds 20m fund is almost fully invested in 23 companies, but Murray Johnstone has been able to do another Pounds 130m of deals out of Manchester, involving 25 companies in all. For example, the buses buy-out received about Pounds 1m of equity backing from Ventures North West, but nearly Pounds 10m from Murray Johnstone. Local knowledge - the prerequisite of a good local deal - was available in abundance, so no great selling job had to be done to pull in outside firepower. Mr Diggines is now in charge of Murray Johnstone's London office as well as Manchester, with a remit to repeat in the south-east and south what he and his colleagues have done in the north. He sits on the Murray Johnstone board and on the investment committee which makes its decisions by teleconference every Wednesday. In Manchester, his investment managers are accountants, but they will be joined by a merchant banker shortly. He thinks small teams and decisiveness have been important in Murray Johnstone's emergence. It is policy to say 'no' quickly so as to make as much resource available as possible for speeding 'yes' decisions. 'But if you say yes, you have got to mean it, and not be half-hearted,' he says. Murray Johnstone believes it is now second in UK regional markets to 3i, which has a 50 per cent share. Unlike 3i, it always adopts a hands-on approach, taking a seat on the board of investee companies. Mr Diggines also believes Manchester's financial and professional network has been important, enabling many deals to be brokered and syndicated in the northern capital's 'square half-mile' - the city centre area peopled by lawyers, fund managers, accountants and the like. The key, however, is access to substantial funds and to the ability to commit them. Something more than a representative office is required. In its Manchester set-up, Murray Johnstone appears to have discovered an ideal approach. Some London-based funds are already trying to copy it in the regions. If Murray Johnstone can repeat its Manchester success in the south and south-east, the gauntlet will really be down.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Management: MBA numbers on the slide Has the MBA's surging popularity finally been checked? Preliminary findings from the London-based Association of MBA's suggest the number of students enrolling on UK courses this year has fallen by 10-15 per cent. A clear picture of the underlying trend, though, has yet to emerge. Roger McCormick, director-general, says the Association has done its 'ring round' four times - but is still not satisfied it has 'an accurate fix' on what is going on. Business schools can be notoriously secretive with the result that the quality of some of the information may be suspect. In certain cases the market has clearly collapsed. At one south-east polytechnic, course numbers have fallen from more than 60 to less than 35 in the last two years. But elsewhere there is tentative evidence that administrators may be filling places with poorer-quality candidates than in the past, and that expansion plans have been shelved. McCormick is wary of concluding that the MBA bubble has burst. He remains impressed by the resilience in a recession of the full-time MBA course - which requires participants to leave a job and raise funds to pay for tuition and lodging - and points out that the setback follows several years of strong growth. Since sterling's devaluation last September, moreover, UK MBA courses have become more attractive for foreign students who speak good English. There are 92 MBA courses in the UK, compared with 47 in 1986. Last year, according to the Association, 2,500 students completed full-time courses, 2,500 completed part-time courses, and 700 received their MBA through distance learning. The distance learning numbers will get a boost this year when the first full cohort of MBA students graduates from the Open University.</p>

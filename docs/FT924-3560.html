			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Alan Sugar remains pessimistic over deal MR ALAN Sugar yesterday remained pessimistic about gaining the support of shareholders who appear strongly opposed to his proposal to take Amstrad private. With the approach of tomorrow's deadline for proxy votes, ahead of the extraordinary meeting on Thursday, Mr Sugar repeated the suggestion that shareholders should act. Some of the 20,000 shareholders who had not voted but who expected a cheque in the post for their shares 'might be in for a surprise,' he said. 'The interesting thing is what happens to the share price tomorrow,' Mr Sugar said last night. Results of proxies received by Thursday evening suggesting Mr Sugar was losing his battle to take Amstrad private came on Friday after the market closed. Amstrad shares closed unchanged on Friday at 28p, 2p below the price Mr Sugar is offering to buy the 65 per cent of Amstrad shares he does not already own. Amstrad on Saturday ended its telephone campaign to persuade shareholders to send in proxy cards. The campaign which was financed by Amstrad and policed by Amstrad's advisers, Kleinwort Benson, involved individual calls to thousands of Amstrad shareholders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There was turmoil again today on the currency  markets. The escudo was under pressure from speculators when  Portuguese banks sold so much currency that they ended up  without escudos. The Bank of Portugal was forced to intervene  with over 1 billion escudos to be able to control the situation.  It was a nerve-racking day on the markets. More details from  Paulo Fidalgo:    [Fidalgo] The financial markets were surprised today when  banks started running out of escudos and short-term interest  rates rocketed to figures 10 times above the average of about  one week ago. For you to have an idea about the chaos reigning  in the markets, it is enough for me to tell you that rates for  24-hour interbank loans reached 100 percent as opposed to 10-12  percent rates charged one week ago. Following intervention by  the Bank of Portugal, the situation was more under control, and  the overnight rate settled at 40 percent. But to stabilize the  situation, the Central Bank had to make available to banks over  1 billion escudos, twice the amount used yesterday. Speculators  started selling escudos about one week ago and forced the  devaluation of the Portuguese currency against almost every  single currency within the European Monetary System [EMS].  National banks that played an intermediate role in the  operations have now run out of escudos and will have to buy them  before Monday [11 April], the date when the Central Bank will  verify whether the compulsory reserves are within the  established boundaries. Miguel Beleza, governor of Bank of  Portugal, is imposing the present interest rates as a means of  punishing speculators and thus charging a very high price for  the availability of the currency. This is a way of controlling  the game of purchase and sale of the escudo and maintaining its  value on the international market.    From this speculative movement against the escudo, the banks  are trying to draw the conclusion that interest rates have  already reached their lowest limit -- around 9 percent -- and  that they cannot drop any further unless the government gives up  the present value of the escudo within the EMS. Therefore, the  market is now waiting for clearer signs: A strong escudo or low  interest rates. But it looks difficult to have these two  together.</p>

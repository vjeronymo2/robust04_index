			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Patience runs out in S Africa: A look at grievances over living conditions As so often in the past, downtown Johannesburg on Monday night was the scene of violent confrontation between angry black demonstrators and police. But unlike the clashes of earlier years, this was no clear-cut battle between the heartless enforcers of apartheid and their defiant victims. Instead, it was triggered by police evicting homeless people who had illegally occupied a vacant building in protest at the government's seeming inability to find them alternative accommodation. Images of destitute families thrown out on to the street encapsulate a cruel moral and practical dilemma for the African National Congress-led government: how can it cater to the demands of its long-suffering black constituents while reintroducing a culture of law and order? 'Disaffection is growing,' says Mr David Maepa, a local government expert with First National Bank. 'People are willing to wait if they know something is being done, but the impression the government gives is of talk and no action.' Part of the problem is a crisis in local government across the country. On everything from the provision of housing to the building of schools, the ANC has insisted communities should be directly involved; the problem is that as yet, there exist no post-apartheid local authorities qualified or equipped to assume such roles. 'At national level, the legitimacy crisis was solved (through the April elections) before delivery (on black expectations). At local level, the problems of legitimacy and delivery will have to be confronted at the same time,' Mr Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, the veteran political analyst charged with running new local government elections, said in a recent article. The problem is unlikely to be resolved soon. A year ago, constitutional negotiators confidently predicted the first democratic local elections would take place by the end of November. Six months later, the new government put this date back by a year for logistical reasons, but retained the beginning of December as the target for integrating white towns and black townships into single metropolitan councils. But fewer than half all municipalities have managed even this task, necessary before voters' rolls can be compiled. The likelihood of elected authorities taking over before 1996 is receding rapidly. The corrosive rent and services boycotts that began during the mid-1980s as a form of political protest are exacerbating the problem by leaving local bodies short of the funds to undertake development. As a result, although the cabinet has agreed to write off tenant arrears to the end of January 1994, at the cost of several billion rands, the strain on national finances has forced it to insist that payments due from February onwards must be met in full, a sum that already amounts to R324m in the so-called PWV area around Johannesburg alone. While both national and regional ANC leaders are threatening tough action, including politically unpopular evictions if payments are not met, they are coming under fire from grassroots organisations. The South African National Civic Organisation, an umbrella body for the ANC-aligned civic associations that sprang up in the mid-1980s as alternatives to official government bodies, has called on the government to scrap all arrears and further cut the already subsidised rent for township dwellers. 'Basic services must first be guaranteed and an affordable rate needs to be negotiated with the people,' says Mr Mbongeni Ngubeni, head of Sanco's local government unit. Some residents say the time for boycotts has passed, but most chafe at paying before services are upgraded. 'Why should people pay for faulty houses and an unreliable water supply?' asks one angry inhabitant of Soweto, the black township near Johannesburg. Eskom, the electricity utility, supports the view that improved services would lead to a higher level of payments, and says that since it upgraded its infrastructure in Soweto and began an educational and promotional programme in the area, revenues have risen. 'In October, 40 per cent of residents paid their bills compared to only 26 per cent in September,' says Mr Martin Opperman, the company's negotiations manager. As the squatters' protest this week indicated, patience is likely to run out unless there is a visible effort to address popular grievances well before the oft-postponed local elections take place. 'They have been sending the wrong signals so far,' says First National's Mr Maepa. 'It is time for the government to start addressing grassroots concerns.'</p>

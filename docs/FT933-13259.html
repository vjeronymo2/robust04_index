			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas beats fall in civilian business McDONNELL Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday reported a strong improvement in second-quarter earnings, despite the sharp global downturn in the civil aviation business. Mr Herb Lanese, chief financial officer, said the company was 'tracking very well' to exceed Wall Street's expectations of Dollars 9.30 a share in earnings from operations for 1993. McDonnell Douglas shares rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 74 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company reported net earnings of Dollars 170m, or Dollars 4.33 a share, compared with Dollars 11m, or 29 cents, in the same period of last year, even though revenues dipped from Dollars 4.8bn to Dollars 3.8bn. It was helped by Dollars 57m, or Dollars 1.46, of unusual gains from settlement of a tax issue and a change in retirement health care funding, but the company said that even without this help, earnings of Dollars 113m were a second-quarter record. McDonnell Douglas, which has been financially stretched for the past few years, also substantially improved its balance sheet, with the indebtedness of its aerospace operations dropping to Dollars 2.34bn, compared with Dollars 2.77bn at the end of 1992, while the debt to equity ratio dipped to 0.75 from 1.01. The increase in earnings was powered by Dollars 100m of profits from the missiles, space and electronics segment, compared with Dollars 37m in the same period of last year. The military aircraft business produced Dollars 122m, up from Dollars 46m a year ago, when the company took a Dollars 34m write-off. The programme to develop the C-17 military transport, which has been dogged by financial and other problems, broke even in the first half and Mr Lanese said it was expected to be profitable in the second half. The civil aircraft business produced second-quarter earnings of Dollars 14m, up from Dollars 6m a year ago, despite a 37 per cent reduction in revenues, reflecting reduced aircraft deliveries. For the six months, McDonnell Douglas reported net earnings of Dollars 386m, or Dollars 9.84 a share, up from Dollars 35m, or 91 cents, in 1992, excluding the effect of an accounting change last year. First-half earnings from operations were Dollars 5.28 a share.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev by LA </F> LIBRE BELGIQUE correspondent in Sofia; date not given: "Sofia  Partner for Peace"]    [Text] On 14 February, Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev is  due to sign the "Partnership for Peace" offered by Bill Clinton  to the countries of Eastern Europe as a first step toward their  cooperation with the structures of NATO. The fact that it is  the president himself who will be signing the document  underlines the importance attached by Bulgaria to the European  structures in general, as well as its desire to obtain the best  possible guarantees for its security.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Mr. President, why has Bulgaria turned  to  the "Partnership for Peace?"    [Zhelev] Bulgaria cannot remain alienated from this  initiative, which is attracting all the countries of Central and  Eastern Europe, and to which Russia will also probably turn.  For us, this initiative represents an important step towards  full membership of NATO. Bulgaria hopes that, in time, NATO  will transform itself into a European-Atlantic security system  -- a pole guaranteeing security for all countries, large or  small, in any region of Europe or the Atlantic. Naturally,  Bulgaria cannot remain distant from this initiative in order to  seek alternative, utopian and uncertain, guarantees for its  national security.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Do you believe that Bulgaria could lose  some favor with Russia by doing this?    [Zhelev] I do not consider such a hypothesis to be well-  founded, for sooner or later Russia will, or should, join this  collective security system, depending on the natural run of  events. The European-Atlantic community itself has an interest  in attracting Russia, which constitutes a major element of this  very community.    It is not out of fear for any ambitions that the Russians  might have that we aspire to join NATO structures.  Bulgarian-Russian relations are traditionally friendly. If  politicians in certain circles -- communists, neocommunists, or  postcommunists -- regard our interest in NATO as an expression  of our being in opposition to Russia, then it is because they  have a poor understanding of the run of historical events.  Russia is on the way to democratization, just as we are.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is there agreement between the various  political forces in Bulgaria regarding its joining the  "Partnership" and, possibly, NATO?    [Zhelev] I believe that there is already a consensus on this  matter, at least at institutional level. I have, on several  occasions, expressed my view favoring Bulgaria's commitment to  and membership of NATO, for our country has no alternative  regarding its national security. The government supports the  same policy. In our Parliament, which is the arena of the  fiercest debates, there were only two votes against when a vote  was taken on the declaration in favor of subscribing to the  "Partnership" initiative.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Does the possibility of NATO air strikes  in Bosnia constitute a threat of the conflict spreading?    [Zhelev] We have always emphasized that Bulgaria will not  get  mixed up in that conflict in any way whatsoever. Moreover, we  want the other Balkan states and the countries bordering the  former Yugoslavia to adopt the same principle, for we believe  this to be a condition sine qua non for preventing the conflict  from spreading, and avoiding another war in the Balkans.    We believe that the UN embargo must be strictly respected,  because it is proving fairly effective. As for possible air  strikes, I believe them to be an extreme measure taken by the  United Nations with a view to lifting the siege of Sarajevo; and  I hope that, if it has to be implemented, the United Nations  will take account of the actual conditions on the ground to  spare the civilian population, and only attack the military  targets which are undermining the practical application of its  initiatives. However, in any case, this can only be done under  the aegis of NATO and within the context of the decisions it  takes.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Pentagon seeks sweeping cuts in weapons spending The Pentagon has ordered a sweeping review of almost all its main weapons programmes in an effort to squeeze defence spending over the next five years into a shrinking budget. The military services have been told to prepare to cancel, delay or arrange substitutes for all their most costly equipment plans, including the Air Force's F-22 fighter, the Army's Comanche helicopter, the Navy's Aegis destroyer and the Marines' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft. Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, said the services had requested more money for the 1996 fiscal year than the administration's budget would allow. He had therefore 'given them some guidance on where to cut' to ensure that service chiefs did not try to preserve pet weapon systems by scrimping on operations and training budgets, which he views as essential if US forces are to maintain full readiness. 'This doesn't mean that they'll be cut. It's just to say that these are not sacred cows,' Mr Perry said yesterday. In a memorandum to service chiefs, Mr John Deutch, Mr Perry's deputy, targeted 10 key weapons programmes for cancellation or delay. Mr Deutch told the Air Force to develop a plan for delaying acquisition of the F-22 fighter, built by Lockheed and Boeing. The Air Force currently plans to acquire over 48 F-22s a year, starting in 1998, at a cost of Dollars 71bn.( Pounds 45.8bn). The F-22 is the Air Force's most cherished project, and delaying its acquisition would complicate plans for replacing the F-16 strike aircraft in the next century. But Army officials have already started sniping at the F-22, which they say is designed to give a degree of air superiority that will never be needed against the third-world enemies the US is now likely to face, and has only limited ground attack capability. The Army, in turn, faces the prospect of cancelling its only two major programmes: the Comanche helicopter and the Advanced Field Artillery System. The Navy has been asked for plans to slow its shipbuilding programme to an average of either 2.5 or 2 destroyers a year, with additional delays for its new attack submarine. Mr Deutch also asked the Marines to submit the most promising helicopter alternative to the controversial Osprey, which takes off like a helicopter but then swings its rotors down to fly like a propeller-driven aircraft. Top Pentagon officials have tried for years to kill off the expensive and still experimental aircraft. Senior members of Congress and government auditors have been warning for some time that the armed services have failed to scale back their procurement plans enough to fit within today's budget limits. But cancelling some of the Pentagon's highest profile weapons systems is sure to attract criticism from opponents who have attacked the Clinton administration for cutting defence spending too much.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Warning on acid rain campaign Success in reducing the sort of industrial pollution that causes acid rain would increase the rate of global warming through the greenhouse effect, the British Association meeting heard. Dr David Carson, director of the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Control at the UK Meteorological Office, said: 'It is now known that sulphur dioxide emitted in industrial processes can lead to sulphate particles, which reflect sunlight back to space and cool the surface - an effect opposite to that of the greenhouse effect.' Sulphur dioxide emissions - the main cause of acid rain - result from burning sulphur containing coal and oil. Because acid rain does so much damage, many countries are trying to reduce such emissions by switching to low-sulphur fuels and installing sulphur-removing equipment in power stations. 'If we reduce sulphur emissions now, we would expect a more rapid rise in temperature than we have observed to date,' Dr Carson said. He did not advocate an end to sulphur reduction programmes as a countermeasure against global warming, but said it illustrated the complex interplay between different types of pollution and the need to allow for them when developing computer models of the climate.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (16): No tax - and less risk than you feared - Offshore funds Tax evasion, exotic, dodgy: for many investors these will be images conjured up by offshore investment funds. Yes, all can be true. But offshore funds don't have to be any more risky than unit and investment trusts, their UK-based cousins. Being offshore means a fund is based, for regulation and tax purposes, outside mainland UK. The rules that such funds live under and how they are taxed are different - sometimes better, sometimes worse - than onshore trusts. Offshore funds pay their income gross, which is handy for non-taxpayers. UK taxpayers, although they are expected to declare the income to the Inland Revenue, can benefit from the improved cashflow. Investors who expect to enter a lower tax bracket - say, when they retire or if they move abroad - can benefit from 'roll-up' funds. Putting your mind at rest on the regulatory front should involve the following steps: Look for names of investment firms you know. The bigger, blue-chip names have bigger reputations to protect. They are also more likely to have a UK contact point. If you deal through a UK-authorised arm of the offshore fund manager, you leave open the possibility of compensation for negligence under UK rules if the fund should, for example, go bankrupt. Buy through a UK-authorised financial adviser: again, you have the potential for making a claim of negligence against that adviser if something goes wrong with the fund. A fund that is recognised by the Securities and Investments Board (Sib) has been given the go-ahead to market to UK investors by one of the UK's senior financial regulators. Sib is saying that the regulatory framework of the fund is equivalent to that in the UK. Ucits status means the fund and its regulation conform to a European Union standard. Funds that carry neither are not necessarily to be avoided; but do check that the fund is authorised in its home territory. One advantage of an Sib-recognised fund is that the managers are required to say which watchdog you should complain to if something goes wrong. Favour funds from the bigger, less exotic offshore centres. The UK regulators say that Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda have investor protection - including compensation schemes - at least as good as in mainland UK. But it is possible for a fund from one of these centres to be subject to lesser regulation and compensation arrangements - so this test is not failsafe. Dublin and Luxembourg are both important fund centres with good regulatory reputations. But they don't have compensation schemes. Do not take the quoted charges at face value. Annual costs can amount to nearly 10 per cent of a fund's value, even though the quoted annual management charge is just 1.5 per cent; and that can prove a huge drag on investment performance. Uncovering these hidden charges is not easy, though: new guides from London-based Fitzrovia International are one of the very few user-friendly sources. Read the fund's marketing material or prospectus thoroughly. Know how your money will be invested, the pedigree of the managers and what you will pay (including, for example, performance fees) for that management.</p>

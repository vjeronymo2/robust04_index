			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Funds sought to back low-interest loans THE International Monetary Fund is looking for contributions worth SDR1.5bn (Pounds 1.64bn) from donor countries to help subsidise low interest rate loans to developing nations. The money would go towards establishing a successor to the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (Esaf), a trust fund set up in 1987 to lend at 0.5 per cent interest rates to low-income countries with protracted economic problems. The Esaf is due to expire in November. A senior IMF official said the Washington-based institution was looking for SDR5bn of capital for the new Esaf, in the form of interest-bearing loans from donor countries. In addition, the Esaf would need SDR2.1bn to finance the subsidy element in its loans. The IMF believes it can contribute SDR500m-600m from its own resources, leaving SDR1.5bn to be culled from donor countries. 'The amounts are sizeable but within reach,' the official said, adding that it should be possible to complete negotiations by the end of the year. The IMF will use its annual meetings, starting this weekend in Washington, as a fund-raising opportunity for the new Esaf, but officials expect to meet a cool initial response. Budget difficulties have made many countries reluctant to dip into their own treasuries, and the UK earlier this year suggested the IMF should sell some of its own gold reserves to finance the Esaf - a proposal which appears to have been dropped.</p>

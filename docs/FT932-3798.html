			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Germany in EC row over US sanctions GERMANY was at the centre of a potentially damaging EC row yesterday after the European Commission demanded an explanation for Bonn's apparent refusal to implement trade sanctions against the US, which the 12 agreed unanimously on Tuesday. In Bonn, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal economics minister, confirmed that Germany would not apply discriminatory sanctions against US companies. But he firmly rejected accusations that Germany was violating EC law. Commission lawyers were last night writing to the German government seeking full clarification, as Brussels underlined that Bonn was in danger of breaching Community law and loyalty. 'We're getting conflicting signals out of Bonn,' said an aide to Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner. 'They haven't made clear what they're doing,' he added. 'If confirmed, any bilateral agreement of such a kind would be illegal under Community law,' the Commission said in a tough statement. The row centres on government telecommunications contracts. The US last month imposed a ban on bids from EC companies for Dollars 20m worth of public procurement contracts, alleging discrimination against American companies in the European market. EC foreign ministers on Tuesday retaliated with a Dollars 15m sanctions package against the US. The US objects to Article 29 of the EC's utilities directive, which entered into law in January, and gives a 3 per cent price preference to EC companies bidding for any government contract. The article is there as a bargaining chip to get the US to dismantle its 'Buy American' legislation in public procurement. In April the two sides reached partial agreement on public contracts. The intra-EC row, so far confined to Brussels and Bonn, broke out after Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, told a US congressional committee on Thursday night that Germany and the US had agreed to drop sanctions. Brussels yesterday warned Bonn it would be taken to court if it failed to put Article 29 on Germany's statute book, and that it was also obliged to stand by the sanctions agreement it signed this week. Some Brussels officials suspect Washington of 'divide-and-rule' tactics. But they are also concerned that Germany will be weakened as a counterweight to France. The German economics ministry says it is bound by a 1954 friendship treaty with the US which forbids trade discrimination. The Commission flatly rejected this argument last night, pointing out that Article 234 of the EC's Treaty of Rome says that member states 'shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities' with previous undertakings. The Treaty 'is as clear as a bell and overrides previous agreements,' the aide to Sir Leon said.</p>

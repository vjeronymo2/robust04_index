			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given:  "`The Parties of the Right Have Failed'"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Horn, your serious car accident  is quite obviously still bothering you a lot.    [Horn] I am much better now, even though this appliance,  which weighs 7 kg, does create certain difficulties,  particularly in bed. But let us talk about politics.    [DER SPIEGEL] What Hungary's goulash communism failed to  accomplish in decades in power was achieved by the first freely  elected conservative government: With their first election  victory, the former Communists are now more popular than ever.    [Horn] What can be so bad about 54 percent of Hungarians  having cast their vote in favor of us Socialists? The  overwhelming majority of voters are salary-earners and  employees; all in all, the election result reflects the reality  of the structure of Hungarian society.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does this not sound like the former Lenin  disciple Horn, who, although he cut through the barbed wire at  the border with Austria in 1989, thus making it possible for  thousands of GDR refugees to leave the country, has stuck to  socialist ideas at the same time?    [Horn] By asking such a question you are ruling out that man  learns from experience. My process of rethinking did not only  start yesterday or the day before. I was one of those who  sought and found contacts with West European social-democratic  parties as early as in the mid-seventies, primarily with the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Therefore, in the  course of the years, we went through the school of social  democracy, studying in practice the social market economy,  pluralist democracy, and the thinking that is guided by free  enterprises....    [DER SPIEGEL] And then you forfeited the people's trust. In  1990 people voted against the old system without knowing the new  one, while now the Hungarians seem to be longing for the old  days.    [Horn] I do not want to rule out that our success does not  have to be attributed in parts also to a certain longing for the  past security people had in their lives. Yet the people do not  want to return to state ownership or the one-party system, they  only want competent experts now. The current government has  speeded up our victory through its stupid policy. This is what  highlighted the contrast between what we stood for and the  anachronism of these politicians even more. The Hungarian right  even tried to arouse a nostalgia for the arch-conservative  Horthy regime instead of meeting the challenges of our time.    [DER SPIEGEL] You do not have any problems with turncoats  and old single-party cliques?    [Horn] Of course, we also have them in Hungary. I have  heard of people who now all of a sudden address others with  comrade again, while only one year ago they would have protested  against it. But any deal requires two persons. It depends on  the party whether we will tolerate nepotism and whom we rely on  for support.    [DER SPIEGEL] Corruption is also widespread in Hungary. Can  you say with a clear conscience that there were no  irregularities in the way the assets of the former Communist  Party were dealt with, and that you are morally legitimized to  control these machinations?    [Horn] Excuse me -- the Socialist Party has given account of  the former party assets to the very last penny. This has been  confirmed by both the state prosecutor and the Audit Court.  Apart from that, I can promise only one thing: We are firmly  determined to fight mercilessly against any form of state  corruption, and to depose from office anyone from among the  ranks of our party who is even faintly suspected of corruption.    [DER SPIEGEL] Four years ago the conservatives made similar  promises; a little later the reforms got stuck. Everyday life  became dominated by the shadow economy and Mafia-like  structures. Is there not a danger that the Socialists could  suffer the same fate?    [Horn] Despite the absolute majority, we intend to rule in a  coalition. I am starting from the assumption that we will  submit an offer to this effect to the Alliance of Free  Democrats, since our programs are similar in many points. A  social-liberal coalition might create a wide democratic basis.  We want to enter into vivid dialogue with society, and practice  a new political style.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will Hungary's relations with its neighbors  change, relations that have been tense for a long time as a  result of Hungarian minorities?    [Horn] What we will not change in our foreign policy is  Hungary's Western orientation, in which I would like to give  priority to Hungarian-German relations. Should I become prime  minister, my first journey will probably take me to Bonn.  Hungary's further fate will depend to a large degree on whether  we manage to intensify relations with Germany. Moreover, we  need a better associate membership agreement with the European  Union [EU]. Then we must also seek a new beginning in our  relations particularly with Romania and Slovakia, countries with  which our problems have deteriorated regarding the Hungarian  minorities.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will Budapest give the signal for further  victories by reformist Communists in the former East bloc?    [Horn] I do not think that the voters in any country will  look to their neighbors for election results. There is not a  trend toward the left in eastern Europe; the only thing that  matters is that the right-wing conservative parties have failed  everywhere in this part of Europe. This should really be their  problem.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / More doubts on London hospitals THE NEXT STEP in the controversy over the restructuring of London's hospitals will come next Wednesday with the publication of six reviews into the distribution of specialist services in the capital. The reviews into the future shape of London's specialist services were set up by the government after the Tomlinson report, which proposed reducing the capital's large number of teaching and specialist hospitals. Next week's reports will, however, add to doubts over the future of hospitals that were not directly threatened by Tomlinson. The pressure group London Health Emergency, which yesterday published a document containing findings from the reviews, expressed fears that the recommendations could lead to nine hospitals closing and others finding their financial positions undermined. In addition to hospitals such as St Bartholomew's in the City, under threat since the publication of the Tomlinson report last year, the pressure group suggested that hospitals such as Oldchurch in Romford, the Brook in Greenwich, Atkinson Morley's in Wimbledon and Queen Elizabeth children's hospital in Hackney will be at risk. London Health Emergency expects that the reviews will propose to transfer specialist units lost in the closures, but fears that in the present state of public spending policies there would not be sufficient funds to finance such redevelopment. The pressure group said: 'The only certainty appears to be that a big reduction in London hospital services is already under way, reinforced by the panic cuts and closures imposed by the chaos of the internal market.' Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, stressed yesterday that it would 'be wrong to think that the recommendations of the reviews provide the definitive blueprint for the future'. The reviews, like the Tomlinson report itself, would be treated as independent advice to the government and not as government policy. Further rationalisation in London is likely to be proposed next month when another review of the capital's specialist post-graduate hospitals is published. Final decisions on hospital services in the capital are likely to be made by ministers by the end of the year.</p>

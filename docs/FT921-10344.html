			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Financial advisers criticised by Which? MANY investments suggested by financial advisers would generate a high commission for advisers but were not suitable for investors, according to a Consumers Association study published in Which? magazine today. The survey follows a recent study by the Securities and Investments Board, the investments watchdog body, which found that many policies sold by tied agents of insurance companies were cancelled within two years, with a consequent loss to investors. Two Which? investigators each visited 20 financial institutions. A panel of experts then commented on the advice. The survey found a mixed standard. A third of companies regulated by the Financial Services Act did not provide a buyers' guide for the investigators, as the act requires. Banks were the most criticised institutions, with the experts finding that they 'generally failed to get enough personal information'. Independent financial advisers were praised for suggestions given to one investigator.</p>

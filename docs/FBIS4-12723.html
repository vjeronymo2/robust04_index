			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alon Pinkas and Bill Hutman] </F>   [Excerpt] A total closure of the territories was imposed  yesterday and is to last at least until after Independence Day.    At the same time, police launched an operation to locate any  Arabs from the territories within the Green Line and escort them  back to their homes.    Leaves have already been canceled for all police officers,  and training courses closed, with participants being sent back  into the field to beef up manpower.    The decision to impose the closure was made by Defense  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin following recommendations from the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces], the General Security Service, and the  police.    The closure went into effect yesterday at 5 p.m. and  included, without exception, the Gaza Strip, Judaea, and  Samaria. Palestinians from the territories will be barred from  entering Israel, including eastern Jerusalem.    Police Inspector-General Rafi Peled said the closure would  remain in effect until the present wave of terror subsides, and  then would only be lifted gradually.    "We are going to constantly check ourselves. If the  situation deteriorates, we will continue (the closure). If  things cool off, we will consider a gradual and controlled  lifting of it," Peled said.    Last night, police conducted a nationwide search for  Palestinians illegally residing in Israel, finding them, and  then returning them to the territories.    "The country will be empty of Arabs from the territories,"  Peled said.    The IDF also imposed a "regional closure" on Janin, Tulkarm,  and Qalqilyah, prohibiting residents from traveling beyond city  limits. In addition, Hebron is still considered a closed  military area.    Security sources have confirmed that a large Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] cell is active in Janin. They stressed  that Hamas cells in Ramallah and Hebron were liquidated in the  last two months, but that the Janin cell, to which the 'Afula  terrorist apparently belonged, is still at large. "We are  talking about no more than 12 activists who enjoy the  population's support in some areas," they said.    Security sources said that the closure is, at this point,  "indefinite," but Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Ehud Baraq  said it would last several days. Defense Ministry sources said  the closure would continue at least until Independence Day.  [passage omitted]</p>

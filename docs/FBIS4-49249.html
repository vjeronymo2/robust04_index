			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Lu Ping Says Good Atmosphere Needed for Meeting </F> With Patten"]    [Text] Yesterday (3 May), Lu Ping, vice chairman and  secretary general of the Preliminary Working Committee, who is  visiting Hong Kong, said that he hoped to meet Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten in the future in a better atmosphere so  that they would really be able to achieve certain results  through a meeting; at present, the Hong Kong Government was not  friendly to the Preliminary Working Committee, so if he and the  governor held personal talks, the talks might not achieve any  results.    Last night, after attending a cocktail party held by XINHUA  Hong Kong Branch in honor of the visiting mainland members of  the Preliminary Working Committee, Lu Ping answered questions  raised by reporters. When asked when he would meet with the  Hong Kong governor, he said that he hoped there would be a  better atmosphere so that both sides might actually achieve  certain results through a meeting; otherwise, it would be  meaningless if they met and achieved no result.    Lu Ping said: At present, the Hong Kong Government is not  friendly enough toward the Preliminary Working Committee. It  does not allow Hong Kong civil servants to meet committee  members. In such circumstances, even if personal talks are held  with the governor, the talks may not achieve any result. So it  is better to first make some progress on certain issues through  lower-level contacts through various channels, and then he may  consider whether it is possible to achieve certain results  through talks between him and the governor.    When talking about the airport issue, Lu Ping said that the  two sides were still discussing issues concerning the airport  project and the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. He believed  that an option acceptable to both sides would be worked out. He  hoped that agreement would be reached on the financial package  and airport management regulations before long.    Lu Ping said that he came to Hong Kong this time in his  capacity as vice chairman and secretary general of the  Preliminary Working Committee to attend meetings of the  political and economic affairs groups. The two groups are  holding meetings in Hong Kong mainly for the purpose of enabling  their members to listen to more opinions from various quarters  in Hong Kong. He stressed that the task of the Preliminary  Working Committee was to strive for a smooth transition in 1997,  and he believed that a smooth transition represented the common  wish of all Hong Kong residents. So he expects support and  cooperation from the general public for the work of the  Preliminary Working Committee, and the committee is also willing  to listen to opinions from all quarters of the local community.    Lu Ping said that because he had to rush back to Beijing to  handle some urgent matters, his schedule in Hong Kong was very  busy. Many friends wanted to see him, but he did not have enough  time, and he was sorry about that. He hoped that he would stay  in Hong Kong for a longer period next time. When asked about  his feelings about Hong Kong, he said that he did not have any  special feelings because he did not go sightseeing in the  streets.    Lu Ping asked the mass media to convey his regards to the  residents of Hong Kong. He said that he had not visited Hong  Kong in the last one or two years, and he really wanted to see  what changes had occurred in various aspects. However, he had  to attend meetings these days, so he could only greet Hong Kong  people through the media.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Samsonenko: "Demonopolization"] </F>   [Text] A three-day anti-monopoly meeting in Kiev on May 24  was attended by representatives of most of the CIS and central  European countries.    The foundations for this meeting were laid in Moscow on  March  12, 1993, by heads of the CIS member states who signed an  anti-monopoly agreement. A few months later CIS representatives  met to set the appropriate guidelines. Another meeting in Almaty  on October 15, 1993, dealt with legal imperfections in the  Moscow agreement and lack of coordination. Basic principles for  competition and integration were set forth in Ashhabad on  December 23, 1993: the CIS representatives agreed on  anti-monopoly policies and establishment of an Interstate  Council.    In opening the conference Oleksander Zavada, head of the  Ukrainian Anti-Monopoly Committee, noted that the Kiev forum was  the best attended and included Eastern European representatives.  He underscored the fact that the purpose of the meeting was to  enhance cooperation in anti-monopoly policies among the CIS  members and develop analogous relationships with Baltic and East  European countries.    Since all the countries shared a common economic system in  the recent past, there is great need for such coordination,  particularly where international trade is involved. To that end,  Ukraine had initiated this meeting to coordinate anti-monopoly  measures and safeguard entrepreneurs and consumers alike. This  was particularly important because of expansion of the  activities of trans-national corporation.    While Zavada agreed that the experience of Russia or some  Eastern European countries may not have been too impressive,  Ukraine must take their experience into account when formulating  its anti-monopoly policies because of their encounters with  market economy problems and monopolistic practices. Moreover,  Ukraine has already implemented over three hundred anti-monopoly  measures and has created a corresponding legal framework to  support them. It is important for Ukraine that these laws fit in  with the rest of Ukrainian jurisprudence.    The meeting culminated with the signing of the appropriate  documents of understanding, integration and implementation among  the CIS members, Baltic states and Eastern European countries.  In addition, the Interstate Council considered methodological  ramifications of cooperation in light of individual national  laws.    The meeting ratified a memorandum issued by the Interstate  Council to the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly entitled  "Concordance of National Anti-Monopoly Laws with the  Anti-Monopoly Agreement Signed by CIS Heads of State at Ashhabad  on December 23, 1993." Leonid Bochyn, head of the Interstate  Council and of the Russian State Committee on Anti-Monopoly  Policy, has characterized the memorandum as being important  because it calls for concordance of anti-monopoly laws, passage  of applicable laws by parliaments of CIS member states, and  creation of enforcing agencies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Vasilkova: "But As Far As the Rest Is </F> Concerned--Everything Is Coming Up Roses!"]    [Text]  <H5>  Ministry of Labor Provides Results for Last Year </H5>   "According to information from the Nutrition Institute, last  year our schoolchildren grew thinner by a kilogram. We find this  report disturbing," Valeriy Kolosov, first deputy minister of  labor of the Russian Federation, told journalists.    Plans called for the minister himself to conduct this press  conference on the situation in the socio-labor sphere, but he  was detained at a government meeting. His deputies, V. Kolosov  and R. Batkayev, therefore came under the "shelling" of press  representatives.    What did we find out?  <H5>  Population Income </H5>   Population income increased 11-fold over the level of 1992.  However, this takes into account the incomes of people engaged  in entrepreneurial activity. If these are not taken into  account, the level of income fell.    More than 30 percent of the populace have incomes lower than  the minimum wage level, and 13 percent have incomes which do not  exceed the cost of the minimum subsistence selection. And this  does not consider the quality of nourishment, a factor of  serious concern to medical experts. For example, the  above-mentioned schoolchildren no longer receive milk at  breakfast.  <H5>  Wages </H5>   Wages increased 9.9-fold over the level of 1992, which  corresponds approximately to the growth in consumer prices. But  in December of last year wages increased only eightfold over the  level of the previous December, while prices rose almost  10-fold. The differential seen with respect to wages is ever  increasing.    "At a number of state enterprises, the salaries managers  receive exceed the average wage dozens of times," V. Kolosov  stressed. "This is abnormal. We have to have some kind of rules  regulating this."    Recently a critical situation has arisen regarding delays in  monetary payments, especially to workers in the budget sphere.  Their pay level continues to lag behind wages in the production  sphere. Last year the wage level in sociocultural sectors  amounted to 40-80 percent of the average wage in industry.  <H5>  Employment and Unemployment </H5>   The total number of "persons out of work and actively  seeking  work" (as the employment services characterize the unemployed)  and "workers in the less-than-full employment mode" (the  potentially unemployed) came to 7.8 million individuals by the  end of 1993, or 10.4 percent of the "economically active  population." Some 0.8 million people hold official status as  unemployed. Considering sectors of the national economy, the  most significant employment reductions were seen in science and  construction. Yet the number of people employed in credit  services, insurance, tax inspectorates, public notary offices,  and legal services is increasing.  <H5>  Labor relations </H5>   Labor relations are characterized as tense. The reasons:  nonconformance of labor legislation to new economic conditions  and the absence of an effective system of protecting the labor  rights of workers.    Contract forms of labor relations based on principles of  social partnership have virtually displaced the administrative  forms of labor relations.  <H5>  Labor Conditions and Social Insurance </H5>   Every day about 30 individuals lose their lives and more  than  50 become disabled in the production sphere. Some 400 accidents  occur each year. Expenses incurred by enterprises related to  damage compensation exceed 40 billion rubles [R] per year. Our  level of occupational trauma is two to four times greater than  in the developed countries of Europe. Nonetheless, enterprises  are reducing funds designated for ensuring occupational safety,  and in the private sector they often do not allocate such funds  at all.  <H5>  Personnel Training </H5>   Over the past three years, we have seen sharp reductions in  the numbers of directors and specialists--by more than  threefold, and of workers--by 5.4-fold. The number of workers  undergoing training, retraining, or receiving instruction for  the first time decreased twofold.    Assessing the situation overall in the socio-labor sphere,  specialists of the Ministry of Labor have concluded that as a  result of measures taken, the landslide drop in standard of  living of the population which began in 1992 came to a halt in  1993.    To agree or not agree with this--is the right each one of us  has.</p>

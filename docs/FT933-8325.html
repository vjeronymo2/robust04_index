			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Modest US Growth THE US economy is growing at a modest pace, figures indicated yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. The Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 0.4 per cent last month and 3.5 per cent in the year to July, more than recouping small declines in output in May and June. The figures - consistent with forecasts of accelerated economic growth in the current quarter, after a disappointing 1.6 per cent annual growth rate between April and June - indicate that factory production is beginning to expand in response to rising consumer demand. Last month's rebound was broadly based and would have been stronger but for a further modest decline in car and truck output. The consumer goods, business equipment and construction sectors all registered production increases after previous declines. Output of utilities rose sharply as unusually hot weather led to a surge in electricity consumption. Manufacturing output rose by 0.2 per cent last month and by 3.8 per cent in the year to July. The level of industrial capacity utilisation rose slightly to 81.5 per cent, the average level in the first half. This is less than half a percentage point below the long-term average, suggesting that rapid increases in production would put upward pressure on prices.</p>

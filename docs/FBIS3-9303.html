			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A little while ago, Czech radio asked Czech Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus to comment on today's rally staged by the  Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions Association.    [Begin Klaus recording] I am not at all willing to comment  on  this rally because the government has not contributed one iota  to this rally. This is simply a 100-percent, or 101-percent,  matter of the trade unions. This has nothing to do whatsoever  with the government.    The talks between the government and the trade unions have  been conducted in an absolutely correct way, I think. A number  of comments trade unions had regarding the amendment of the  Labor Code have been accepted. Thus, any consideration that the  government failed to consult these matters with the trade unions  is an absolute lie and a fallacy. It does not necessarily  follow that the government should accept all of the trade  unions' comments in their entirety, as some trade union leaders  might wish. In my view, there is nothing in this matter that  the government would have to feel responsible for. I am getting  reports from all over the Republic speaking about false pressure  campaigns when trade unionists invite people to take a free trip  to Prague, where, as part of this trip, they would briefly  attend some kind of rally. Telephone calls, faxes, and letters  coming from people all over the Republic clearly reveal these  actions on the part of the trade unions. Personally, I would be  ashamed to be a trade union leader. [end recording]</p>

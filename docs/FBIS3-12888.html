For some time, the Iraqi regime has  been interfering in Yemen's internal affairs, particularly after  the successful democratic experiment in Yemen. With this  experiment, the Yemeni people in both parts of the country opted  for unity and coexistence under a single regime to prevent the  country from sliding into the cycle of conflicts and crises. By  depending on the people's will and by going back to the people,  Yemeni unity was achieved.    Naturally, the Baghdad regime does not feel comfortable  about  the success of any experiment that may smell of democracy and in  which the peoples have a decisive say. Thus, the Baghdad regime  decided to inflame the Yemeni crisis and steadily sought to  undermine Yemeni unity, hoping to gain a foothold there by  creating a fragile pro-Iraqi regime in Yemen that would follow  in its footsteps and accept whatever Iraqi dictator Saddam  Husayn imposed on it.    According to Iraqi opposition sources, the Yemeni Socialist  Party has expressed concern with the sabotaging role played by  the Baghdad regime in the Yemeni crisis. Instead of lending a  helping hand to bring the views of the two conflicting parties  in Yemen closer, the Iraqi regime is trying hard to deepen their  differences by backing one party against the other. Reports  indicate that 12 Iraqi pilots have arrived in Sanaa to train and  support the northerners' troops. The same reports indicate that  during the past two months the Iraqi Embassy in Sanaa was the  scene of meetings between military commanders who support Yemeni  president 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the Iraqi military attache in  Sanaa. To further increase tensions in Yemen, some members of  the pro-Baghdad Yemeni Ba'th Party kidnapped a number of  foreigners some time ago and held them with some of the tribes  affiliated with the party. Furthermore, the Baghdad  intelligence service in Yemen in the past few years has  assassinated several Yemeni political and scientific figures.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> KALEIDOSCOPE REVIVED AT CAL STATE L.A.  </P> <P> To the isolated, nomadic dancers and choreographers of Southern California,  Dance Kaleidoscope has become an annual gathering of the clans -- a chance to  display individual achievement in the context of a community showcase.  </P> <P> For eight years, starting in 1979, the performance series survived its unwieldy  grab-bag format and wildly fluctuating standards of quality control only to  vanish with the collapse of its sponsor: the Los Angeles Area Dance Alliance.  </P> <P> Enter Cal State L.A., a blue-ribbon selection panel and the city's Department  of Performing Arts, all working to reconstitute Dance Kaleidoscope as a  three-program (six-performance) event spread across two weekends. As before,  the focus is on presenting up-and-coming artists: 24 soloists and groups who  need a stage. The event no longer takes place at the John Anson Ford Theatre --  but that venue was never exactly ideal for dance and, anyway, who needs more  summer traffic in Cahuenga Pass?  </P> <P> The important thing is that the new, on-campus location, the city money, the  uniform audition process and the shared commitment to excellence have made no  difference whatsoever. Dance Kaleidoscope re-emerged over the weekend exactly  as it used to be: flagrantly, gloriously uneven, boasting some dancers that  only a mother could love and choreography that amounted to budget knockoffs of  the era's most celebrated innovations.  </P> <P> On Program A, Saturday night, Naomi Goldberg's new, ad hoc Los Angeles Modern  Dance and Ballet Company perfectly caught the gestalt of the event with the  playful Baroque suite "Looking in a Fishtank," in which people of nearly every  possible age, race, sex, physical condition and level of expertise executed the  same movement tasks in a procession resembling the epic winning-of-the-West  sequences from "Billy the Kid." Welcome to the new frontier: dancing as  variegated as the Los Angeles audience.  </P> <P> This endearing throwback to the anyone-can-dance phase of early minimalism  found its complement in the sensational contact-style duet that opened the  lumpy genre piece "Dawg Tired and Dirty," with Karen Johnson boldly lifting and  swinging Steven Craig as if declaring her emancipation from societal partnering  stereotypes.  </P> <P> Liberation of another sort informed Stephanie Gilliland's solo "Sticks and  Fall," in which involvement in music and formal movement process seemed to  bring the dancer close to a personal breakthrough -- a mode of direct,  instinctual expression beyond performing. It didn't happen Saturday, but the  attempt provided the only genuine risk and experiment on the program.  </P> <P> Recently reviewed, Ferne Ackerman's finely crafted group piece "Flame" looked  hectic and oversold at this performance, just as Andor Czomp's fluent  Herdsman's Dance ("Ecsegi Kanasztanc") for Karpatok Hungarian Folk Ensemble  proved curiously flat. Even more disappointing: the insensitive and often  unmotivated dancing by California Theatre Ballet of "Sunflowers," the late  Antony Tudor's masterful 1971 study of shifting emotional alliances.  </P> <P> Though Young-Ae Park's "Da'Mong" (Dream Layers) began in tantalizing  processional vignettes, it soon dumped dance altogether to emphasize  play-acting cliches. Still, the solo at least had Park's technical skill and  concentration to recommend it.  </P> <P> During intermission, the Katja Biesanz Dance Theatre presented the modest,  whimsical "Chagall's Circus" on a small platform stage outdoors. Problematic  visibility alone made this a dubious innovation in Kaleidoscope tradition,  though the piece's artful costumes and body masks (especially the gleaming  fish) certainly looked alluring close-up in the moonlight.  </P></p>

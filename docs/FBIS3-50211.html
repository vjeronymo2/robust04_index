Addressing a  press conference in Wroclaw on Tuesday, Szmajdzinski warned that  the daily costs of maintaining the complex military training,  health care, and housing systems represent 75 percent of the  total Army budget because these structures are too large for the  reduced Polish Army. Szmajdzinski called for respective quick  decisions because even a 6-7 percent increase in spending on  national defence will not solve the problem. He also appealed  for quicker structural changes in the national defence sector  and exemption of 5 thousand soldiers from the military service  duty.</p>

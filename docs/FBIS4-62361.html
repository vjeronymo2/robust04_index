			<p>BFN     [Text] Because of poor flying conditions, the delegation of  the joint peace-making mission of the CSCE and Russia was today  once again unable to fly out to Stepanakert for talks with the  Karabakh leadership. As an ITAR-TASS correspondent learned, a  decision was taken today to hold the meeting between Jan  Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group and Vladimir  Kazimirov, plenipotentiary representative of the Russian  president, and the leadership of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  in Yerevan.</p>

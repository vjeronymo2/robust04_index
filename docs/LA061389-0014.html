			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ROYAL HUNCH PAYS OFF IN 2-1 VICTORY OVER A'S  </P> <P> John Wathan, the Kansas City Royals' manager, went with his instincts Monday  night against the Oakland Athletics, and came away with a victory and an  improved position in the American League West.  </P> <P> With Kevin Seitzer at second and two out in the 11th, Jim Eisenreich worked the  count to 3-and-1 before grounding a single up the middle, scoring Seitzer and  pushing the Royals past the A's, 2-1.  </P> <P> The victory at Kansas City, the Royals' fifth straight, moved the team past the  Angels into second place in the American League West, 2 1/2 games behind the  A's.  </P> <P> "Sometimes you have to do what your instincts tell you to do," said Wathan, who  allowed the left-handed Eisenreich to hit against left-handed reliever Greg  Cadaret.  </P> <P> Eisenreich, who was as surprised as any at Wathan's decision, said: "I didn't  think there was any way I would bat. I kept looking over my shoulder to see  (right-handed) Pat Tabler coming out of the dugout to pinch-hit."  </P> <P> Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa had brought Cadaret in from the bullpen in the  11th to replace Todd Burns and face the left-handed George Brett, who grounded  out.  </P> <P> LaRussa ordered Cadaret to walk Bo Jackson intentionally, bringing up  Eisenreich.  </P> <P> "I like the matchup of Cadaret against the left-handers," LaRussa said. "Burns  had already been in there for three innnings. I was proud of Greg. He made some  good pitches to Brett and Eisenreich."  </P> <P> It was the 14th time in 18 games that Oakland pitchers have allowed no more  than two runs. The Athletics have won 11 of them.  </P> <P> The Royals took a 1-0 lead in the second against Bob Welch on Jackson's  opposite-field home run, his 15th.  </P> <P> The Athletics tied it, 1-1, in the sixth on a walk, Mark Gubicza's throwing  error and an infield out. Mike Gallego, the No. 9 hitter, walked leading off  and Luis Polonia dropped down a sacrifice bunt.  </P> <P> Gubicza charged and attempted an off-balance throw to first that sailed wide  for an error, allowing Gallego to go to third. After Dave Henderson struck out,  Dave Parker grounded to second baseman Brad Wellman as Gallego scored the tying  run.  </P> <P> Jim Corsi relieved Welch in the fourth when the right-hander pulled a groin  muscle covering first base on a ground ball.  </P> <P> Toronto 5, Detroit 4 -- Kelly Gruber's fifth hit of the game, a two-run double  with two out in the 11th inning, lifted the Blue Jays over the Tigers at  Toronto.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays took three of four games from the Tigers and spoiled Sparky  Anderson's 10th year anniversary as Detroit manager.  </P> <P> The five-hit game was the first of Gruber's career and made a winner of Tom  Henke. Mike Heath had five hits for the Tigers.  </P> <P> Fred McGriff hit his 14th homer for Toronto, Gary Ward his second for Detroit.  </P> <P> Chicago White Sox 5, Cleveland 3 -- Steve Rosenberg won for the first time in  five major league starts and Rich Yett was chased without retiring a batter at  Chicago as the White Sox beat the Indians.  </P> <P> Rosenberg allowed eight hits and three runs in 6 1/3 innings, striking out four  and walking none. Donn Pall went 1 2/3 innings and Bobby Thigpen pitched a  hitless ninth for his 11th save.  </P> <P> Yett allowed two hits, walked two and hit a batter, and four of the five  runners scored. It was the first time he has been knocked out in the first and  his third straight defeat.  </P> <P> Cory Snyder homered for Cleveland, his seventh.  </P> <P> Chicago Cubs 10, St. Louis 3 -- Ryne Sandberg drove in three runs with three  hits, including a two-run homer, and Jerome Walton had four hits for the first  time in his career as the Cubs defeated the Cardinals at Chicago.  </P> <P> With Rick Sutcliffe sidelined with back spasms, Steve Wilson made his first  major league start and allowed three hits in five innings, walking one and  striking out three.  </P> <P> Walton, activated Sunday from the disabled list, led off the first with a  single and was forced by Dwight Smith. Sandberg followed with his eighth homer  of the season and third in his last three at-bats against Scott Terry, who got  the loss -- the Cardinals' first in six games.  </P></p>

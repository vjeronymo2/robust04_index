			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (6): Hardest to call - Industrials / Victims of the double dip OF all the property sectors, industrials are probably the hardest to call at present; it is possible that they have reached a watershed which in turn may have indicated the arrival of the recession's second dip. Until the summer, factories and warehouses were undoubtedly the best performers in an otherwise grisly market. That certainty has now vanished. Since mid-year, lettings and capital values surveys have been out of date almost before publication. During the third quarter, the number of investment transactions declined significantly, according to Mr David Hutchings, head of investment research at Healey &amp; Baker, although demand for well-let modern space continued. But more telling may be the accelerating decline in rental levels seen in the Hillier Paker rent index: -2.3 per cent between February and May, accelerating to -3.2 per cent between May and August. There is also little joy to be found in the most recent floorspace survey from King &amp; Co. Throughout 1990 and 1991 the industrial sector was underpinned by a relative balance between supply and normal demand - relative, that is, to the grossly over-supplied office market. But there are now signs that manufacturing and distribution companies are failing to mop up space at the same rate. King &amp; Co's figures to mid-August show a 4 per cent overall increase in available floorspace to an historically high level of 163m sq ft in England and Wales - and these figures were reached before the spate of autumn closures and shrinkages announced by BAe, Ford and others, let alone the knock-on effects of the government's attempt to halve British Coal. There is still strength to be seen in the industrial sector. New buildings continue to be taken up: their supply declined, according to King &amp; Co. But they now make up 12 per cent of all stock, which suggests that the backlog of second-hand stock will continue to mount, with increasing amounts virtually unlettable. Prospects for the fourth quarter look bleaker. A reduction of two percentage points in interest rates between Black Wednesday and mid-October failed to restore confidence in the government's handling of the economy. Until this autumn northern regions had appeared relatively unscathed by the recession and there was hope that they might lead the national recovery. But the Northern Development Company and the Tyne and Wear and Teesside chambers of commerce dashed those hopes. Sales, orders, confidence and employment levels in Cumbria and the North East have all dropped sharply and the position is worsening. Only 16 per cent of companies are working close to capacity and nearly 90 per cent believe the outlook is even blacker. The depth of the UK market in industrial sheds is such, however, that deals are still being done. Mr Guy Frampton, senior agency surveyor at Hillier Parker, for example, reports signs of life in the M25 belt which has stagnated for two years. So far, evidence for new lease structures is only anecdotal. But it cannot be long before it is made official. No property luncheon table is without its tales of breaches of the traditional 25-year lease with upward-only rent reviews. As if there were not enough bad news about, another dismal trend is still gathering pace: the knock-on effects of shrinkage in information technology manufacturing. In itself, the 'downsizing' of IBM by 40,000 jobs with a further 32,000 jobs gone or going at Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment would be bad enough. But the property industry may not yet have taken on board the difficulty of finding replacement tenants for highly-customised buildings designed to meet the specifications of high-tech manufacturers. Overall, the key to servicing depressed industrial tenants with poor sales prospects as well as risk-averse investors seeking reliable income streams, may lie with good, secondary properties: true, multi-purpose, low-specification sheds on estates close to motorways.</p>

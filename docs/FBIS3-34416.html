			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] The Zionist regime has admitted that the bold attack  by Lebanon's Islamic Resistance mujahidin against Israeli  military patrols in the occupied area in south Lebanon killed  four Zionists and wounded two.    Although in such cases, the Zionist regime, which is  helpless  when it comes to such operations by the Muslim revolutionaries,  always resorts to blind attacks on residential areas and finds  many innocent Lebanese people rolling in blood, the continuation  of the anti-Zionist resistance is of extreme political  significance. Overtly colluding with the United States during  the past two years, the Zionist regime has tried to make it look  as if it seeks peace and attempted to hide its aggressive nature  by participating in the so-called peace conference and by  propagating false slogans. But the continuing operations by the  Islamic Resistance mojahidin thwart much of this effort by  Israel and clarify that the Zionist regime continues to occupy  part of Lebanon and some other Arab countries and that it also  extensively violates international regulations.    The operations by Lebanon's Muslim mujahidin against the  Zionist occupiers also clarify another reality: Contrary to what  the heads of some Arab states claim, Tel Aviv is vulnerable.  Justifying their participation in the compromising talks with  Israel in Washington, the Arab governments always speak of  upsetting the Middle East's military balance in Israel's favor.  But if this is true, then the operations by the Lebanese Muslim  mujahidin show that having faith in the struggle against this  usurping regime can alter the material and power balance to a  large extent.</p>

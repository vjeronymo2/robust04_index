The Academy of Arts and Sciences of Kosova has been  established since sixteenth years ago according to a decision of  the Kosova Assembly, during the time when Kosova was an  autonomous region.    "The academy is of Kosova and it will exist and act as the  highest institution of science, art and culture in Kosova" is  stressed in the many reactions done against the Serbian attacks  over the academy.    The Kosovar Academy of Helsinki, expressing his indignation  to the closing of the building of the academy and appealing and  asking help from the international institutions, stresses that  "the usurpation of the building of the academy is a signal that  shows that the Serbian authorities with premeditation want to  abet the inter-ethnic conflict in Kosova, which will have  unforeseen consequences not only for the Albanians of Kosova,  but even for all the Balkan region.</p>

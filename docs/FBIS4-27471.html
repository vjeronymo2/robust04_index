			<p>BFN     [Text] The country's gross national product [GNP] grew by  4.84 percent in the first quarter of the year. That's a big  leap compared to last year's 0.27 percent to the same period.  Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito calls it a  remarkable (?sailing). The growth rate was the highest recorded  in the past three years. Habito said it meant new jobs for  Filipinos and open business opportunities for local industries.  Habito said at least 200,000 jobs would have been available  starting last month. Habito also said prospects for the rest of  the year are even brighter despite fears of rising prices of  petroleum products and basic goods as a result of the  implementation of expanded value-added tax.</p>

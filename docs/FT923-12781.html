			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Hoteliers expect delay in upturn A GROWING number of hoteliers believe that the economic downturn has ended but most think their industry will not achieve full recovery for a year or longer. A survey by the Horwath leisure industry consultancy, published yesterday, found that 38.2 per cent of hotel general managers, who were questioned in the last week of June, thought the recovery had begun, compared with 23.2 per cent three months earlier. The proportion of managers who believed that the hotel industry downturn was still continuing dropped from 76.8 per cent in the first quarter to 61.8 per cent. The hoteliers have become more pessimistic, however, about the time it will take for full recovery to be achieved. The proportion of hoteliers who thought that it would take 12 months or more has risen from 81.9 per cent to 84.1 per cent. More than 80 per cent of them said they did not expect to increase their room tariffs this year.</p>

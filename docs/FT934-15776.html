			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace As Mr George Simpson, British Aerospace's deputy chief executive, ponders whether to stay with the company this weekend, BAe's turbulent last two years will give him plenty of food for thought. Since the ill-fated rights issue, departure of Professor Sir Roland Smith, and Pounds 1bn write-off against the regional jet business, BAe has made solid progress. A further large Tornado contract with Saudi Arabia has been secured, the Eurofighter reprieved, Ballast Nedam and the corporate jet business sold. Perhaps most importantly to Mr Simpson, Rover has done well in an appalling European car market. Recently, however, the news for the company has been less good. Eurofighter has encountered technical problems and the negotiations over forming a joint venture for the regional jet business with Taiwan Aerospace have been bogged down in detailed disputes. The time must be fast approaching when BAe should withdraw from discussions rather than endure further uncertainty. Yet the collapse of talks with Taiwan would not now be the disaster they would have been 18 months ago. BAe has released cash through its asset sales. More importantly, the company has renegotiated its banking arrangements to remove the minimum net worth constraint which had effectively prevented it from writing off other businesses. It can now rationalise its turbo-prop aircraft or missiles operations without undue worry. The balance sheet would be left a little weaker, but well within interest cover banking limits. The main risk to BAe from Taiwan is not financial, but that further procrastination will look like management dither.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Mitsubishi Electric has developed short-wavelength,  high-output oscillation technology using a solid-state YAG  laser. It was difficult to obtain the high-output  short-wavelength laser light because the wavelength conversion  element, which transforms the YAG laser light (infrared light)  into short-wavelength light, tends to cause crystal destruction.  The company avoided crystal destruction by bringing about a  ``gentle frequency conversion.'' It achieved this by lengthening  the frequency conversion element and increasing the optical beam  size of the YAG laser by an order of millimeters 10 times that  of conventional types. Using this technology, Mitsubishi  achieved the oscillation of 24 watt green laser light.  Furthermore, it is said that not only green laser light but also  blue laser light and other high output oscillations are possible.    The solid state laser which oscillates short-wavelength  laser  light consists of an excitation light source, a YAG laser (a  yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser doped with niobium), a nonlinear  optical material which is the wavelength conversion element, and  other components. The excited YAG laser emits 1064 nanometer  infrared light which, after passing through the wavelength  conversion element, oscillates green, blue and other  short-wavelength light. However, the wavelength conversion  element crystal was too brittle to withstand the strong infrared  light.    The company enlarged the spot size of the infrared light  entering the wavelength conversion element by an order of  millimeters for the purpose of dispersing the energy and, at the  same time, it lengthened the wavelength conversion element.  Several crystals were connected together because the maximum  size for the wavelength conversion element crystal is 10  millimeters. The optimal phase matching of their adjoining parts  has been designed in order to minimize conversion loss.  Accordingly, even when high output infrared radiation enters,  the destruction of the wavelength conversion element crystal  does not occur.    Employing this technology, and using a KTP (potassium  titanate phosphate) wavelength conversion element which halves  the wavelength, a 24 watt (electric power input 4.9 kilowatts)  green laser light (532 nanometer wavelength) generation was  attained. This is double the output achieved up until the  present time and it is said that it is possible to have an  output of more than 100 watts. Moreover, this technology can be  applied to other wave conversion elements, such as  KNb&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt;  (potassium niobium&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; ) which converts  the wavelength to one third -- a blue wavelength.</p>

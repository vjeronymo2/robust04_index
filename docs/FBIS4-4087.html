			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA)--A "family guidance  program" jointly sponsored by Beijing Municipal Education  Bureau, Beijing Federation of Women and Beijing Family Education  Society is to be carried out in Beijing.    An official in charge of the program said that the aim is to  enhance family education and improve the quality of the  education.    The program will reach its climax on May 15 to mark the  "International Family Day" which has been set by the United  Nations.    Beijing has about 2.35 million children aged under 14 years.    Experts said that it is an important task to undertake  family  education among them.    The program will help parents to learn the physiological and  psychological characteristics of children under the age of 14,  and to master scientific education methods to answer children's  questions in their growing-up process.    The program will also promote the idea of families improving  their structure and becoming a favorable environment for the  sake of children's healthy growth.    The program will run training schools for parents in  communities, get special articles and programs put out in the  media, publish books and open consultancy services to improve  family education.    Beijing has now set up thousands of "schools for parents,"  and also has two special newspapers on family education.    In 1980, Beijing Family Education Society was set up and in  1984, the city set up a Family Education Consultancy Center  which has received 15,500 visits and 4,000 phone calls from  parents.</p>

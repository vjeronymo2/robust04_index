			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merchant bankers flock to Rome - Plans to privatise Italy's state sector are starting to take shape THE world's investment bankers are flooding to Rome as plans to privatise many of the companies within Italy's overblown state sector take shape. Their enthusiasm is understandable. The government hopes to raise L27,000bn (Dollars 18.5bn) in the next three years through asset sales, while IRI, the state holding company, is budgeting on a further L24,000bn as a means of reducing borrowings running close to L70,000bn. All this is music to the ears of the world's merchant bankers: and the Italian treasury headed by Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, is their first port of call. Since the new Amato government took office in June, the treasury has become the crucial force in the privatisation process. Political placemen in state-owned companies have been largely replaced by senior treasury officials, while the six-man committee of senior bankers and economists looking into privatisation reports directly to Mr Barucci. Although privatisation is still in its infancy, the competition among bankers has already revealed some winners and losers. Most prominent among the latter are the Italian houses. Italy's merchant banks often present themselves as equal to big London and New York rivals when it comes to domestic business. So far they look to have been left out in the cold. Mediobanca, Italy's leading merchant bank, and Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the public-sector financial services group, have been given a broad mandate to advise the treasury. But IMI, which has been asked by the ENI state holding company to advise on selling its Nuovo Pignone engineering subsidiary, is the only domestic bank so far to have been given a sizeable specific mandate. The absence of Italian houses reflects their inexperience in privatisation business. No Italian bank yet has the expertise to handle a major valuation based on comparative experience abroad. Competitive and political considerations also contribute. Italian banks needing corporate finance advisers have traditionally looked abroad to avoid revealing confidential information to domestic rivals. In other cases, the choice of a prestigious international bank has stemmed from political concerns to underline the job is being done fairly and without party political pressure. British merchant banks have emerged well so far. SG Warburg has won plaudits for valuing IMI, in which the government is trying to sell its 50 per cent stake. Barings is valuing the big INA insurance group, while Kleinwort Benson last year valued the treasury's share in the Crediop long-term lending bank. Some US houses have also prospered. IRI chose Merrill Lynch to recommend strategies, and find buyers, for its 67 per cent stake in Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth-biggest bank. Lehman Brothers is starting to see the rewards for months of painstaking work for Finmeccanica and Stet, IRI's engineering and telecommunications subsidiaries. Though not yet privatisation candidates, both are poised for substantial restructuring prior to a reduction in the state's shareholding. Goldman Sachs, Swiss Bank Corporation, Paribas and Lazards are still locked in the seemingly interminable task of advising ENI on the flotation of its Agip and Snam subsidiaries. The timing - the deal was initially to have been completed by the end of last year - has suffered from changes in government policy between floating the subsidiaries or ENI itself. But the clear winner so far has been Wasserstein Perella, the US investment bank formed by former First Boston employees. In spite of its relatively small size and youth compared with its rivals, it has already won a disproportionally large slice of business. Wasserstein Perella's biggest prize has been in advising IRI on restructuring its SME food, retailing and catering subsidiary. After blueprinting the break-up, it has now been charged with finding buyers for the various operations on the block. Earlier, it advised SME on disposing of some smaller joint ventures. And it has established a strong rapport with Finmeccanica, whose Esaote Biomedica subsidiary it is now trying to sell. Wasserstein Perella's success has created ill-feelings among its rivals, particularly banks which have both commercial and investment banking relationships with the state holding companies. 'We are one of the biggest foreign lenders to IRI, which borrows at highly competitive rates,' says one leading European bank representative. 'But so far we haven't had any advisory business, in spite of submitting various interesting and competitive proposals.' Wasserstein Perella's mandates have triggered allegations, so far only in private, that it has benefited from privileged contacts with the Amato government. In April 1991, Wasserstein appointed Mr Franco Reviglio, a prominent university professor and former ENI chairman, as an Italy-based 'senior international adviser'. When the new government took office, Mr Reviglio became budget minister, putting him in one of the three key ministries concerned with privatisation. Wasserstein Perella asserts Mr Reviglio terminated his contract on election as a Socialist party senator in the April 1992 polls. 'That was months before he even knew would be made a minister,' says a banker. Since then, professional contacts with the bank are said to have wholly stopped, but some competitors view the bank's recent successes with disquiet. It takes more, however, than a senior Italian figurehead to win mandates. The presence of Mr Romano Prodi, a former IRI chairman, as adviser to Goldman Sachs, a top Wall Street name, has not won it any IRI privatisation business so far. Indeed, some bankers suggest having a heavyweight Italian official on the letterhead can be a positive disadvantage. Though potentially useful as an intermediary thanks to privileged friendships or party political contacts, 'their backgrounds can often close as many doors as they open', says one banker. 'You must remember the Italian system is based on consensus. It only takes one veto to block a mandate,' says a senior official at one state holding company. 'In Italy, it's probably more important to have few enemies than lots of friends.' But personal factors do count up to a point. Wasserstein Perella's success is partly based on the relationships established when Wasserstein officials were still working for First Boston. The latter advised Finmeccanica on crucial deals such as the sale of Alfa Romeo and the acquisition of Bailey Controls in the US. They also worked for SME on other transactions. 'That created a firm bond for winning future mandates', notes one IRI executive. The risk for a relatively small house like Wasserstein Perella is to ensure customer relationships rest on more than one individual to avoid disruption should key staff jump ship.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Trade gap cut in Australia A better export performance caused Australia's trade deficit to narrow last month, bringing relief to the Keating government and lessening chances of another interest rate rise before Christmas. Latest figures showed a current account deficit for October of ADollars 1.65bn (Pounds 750m), seasonally adjusted, higher than the ADollars 1.27bn in October 1993, but below the deficits of ADollars 1.8bn and ADollars 2.1bn in September and August this year. Exports rose 5 per cent seasonally adjusted in October, with commodities such as gold, wool and coal contributing strongly. Imports, on the same basis, were 2 per cent higher. Economists had been predicting an October deficit of ADollars 1.8bn-ADollars 1.9bn. As the prospect of a further early interest rate rise ebbed, the Australian dollar drifted lower. A sharp decline in building approvals last month suggested the recent housing boom has peaked. Figures for business investment were more complicated; new capital expenditure for the quarter declined overall, but spending on plant and equipment was 3.4 per cent higher (27.6 per cent above that seen a year ago). Mr Ralph Willis, treasurer, claimed there was 'a continuing strong recovery in business investment'. Attention will now shift to the September quarter's GDP figures, to be released today and expected to show growth running at 5.5 per cent annualised. Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank, said the government should consider raising taxes to cut its budget deficit and warned that lack of wage restraint would mean higher interest rates.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By He Xiaoying (0149 1321 3841): "We Must Strive Hard To </F> Correctly Handle Contradictions Among the People"]    [Text] The theory of correctly handling contradictions  among the people put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong in the 1950's  has, in the following decades, undergone testing in the practice  of social and political life. It has increasingly demonstrated  the radiance of its truth and has made clear that it is a great  theory for consolidating and developing socialism.  <H5>  An Epoch-Making Contribution to the History of the </H5> Development of Socialism    Lenin once said: "Our judgment of historical achievements is  based not on whether the history-makers have provided us with  the things which we need now, but on whether they have provided  something new which previous generations had not provided." The  epoch-making historical achievement of the work "On the Correct  Handling of Contradictions Among the People" lies precisely in  the fact that it contributed a new scientific conclusion and  solved an enormous and pressing problem in the practice of  socialism.    This theory adhered to thoroughgoing Marxist dialectics and  propelled Marxist doctrine on social contradictions to a new  stage. It completely refuted the point of view that regarded  contradictions within socialism as heresy, promulgating the need  to scientifically recognize contradictions in socialist society  and illuminating the role of correctly handling these  contradictions as a motive force driving the advance of  socialism. Thus it has opened the new line of thought that the  correct handling of social contradictions will promote social  progress. Moreover, it has promulgated and expounded on the two  kinds of contradictions, different in nature, which exist  objectively in socialist society, and this has charted the  course to the concrete recognition and handling of all  contradictions under conditions of socialism.    If we say that, due to Stalin's error of denying  contradictions in theory and mixing up contradictions in  practice, the great pursuit of socialism initiated by Lenin  gradually sapped the vigor of socialist development and  subsequently led the development of socialism to a certain  crisis, then we can say that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory has  injected vigor into socialism and given a great impetus to its  development.  <H5>  The Overall Theme of Domestic Political Life in the Primary </H5> Stage of Socialism    In 1957 Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our objective, what we  wish to build, is a type of political setup which is both  centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, which has  both unity of purpose and individual ease of mind, and is lively  and vigorous. This will be beneficial to socialist revolution  and socialist construction, help us overcome difficulties, speed  up the construction of our country with a modernized industry  and agriculture, promote the consolidation of the party and the  nation, and help us to withstand trials and tribulations. The  overall theme of this is the correct handling of contradictions  among the people and contradictions between the enemy and  ourselves. We will go about this by seeking truth from facts  and following the mass line. "Practice in the years following  1957 showed how correct and far- sighted he was to grasp this  overall theme. It is no simple feat to grasp clearly and  without wavering this overall theme from beginning to end, and  once having grasped it, to do a good job of it. The crucial  point lies in having a profound and intrinsic understanding of  China's national conditions. The second-generation leadership  body which emerged after the Third Plenary Session of the  Eleventh CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as  the core, summed up historical experience and lessons, studied  the new situation and the new problems under the new historical  conditions, and soberly recognized that our country is at  present, and will be for a comparatively long historical period  to come, in the primary stage of socialism. This has made us  all the more keenly realize the scientific nature of this  overall theme of correctly handling the contradictions among the  people, and raised our consciousness of the need to grasp it  tightly, and consequently, our scientific understanding of the  special nature of the social contradictions in the primary stage  of socialism.    First: The large-scale and leading nature of  contradictions among the people.    Of all the contradictions in the primary stage of socialism,  "class struggle is no longer the principal contradiction." None  of the various social contradictions existing on a large scale  in our country belongs within the scope of class struggle. Of  course, class struggle, within certain parameters, will survive  for a long time, and under certain conditions may even  intensify. This situation of contradictions demands that we not  only avoid glossing over still-existing class struggles of an  antagonistic nature, but that we fully recognize the dominant  position of widespread social contradictions among the people.    Second: Contradictions among the people are diverse  and complicated.    In the primary stage of socialism, due to both historical  and  modern factors, uneven development among districts, industries,  departments, nationalities and groups lead to differences in  benefits. These differences in benefits lead to contradictions.  In the conditions of reform and opening, and especially after  undergoing new adjustments -- and even frictions and collisions  -- in the course of the changeover from the old to the new  structure, these contradictions take on an very complex  character. For instance, the scissors gap between industry and  agriculture, the widening gap in the development level between  the coastal and inland regions, the growing gap between managers  and workers in many economic sectors, and the unfair social  distribution -- all these have exacerbated the difficulties in  distinguishing the contradictions and made it more urgent to  find a new way to handle them.    Third: The contradictions in people's thinking and  understanding are long-term and frequent.    Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a  creative  social systems engineering project. In the course of  exploration and opening up in the face of divided opinions on  the advantages and disadvantages which crop up, divergence in  people's understanding is inevitable. This is not only because  there are different interest bases, but also because there are  different levels of understanding of the theory of knowledge.  This divergence in understanding needs to be cleared up by  means of discussion, comparing notes, and exchanges, but more  importantly, it should be gradually solved in the deepening of  the reform.    Fourth: The contradictions in the party-masses  relationship and the cadres-masses relationship have become an  increasingly important aspect of the contradictions among the  people.    Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Our people's government is a  government which genuinely represents the people's interests.  It is a government which serves the people. However, there are  also certain contradictions between it and the masses of the  people. These contradictions include those between the state's  interest, the collective interest, and the individual interest,  those between democracy and centralism, those between the  leaders and the led, and those between the bureaucratic style of  work of some government functionaries and the masses." The key  to solving these contradictions is to rectify the party's style  of work, strengthen the building of clean government, and  "persist in our efforts to restore the traditional style of work  of our party characterized by hard work, plain living, and close  relations with the masses." The problem of work style of a  party in power is a life-or-death concern of that party. Only  if our party can correctly solve this contradiction and further  consolidate and strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties between the  party and the masses will it be possible to attain the type of  political situation described by Comrade Mao Zedong and only  then will our party be able to stand up to any storms and  stresses.    Fifth: The multisphere, multilevel nature of  contradictions among the people demands a versatile method of  handling them.    As contradictions among the people in a socialist system can  be alleviated and solved through self-regulation and  self-improvement, it is imperative for us to give full play to  the superiority of the socialist system in handling  contradictions. In resolving the dynamics of contradictions we  must find the most appropriate plan, effective for a given  period of time. It is unrealistic to be blindly self-satisfied,  metaphisically refusing to recognize contradictions or  mechanically applying one pattern to approach many  contradictions. There is, and can be, no universal panacea --  we must exercise the party's and the government's subjective  dynamism, starting from reality in everything.  <H5>  Raising the Ability To Correctly Handle Contradictions Among </H5> the People Is an Important Duty of a Party in Power    A great work is only such if it cleaves to its main theme  without wandering off the track and solves well the transition  from paragraph to paragraph. This great piece of writing on the  correct handling of contradictions among the people not only has  to adhere closely to its main theme, but has to be seriously  organized and coordinated. Since the Third Plenary Session of  the Eleventh CPC Central Committee, not only has our party  gained a profound understanding of the main theme of  contradictions among the people, but in the course of practical  explorations has accumulated rich experience in the handling of  contradictions among the people.    --The objective of getting a firm grasp on the correct  handling of contradictions among the people is to unite all the  positive elements, transform all the negative elements and serve  the construction of a powerful, democratic, and civilized modern  socialist country. Therefore, when we handle various types  of contradictions among the people, we must start from this  overall interest and work to promote the realization of our  nation's stability and unity, the development of its productive  forces, and the overall progress of society. We must coordinate  in an organic way the country's long-term development with the  actual demands of the masses of the people, and the interests of  the country as a whole, with the interests of the regions,  departments, and individuals. However, we must recognize that  while the multitude of contradictions among the people are all  rationally clamoring to be solved, they can only be solved step  by step. Some contradictions cannot be solved all at once,  while others can only be eased to a certain extent. In all  this, people must take the overall situation into account.    --Gather tightly around "one center" to handle the  various contradictions among the people. The large number  of contradictions among the people in the primary stage of  socialism, whether they are differences of interest or  divergence of understanding, in the final analysis must be  solved through development and reform. Many problems can be  comparatively well solved as the economy develops, the wealth  for social distribution increases, the reform advances,  mechanisms are enlivened, and social vigor increases. For this  reason, in handling any contradiction we must obey and serve  "one center" and gradually solve them in conjunction.    --Synthesizing a variety of methods and applying  them in a coordinated way is the basic channel for handling  contradictions among the people. Contradictions among the  people touch upon the fields of economics, politics, ideology,  and culture. As such, they all have their individual  peculiarities, but they also have mutual relationships.  Therefore, in handling contradictions among the people, not  only must we provide concrete solutions to concrete questions,  but we must refrain from judging by appearances. We must combine  democratic discussion, persuasion and education, legal  regulations, moral restraints, and administrative and economic  methods, and apply them in a synthesized and coordinated way.  Contradictions of different natures call for different handling  methods, i.e., the method of "unity-criticism-unity" should be  applied in the case of political and ideological problems; in  the case of relations between the Communist Party and the  democratic parties, the method of "long-term coexistence and  mutual supervision"; and in the case of science and culture, the  method of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools  of thought contend." In the case of economic benefits, it is  necessary to make overall plans and take all factors into  consideration. In the new circumstances, contradictions have  taken on a complicated and many- sided character, facing us with  the necessity of finding even more new methods to solve them.  In the past few years, in the course of handling the  contradictions and clashes that have emerged between the  interests of the masses and the interests of the regions, we  have gained some good experience, i.e., we should tell the  people to recognize that, for a certain period of time,  differences in benefits are unavoidable, and to encourage some  regions and some people to push ahead with development through  hard work and scientific management. At the same time, while  advancing toward common prosperity, we must coordinate benefits  in a multilateral way and make sure that differences will not be  so great as to threaten social stability.    -- Carefully distinguish between two different types of  contradictions, and resolutely use dictatorial methods to handle  the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. In the  primary stage of socialism, class struggle still exists to a  certain extent. The contradictions between the enemy and  ourselves and the contradictions among the people are so  intertwined that they are sometimes not immediately  distinguishable. This calls for the utmost prudence. But in  cases in which there is conclusive evidence that a contradiction  is one between the enemy and ourselves we must tackle it  head-on, for it is only by resolutely battling the enemy that we  can safeguard the people.    --Conscientiously handle contradictions within the  party. Contradictions within the party fall into the  category of contradictions among the people. The correct  handling of contradictions within the party is very important  for a ruling party in its efforts to build unity, cohesion,  integrity, self-discipline, and conscientious administration on  behalf of the people. The correct handling of contradictions  within the party contributes to solving contradictions among the  people. At the same time, if contradictions within the party  are not handled correctly, their negative elements will have an  adverse effect on solutions to contradictions among the people.  When leading groups at all levels of the party shoulder the  important task of handling contradictions among the people,  their very persons become a unity of contradictions, and the  correct handling of contradictions among members of the leading  groups of the party and the proper building of unity and  cohesion is an important task which must not be neglected.    We are now in the course of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The correct handling of contradictions among  the people is a great undertaking which must be tackled  throughout the primary stage of socialism. There is an endless  series of new conditions and problems. The whole party must  make more efforts to correctly handle contradictions among the  people in order to promote the cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.</p>

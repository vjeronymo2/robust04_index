			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HIGH COURT REJECTS PLEA BY SAN ONOFRE STAFF ON DRUG TESTS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by workers at a Southern California  nuclear power plant who are challenging their employer's random drug tests.  </P> <P> The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that threw out, at least  temporarily, a lawsuit attacking the tests. The justices already are studying  the validity of drug tests in three other cases.  </P> <P> The case stems from tests initiated by Southern California Edison Co. at its  San Onofre nuclear plant. The tests, modified in December, 1986, require  randomly selected workers to produce urine samples for laboratory analysis. The  workers are told the day before they are tested.  </P> <P> The plan was challenged by Local 246 of the Utility Workers Union of America.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOREATOWN BLAST SUSPECT TELLS HOW HE WAS INJURED  </P> <P> The man blamed in a Koreatown fireworks explosion that injured 10 policemen  last week says he was poking at a skyrocket with a knife, "curious to see what  they make it with," when he caused an earlier blast that tore off much of his  right hand.  </P> <P> "I'm into fireworks," Gary Weksler said Friday at a Westside motel where he has  been staying since his release from Los Angeles County Jail. Weksler was  released on his own recognizance Thursday pending a court appearance on charges  of possession of a dangerous device.  </P> <P> Weksler, 38, conceded that he had been storing illegal fireworks at his  Koreatown apartment. "It wasn't an overabundance," he said, just "a little more  than an average person would have . . . enough to put on a small show."  </P> <P> He said he collected the fireworks because he enjoyed putting on private  pyrotechnics displays for his friends, usually at local beaches. "It's a hobby  of mine," he said. "I've been doing it for 20 years."  </P> <P> Weksler refused to say where he was before dawn June 27 when an M-80 skyrocket  exploded in his hand, ripping off two fingers, mangling two others and pocking  his face and chest with burns from flaming explosive.  </P> <P> Later that day, officers went to his apartment after hospital personnel who  were suspicious of his injuries contacted authorities.  </P> <P> According to police, bomb squad experts had discovered a "major fireworks  cache" in his home before a blast tore through the apartment, causing minor to  moderate injuries to 10 officers in and around the building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Objects to Reports  </P> <P> Weksler objected to newspaper accounts that mentioned his personality problems  and psychiatric counseling as a youth. "I am not some crazy bomber that makes  bombs," he said, stressing that his fireworks, which are illegal in Los  Angeles, were the sort that are commercially available in other areas.  </P> <P> Weksler said that despite his injuries and the injuries suffered by the police  officers, he would like to continue to "fool around with fireworks."  </P></p>

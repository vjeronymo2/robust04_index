			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Palestinians to resume peace talks ARAB negotiators agreed yesterday to resume Middle East peace talks in Washington next Tuesday after an interruption of more than four months caused by Israel's deportation of over 400 Palestinians. The decision was announced in Damascus following a final meeting of representatives from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and the Palestinians. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, arrived in Damascus after a bruising session with colleagues in Amman during which he only narrowly secured approval for the resumption of talks with Israel. Two members of the Palestinian negotiating team immediately announced their resignations and the leader, Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, said he had been surprised by the Damascus decision. 'Our recommendation to the PLO leadership was that we should not go until Israel has responded to our requests.' During violent protests in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday, Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian youth and wounded dozens more. Israeli helicopter gunships later attacked two villages in south Lebanon after guerrillas fired Katyusha rockets at the border town of Metulla and the western Galilee area. The Arab decision to resume negotiations was welcomed by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. Mr Christopher said the decision would be welcomed by the entire world community and he again pledged that the US intended to become a 'full partner' in the peace process. Next week's talks, the ninth round since the inaugural session in October 1991, could decide the fate of the peace process. They will be open-ended and the pressure that had to be applied to win Palestinian participation underlines the bitterness within the occupied territories at the failure of their negotiators to make any substantive progress towards self-determination. In a statement issued after their meeting in Damascus, Arab foreign ministers laid the blame for the impasse on the 'continued obstacles' created by Israel. They condemned 'Israeli aggression against Lebanese territory', the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, the mass deportations of Palestinians, 'the blowing up of houses and killing of civilians', and urged a lifting of the order which for more than three weeks has sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The foreign ministers said the decision to return to Washington was based on the assumption the US would implement all the assurances and undertakings it had given during recent discussions. Mr Christopher praised Egypt and Saudi Arabia for persuading the Palestinians to resume talks, but made no mention of assurances given to the Arab delegations. He said a statement was expected from Israel.</p>

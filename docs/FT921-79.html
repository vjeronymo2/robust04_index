			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lost Lilley - Ballot Box Likeable and clever though he is, Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, is not the sort of man you would let loose on an election campaign. So far he has not been much seen. Yesterday he appeared at an Edinburgh press conference to demonstrate why. He appeared to backtrack on assurances made early in the campaign by Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, on the relocation of civil servants dealing with oil exploration to Aberdeen. The issue is a vote-winner in Scotland, backed by all the other main parties, and one of the few popular Tory proposals. Evidently no-one had told Lilley that it is included in the Conservatives' manifesto for Scotland.</p>

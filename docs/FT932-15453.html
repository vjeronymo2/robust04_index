			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: Pilatus to buy Piper Aircraft assets PIPER Aircraft Corporation, one of the few remaining manufacturers of small aircraft in the US, has agreed to sell most of its assets to Switzerland's Pilatus Aircraft. Pilatus, which makes single-engine, turbo-prop training aircraft as well as utility and commuter aircraft, would pay Dollars 20m in cash, provide a Dollars 10m note, and assume Dollars 6m of obligations. However, the tentative deal with Pilatus, a subsidiary of the Zurich based Oerlikon-Buhrle weapons and engineering group, could open the door to competing offers. Piper - with headquarters in Vero Beach, Florida - has been operating under bankruptcy court protection since July 1991, and US bankruptcy procedure usually allows any asset sale proposal to be successfully topped by a 'higher and better offer'. Yesterday, lawyers for Piper said there had been no formal position taken on the Pilatus offer by Piper's unsecured creditors, but they had generally encouraged management to get a sale process under way. 'We owe it to our creditors, employees, distributors and suppliers to resolve the bankruptcy at the earliest possible date with the greatest pay-out to the creditors,' said Mr Charles Suma, the chief operating officer at Piper. Like other small aircraft manufacturers, Piper has been bedevilled for years by product liability suits - which have led to heavy legal costs and onerous insurance premiums. Critically, the agreement with Pilatus envisages that the Swiss company would acquire the Piper assets 'free and clear' of these claims. Part of the Pilatus consideration would then be set aside in a trust to deal with such product liability actions, where successful. The latest events at Piper follow an active decade for the company. Founded in 1929, Piper was a family-run business for many years. However, by the 1980s ownership had passed to Lear Siegler, the US private company. In 1987, Mr Stuart Millar, a US businessman who had been a Second World War fighter pilot, bought the company. In early-1991, there were attempts to sell the business - by then cash-strapped - to Aerospatiale but the French aerospace group withdrew, largely because of the product liability problems. In 1991, when Piper went into bankruptcy, it had effectively ceased operations. Today, however, it employs about 350 people, and last year delivered 85 piston-engined aircraft. Sales over the past 12 months were about Dollars 47m.</p>

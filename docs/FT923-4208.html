			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: Daishowa Paper share deal to raise Y9.9bn DAISHOWA Paper, Japan's second largest paper manufacturer which is facing mounting debts due to over-expansion in the late 1980s, said yesterday it would raise Y9.9bn (Dollars 78.7m) through a share allotment. This follows the company's recent decision to pass its interim dividend and sell overseas assets. Daishowa will allot 5.26m in new shares to Mr Ryoei Saito, honorary chairman and controversial art collector. He will pay Y1,900 a share on September 28. The allotment will raise his equity stake to 3.81 per cent from 1.45 per cent. The share allotment will increase Daishowa's outstanding shares to 219.4m, raising its capital to Y31.6bn. Daishowa said it would use Y8.1m to repay debts, and the remaining Y1.8m as operating funds.</p>

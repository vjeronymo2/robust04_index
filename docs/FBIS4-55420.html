			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>   [Text] All day long, the chetniks in Grabez, the Grmusa  plateau, and in the Buzin section have been launching  provocations and infantry attacks and firing from anti-aircraft  weapons. This morning and evening they shelled the outlying  districts of Cazin. Members of the traitor Kladusa paramilitary  [Fikret Abdic's forces] have been attacking the outer rim of  Cazin and Todorovo. Their artillery continued to pound civilian  targets in the wake of their failed attempts at infantry forays  along a large stretch of the demarcation line. There is again a  large number of civilian casualties following these murderous  attacks. There is also a great deal of material damage.</p>

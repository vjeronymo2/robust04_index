			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Cost of Rhetoric"] </F>   [Text] Following the killing of 68 people by a mortar bomb  -- presumably Serbian -- in Sarajevo on Saturday [5 February],  it now seems almost certain that NATO forces will be committed  to some form of direct military action in Bosnia. Western  governments, however reluctant to act, now believe they have no  choice. Before a decision is announced, it is well to consider  what is at stake. We have always argued against full-blooded  intervention in the former Yugoslavia: first, because it seemed  impossible to define attainable military and political  objectives; and second, because the principal burden and cost  would fall upon Britain and France, in the absence of the will  or the means for effective participation by other major powers.  We have also urged that political leaders should not damage the  credibility of either NATO or the United Nations by indulging in  empty threats against the Serbs which they have no intention of  making good.    Yet, in the event, most Western leaders, including President  Clinton and, some months ago, Mr John Major and Mr Douglas Hurd,  have succumbed to the temptation to appease public sentiment  with strong rhetoric. The Serbs have repeatedly called their  bluff, by ignoring vague threats of international action and  continuing their brutal assault on Muslim enclaves. Serb  defiance of Western pressure has indeed been damaging. If, at  some time in the future, other foreign powers, including Russia,  feel minded to take aggressive action abroad, why should they  heed Western warnings to halt or face the consequences? Western  policy towards Yugoslavia has represented the very negation of  deterrence. There will often be a good case for  non-intervention, as we believe that there has been in Bosnia.  But there is never a case for threatening intervention, then  failing to make good that threat.    And so to the vexed immediate issue, of possible NATO air  strikes against the Serbs following the hideous events in  Sarajevo on Saturday. Those most eager for such action are,  essentially, seeking to use Western firepower to punish the  Serbs for their actions, rather than in pursuit of a coherent  long-term strategy. We would argue that it is undesirable to use  NATO forces merely for punitive purposes. Yet the cost to  Western credibility could become disastrous if every United  Nations resolution and NATO threat were to be set at naught. At  the recent NATO summit, the organisation's political leaders  committed themselves to offer the UN whatever degree of military  support was necessary to maintain the UN's humanitarian mission  and to safeguard the designated UN enclaves in Sarajevo and  elsewhere.    Thus far, nothing whatever has been done to make good those  promises. Now, it must be. As we argued last week, if the UN's  humanitarian missions in Bosnia are to continue at all, the  necessary degree of force must be used to make them viable.  There is a real risk that forcing open roads and driving back  Serb artillery by use of ground forces and air strikes will  escalate the struggle, and embroil UN forces -- including those  of Britain -- more deeply than ever, and at painful cost in  casualties. But the alternative, of allowing the world to see  that the promises of the West's combined political leaderships  are worthless, is even less acceptable.    The West's commitment in the former Yugoslavia should remain  strictly limited. But such as it is, it should mean what it has  said. If the presidents and prime ministers of NATO's member  nations find the Bosnian entanglement intractable and  embarrassing, it may at least teach them how unforgivable it is  to indulge in rhetoric in international affairs to placate  domestic opinion, without the will to act upon it.    As a result of such rhetoric, compounded by the awesome  power  of television to influence public sentiment towards simplistic  views of intractable problems, it has now become necessary to  embark upon a dangerous and possibly foolish course, as the only  means of maintaining the credibility of the international  community.</p>

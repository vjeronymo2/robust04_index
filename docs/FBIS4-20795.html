			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Difficult Exercise"] </F>   [Text] The railway budget estimates for 1994-95 had to be  formulated by the Union Railway Minister, Mr. C.K. Jaffer  Sharief, against the backdrop of a shortfall in receipts from  freight and passenger traffic and the consequent reduction in  internally generated resources. The need to revise downward the  target for originating freight traffic and the deceleration in  growth in passenger traffic are due to the slow rise in  industrial production and resistance from passengers to rising  fares. From the first time in recent years the budget estimates  of gross traffic receipts have not been realised and it has been  necessary to reduce the Plan outlay in 1993-94 by Rs. 300  [rupees] crores even with the success in raising larger  resources through tax-free bonds.    Since the law of diminishing returns would seem to be  operating with successive increases in freight rates and  passenger fares and the gross domestic product has not been  rising as expected, Mr. Jaffer Sharief had to take note of the  warning signals and adopt a cautious approach when finalising  proposals for upward adjustments in freight rates and passenger  fares. Even otherwise it was generally expected that there would  have to be increases under these heads as diesel oil has become  costlier and other inputs have become dearer for various  reasons. In spite of the escalation in cost, it is claimed that  economies in working expenses to the extent of Rs.200 crores  have been achieved and with reduction in appropriation to  depreciation fund and other adjustments, the revised estimates  disclose a surplus of 973 crores against Rs. 2,195 crores  (budget).    The target for originating freight traffic however has been  raised for 1994-95 though the growth in passenger traffic has  been estimated at only two per cent. [Passage illegible] the  increase in freight traffic can materialise only it there is no  repetition of the experience of 1993-94. Much depends of course  on the developments in the economy in 1994-95. On the basis of  the estimates, it is expected that there will be a shortfall in  resources of Rs. 997 crores for financing even a modest Plan  outlay of Rs. 6,515 crores. This is only marginally higher than  the budget estimates for 1993-94. A larger portion will be found  through borrowing and a higher level of budgetary support  because of inadequate generation of internal resources. The Plan  outlay should be much higher than it is now though paucity of  resources is a limiting factor. It is also intended to  streamline operations with a restructuring of zonal systems and  a better use of the capacity of Railway enterprises.    Even though a valiant attempt has been made to limit  escalation in costs and use available resources optimally, it  has been necessary again to raise freight rates and passenger  fares. A new procedure has been adopted for pushing up freight  rates with changes in classification. It would appear that the  incidence of upward adjustments will be more severe in respect  of commodities whose handling has not been remunerative enough  for the Railways. The increase in the cost of moving bulk  commodities over longer distances may thus be more pronounced  than in the case of high rated traffic. While passenger fares  have been raised by six per cent, an effort has been made to  reduce cosmetically fares for short distances. In the event, the  hike in freight rates will fetch additionally Rs. 800 crores and  passenger fares Rs. 197 crores. The total amount sought to be  raised was as much as Rs. 1,848 crores last year. Railway users  may thus feel that they have been let off relatively lightly  though the cumulative effect of the changes in recent years is  proving to be regressive. In the changing situation a  strengthening of the Railway finances can be ensured only with a  growth in all types of traffic.</p>

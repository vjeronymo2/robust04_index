			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Early intelligence files implicated Robert Maxwell THE UK GOVERNMENT had intelligence information years before the collapse of Mr Robert Maxwell's empire that suggested the late publisher was acting dishonestly. Mr Maxwell was not seen as a risk to national security and was therefore not an 'intelligence target' as such. But it is understood that information pointing to his questionable activities existed within the files of the security services from Mr Maxwell's early days as a businessman. The Financial Times has also learnt that a full intelligence report was prepared for the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) at the time of Mr Maxwell's death off Gran Canaria on November 5 last year. The JIC, which is part of the Cabinet Office, co-ordinates and assesses information from Britain's intelligence services, including MI5 and MI6. Separately, a former JIC official has claimed that some data on Mr Maxwell's more recent activities, gathered by the intelligence services from intercepted telephone conversations and faxes, were passed to the Bank of England in 1989. The Bank is understood to have carried out an intensive search last week and can find no such information on its files. Its officials have no recollection of receiving such information. Mr Robin Robison, who worked as an administrative officer for the JIC, claims that other major British and foreign companies, largely but not exclusively in the defence field, routinely have had their telephone and telex communications intercepted. The companies under surveillance, he says, included GEC Marconi, Lonrho, Rolls-Royce, and their foreign competitors, and General Motors of the US. Mr Robison, whose job involved sorting signals intelligence from the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, the centre which intercepts international communications, claims in a statement that, while working for the JIC, he sorted raw intelligence on Mr Maxwell. 'The sigint (signals intelligence) I saw in the autumn of 1989 included intelligence data on Robert Maxwell taken from telephone conversations and faxes intercepted in Israel and the Mediterranean, probably from his yacht the Lady Ghislaine.' The information, according to Mr Robison, centred on Mr Maxwell's businesses and his overseas trips although he cannot recall what the reports said in detail. He says the information was evaluated and distributed to top Whitehall officials including the prime minister's office and cabinet ministers. Mr Robison, who resigned from the JIC at the end of 1989, says he sent some GCHQ data on Mr Maxwell to an economic subsection of the committee which included a seconded Bank of England official and others. Classified intelligence material about Mr Maxwell protected by code words was also sent regularly in a van to another official at the Bank's City headquarters in Threadneedle Street, he says. The middle ranking official named in Mr Robison's statement is understood to act as a post-box within the bank for sensitive information. The official receives confidential documents and passes them to Bank departments which may have an interest in the contents. In normal circumstances, the Bank would not expect to receive any information on Mr Maxwell, since the late publisher did not own any businesses regulated by the Bank. If it had received such information, it would have been passed to the industrial finance department under Mr Pen Kent or the banking supervision section under Mr Brian Quinn, directors of the Bank. Neither department has been able to find any record of receiving such information. The Bank is known to have received information passed to it by the intelligence services about the activities of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International and its links with international terrorists. Mr Maxwell, who was born in Czechoslovakia, had high-level contacts with several former communist leaders. There are also suggestions that he was under surveillance by the Czech secret services. Mr Robison, a Quaker, resigned from the JIC over what he believed was the increasing unaccountability of intelligence gathering and the potential for the misuse of power. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has declared himself in favour of more open government. He has appointed Mr William Waldegrave as minister for 'open government', and recent-ly broke with Whitehall tradition by publicly naming the heads of MI5 and SIS (MI6). Ivo Dawnay writes: The Cabinet Office refused to comment on the claims, insisting Mr Robison was a 'very junior administrations officer' who had worked on the JIC for a relatively short period. But it did not deny such information might have been collated. 'This refers to intercepts which obviously are part of intelligence systems,' an official said. 'We never comment on those for security reasons.' Labour party trade and industry spokesman Gordon Brown last night called for a full statement from Mr Major. 'If government ministers knew of irregularities in the Maxwell empire as early as 1989 then we now need a top level inquiry and a full prime ministerial statement explaining why no action was taken to investigate fraud.'

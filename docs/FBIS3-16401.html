This is always the  case whenever the conflicting sides come close to an agreement  on a cease-fire and the commencement of talks.    Before reporting on the meeting between Babken Ararktsyan,  chairman of Armenian Supreme Council, and Rasul Guliyev,  chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet, at the  Idzhevanskiy-Kazakhskiy border on 12 March, the announcer stated  that the Armenian side was forced to halt military operations  because of losses it recently suffered in Karabakh.    This is an absolute lie because the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic  and Armenia have always proposed a cease-fire and talks. The  claim about Armenian defeats is also a lie. The only success by  the Azerbaijani side since the start of the offensive on 18  December 1993 was that they penetrated Kelbadzharskiy Rayon.  However, they suffered considerable losses and were forced out.  The Azerbaijanis have always suffered defeats and have lost  tens of thousands of men on the other war fronts too.    During his interview, Rasul Guliyev said that the Armenian  forces must be withdrawn from all Azerbaijani lands.    This has always been Azerbaijan's aspiration. However, the  opposing side has never agreed to it, and no such agreement was  concluded during the aforementioned meeting. This was confirmed  by Babken Ararktsyan in his statement to Mayak Radio following  the report on Ostankino. In refuting that report and in an  attempt to avoid similar intrigues by the Azerbaijani side, the  chairman of the Armenian Supreme Council declared that  henceforth Armenia will not go to such meetings unless the  Karabakh side also takes part in them.    Babken Ararktsyan spoke in detail about this meeting in his  news conference today. [passage omitted]</p>

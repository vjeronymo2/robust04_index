			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / ANC looks at how to pay for its programmes: The ambitious economic goals of South Africa's probable new rulers Now for the hard part. As the African National Congress stands on the threshold of the political kingdom in South Africa, ANC leaders at the weekend launched a new and more difficult battle; the struggle for economic power without which political rights are meaningless. 'No political democracy can survive and flourish if the mass of our people remain in poverty, without land, without tangible prospects for a better life,' says the foreword to the ANC's draft Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), endorsed at a weekend conference of ANC allies. 'We must not perpetuate the separation of our society into a 'first world' and a 'third world' - another disguised way of preserving apartheid.' The crux of the problem is how to raise the mass of South Africa's people out of third-world poverty. The draft programme dodges the hard choices, and is probably better understood as an election manifesto than an economic plan. It sets ambitious goals - over the next five years, 1m homes will be built, 2.5m houses electrified, clean water, sanitation and health care provided for all. But financing is at best vague, at worst unrealistic. Nothing is costed, no priorities are set; all options (including the perennial threat of nationalisation) are left open. However, the programme provides the clearest indication yet of the policies of the new government, which is likely to be dominated by the ANC. The document conveys caution about the speed of implementation, as well as a commitment to fiscal discipline and the need to maintain macroeconomic balance, which white South Africans and foreign investors will find reassuring. 'We must finance the RDP in ways that do not cause undue inflation or balance of payments difficulties,' it says, adding that 'the vast bulk of the RDP will be financed by existing resources organised, rationalised and directed within RDP guidelines'. The current budget deficit of 6 per cent of gross domestic product would not be exceeded and the overall tax burden, as a percentage of GDP, would remain the same 'until strong growth is achieved'. The commitment to a budget deficit not exceeding 6 per cent of GDP is further enshrined in a letter of intent sent last December to the International Monetary Fund and signed by the ANC. Still, Mr Trevor Manuel, ANC economics head, makes clear the 6 per cent ceiling will not apply beyond the 1994-95 budget - he says it would be preposterous to assume RDP can be funded without borrowing more - and ANC plans for 'increasing the efficiency of consumption expenditure and improving the revenue recovery capacities of government' display a touching faith in the powers of the new broom. Mr Manuel points out that a budget of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn) for a nation of 40m people is already not small; and World Bank figures show South Africa already spends more than twice as much on education, as a percentage of GDP (7.3 per cent in 1993), as any other nation in its income bracket, and more even than high-income countries. On health, only Hungary and the UK spent more proportionately than South Africa; Sweden spent only a tenth as much. Most of this money goes to fund the bloated bureaucracy, which can only increase in the first years of an ANC government: nine new provincial administrations will be set up under the constitution; the RDP proposes creating a host of state or parastatal bodies - a national housing bank, an implementation commission, all the apparatus of the centrally planned state  -and affirmative action will swell the civil service further. It is hard to accept the ANC's optimism about vanquishing corruption and inefficiency overnight. A few months in power will probably reveal to the ANC all the contradictions inherent in its plan: it calls for 'people's power' to be exercised at all levels, while simultaneously demanding a high degree of central planning; and it proposes huge spending increases without concomitant rises in revenue. The document ponders a host of new taxes: 'reconstruction levies' in the form of taxes on capital transfers, land and luxury goods; a new national insurance charge; and privately, ANC leaders are still debating a specific wealth tax as a levy on assets. 'When the crunch comes, which way will they jump? Will they slow implementation, or raise taxes?' asks one businessman, who notes that ANC leaders are at best reluctant converts to market economics. Most ANC leaders still pursue a moral approach to economic questions, arguing 'it must be done, it should be done, therefore it will be done', says another businessman.</p>

While MMS realizes the exact impact may not be determinable, a list of all leases and sales months within those lease accounts which could possibly be affected can be compiled. Paragraph (a)(4) of &sect;230.459 requires only an estimated dollar impact. The 2-year period for leases and/or sales months not included in the tolling request will not be tolled. The purpose of this strict construction is to minimize subjective judgments in applying section 10 requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) Two commenters objected to the provisions of &sect;230.460 which repeal the special treatment of advanced rental payments when leases are later subject to suspensions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The IBLA rulings discussed with the preamble (58 FR 53474) were issued prior to any regulations governing section 10. These cases concluded that under the unique fact situations presented, excess rental payments which otherwise were not subject to refund or credit under section 10 could be credited against future rentals. Upon review, MMS still concludes that IBLA's conclusion is not consistent with the Department's interpretation of section 10. Thus, after this rule is effective, the IBLA decision will not be followed. However, these cases are exactly the type of situation envisioned for tolling the 2-year limit by filing a request pursuant to &sect;230.459(a)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) One commenter questioned the requirement of &sect;230.461(d) which disallows the recoupment of a payment amount that exceeds the reported amount. This commenter stated that if the overpayment is not subject to section 10, then the payor should not be required to file a refund request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In those cases to which &sect;230.461(d) applies, the payor may recover its funds without a section 10 refund request. A payment amount exceeding the total reported for more than one lease is not a payment ``in connection with any lease.'' (See the detailed discussion in the 1993 M-Opinion). Such an amount cannot be recouped by reporting a credit entry for a specific lease since the funds were not applied to any lease. After the Form MMS&hyph;2014 lines are processed, amounts in excess of the total reported remain as an unapplied credit in the payor's account. The MMS accountants would then contact the payor for direction as to how the funds should be applied. In most cases, the payor could reduce the next payment by an equal amount to balance its payor account. In other situations, the funds could be applied to an underpaid invoice or other Forms MMS&hyph;2014. If these situations did not apply, the payor could request a non-section 10 cash refund as outlined in the MMS ``Oil and Gas Payor Handbook'' (1986), Volume II, page 4&hyph;25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n) One commenter stated that the provisions of &sect;230.461(g), which would not require a section 10 refund request after a successful challenge of an MMS order to pay, would be more useful if MMS specifies how such funds would be recovered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

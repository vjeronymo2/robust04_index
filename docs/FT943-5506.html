			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: An eccentric view of independent nation Sir, You have an intriguing way of announcing the news that Sir Julius Chan was voted in as prime minister of Papua New Guinea by the national parliament - 'Australia puts faith in new PNG prime minister' (August 31). And might it not be worth reporting the views of the Papua New Guineans who have enjoyed independence for a generation? Your report became even more eccentric in its first paragraph, locating PNG as 'a resource-rich nation adjoining Indonesia's Irian Jaya'. Well, up to a point. Australia's world view (and its obsession with Indonesia) is interesting in its own right, but PNG - by far the largest South Pacific country - merits separate treatment, please.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Angolan peace talks are continuing in Lusaka  today. The general principles of the Angolan electoral process  will be on the negotiating table and the talks will focus on the  second round of presidential elections.    Dr. Jorge Valentim, National Union for the Total  Independence  of Angola [UNITA] information secretary, said in the Zambian  capital yesterday that there was the possibility that an  agreement might be reached in that area. That UNITA official  said, however, that he favored more exchanges of ideas between  the two sides so as to permit a greater understanding of the  problems at hand.    The UN mediators and the team led by Faustino Muteka are due  to meet today. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye  is expected to receive the Popular Movement for the Liberation  of Angola-Labor Party's counterproposal on national  reconciliation, for which he has waited more than a week.    The mediators and the UNITA team to the talks met throughout  the morning yesterday. In the afternoon Blondin Beye met with  the Ad Hoc Commission for Electoral Affairs.</p>

If the control group (considering entirely of women and/or minorities) owns at least 50.1 percent of the equity and, for corporations, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock, then the gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth of any other investor are not considered unless the investor holds more than 49.9 percent of the applicant's passive equity (which, for corporations, includes as much as 5 percent of the voting stock). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Affiliates.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The gross revenues, assets and personal net worth of outside interests held by the applicant (and the attributable investors in the applicant) are counted toward the financial caps if the applicant (or the attributable investors in the applicant) control or have power to control the outside interests or if the applicant (or the attributable investors in the applicant) is under the control of the outside interests.

The points below summarize the two structural options available to firms that wish to qualify for the special provisions adopted for businesses owned by minorities and women. These options will be discussed in more detail in the text that follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 50.1% Equity Option <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If women and/or minority principals control the applicant and own at least: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;50.1 percent of the equity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;and 50.1 percent of the voting stock, in the case of corporations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Then any other investor may hold: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;not more than 49.9 percent of the passive equity (which, for corporations, includes as much as 5 percent of the voting stock). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 25% Equity Option <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If women and/or minority principals control the applicant and own at least: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;25 percent of the equity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;and 50.1 percent of the voting stock, in the case of corporations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Then any other investor may hold: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;less than 25 percent of the passive equity (for corporations, any other investor also may hold not more than 5 percent of the voting stock). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 117. We also have imposed numerous strict requirements to deter shams and fronts and to prevent abuse of the incentives for designated entities. The Commission intends to enforce vigorously each of these requirements. All licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks are prohibited from voluntarily assigning or transferring their licenses for three years after grant of the application and for the next two years may assign or transfer licenses only to other entities that satisfy the financial criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Furthermore, a business that seeks to acquire a license from an entity paying in installments during the license period will be required, as a condition of the grant, to pay according to the installment payment terms for which it qualifies, unless they are more favorable in which case the existing terms apply. If the purchaser is not qualified for any installment payment plan, we will require payment of the unpaid balance in full before the sale will be approved. We also adopt rules to ensure that the value of the bidding credit is returned to the government in the event of a transfer of control or assignment of the license to an entity not qualifying for bidding credits or not qualifying for as high a bidding credit as the seller. In addition, we impose a one-year holding period on licenses received through the benefit of a tax certificate. We will also random audits to ensure that designated entities  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de jure <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control. These steps and our eligibility and affiliation rules will help to ensure that the measures we adopt are utilized only by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  eligible entities and to deter winning bidders seeking only to make a quick profit on the sale of PCS licenses. Ultimately, we believe that we will best fulfill our statutory mandate by creating powerful incentives for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  designated entities to attract the capital necessary to compete both in auctions for broadband PCS and in the provision of service, and be requiring a strict holding period to ensure that the public receives the benefit of this diverse ownership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Motor town recalls days before Daf: The impact of the company's collapse PHOTOGRAPHS and mementoes of a lifetime in engineering decorate the walls of a small bedroom which is part office, part glory hole at the home of Mr Les Southworth, a former director at Leyland Motors. Mr Southworth, who belongs to a long line of boardroom engineers at Leyland, is recalling the day in 1965 when Sir Donald Stokes, then managing director, decided to present a gold watch to everyone who had more than 25 years service with the company. 'They had to hire the Winter Gardens at Blackpool. There were 1,750 workers from the Leyland and Chorley factories who qualified. Many had 30 or 40 years service. 'People at Leyland had pride and spirit in their work. They still do. They have accepted new working practices. Production levels are equal to any in Europe and vehicles are coming off the lines with zero defects,' he says. The town gave its name to the company. Many of the townspeople gave their working lives. Mr Southworth almost ran out of fingers counting his family connections in the company. 'I worked at Leyland, my son worked there, my brother did, daughter-in-law, uncle and nephew,' he said. 'They all worked there but they're all gone now.' They left the company as it shrank during the 1980s. Doors have been closing on Leyland's factory floors since the early 1980s when 12,500 people were employed locally. Once many workers were bussed in from surrounding areas. Today the employment pattern is reversed as increasing numbers of Leyland people commute to adjoining areas. The threat to the remaining 2,500 jobs at the Leyland Daf plants in the town, with a possible 7,000 more due to knock-on factors, is exacerbating an erosion of local trade that has happened throughout the past decade. The demise of Leyland is not so much the death of a town as the end of a way of life where a community lived, worked and shopped around the main employers. In its heyday, the truck company exerted a powerful influence in Leyland. Roads such as Churchill, Cromwell and Centurion were named after the battle tanks that were built there and Leyland people retain a strong emotional attachment to the company. According to South Ribble Borough Council, Leyland is far from dying. It is in Lancashire's wealthiest borough, topping a league table based on information gleaned from census returns. The town of 36,000 is to the north-west of the traditional Lancashire industrial belt. Beyond the urban centre is rich farmland. Three industries dominated the town after the second world war - trucks, paint and rubber manufacturing. All have declined, consolidated or moved operations to the peripheries of the town. Today a third of South Ribble's workforce is employed at seven companies. Only last week the town had been heartened by the news that British Aerospace, which employs about 3,500 people in the borough, had secured Tornado aircraft orders for Saudi Arabia. However, the jobless trend is worrying the council. By November 1992 it was running at 6.8 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in June 1990 - a trend which worries the council. Mr Jim Breakell, the mayor, is a staunch supporter of the plant. He says it is far removed from the pre-Daf merger days of industrial strife. 'I don't believe the government is looking at it with an entrepreneurial eye,' says Mr Breakell, who believes a financial lifebelt from the government would make economic sense. He criticised some of the 'camouflage, facelift schemes' in industrial areas which he said left little to show for the outlay. He said: 'They put money into short-term things that don't do the economy any long-term good.' About 5,000 demonstrators marched from the Leyland Daf assembly plant in Leyland to the town centre yesterday in support of 2,200 local employees of the company whose jobs are at risk.</p>

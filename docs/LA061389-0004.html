			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A judge in Atlanta dismissed one of 10 perjury counts against former Rep. Pat  Swindall as the defense began its case. U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman  called the count "just too confusing for a jury trial." The judge also threw  out more than half an hour of testimony by a defense witness, Rep. Barney Frank  (D-Mass.) who discussed what knowledge that congressmen do and do not have on  details of legislation. Swindall is accused of lying to a federal grand jury  that was investigating the laundering of illegal drug profits. The former  Republican lawmaker negotiated an $850,000 home loan with a businessman who has  since been convicted on money laundering charges. The dismissed charge said  Swindall lied when he testified that he knew little about a mortgage company  created to funnel the money to Swindall.  </P></p>

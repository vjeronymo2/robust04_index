			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ye. Spiridonov, ADS, under the rubric </F> "Property": "Four Fifths of Machinebuilding Enterprises  Potential Bankrupts: Roskommash Disputes Insolvency Criteria Set  by Government"]    [Text] In a few days, a government resolution on the  implementation of bankruptcy legislation that sets insolvency  criteria for enterprises and regulates standards for  bankruptcy-related procedures will be passed. In preparing the  draft resolution, the Federal Administration for Insolvency  (Bankruptcy) Affairs under Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee  on the Administration of State Property] used methods for  analyzing enterprises' financial-economic activity worked out by  the administration with the participation of specialists from  Roskommash (Russian Federation Committee on Machinebuilding).  The Roskommash board of directors was informed of this at a  meeting by its chairman, Anatoliy Ogurtsov.    However, as Aleksandr Voytenko, the head of the Main  Administration for Structural Policy, Demonopolization, and  Privatization at Roskommash, stated, while coming into its own  in the name of the state as the owner of the bankrupt  enterprise, the department raised the plank of financial  indicators envisioned as allowable too high. If insolvency  criteria are to be set only according to the current accounting  balance-sheet, as the Federal Administration on Insolvency  Affairs is doing, and the enterprise's debts are allowed to  exceed the funds available to cover them by no more than a  factor of 2, then, according to Aleksandr Voytenko, 80 percent  of the enterprises in the machinebuilding complex will wind up  on the register of insolvent enterprises.    So far, the Federal Administration on Insolvency Affairs has  put the Moscow Searchlight Plant and the NATI Institute [State  Tractor Science and Research Institute] on the "black list."  Roskommash itself is still defined on the basis of 15  enterprises. At the instruction of Viktor Chernomyrdin, said  Anatoliy Ogurtsov, the branch commission will analyze  enterprises' financial-economic status and make site visits  before 25 May. Then the final list of bankruptcy candidates will  be drawn up. However, it will include only the "very very most,"  inasmuch as the government's draft resolution on implementing  bankruptcy legislation, Mr. Ogurtsov feels, permits the  integrity criteria it sets to be ignored when the bankruptcy of  the enterprise could be averted by preventive financial  stabilization measures.    Among the prophylactic measures against bankruptcy mentioned  at the board meeting were mandatory preservation of at least 25  percent of the shares of the enterprises included in the  priority branch programs for the development of machinebuilding  as state property, as well as the transfer of these shares to an  administration acting as principal for the branch ministries and  committees. Sergey Belyayev, chairman of the Federal  Administration on Insolvency Affairs, who spoke at the meeting,  characterized these claims of Roskommash's as unsupported,  since, as he said, there had yet to be a single example of an  enterprise with a 25-percent share of state property being able  to attract a substantial investor. Therefore, in his opinion, if  its directors were indeed disturbed by the fate of semi-official  enterprises, then Roskommash, on the contrary, needs to fight  for state packages of shares to be sold to rich investors.</p>

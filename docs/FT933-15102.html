			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Latham Pounds 2.21m in the red JAMES LATHAM, the timber importer and building materials merchant, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.21m for the year to end-March. The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 612,000 last time and came from turnover up from Pounds 59.6m to Pounds 60.8m. The increased loss was due to a Pounds 1.89m exceptional charge relating to property write-downs, ongoing rents for closed branches and a further sum to cover historic pension arrangements not related to the pension fund. Interest charges fell slightly, from Pounds 1.35m to Pounds 1.13m, and the company said that to reduce borrowings, further property disposals were envisaged. Losses per share came out at 43.9p (8.7p). There is no final dividend leaving a total for the year of 1.5p (3.75p).</p>

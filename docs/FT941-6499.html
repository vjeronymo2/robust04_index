			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strength of yen hits Sumitomo Rubber result The weak state of Japan's economy and the rise in the yen were blamed for a 32 per cent fall in parent company pre-tax profits at Sumitomo Rubber, a leading manufacturer of tyres. Sumitomo, which owns Dunlop in the UK, France and Germany, said the sluggish state of Japan's car industry and increasing moves to produce cars overseas had adversely affected demand for tyres and resulted in pre-tax profits falling to Y8.04bn (Dollars 76.8m) in 1993 from Y11.8bn a year earlier.</p>

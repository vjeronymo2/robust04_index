			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 12 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said here today that he hoped the  United States would not take retaliatory trade sanctions against  Japan.    Hosokawa indicated that Japan would view such moves as  violations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),  but said he was not frightened of possible retaliatory strikes.    "I very much hope the U.S. will refrain from such action,"  the prime minister said at a news conference before his  departure for Tokyo.    Hosokawa, who arrived here Thursday [10 February] night for  a  two-day visit, held the first summit meeting with U.S. President  Bill Clinton Friday, but failed to reach a trade agreement.    Clinton criticized Japan for unwilling to open its market to  U.S. goods. "It is better to have reached no agreement than to  reach an empty agreement," Clinton said.    Clinton invited Hosokawa and his wife to breakfast at the  White House today to demonstrate that failure of trade talks  would not affect the friendly relationship between the U.S. and  Japan.    Afterward, the President told reporters that no further  trade  discussions were conducted at the breakfast meeting and that "it  was a totally social visit."    But he said that "we just have to examine what our next  steps  will be, and we will be turning to that next week."    Hosokawa didn't think the failure of the agreement will lead  immediately to U.S. trade sanctions against his country.    The prime minister said Japan would not drop its resistance  to "numerical targets" which the United States has demanded,  aiming at cutting Japan's giant trade surplus.    Hosokawa insisted that "we will not modify our position in  that regard," although the Japanese leader will be returning  empty-handed from the U.S. summit meeting.</p>

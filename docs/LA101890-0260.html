			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AT&amp;T REPORTS PROFITS UP 2%, CITES LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE  </P> <P> AT&amp;T said today its profit rose 2% in the third quarter, reflecting  strength in the company's long-distance service and increased sales of products  overseas.  </P> <P> For the three months ended Sept. 30, AT&amp;T said it earned $712 million, or  65 cents a share, compared to $699 million, or 65 cents a share, in the same  quarter last year. Per-share earnings remained stable due to a higher number of  outstanding shares in the most-recent quarter.  </P> <P> Revenue advanced 5% to $9.36 billion from $8.9 billion in the year-ago quarter.  Operating income rose 11% to $1.25 billion.  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Chairman Robert E. Allen called the results  by the nation's largest long-distance phone company "solid in the face of a  softening economy."  </P> <P> The company said in a statement that higher-than-expected start-up costs for  the AT&amp;T Universal Card, a combination credit and calling card introduced  in March, prevented earnings from showing even stronger gains. Costs for the  card were higher than expected because of greater demand than the company  anticipated.  </P> <P> In addition, AT&amp;T said, its earnings were hurt by higher income taxes  resulting primarily from reduced tax credits.  </P> <P> Product sales, including network telecommunications products, computers,  microelectronic components and consumer products, jumped almost 13% during the  quarter to $3.08 billion.  </P> <P> Service revenues, which include long-distance service, installation and  maintenance of equipment, and finance services, rose 3% to $5.72 billion.  Long-distance revenue itself grew 1.5% as calling volume advanced 7%.  </P> <P> Charles Nichols, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the 7%  increase in calling volume is good news and "shows that AT&amp;T has become  more effective in stemming market-share erosion" to MCI Communications Corp.  and U.S. Sprint.  </P> <P> Nichols said he is pleased with the company's earnings growth and agreed that  it is doing well in the light of the economic decline. He called the continued  earnings drag from the Universal card "a short-term negative, long-term  positive" since the card holds the potential of increasing earnings in the  future.  </P></p>

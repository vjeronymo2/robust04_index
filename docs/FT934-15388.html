			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Back in the bright lights for Lucas - Andrew Bolger describes the strategy behind doubled profits of Pounds 50m LUCAS Industries executives reported their results from a specially designed platform, complete with bright lights and pictures of the components which the engineering group supplies to the world's automotive and aerospace industries. The glossy presentation matched a new confidence on part of the Birmingham-based company, which said cutting costs had helped it to double annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 50.3m. Lucas's share price has also doubled since the dark days of last autumn, when a recession-induced collapse in profits made it the City's favourite target for a hostile takeover. However, Pounds 50.3m is still a miserable rate of return on sales of Pounds 2.56bn, and Lucas once again had to raid its reserves to maintain the dividend payment. The same executives were yesterday also anxious not to appear over-optimistic, given the tough state of the continental European markets which account for 38 per cent of sales. Sir Anthony Gill, Lucas's chairman and chief executive, clearly had not envisaged a 16 per cent drop in the European automotive market when he said last year that he aimed to cover this year's dividend payment from earnings. Yesterday, he said he now hoped to get back to that happy state in the current year - but it was again phrased as a 'chairman's aim', rather than a firm commitment. Mr John Grant, finance director, said: 'We are bumping along the bottom of the cycle and probably will continue to bump along for a little while longer.' Overall sales rose by 2 per cent, net of currency movements and divestments, in spite of sharp declines in world aerospace and European automotive markets. Lucas said this reflected its strong positions in the more resilient sectors of both industries. It claimed increased market share in each of its core businesses - aerospace engine control and flight control systems, and automotive braking and diesel systems. Automotive, which accounted for 63 per cent of group sales, improved operating profits from Pounds 42.2m to Pounds 45.1m, with improvements in costs more than compensating for the group's limited ability to pass on price rises to customers. Launch costs in the diesel and electrical systems businesses dampened the pace of profit recovery. Aerospace sales, which comprise 25 per cent of the group total, were down 7 per cent at constant exchange rates. Cost-cutting helped operating profits double to Pounds 31m. Lucas said it had been less affected than the industry generally by softer defence markets and production cuts by leading airframe makers - mainly because of its strong presence on newer aircraft and engine families. Mr Grant said the restructuring programme unveiled last year was about '80 per cent complete', although many of the improvements in efficiency would continue indefinitely. Employee numbers have been reduced by 20 per cent since July 1990, and will continue to fall at an annual rate of 2-3 per cent. The divestment programme realised Pounds 56m in the year to July, and Pounds 75m to date. The group said further disposals would be made of businesses which did not contribute significantly to its core strengths. Mr Grant, who joined Lucas last year from Ford, said capital spending had been cut by Pounds 7m to Pounds 116m and improved financial discipline had cut working capital by Pounds 22m. Sir Anthony said that when the group's main markets recovered, it should be able to get back towards profit margins similar to those achieved before the recession - a return on sales of up to 10 per cent. Lucas was aiming for such a recovery in margins within three years - which was ambitious, but achievable. Whatever Lucas's long-term future, it will involve both a new chairman and chief executive. As expected, the company would not comment on the post of chief executive, except to say it still hoped to make a formal announcement at or before the group's annual meeting in November. Sir Anthony, who last year agreed to stay on until the management succession was sorted out, ended his review of the trading outlook on a note of carefully qualified optimism. 'Further reductions in costs and working capital will provide a platform for the company to continue to enhance value for shareholders, despite uncertainties over the pace of economic recovery. Lucas is strong, getting stronger and will be in a powerful position to benefit from a revival in the global economy when it comes.'</p>

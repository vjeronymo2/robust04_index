			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Fanuc enjoys sharp rise following shake-up Fanuc, a Japanese maker of machine-tool equipment, said profits for the first six months to September increased sharply due to cost-cutting measures and streamlining of operations. Unconsolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - for the first half rose 13.4 per cent to Y13.2bn (Dollars 136m) in spite of a 4 per cent fall in sales to Y54bn. Orders for the first six months rose 17.2 per cent to Y61.6bn, and after-tax profits rose 8.3 per cent to Y7bn. Operating costs fell 9.6 per cent to Y43.6bn resulting in a rise in operating profits by 29.9 per cent to Y10.4bn. Non-operating profits fell 26 per cent and non-operating costs fell by 53.9 per cent. Sales in Fanuc's factory automation division fell 4.1 per cent to Y33.6bn, and its robot division fell 11.3 per cent to Y15bn. The company said it would raise dividends for the current business year to Y20 a share from Y18, due to the profit growth. For the full year to March, the company expects a 6.8 per cent rise in sales to Y113.5bn and a 24 per cent rise in recurring profits to Y28.5bn.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Valmet VALMET, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, cut losses after financial items to FM72m (Dollars 12.7m) in the first four months, from FM126m in the same period in 1992, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. Sales rose 38 per cent to FM3.31bn, and the operating margin rose to FM265m from FM123m. However, financing costs increased to FM152m from FM84m, mainly because of a FM50m foreign exchange loss following the depreciation of the markka. Given the stronger performance, and signs of revival in the wood processing industry, the group has forecast a 'considerable improvement' in income for the full year.</p>

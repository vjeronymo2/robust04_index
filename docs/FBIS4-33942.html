			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Washington by AE correspondent Paulo Sotero] </F>   [Excerpt] Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is  sounding out the U.S. Government and other governments of  developed countries about his chances as candidate for president  of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the international  organization created through the accords of the Uruguay Round of  the GATT talks to replace the GATT secretariat. Sources in the  Mexican Government and in the Clinton administration have  confirmed that there have been consultations on this matter.    In Brasilia, an official source said that the Brazilian  Government views the possible launching of Salinas' candidacy as  normal, and no cause for concern. This week the Brazilian  Government officially launched the candidacy of Finance Minister  Rubens Ricupero for this post. Ricupero, who served earlier as  the Brazilian ambassador to GATT, earned the respect of the  formulators of international trade policies in Geneva because of  the role he performed as chairman of the contracting parties at  a difficult juncture of the long Uruguay Round negotiations.    According to Luiz Felipe Lampreia, the incumbent Brazilian  ambassador to GATT, Ricupero's candidacy emerged naturally in  talks with the GATT "inner circle" -- with the support of  European, Asian, and Latin American countries -- after GATT  Director Peter Sutherland announced that he is not interested in  leading the new organization. An official source said: "Rather  than launch Ricupero's candidacy, all the Brazilian Government  did was take over an initiative originated by others." [passage  omitted]</p>

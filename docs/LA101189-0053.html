			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH WILL MEET 3 LATIN CHIEFS IN DRUG SUMMIT  </P> <P> The presidents of South America's three principal cocaine-producing countries  on Tuesday invited President Bush to a summit within 90 days to forge joint  strategies in the "frontal assault" on drug trafficking, and Bush quickly  accepted the proposal.  </P> <P> Bush expressed his willingness to take part shortly after word of the proposal  by Presidents Alan Garcia of Peru, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Virgilio  Barco Vargas of Colombia reached the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater  said.  </P> <P> "We accept. The President will go," Fitzwater declared. "I think everybody had  felt a summit like this would be necessary."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the specific invitation to a summit conference caught the White  House by surprise, even though Bush had mentioned such a meeting during his  presidential campaign last year and again in a nationally televised speech  Sept. 5 in which he outlined his anti-drug program.  </P> <P> Fitzwater said no discussions have been held on the specifics of such a summit,  including its agenda, date, location or participants.  </P> <P> Garcia, Paz Zamora and Barco did not suggest where the summit should be held,  although their invitation to Bush suggested that they want it to occur in Latin  America, not in the United States. That appeared to raise the potential for  disagreement, given possible security problems in the drug-producing countries.  </P> <P> Jamaica, Barbados, and Caracas, Venezuela, have been mentioned as possible  sites, Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> "They're inviting us. We'll be talking about the location," he said.  </P> <P> A communique issued by the three Latin presidents said a technical meeting  would be held in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, on Nov. 20 to work out details of the  joint proposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Surrounded by Troops  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a desert resort surrounded by army troops and police units,  Garcia, Paz Zamora and Barco spent nearly five hours Tuesday coordinating  common measures against the scourge afflicting their nations.  </P> <P> The three presidents expressed their resolve to work together to combat cocaine  trafficking, while acknowledging the differences in the problems of production,  commercialization and consumption.  </P> <P> "We emphasize that there is a growing universal awareness of the gravity of the  problem and of the co-responsibility of the states" to counter it, the three  said after the meeting.  </P> <P> Peru and Bolivia, among the poorest countries in Latin America, together grow  more than 80% of the coca leaves used in the production of cocaine. Colombia,  home of the powerful drug cartels, is the center of final refining and  marketing of cocaine to consumers in the United States and Europe. All three  countries also have growing drug use problems of their own.  </P> <P> At the same time, Peru is coping with a violent left-wing insurgency that has  left more than 15,000 dead since 1980. The dominant rebel group is Sendero  Luminoso (Shining Path), a Maoist guerrilla movement that has built up a  tactical alliance with peasant coca growers and in recent days has killed  dozens of people.  </P> <P> Bolivia has no insurgency problem, but its coca growers are bound together in  powerful unions that oppose eradication programs. Colombia has endured a wave  of violence since mid-August, when traffickers killed a leading presidential  candidate and the government responded with a declaration of all-out war  against the government.  </P> <P> Underlining their security concerns, the presidents met in the small city of  Ica, about 200 miles south of the Peruvian capital of Lima, in a virtual oasis  surrounded by dozens of miles of bare desert sand. All approaches were guarded  by security forces at roadblocks, and plainclothes officers patrolled the  agricultural town of 150,000, reportedly rounding up hundreds of people without  identity documents.  </P> <P> The two visiting heads of state arrived by plane at a military air base in  nearby Pisco and flew by helicopter to the grounds of a resort hotel on the  edge of Ica. Soldiers with binoculars stood atop the mountainous sand dunes  that surround the hotel, monitoring all approaches.  </P> <P> The one-day summit preceded the third annual meeting today through Friday of  the now-misnamed Group of Eight, an organization of presidents of Latin  American democracies aimed at encouraging regional integration.  </P> <P> Panama, the eighth member, was suspended last year after strongman Gen. Manuel  A. Noriega in effect deposed President Eric A. Delvalle. At this week's session  the presidents are expected to consider a motion to expel Panama outright after  Noriega's cancellation of election results last May.  </P> <P> "We could ill permit a country like Panama, which makes a joke of the  democratic system, to remain among us," Peruvian Foreign Minister Guillermo  Larco Cox said Tuesday. "The Panamanian government is a usurper of the popular  will."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Newly Elected  </P> <P> Of the seven member countries, three have newly elected presidents: Carlos  Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Carlos Saul  Menem of Argentina. The other four, Garcia of Peru, Barco of Colombia, Julio  Maria Sanguinetti of Uruguay and Jose Sarney of Brazil, all will be leaving  office within a year after elections in those countries.  </P> <P> A brief communique read by Garcia after the talks Tuesday said the three  leaders "take up the initiative of President George Bush. Therefore, we invite  him to take part in a meeting in the next 90 days and also consider to be of  great importance the possible participation of the countries of Europe in this  meeting as well."  </P> <P> In his anti-drug program announced Sept. 5, Bush pledged $261 million to the  three Andean nations in this fiscal year to help them fight drug trafficking.  Separately, the three nations had complained that the program overemphasizes  repression of drug trafficking and offers too little economic help to allow the  countries to devise viable alternatives for their people. Coca and cocaine  bring billions of dollars a year into the three economies.  </P> <P> The three presidents neither criticized nor praised the Bush initiative. Their  statement avoided substantive comment on the drug problem, and the presidents  declined to answer questions.  </P> <P> Bush is scheduled to visit Costa Rica on Oct. 27-28, but officials have said  for several weeks that if a drug summit is organized, it would not be held in  conjunction with that meeting, because its host, Costa Rican President Oscar  Arias Sanchez, has insisted that his summit focus entirely on the efforts to  establish democracy in the region.  </P> <P> Asked whether a drug summit could take place within 90 days, Fitzwater said  Bush had been talking about holding the meeting "by the end of the year," so  that a 90-day time frame was "within the realm of possibility."  </P> <P> The spokesman said Bush and Barco had spoken about holding such a meeting when  they met in Washington two weeks ago. "That probably fed the idea into the  group" in Peru, he said.  </P> <P> Asked what such a meeting could accomplish, Fitzwater said, "You need a lot of  coordination and information on international drug trafficking."  </P> <P> Smith reported from Ica, Peru, and Gerstenzang from Washington.  </P></p>

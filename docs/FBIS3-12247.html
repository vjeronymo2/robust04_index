			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arab affairs correspondent Eldad Beck] </F>   [Text] The PLO leadership in Tunis has already been  apprised of today's cabinet session. The PLO declared that the  cabinet's decisions were insufficient, failed to meet the  Palestinians' minimum demands, and disappointing. We spoke with  Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, a short  while ago. Dr. al-Tibi commented on the steps slated to be  taken against the Kakh activists, including their disarmament.  Al-Tibi said we are not dealing with a small group of people  and asserted that a large number of settlers should be disarmed.  Ahmad al-Tibi called for an immediate solution to the problem  of the Jewish settlements, especially those located in the heart  of Arab population centers. Al-Tibi said: A new era has ensued  in the wake of the massacre in Hebron and the Israeli Government  decisions do not meet its demands. In short, Ahmad al-Tibi  described today's cabinet decisions as disappointing.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks' revival in response to Fed move Wall Street US stocks showed a modest improvement yesterday as investors sifted through the implications of the Federal Reserve's move to tighten monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.91 higher at 3,869.46, but the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 0.27 to 468.53. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite added 1.65 to 473.38, and the Nasdaq composite 1.17 to 797.51. NYSE volume, at 281m shares, was moderate. With the Fed's decision to push up rates out of the way, equity investors were free to count their blessings, which include buoyant economic growth and strong corporate profits. As a consequence, blue-chip stocks advanced steadily during most of the session. In the last hours of trade, however, the positive sentiment ebbed a bit and the Dow industrials gave back some of their gains. The day's economic news had the potential to unsettle the rosy mood. The Commerce Department said the orders of durable goods last month slumped by 2.5 per cent, much worse than the consensus forecast of analysts, who saw a half-point decline. However, investors chose to ignore the data, partly because most of the decrease was concentrated in the aircraft sector, limiting its negative implications for the economy as a whole. The shift in attention away from interest rates was reflected in the performance of stocks most expected to benefit from an expanding economy. Caterpillar powered Dollars 2 1/4 ahead to Dollars 121, International Paper climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 70 3/8 and General Motors added Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 . Ford fared even better, jumping Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 63 3/8 . International Business Machines was a notable loser, thanks to reports raising concern over the company's mounting debt-to-equity ratio. The stock slumped Dollars 1 to Dollars 57 1/4 . Trucking and air-freight delivery stocks were strong, lifting the Dow transportation index by 10.59 to 1,725.01. Roadway Services gained Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 70 3/4 , while Airborne climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 . But UAL, parent of United Airlines, sagged Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 125 1/2 . In financial services, Lomas gained Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 9 1/8 on heavy volume of nearly 2.2m shares. The mortgage banking concern disclosed that it would consider a merger or acquisition by another company. Rubbermaid's share price fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 28 1/4 after its chairman warned that the consumer-products company would fail to meet its first quarter earnings projections of 35 cents a share. Canada Toronto stocks rocketed higher in late session trade, sending the TSE-300 index soaring to an all-time closing and intraday high. It rose 58.05 points to 4,609.93 in brisk turn-over of 92.1m. Gains were broad-based, which analysts cited as another positive sign that market sentiment has turned. Advancing shares outpaced declines 503 to 316, with 311 stocks closing steady, unmoved by the market. Mexico Mexican stocks ended moderately higher after a busy,speculative session buoyed by a drop in domestic interest rates. The IPC index of 36 leading shares closed 31.65 points higher, a gain of 1.26 per cent, at 2,543.57. Volume was brisk at 124.18m shares of which Telefonos de Mexico accounted for almost 47m. Telmex A shares ended 1.89 per cent higher.</p>

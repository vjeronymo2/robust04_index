			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, Jan 3 (CTK) -- Slovak President  Michal Kovac's urgent call for the creation of a broad  government coalition, made in his new year's speech, was "a  challenge" addressed to Premier Vladimir Meciar who has been  stubbornly rejecting solution of social problems in this way,  the trade union daily PRACA writes today.    It recalls that before he became president, Kovac was one of  the leaders of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS), of which Meciar is the chairman, who in the (June 1992)  election campaign coined the idea of creating a government of  experts irrespective of their party affiliation.    If Meciar interprets Kovac's proposal as a small revenge for  their disputes, he will probably decide to continue fighting  against the majority which can imagine a broad-coalition  government with "his" movement, but without him, PRACA writes.    If Meciar accepts the challenge and "allows himself to be  dismissed" because his time in this historical stage has run  out, he will certainly return to political life as a messiah  with which he already has his own experience, the paper adds.    Slovak President Michal Kovac's new year's appeal to parties  and movements to look for suitable personalities for a  broad-coalition government will probably give rise to much  controversy, the left- leaning PRAVDA writes.    "Supporters of status quo from both the government and the  opposition will assess (Kovac's) appeal as inappropriate," the  paper says and adds that Kovac "does not want the HZDS and its  chairman to do nothing less but... to share power and  responsibility with other political subjects. They (the  subjects) should cooperate with the HZDS as with a recognized  partner, according to the president's notions. He may be asking  too much of what our politicians are not capable," PRAVDA says.    But it adds that Kovac's appeal had to be made "because time  for making a meaningful change is quickly running out." The  economic and social situation in Slovakia has been too bad for  social energy to be spent on unproductive political struggles  and disputes, PRAVDA stresses. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it hopes to inspect two  unreported nuclear facilities in North Korea in addition to  seven reported sites at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang. IAEA  Director-General Hans Blix expressed the hope in an opening  speech Monday at the Board of Governors' meeting. Blix made it  clear that the upcoming IAEA inspection would be limited to  checking the seven reported facilities only once and to  confirming that North Korea has not diverted nuclear material.    The IAEA Board of Governors, meanwhile, decided to take up  the North Korean nuclear issue on Wednesday [23 February], the  last day of its three-day meeting. The decision came moments  after North Korea sent a telegram informing the IAEA secretariat  that it would issue visas for members of an IAEA inspection team  after seeing the outcome of its talks with the United States,  held in New York early this week.    The North Koreans thus appeared to have erected yet another  barrier to IAEA inspections. Blix told Pyongyang last week that  the IAEA was ready to send inspectors whenever North Korea  issued visas for them. North Korea sent a three-member  delegation to the Board of Governors' meeting including Kim  Su-kil, a Foreign Ministry official at the ambassadorial level.    "(North Korea's) acceptance of inspections resulted from a  North Korea-U.S. agreement," Kim said. The issuance of visas  for the inspection team would be linked to corresponding  measures the United States has promised to take, Kim said.    As a result, the IAEA inspection team could arrive in  Pyongyang on Saturday [26 February] at the earliest, if the  U.S.-North Korea contact proceeded smoothly.</p>

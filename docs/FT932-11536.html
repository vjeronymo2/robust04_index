			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Tories shrug off Newbury poll rating THE TORIES insisted yes-terday that they were still confident that they would win the by-election at Newbury on Thursday, in spite of an opinion poll showing their candidate 16 per cent behind Liberal Democrat Mr David Rendel. Both the parties have moved into top gear for the final days of campaigning, with neither fully believing the poll putting the Liberal Democrats on 54 per cent, with the Tories trailing on 38 per cent in the seat which they held with a 12,000-plus majority at the general election. Mr Julian Davidson, the Tory candidate, said yesterday: 'I am very confident that we will run a hard campaign over the last three days and that we will win on Thursday.' Last night the Tories held a rally with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who was heckled by Euro-sceptics and had eggs thrown at him by Communist party members. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday paid his third visit to the constituency to urge voters to hold the government to account. 'A vote for the Conservatives will be used to endorse the Conservative record of the last year. A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to force a change of direction and a change of style for the next year,' he said. In spite of the NOP poll in The Mail on Sunday, which was conducted by telephone in the second half of last week among some 750 voters, Liberal Democrat campaigners said they thought the result on Thursday could be very close. They are keen that the support they have attracted from former Tories and the small number of Labour supporters in the constituency does not evaporate with a perception that they look set to win by nearly 10,000 votes. The Tories said that the poll did not coincide with their own findings, and pointed out that opinion polls in the approach to the general election last year understated Tory support.</p>

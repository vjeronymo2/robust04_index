			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P lowers debt ratings of Canadian bank STANDARD and Poor's, the credit rating agency, said it had downgraded the long-term debt ratings of Toronto-Dominion Bank, to AA from AA-plus, and its subordinated debt to AA-minus from AA, Reuter reports from New York. Both ratings are removed from creditwatch, where they were put on February 12. Total debt affected is Dollars 5.3bn. The action reflects the continued worsening of the bank's asset quality, and the expectation of a prolonged decline of future profitability levels, S&amp;P said. Toronto-Dominion Australia and TD Mortgage Corp ratings were cut to AA from AA-plus. Toronto-Dominion's A-1-plus short-term rating was affirmed.</p>

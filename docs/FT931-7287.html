			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Only the tenacious need apply THIS is a bad time time to be looking for a job in advertising. The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, estimates the number of jobs in advertising agencies in Britain has collapsed from a peak of 15,000 in 1988 to 12,000 in 1992. Redundancies have also taken their toll in the US advertising business, according to Gary Billings, worldwide human resources director for the agency Lintas Worldwide. Based in the US, Billings has responsibility for the hiring and development of Lintas Worldwide's top executives. 'In New York, there has been something like a 25 per cent reduction in the number of people working in advertising in the last five years and those are people who will never re-enter the market again,' says Billings. But although the number of jobs has shrunk, opportunities still exist. The key is to spot them and improve chances of getting noticed. One inescapable rule is to be persistent, says Billings. 'What it takes to get the job is the skill you need to succeed in the job, and that's tenacity. The probability of being in the right place at the right time to get a job is a function of how many letters you have sent out. You make your own luck; the person who is willing to send out hundreds of applications and stick with it, is rare.' Another key factor in advertising agencies' recruitment thinking is that, just as their clients are increasingly shifting towards global marketing strategies, so too agencies want to see evidence that new recruits are able to function on a global basis. 'If you see yourself as a global advertising executive the opportunities are greater, as long as you are willing to spend time in a developing economy,' Billings adds. A willingness to spend three years in the Shanghai office might mean lowered pay expectations and tough working conditions. But such baptisms of fire might, suggests Billings, lead to greater long-term success than simply expressing a desire to dive headlong into a major account in a high-profile office such as Paris or New York. A checklist of requirements that an international agency looks for from new recruits includes: an understanding of how global economies work and interact; flexibility; enthusiasm; a realistic - that is, lowered - expectation of pay levels; linguistic abilities. But even more important, says Billings, 'Is that you have to be very good at packaging and positioning yourself as a brand. That's true no matter where you go. You must be realistic about time. It takes at least nine months between starting to look and finding a job. Be patient and persistent. Never waste a contact until you're ready. We're a networking business. When a person is on the market, the first thing they do is start calling on the network. But you must know exactly what your objective is before you sit down with that contact.' Nick Jones, 26, is British by birth but works for Lintas in New York on the IBM account. His experience confirms that persistence and careful research can give results. An English studies graduate, he went on to do an MBA at Colorado State University. 'I applied for advertised jobs and also to US agencies directly, targeting those where I felt I had something to offer. In my MBA I studied the computer industry. When I saw that Lintas has pretty much all the IBM advertising, I focused on Lintas. My interest in the IBM account, as it turned out, coincided with the need for an assistant account executive.' Jones believes he sent 60 speculative letters, from which he got two interviews. 'You have to offer them (advertising agencies) a reason why you would be good on a particular account. I don't think you can just say: 'I want to work in advertising.' Everyone says that.'</p>

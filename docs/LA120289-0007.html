			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOCKEYS SEEM TO GET BETTER WITH AGE  </P> <P> The national top-10 jockey standings contain some interesting information. All  of the top six riders -- except (Eddie) Delahoussaye, and he has a national  riding title -- are past Eclipse Award winners. All of the top six -- except  (Jose) Santos -- are over 30 years old, and two of them -- (Angel) Cordero and  (Laffit) Pincay -- are over 40. This seems to be one sport where the cream  comes to the top -- and stays there.  </P> <P> DON LOVE, Palm Springs  </P></p>

Some unlawful elements changed the amounts  of money on invoices to swindle money from companies, and some  printed false invoices to evade taxes. For example, a 29-yuan  invoice for a piece of cloth was changed to 115,000 yuan, and  some people have bought false invoices to claim reimbursement  from the accounting departments. Beijing police recently  cracked a gang who printed and sold false invoices, crushed  three dens, arrested 22 suspects, and seized 295 copies of  invoices which certify payment of state value-added taxes.  Shenzhen police also cracked a similar case, arrested 35  persons, and seized 600 such invoices. Law courts,  procuratorates, public security organs, and taxation departments  made joint arrangements to crack down on false invoices  throughout the whole country. They decided that a fraud-proof  value-added tax invoice, which can be used across the country,  will be printed solely by a certain department and used  beginning 1 July.

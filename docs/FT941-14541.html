			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Westminster council defence faces challenge The principal defence of the Westminster councillors, who were named by the district auditor for alleged gerrymandering in the sale of council houses in marginal wards, is challenged by documents obtained by the Financial Times. Many of the councillors, including Dame Shirley Porter, former leader of the council, have argued that they had received legal advice approving the sales policy. But a transcript of an interview by Mr John Magill, the district auditor, of Mr Jeremy Sullivan, the barrister who advised Westminster city council on its now-abandoned policy, which was conducted on November 12 1992, indicates that had Mr Sullivan been fully briefed on the council's motives, he would not have endorsed the policy. Mr Sullivan believes he was not shown vital papers on the policy's effect on the homeless. Mr Magill has called Westminster council's policy 'disgraceful and improper' and provisionally recommended that 10 councillors and officials be surcharged Pounds 21.25m over their involvement in the affair. In the transcript, Mr Magill puts the question in the following terms: ''The majority party nearly lost the election, and since then they have been talking about targeting marginal wards. We are collecting data on these eight wards, we are talking about designating all the properties in those eight wards' and that was the sort of background flavour, what is your view of that?' Mr Sullivan replied: 'I would have said: 'It is unlawful.' If that is the way it has been put.' A letter from Mr Merv Montacute, the council's managing director, to Mr Andrew Dismore, the council's Labour leader, indicates that Mr Sullivan did not see the final draft of the reports drawn up by council officials for the council's housing committee. The letter also says: 'My understanding of the position is that Mr Sullivan was not shown a list identifying specific properties for designation.' Mr Sullivan did not see another key report - Westminster Housing and Economic Study - which was commissioned by the council from PA Cambridge Economic Consultants. The report made clear in 1987 that there was a serious and worsening homeless problem in the area. It said: 'Housing problems for the most vulnerable groups are getting worse, an impression confirmed by the continuing high level of homelessness.' This finding is crucial in the light of Mr Magill's provisional view that the council's sales policy was 'inconsistent with the statutory duties which the council owed to the homeless. In his interview Mr Magill showed Mr Sullivan the two volumes of the report, to discover if he had been asked to read it. Mr Sullivan replied: 'I think I should have a fit if I had been asked to do that. I certainly was not. I am not sure whether I have ever been asked to read that, even in preparation for the judicial review proceedings.' Mr Magill said in the public statement made last week: 'No local housing authority acting reasonably would adopt a policy, the anticipated consequences of which were that the number of homeless households placed in temporary accommodation would increase by 172 each year and that the net revenue costs to the council would increase by over Pounds 1.5m in each succeeding year.'</p>

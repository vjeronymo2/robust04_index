			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Private View: Mutations of an artist in the lab - William Latham on the aesthetics of his computer-generated 'virtual sculptures' BUT IS IT Art? William Latham says it is, though he does it at the console of a computer in an underground laboratory at an IBM research station in southern England. He sits in the half-darkness breeding 'virtual sculptures' out of mutant forms borrowed from nature - horns, shells, slugs and eggs - and sets them afloat in computer space like visitations from a nightmare. Not only are they art, says Latham, they are a statement of the artist's function in a technical world. 'My work links into the Renaissance and Durer's concern with geometric primitives. It has connections with Leonardo and his sketchbooks.' His other influences are Surrealism, 'systems art' and the Russian Constructivists, Pop Art and SF films such as Aliens. 'I am exploiting technology and commenting on it at the same time,' he explained. 'Normally an artist stands on the edge of society as a spectator making comments. The artist on canvas is on the outside, whereas I have become a cog in the science machine. 'Maybe it's the 20th century's view of artists that is wrong. They are peripheralised, expected to behave like savages, when really they are often highly perceptive and can make a much wider contribution. It's wrong that they should be limited to commercial galleries and museums. Visual communication is very powerful and it is a skill that many people don't have. There's not enough art at school. I think that's criminal.' William Latham is genuinely an artist; he started painting at 13, won a scholarship to Stowe School, a First in fine art at Christ Church, Oxford, and a Henry Moore scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. From simple geometrical shapes he began to construct, on paper, a vast family tree of forms. He applied to IBM for help and was taken on six years ago as a research fellow - a sort of artist in residence. IBM was practising community outreach. But its investment in Latham has proved commercially valuable. For his evolutionary project led to the creation of 'Mutator', a sophisticated computer program which, because it it permits the use of intuitive judgment, could revolutionise not only graphic design but financial and economic modelling, automobile design, motorway planning, medical image processing and criminal identification. 'Mutator' could not have been created, however, without Latham's colleague, Stephen Todd, a pure mathematician (also with a First from Christ Church) and full-time IBM employee. The invention of Mutator raised unusual questions of copyright: and since Latham sells his art works (large photographs of his cyber-creatures) through his own company, he was obliged to take legal advice. 'To work with big corporations you have to be very hard-nosed sometimes and diplomatic at other times, especially if you're using millions of pounds of their computer time to do what you like,' he said. Don't you find the environment alien? 'I have accustomed myself to it. Because I'm not an employee I'm treated a bit like a guest. I quite like the environment actually. I've always found it difficult working in a studio by myself. I find it better when stuff is happening around me: you feel you are part of the nervous system of technology.' But that subterranean air-conditioned office . . . I wonder your artistic sensibility doesn't revolt. 'In some ways it has its own aesthetic, the lab world. I find it very necessary to get away from all this and shut it out of my mind. That's why I live in London.' Latham's wife Belinda Channer is an artist too and they have a six-month-old baby, Daisy. Did you have conventional prejudices about scientists? 'No, largely because my father was an industrial chemist. It's odd why I didn't become a scientist. I do think very subjectively, but analytically as well. I switch very quickly from one to the other - working with computers forces one to.' Latham made a distinction between the creative scientists like his colleague Stephen Todd and the programers who live a narrower, systems-dependent existence. I asked him about the mind-numbing jargon of the computer industry. 'It's a bit like Latin in the Middle Ages. If you spoke it you communicated with people across the world, but if not you were hostile. It hasn't helped by making people quite fearful of technology. But jargon is necessary as a short-hand.' William Latham describes the computer screen as a window into his own imagination and his 'sculptures' as snapshots through the window. The mutations are generated randomly but according to parameters set by the artist, and he intervenes to select them on aesthetic grounds. His animated films demonstrate the evolutionary process. Are these creatures as real to you as the real world? 'About the same. I sometimes feel sorry about killing a mutation. You become attached to them in a funny sort of way, a bit like a pet. They float around and the babies cluster round the parent like bees around a honeypot. Should I really kill these little things clustering around their parent? Is it morally incorrect to kill these forms if they are behaving autonomously?' Having instruction keys on the computer which read 'marry', 'breed', 'gene-splice', 'kill' makes it worse, he said. 'The morality of computer space . . . ' he laughed. But is it Art? Latham sells about six of his big Cibachrome prints a year (they go for Pounds 2,000 upwards) through a London gallery; and has exhibited in Europe, the US, Japan and Australia. 'Why shouldn't art be sold in the same way as a symphony on a CD? What I don't like is the elitism, the mafia, snobbishness, art being only for the rich.' Aren't they just computer graphics? 'There is this argument. If I'm like a gardener making flowers for a show or a dog-breeder breeding for Cruft's, it doesn't necessarily make me an artist. If you find a beautiful shell on a beach shouldn't that be called art as well? 'The difference is I am both the gardener and the creator. It's my system, crafted with Stephen to match exactly my ideas. I can go behind the scenes and change the evolutionary rules then come out again as the gardener and breed more forms. I agree that if I was just the gardener someone else could do it instead. 'Another interesting question is whether the role of the artist is to create the system that other people use to make their own art - so art becomes a collective experience. 'Yes, I would describe what I do as art. But maybe the purpose of my work is to question. I think all good art questions the definition of what art is. Does the meaning of art change with evolution and computers? Or is there another term? I don't really try and answer those questions.' But where is the personal stamp? 'The personal stamp is that I define the evolutionary system and the rules of growth, then Stephen hard-codes that.' The objects are very impersonal. 'Like nature. Like that plant.' He pointed to a pot plant. 'It is austere. I want things to be austere so someone looking at them wouldn't realise there was any human involvement at all. I want it to be very cold and very uncompromising, to get this quality of natural forms . . . Nature is hostile. I like photos of giant bed-bugs, blown up.' You mean you have a taste for the weird? 'Yeah', he laughed. 'I think so.' Is this a psychological problem? I asked, half-seriously. 'I think I'm quite a normal sort of guy.' He laughed again. 'But I do like things that are just at the edge of one's frame of reference.' So working on a machine doesn't limit your imagination? 'Not really, so long as I keep producing weird forms.' The machine enables him to be more productive, he said. 'It's quite cathartic, in some ways like Picasso's late work when he was just churning this stuff out . . . getting ideas out of one's imagination. All artists have these drives.' And does your work carry any message? 'You could say it's a comment on the whole area of genetic engineering and man's tampering with the natural world, a subtle parody of science and technology. In a thousand years everything may have been genetically manipulated. So there's a sort of paranoia there about things ceasing to be natural.' Geneticists and the military have shown an interest in 'Mutator'. One day, Latham said, it might be used for purposes with which he did not agree. Such as a eugenics programme for humans? 'My structures are not representations of natural objects. It would have to be a lot more complicated, but we've got the basis of research here that could take it into that area. We ourselves don't' So you could find yourself in 20 years the unwitting father of some monstrous project? 'I hope not. But those are the dangers. It comes back to this human fascination for exploring without knowing where it will lead. It might mean mutating molecules for some medical cure. 'But the point is that the artist is no longer on the periphery.'</p>

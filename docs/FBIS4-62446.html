			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 19, 2-7 May 94] </F>   [Excerpt] On Thursday, 5 May, President Kravchuk signed a  decree, which liberalizes Ukraine's export procedures with a  view of expanding exports of Ukrainian commodities and thus spur  foreign currency incomings.    The decree specifies, in particular, that a list of  commodities is approved, for which quota and license issuance  regulations are nullified in 1994, as well as that license  issuance procedures are no more applicable to commodities, not  covered by the quota regulations.    The decree specifies that exports of coal, ammonia,  ethylene,  benzene, methanol, mineral fertilizers and ferrous metals are  effected following the established procedures without  specifically authorized subjects of foreign economic activities.    The Cabinet of Ministers is instructed to determine, on a  quarterly basis, amounts of export quotas for the above listed  commodities to be realized at auctions by the Ministry for  Foreign Economic Relations.    The Cabinet is further instructed to draft, within a month's  term, and submit to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a law on  necessary amendments to Cabinet decrees, which regulate exports  of commodities and services, and to adjust, within a fortnight's  term, its own resolutions to this decree.    The institute of "special exporters" was set up by the  Cabinet's resolution of 22 December 1993 allegedly with a view  to make more orderly Ukraine's exports and pursue unified and  CIS-co-ordinated pricing-export policies, as well as to ensure a  more regular flow of hard currency to the state budget.    The Cabinet resolution approved a list of organisations and  agencies, which were thus authorized to act as Ukraine's  exporters of certain commodities.    On 5 March and 26 April 1994 the list was substantially  complemented.    According to Valentin Kulichenko, deputy minister for  industry, these "special exporters" charged from 0.5 to 5 per  cent of the contract-specified amounts of export proceeds. As  Mr. Kulichenko maintains, all the "special exporters"  transferred their currency accounts to the Ukrainian  Export-Import Bank by the first quarter's close.    Meanwhile, as observers believe, the Decree was issued under  pressure brought to bear by certain commercial (that is,  nongovernment-owned) structures, which used to deal in metals,  other raw materials and products before the special exporter  institute was introduced.    So, formally from now on, any juridical person, who  possesses  enough means, may buy export quotas at auctions held by the  Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. However, as experts  maintain, quota acquisition is not at all tantamount to a  quota's factual application, since certain structures are  obviously in a very good position to block the quota application  process.    Besides, according to information furnished by the Industry  Ministry, last year, none of Ukraine's exporter-manufacturers  were able to fully realize their quotas. In particular, about  10 million tons of metals failed to be exported under the issued  quotas.    Thus, as analysts insist, Ukraine's export quota market is  doomed to remain shared among the very same old and  long-established influential groups. [passage omitted]</p>

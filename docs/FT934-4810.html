			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After the Budget: Portillo committed to lower taxes Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday restated his rightwing credentials in the wake of the Budget by setting out his commitment to lower taxation. Mr Portillo, a long-standing opponent of tax increases, was taunted by Labour MPs during a debate on the chancellor's decision to increase taxes by Pounds 1.7bn next year. He said the government was determined to keep 'the most fundamental promise of all, and that is to deliver sound public finances'. Mr Portillo said it was essential for the government to reduce the burden of debt interest payments and pave the way for lower taxation 'in due course'. He reminded Conservative backbenchers that Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe delivered a tax-raising Budget in 1981, which provided a base for the economic recovery of the mid-1980s. 'I share the chancellor's judgment about the speed at which he reduces the public sector borrowing requirement,' he said. 'I congratulate him that he has been able to achieve the reduction he seeks with so much emphasis on the control of public spending and so little on the raising of taxes, particularly in the year ahead.' Mr Portillo said that sustained lower taxation could be achieved only through improved competitiveness, which required a fall in public spending as a proportion of national income. 'We must reduce the proportion of national income that is spent by the government,' he said. 'The chancellor has pointed the way in which that is going to be achieved.' Mr Portillo also dismissed Opposition claims that the Budget arithmetic depended on 'smoke and mirrors' to balance government revenue and expenditure. He told Labour MPs: 'We are taking serious action to put right the problem. You continue to pretend that no serious action needs to be taken.'</p>

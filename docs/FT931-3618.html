			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Chancellor's opportunity THE BUDGET that will be delivered by Norman Lamont will be historic, regardless of its content. It is to be the first of two due this year and the last in which decisions on public spending are to be separate from those on revenue. The question is whether what it contains will be worthy of the stature historians are bound to accord it. The chancellor does, in fact, enjoy a great opportunity, something that few may now believe after a recession that has lasted two and a half years. Yet a chapter of accidents has given the UK an excellent chance for sustained non-inflationary, export-led growth. What has created this opportunity? First, an ERM-induced monetary policy tighter than any the UK is likely to have sustained on its own has pushed UK underlying inflation - including its most important determinant, pay inflation - towards levels not seen for a generation. Second, an abrupt, unwanted, but fortuitous exit from the ERM has left sterling at a competitive level. Third, the rapid deterioration in the performance of the continental economies should lead to lower interest rates and so allow the UK to sustain an aggressive monetary policy, without serious risk to the exchange rate. Finally, the debt overhang has ended the damaging conflict of the 1980s between the interest rates needed for domestic monetary control and those allowing a tolerably competitive exchange rate. Different views How should the government exploit its opportunity? One thing it should not do, as probably it knew all along, is pay too much attention to its panel of seven wise men. It is not just that they have radically different views of how the economy works. It is rather that from past experience their recommendations are most likely to be wrong where there is the greatest agreement. In this case, the most likely mistake is the consensus of six out of the seven that tax increases, even if needed, should be postponed. The fundamental question is whether the UK possesses a large structural fiscal deficit. The chances are that it has one of 5 per cent of gross domestic product or more. If so, either tax increases or radical curbs on spending will be required to prevent an ultimately explosive increase in public debt. Such an explosion is not merely a threat for the distant future. The fear that it could happen is also likely to limit what could be the most valuable single development of the next several years, namely, a sustained reduction in the nominal interest rate on long-term bonds. Nascent recovery The good reason for postponing tax increases is fear of what they might do to the nascent recovery. That may be a reason for delaying introduction of tax increases until 1994-95, but the intention to make those adjustments needs to be announced now, which may itself rob the postponement of its benefits. The case for postponement has, in any case, been weakened by exit from the ERM, which allows any adverse effects of tax increases, almost certainly exaggerated by unreconstructed Keynesians, to be offset by a sufficiently aggressive monetary policy. The job of the chancellor is to convince the markets that tax increases or spending cuts equivalent to a fiscal adjustment of at least 3 per cent of GDP will be introduced over at most the next two years. It is also to introduce changes in the tax system that would reduce its distorting effects on the economy. It would be wonderful if the chancellor managed to combine the needed credible commitment to fiscal rebalancing with imaginative tax reform. But it may be too much to ask for. One member of the Treasury's panel of forecasters has argued that an outcome of less than 1 per cent growth this year would be a 'disaster'. This exaggeration does much to explain the persistent instability of British macroeconomic policy, which has, in turn, done so much damage to the British economy. What would, indeed, be a disaster is for the present opportunity for sustained growth to be frittered away in yet another unsustainable expansion, followed by a deeply damaging recession later in the 1990s. Even the UK should be able to learn from past failures. The time to show it has done so is now.</p>

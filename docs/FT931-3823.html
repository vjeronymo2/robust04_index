			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Books: Master of patriotic verse - This biography reinstates the true value of Tennyson's poetry TENNYSON by Peter Levi Macmillan Pounds 20, 370 pages SLIGHTLY more than 100 years ago, in October 1892, Tennyson had the biggest, most public funeral of any English poet - a spectacular ceremonial in Westminster Abbey with survivors of the Light Brigade lining the aisle. It was an appropriate final tribute to a poet whose work had penetrated every literate household in the land. What other poem has ever become so inextricably interwoven with history and national pride as The Charge of the Light Brigade? When the Duke of Wellington died, Tennyson (who had been appointed Poet Laureate two years earlier in 1850 on the death of Wordsworth) wrote: 'Bury the Great Duke/ With an empire's lamentation,/ Let us bury the Great Duke/ To the noise of the mourning of a mighty nation . . .' It was an Ode in which Tennyson gave robust patriotic expression to the Victorian moral outlook in the famous couplet: 'Not once or twice in our fair island-story,/ The path of duty was the way to glory . . .' Most of the time today we apprehend poetry, when we bother with it at all, privately, almost secretly, through the eyes, listening to the sound of the words only with the mind's ear. That is quite different from the way Tennyson and his contemporaries listened to poetry. For them it was read aloud regularly as part of general and parlour entertainment. Tennyson's contemporary Browning perfected the notion of a poem as a histrionic monologue. Even a poem-sequence stemming from a deep sense of personal loss like In Memoriam was conceived in terms of public utterance. Peter Levi, a poet himself, is highly sensitive to this aspect of Tennyson. and reminds us of it when commenting on the poems. His biography of the poet comes in the wake of several previous ones in recent years, such as Robert Bernard Martin's Tennyson: The Unquiet Heart (1983) and Michael Thorn's Tennyson (reviewed here last year). There have also been published during the past decade three volumes of The Letters of Alfred Tennyson and in 1969 there was a truly complete edition of the poetry with copious biographical notes on each poem edited by Christopher Ricks. The basic facts, then, are not in dispute and Levi has no tremendous revelations to unfold. His fresh light arises from his more erudite discoveries - a copy of the Post Homerica of Quintus of Smyrna inscribed in Greek (by Arthur Hallam he surmises) to Tennyson and providing him with the source for the sequel to Oenone. We read once more of the poet's upbringing as the fourth son of a drunken Lincolnshire rector, and of his attendance at Louth Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was one of the earliest members of the Apostles debating society. He went down from the university with the Chancellor's Gold Medal for his poem Timbuctoo but without a degree. He made his poetic debut in 1827 in the slim volume, Poems by Two Brothers, a joint venture with his sibling Charles. Then in 1830 came Poems, Chiefly Lyrical of which he was the sole author. It was cruelly savaged by that notorious literary hatchet-man of the period JW Croker - 'Croaker', Levi aptly calls him - in the Quarterly Review. And as if this was not enough misery, a tragic blow followed when an urgent letter from abroad informed Tennyson that his great Cambridge friend Hallam (who was engaged to be married to his sister Emily) had died of apoplexy in Vienna. Levi discounts the view taken afterwards by Tennyson that, had his other friends not supported him at this time of crisis with their praise of his work, he would have given up poetry altogether. In the event he began In Memoriam soon after his friend's death and he continued to draft poems treating of the legends of Camelot. Levi dates the emergence of Tennyson as a great poet to this period. For those of us who belong to a generation whose taste for Tennyson was systematically poisoned, first by reading TS Eliot's complaint that he 'ruminated' tediously, and then by the strictures of FR Leavis, the deeply-felt responses in this book are a pleasingly corrective experience. Levi rates the song 'Tears, idle tears' as a 'sad and perfect lyric'. That was the very poem Leavis made the spearhead of his attack, contrasting it, much to its disadvantage, with a more poised poem of regret by DH Lawrence. But Levi discriminates too. He suggests that The Idylls of the King are fatally flawed and most of them should be read quickly if at all. He feels that the best part of The Princess is the Prologue, with its description of an open day in summer in the grounds of Park House for the members of the Maidstone Mechanics Institute. (The funfair scenes in Ken Russell's recent and notorious production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Princess Ida were ultimately derived from this instance of Tennyson's descriptive skill). The plays Levi regards as more or less unreadable and certainly unperformable; but he thinks that Maud (severely panned by George Eliot when it first appeared) is 'a powerfully impressive poem'. He finds in it 'a very full and fully sexual expression of love, which as a younger and unmarried man Tennyson could not have written (there he differs from Tolstoy)'. It is these bizarre throwaway comparisons that have such a salutary effect on the reader; like the book as a whole, they send one straight back to the poems.</p>

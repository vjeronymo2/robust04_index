If heating continues after ventilation has been discontinued, carbon dioxide or the inert gas required under paragraph (f) of this section must be introduced into the hold; except, if the seed cake is solvent extracted, the use of inert gas must not be introduced until fire is apparent to avoid the possibility of igniting the solvent vapors by the generation of static electricity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Seed cake must be carried in accordance with the terms of a Special Permit issued by the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH) in accordance with subpart B of this part if_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The oil was mechanically expelled; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) It contains more than 10% vegetable oil or more than 20% vegetable oil and moisture combined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) This part does not apply to solvent extracted rape seed meal pellets or soya bean meal that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Contains not more than 4% vegetable oil and not more than 15% vegetable oil and moisture combined; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) As far as reasonably practicable, is free from flammable solvent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;148.315 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Sulfur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) This part applies to sulfur in the form of lumps or coarse-grain powder only.

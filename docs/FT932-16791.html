			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The thin blue line that divides Cambodia's killers: Nicholas Woodsworth sees how the United Nations - and the Royal Navy - are trying to keep the warring factions under control THERE IS an old floating cinema, made of wood and perched on a raft of bamboo trunks, that sits anchored at the slow-swirling mouth of the Tonle Sap lake in central Cambodia. Potted palms remain at either side of the landing bay where film-goers used to tie up. But the seats have been removed and the projectionist has found work elsewhere: the place is under new management. On top of the cinema's tin roof, now gleaming white, the letters 'UN' have been painted in figures 6ft high. If you stand on the old cinema's roof terrace, where a blue United Nations' flag flies beside a Union Jack, you might think terra firma had never existed. Now a military observer's naval patrol base, the floating building sits lost on a wide flood plain where there is little distinction between water and land. This is a world of backed-up lake and flooded forest, swampy islands, mirror-smooth creeks, and narrow channels of brown water that lose themselves in endless braids and kinks. It is low and green and an easy place in which to get lost. All life - plant, animal and human - has become amphibious. Just a stone's throw from the UN post, across a little inlet, begins the settlement of Chhnok Tru. A village of 5,000 people, it has the sort of amenities many back-country Cambodian towns lack: houses and hairdressers, hardware and vegetable markets, medical stores, motor repair shops, eating houses, temples, and bars. In spite of its size, Chhnok Tru is not marked on any maps. It cannot be, for the simple reason that it never stays put in any one place. Its houses are as mobile as the boats that cruise its main thoroughfares. An entire palm-thatched fishing community floating on bamboo, its location changes according to the season and the rise and fall of the monsoon-fed lake. Chhnok Tru is unusual for another reason. Half its population is ethnic Vietnamese. Some of these immigrants arrived after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979, toppled its brutal Khmer Rouge revolutionary government, and installed a regime controlled by Hanoi. Others, seeking jobs, living space and economic opportunity they cannot find in over-crowded Vietnam, have arrived only recently. Today all ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia are special targets for Khmer Rouge guerrillas who have made their repatriation one of the pre-conditions to participation in UN-sponsored initiatives for peace and democratic elections. In March, in the bloodiest massacre since the UN began peace-keeping operations here, 38 ethnic Vietnamese were gunned down by the Khmer Rouge in Phum Chong Keas, another floating village on the Tonle Sap 75 kms from Chhnok Tru. What are UN peacekeepers up against in Cambodia? Seen from the capital, Phnom Penh, UN operations here are a confused tangle of accusations and counter-accusations. All too often, critics say, bureaucratic unwieldiness, a lack of long-term perspective and the demands of political compromise have sapped the UN's will to enforce a difficult mandate. I went to Chhnok Tru to see what it was like, not for the administrator in his office but for the peacekeeper on the ground - or, rather, the water. Seen from a boat deck on the Tonle Sap, Cambodia's problems take on a different dimension. BRITAIN'S Royal Navy has employed a bizarre fleet of water craft over the 12 months it has taken part in UN peace-keeping exercises in Cambodia. In this sector of its operations, it has collected an old Vietnamese military landing craft that looks like a steel shoe-box; two Russian 'Kanos' - cabin cruiser-size, water-impelled jet boats that roar along in a stink of diesel; and a nippy new runabout that slaps across the water with a 70 horse-power engine at its stern. But most of the work of the Royal Navy military observers here is done in little 10ft Zodiac inflatable dinghies. They are not quite as toy-like as they seem; flat-bottomed and fast, they can negotiate the shallow channels, strong currents and the thousand surface-suspended fishing nets that make boating here such a tricky business. It was into one of these craft that I piled with several British sailors one evening after I had arrived at 'Tango Hotel,' the call-sign of the floating UN post. Our destination, 'Whisky Hotel,' lay not far away among the boats of Chhnok Tru. Whisky Hotel is pretty much what it says it is: a bar. The beer is cold, the lighting dim, the music acceptable and the service comes with a smile. If you smile back, the Vietnamese women who run it will spend entire evenings shelling for you the dishes of dried watermelon seeds that come with the drinks. I was more or less prepared for the slight bobbing motion of the floating bar. I was not unnerved by the sudden list it took when we seated ourselves to one side of the room. Nor was I fazed by the water that began lapping at our feet under our table. But I was not prepared for the company that, soon after, sat down at a table opposite us. CHHNOK TRU sits just below the bottom end of a large salient of Khmer Rouge-controlled territory that tapers down from the borders of northern Cambodia. This is an uneasy area of banditry, intimidation, extortion of the weak, and a continuing low-level war between two of Cambodia's four warring factions: CPAF, the ragged army of the Phnom Penh government, and the NADK, the forces of the Khmer Rouge. Here, just about everyone - uniformed soldiers, village militiamen, provincial government officials, Cambodian fishermen, Vietnamese immigrants - goes about their business armed. The CPAF soldiers who boarded the bar seemed as threatening as the boat in which they arrived. It was narrow, low-slung and fast. Long pipes and intake valves protruded from an uncovered engine that might have been winched out of a '56 Chevy. It looked like something dreamed up by an American teenage garage mechanic with a weekend sideline in hot rods. Only the tripod-mounted light machine-gun at the bow hinted at more serious intent. The soldiers swaggered in, dropped two AK-47 Kalashnikovs on the table and started serious work on a bottle of Mekong whiskey. I felt less than comfortable, but I had not reckoned with the professional skills of 28-year-old Royal Marine leading hand David Leng. A handshake, a few words of kitchen Cambodian and soon he was spinning the chambers of .38 German-made revolver the smiling CPAF men brought out for him to admire. Leng and the other men at Tango Hotel have an easy-going nonchalance that veils a good amount of self-discipline and level-headedness. Both qualities are much needed around Chhnok Tru. A large part of the UN military observer's exercise here is two-way diplomacy: getting to know and inspire confidence in two sides without appearing to favour either one. It is the only way unarmed observers can hope to stand between adversaries and try to create an atmosphere of reconciliation without getting shot at. In reality, it is rarely that simple. The week before I arrived, Lt Cmdr Alex Manning, senior officer at Tango Hotel, cruised northward up the Stoeng Sen river from Chhnok Tru. He was attempting to deliver a letter inviting the local Khmer Rouge commander to friendly discussions with the UN. The Khmer Rouge not only took the letter, but him as well. Release came only after three long and uncertain days. The 10 UN observers at Chhnok Tru - seven Britons of the navy and marines, two Filipinos and a Chilean - get on with a job as best they can. Over the next few days, I accompanied them on the missions that make up a steady routine of difficult and sometimes risky work. Using the Kanos, we travelled to an isolated village 30 miles up the vast Tonle Sap lake to assist in voter registration, a preliminary to UN-supervised elections planned for May. In the Zodiacs, we patrolled backwaters and narrow channels, visited local militias, dropped in on government posts, talked to fishermen, inspected cargoes, and trailed along behind river-boats where plump, Buddha-like captains sat smiling behind their machine-guns. THE MEN OF the Royal Navy are thorough professionals. They complain neither about difficult local conditions nor the political decisions made by the UN leadership in Phnom Penh and New York. But no one can avoid seeing that, by the nature of the mandate handed to them, many of the 20,000 UN personnel in Cambodia find their work frustrating and ineffective. There is a strong sense on the ground that the leadership of Untac - the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia - has taken too conciliatory a stance, not just with the Khmer Rouge but with all violators of the Cambodian cease-fire and peace accords signed in 1991. One soldier I met at a UN post south of Chhnok Tru put it bluntly: 'The UN is doing a crap job. What we should be doing is taking guns away from the nobbers who are shooting people. But all we are allowed to do is request them to voluntarily surrender their arms. It is like going up to a bear and politely asking him for his honey.' The failure of the arms containment plan agreed on by Cambodia's factions is just one of the frustrations. Cruise up any waterway around Chhnok Tru and you will find some of the other problems faced every day by ordinary Cambodians. At riverside military check-points, CPAF soldiers demand money from travellers. In the maze of fishing nets out on the lake, corrupt government administrators extort both catches and money from fishermen. Phnom Penh officials arrive every four or five days to relieve residents of floating villages of much of their earnings. In some areas, villagers have to pay off not only CPAF but the Khmer Rouge as well. The levels of extortion are so high that many Cambodians seem not to care about which political group controls them - only about how much they have to be paid. IN SPITE of the fact that such armed intimidation falls under a UN mandate for the enforcement of human rights, there is often little military observers can do. The Khmer Rouge refuses the UN access to its areas. Elsewhere, incidents can be noted, names taken, serial numbers of arms recorded. But in a situation of growing unrest and factional violence, effective civilian government has been all but obliterated. No doubt UN-supervised elections will take place at some future date. But none of this bodes well for their free-ness or fairness, nor for political stability in their aftermath. But the Royal Navy at Chhnok Tru never says die. On the last day of my stay, a week after he had been detained on the Stoeng Sen, Alex Manning took David Leng and me up the river again to investigate Khmer Rouge advances on CPAF-held territory. We arrived minutes after Khmer Rouge soldiers had rocketed a CPAF front-line post. While a CPAF river patrol boat moved up its own Russian B-10 rocket launcher, soldiers in ragged shirts and flip-flops huddled on the riverbank cradling grenade launchers. But we saw no fighting; the Khmer Rouge had melted back into the bush. What can be done to stop sporadic guerrilla attacks in south-east Asia (or, indeed, full-scale battles in south-east Europe)? Regardless of their best intentions, UN forces in Cambodia can be only as effective as their own leadership and the adversaries involved will allow them to be. We asked questions, took notes, and listened to protests that it was the other side that had started it first. Then we headed back down the winding, green river to Chhnok Tru.</p>

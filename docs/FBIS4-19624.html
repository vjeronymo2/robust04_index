			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has called on Britain  to reassert its economic presence in Asia. Mr. Goh said British  businesses had a long relationship with Asia and it would be  ironic if Britain is seen in the future as a lesser player in  the growing Asian economy.    Speaking in London at a banquet hosted by its lord mayor,  Mr.  Goh said Singapore and Britain have of late, emphasized  different priorities. He noted Britain is reorientated towards  Europe and Singapore towards its ASEAN neighbors.    Mr. Goh said if this trend continues, the historical ties  may  loosen and this will not be to their advantage. The prime  minister said in Asia, Britain enjoys a clear comparative  advantage over many of its European partners. Its economic  presence in Singapore and Hong Kong is substantial. Mr. Goh  assured British investors that Singapore provides ready platform  for British companies to launch their business interests in Asia.    In his address the lord mayor of London, (Paul Neil), called  on Singapore companies and investors to plan for the new and  large European markets. He said Singapore and Britain share  impeccable credentials of free trading nations.</p>

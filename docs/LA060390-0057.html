			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ART FOR RENT IN MUSEUM'S BARGAIN BASEMENT;  </P> <P> A LACMA GALLERY HELPS STRUGGLING ARTISTS BY MAKING IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR  PEOPLE TO RENT OR BUY THEIR ORIGINAL WORKS  </P> <P> Every week people walk out of the basement of the Los Angeles County Museum of  Art with original pieces of contemporary art -- and security does nothing to  stop them. Some will keep the works in their homes or offices for months;  others will keep them permanently.  </P> <P> Don't sound the alarm. It's all the work of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, a  little-known showcase hidden away under the museum's Anderson Building, a place  better known for its cafeteria. Created almost 30 years ago as part of the Arts  Museum Council, this busy office and gallery displays, rents and sells  contemporary art created by more than 250 Los Angeles-area artists it  represents.  </P> <P> "We are expanding the art base of the city by showing all kinds of the people  in Los Angeles that it's possible to support contemporary art," said Terri  Smooke, current director of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery. "We're showing  people how to live with art."  </P> <P> Acting as an independent gallery within the museum, the gallery has three  goals: exposing emerging artists, making original art more affordable to the  general public and raising money for the county museum's acquisitions fund. The  gallery organizes five exhibits each year, showcasing the work of five artists  each time. Each exhibit hangs for five weeks.  </P> <P> Despite the unimpressive amount of space -- the program occupies a basement  hallway, where exhibits hang, and one small office -- Smooke said the gallery  brings in more than $500,000 a year.  </P> <P> But Smooke and the rest of her all-volunteer staff stress the importance of  launching new talent into the L.A. art world. The Art Rental and Sales Gallery  often provides the best option for struggling artists.  </P> <P> "We accept only those artists who are not part of the formal gallery system,"  or don't have any official representation, said Smooke, adding that many of the  artists who are chosen have eventually been picked up by established galleries.  </P> <P> Besides giving much-needed exposure to little-known talents, the gallery also  presents an opportunity for the beginning collector. With rental prices ranging  from $15 to $110 for two months (works can be rented only on a bimonthly  basis), museum members of almost any income range can afford to take home an  original work. Non-members can purchase pieces outright, but cannot rent. All  they have to do is walk into the office and ask to see what's available.  </P> <P> "We're talking the American system here," Smooke said. "Our work isn't priced  like David Hockney and Frank Stella. Almost any person can rent art and keep it  for as long as they would like, or ultimately purchase the art because the  payments apply to the purchase."  </P> <P> According to Smooke, the renters come from all age groups and backgrounds, with  the only common denominator being museum membership and a desire to experiment  with art.  </P> <P> "Some people see something in a show and they fall in love with it. Others  simply want to make their living or work spaces more attractive. They want to  enrich their surroundings," she said.  </P> <P> "Our niche in the community is to try and help those people who aren't in the  regular art market yet," said Susan Franklin, co-chairman of the five-member  Exhibitions Committee of the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, the group that  chooses the artists who appear in the gallery shows.  </P> <P> Partly because it is under the aegis of the county museum, the gallery is able  to pay 75% of the rental and purchase fee directly to the artists. The gallery  keeps the other 25%. So besides having their work see the light of day, new  artists can also reap immediate financial benefits from the program.  </P> <P> "It's brought me a regular check every month," says artist Stuart Saks, who was  part of a show last spring and currently has eight pieces on rent. "It's a  wonderful program. It's an entry-level process for beginning artists."  </P> <P> Marjorie Sievers had her work displayed in a show that ran in February and says  that money isn't the only benefit of participating in the program.  </P> <P> "People see the announcement, and they say, 'Gosh, the county museum. How  wonderful!' They don't think of it based in a hallway," she said.  </P> <P> Sievers, who saw four of her five paintings on aluminum rented the first night  of her show, sees an added advantage in the location of the gallery.  </P> <P> "All kinds of people, all the collectors, go down to the basement because  that's where the curators and all the office personnel are," Sievers said.  "Some big-time art dealers will see your work down there."  </P> <P> The gallery is divided into three separate areas that work together to choose,  store and distribute the art. The Exhibitions Committee handles submissions by  artists and refers artists to the Rental Division. This division actually  processes the rental art from the tiny office where as many as 150 pieces are  stored.  </P> <P> The third area, the Corporate Division, rents art to businesses.  </P> <P> "Exhibition is really the center, the heart of this program," Smooke said.  "That's where we get our credibility in the artists' community because they  understand that this is a serious gallery. It's not just a money-making  venture."  </P> <P> Franklin and her co-chairman Nancy Freedman look for artists doing something  novel. "We are looking for artists who are doing something different, something  we haven't seen before, maybe a little bit on the cutting edge. We are  interested in serious work, art that may be a little bit tough for people,"  says Franklin, who receives about eight to 10 submissions per week. "We don't  want the kind of stuff you see at neighborhood sidewalk art shows. It's beyond  craft."  </P> <P> After the committee members decide which applicants interest them, they make  studio visits. Sometimes they return two or three times before choosing an  artist for a show.  </P> <P> "We try to put together a mixture. We show photography, dimensional work,  abstract work -- a real eclectic mix," Franklin said.  </P> <P> According to Franklin, who is in her second year of heading the committee (the  council alternates chairmanships every two years), positions on the Exhibitions  Committee are the most coveted in the Art Rental and Sales Gallery, mostly  because its members are the bearers of good news.  </P> <P> "When you call the artists and tell them they've been accepted, it's a little  bit like that old TV show, 'The Millionaires,' " Franklin said.  </P> <P> But even an artist's works that are considered unsuitable for exhibition are  often passed down to the Rental Division. Doris Gamson, who heads the Rental  Division, says the goal is to collect a variety of high-quality art that still  maintains a wide appeal.  </P> <P> "We'll keep an artist's work on hand for five years. We hope that after five  years, they'll be a little more self-sufficient," Gamson said.  </P> <P> The more work the better, said Gamson, who sees more renters now than ever.  Currently there are about 450 people who rent art from the gallery. "We're  getting more popular lately. An average of about 15 to 20 renters a week come  in to look at the art. Before holidays, we have them lined up waiting to get  in."  </P> <P> The Corporate Division operates much like the Rental Division, except the  corporate renters are required to keep work for six-month increments, and at  least one employee of the corporation must be a museum member. For a $100  consultation fee -- which is credited as a donation to the museum -- a  representative of the Corporate Division will advise the company on how to best  utilize its space.  </P> <P> At any given time, the Corporate Division is working with a minimum of 50  companies, Gamson said. "And that can range from five pieces to 50 pieces per  job."  </P> <P> Gamson estimated that 20% of all renters end up purchasing the works, but most  return the art after the initial two months.  </P> <P> "You might get somebody that picks something that they think they're mad about  today, and in two months they'll change their minds," Gamson said. "Our biggest  individual renter has 60 pieces out now. He sees so many he likes here in the  office, but then they'll end up under his bed. Every once in a while he'll  bring one of them back."  </P> <P> It's this luxury of relatively painless financial risk that attracts a lot of  inexperienced art lovers into starting collections.  </P> <P> For years, Larry Layne, a San Fernando Valley real estate developer, considered  purchasing art, but with an educational background in business and science, he  felt ill-equipped to deal directly with galleries.  </P> <P> "I found the concept of walking into a gallery intimidating," said Layne. "I  didn't want to take a financial gamble on something I didn't feel comfortable  with."  </P> <P> Four years ago, Layne rented his first piece from the Art Rental and Sales  Gallery. Today he has 30 rented works hanging in his office and his Marina del  Rey home. He has purchased four.  </P> <P> "I learned how I felt about art and how long a piece would own my interest,"  Layne said. "I've learned a lot about art criticism from the staff at the  gallery.  </P> <P> "Who knows how long it would have taken me to feel comfortable buying art?"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Negotiations in Hanoi have confirmed that both  sides are willing to deepen their bilateral cooperation,  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko -- who is currently  on an official visit there -- has said today at a press  conference. This has been the first visit to Hanoi by the head  of Ukraine's foreign policy department since the two countries  established diplomatic relations. Vietnam holds an important  place in our foreign political and economic interests, Zlenko  emphasized at the press conference. Ukraine is aware that  relations with Vietnam are promising and mutually beneficial.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, June 5 (XINHUA) -- More than 500 joint  ventures with a total overseas investment of nearly 300 million  U.S. dollars, have been set up in the Yimeng Mountains area in  east China's Shandong Province.    Most of the investors come from Hong Kong and Taiwan and  some  from European and North American countries.    One of the revolutionary bases of China and consisting of  seven counties, the Yimeng Mountains area is economically  backward compared with the coastal areas because of geographical  reasons.    But it is rich in workers as well as agricultural and  mineral  products, such as peanuts, silk, chestnuts, walnuts, ginkgo,  apples, pears, hawthorn, limestone, marble, diamonds, borax,  gold, silver, copper and iron.    To attract more overseas investment, the province has poured  a great amount of money into infrastructure construction in the  area.    In recent years, the province has built a railway and a  highway cutting through the mountain area. Program-controlled  telephones have linked all the counties in the area with the  national telecommunications system.    A local airport is also being expanded there.</p>

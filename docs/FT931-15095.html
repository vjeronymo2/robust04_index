			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Middle East tension adds to struggles in US Treasury market US TREASURY prices firmed across the board yesterday as the market, still struggling with the weight of new corporate supply, anticipated a flight to government securities in the wake of the Middle East crisis. At the close, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 102 1/16 , yielding 7.445 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was slightly firmer, up  1/16 at 100 11/32 , to yield 4.422 per cent. In early trading Treasuries were weaker, especially in the middle of the yield curve, as dealers marked prices down ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 9.75bn of seven-year notes, which was completed at an average yield of 6.41 per cent. Continued worries about the impact on the market of the steady flow of corporate bond issues also contributed to the early declines. Some investors were comforted by the fact that the market absorbed Dollars 6.5bn of corporate debt on Tuesday without inflicting serious damage on prices. The market rebounded strongly after the White House confirmed that the US military and allied forces had launched an attack on Iraq. The buying was on the assumption that in times of international political crisis, domestic and overseas investors look to US assets, and short-dated US government securities in particular, as a temporary safe haven. UK government bonds closed higher as investors bought at the higher yield levels. The Liffe futures contract rose from 99.13 to 99.26 by late afternoon on volume of about 24,000 contracts. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 118 21/32 to 118 31/32 to yield 8.85 per cent. Dealers said domestic investors were tempted to buy as yields had risen to relatively attractive levels after Tuesday's fall in the gilt market. The gilt market fell back on Tuesday on news that the Bank of England will hold a gilt auction on January 27. NEW supply and heavy selling combined to depress German government bond prices across the yield curve yesterday. The Liffe bund future contract, which opened at 92.88, traded in a range of 92.76 to 92.91 before ending the day at around 92.80. News that the postal authority sold DM2.87bn of notes at tender depressed prices. The auction of six-year notes raised DM2.87bn at an average price of 98.84 and an average yield of 6.99 per cent. Dealers added that several German banks were thought to have sold five-year notes yesterday, after buying the paper earlier in the week at the time of the launch of Italy's DM bond issue. Bunds showed little reaction to GNP data which showed a slowdown in the economy last year. The statistics office said that west German GNP rose 0.8 per cent in 1992 after a rise of 3.6 per cent in 1991. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, said in a speech that the main priority for monetary policy remained to limit inflation, but he added, 'that does not rule out all leeway for the Bundesbank's monetary policy'. Dealers said the Bundesbank took the market by surprise by adding a net DM6.6bn in liquidity into the domestic banking system through a tender of securities repurchase funds, when a slight drain of funds had been expected. FRENCH government bonds edged higher across the yield curve, helped by the franc's relative firmness in the foreign exchange markets. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 moved from 8.04 per cent to 8.02 per cent by late afternoon as the franc strengthened from 3.3965 to the D-Mark to 3.3890. JAPANESE government bonds soared to new highs, but the gains were wiped out by reports that President Bush planned to launch an attack on Iraq and both the cash and futures markets ended the day slightly lower as a result. Dealers said the market opened on a strong note, following on from Tuesday's rally and encouraged by the weak stock market and strong buying interest from institutions. The March futures contact, which opened at 108.80, rallied to a high of 109.08, the highest level for the leading contract in nearly five years. However, after profit-taking the futures contract fell back to end at 108.73. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.44 per cent and moved to 4.41 per cent, before ending at 4.45 per cent.</p>

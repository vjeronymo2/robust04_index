			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: A Rite to remember - Concert There are conductors - almost a majority, these days - who act out the music, and others who just conduct it. Pierre Boulez is one of the latter. With the London Symphony at the Barbican on Sunday, his chosen programme would have inspired many another maestro to strenuous histrionics: Schoenberg's expressionist Five Orchestral Pieces, the athletic First Piano Concerto of Bartok, Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Boulez found it sufficient to give small, precise indications to his superbly rehearsed players; watching him on a silent film, you could hardly have guessed what kind of music he was conducting, but the audible results were magnificent. Schoenberg's 1909 pieces were his first atonal foray with orchestra. Ingenious conductors can dress them in shot-silk hues, to make them more audience-friendly, or administer violent shocks to keep everybody on their toes. Boulez did neither, but kept their own strange colours dry and lucid: one heard much more of the inner workings than usual, with a great gain in cogency. The effect was to convey an uncommonly wide range of expression, not just expressionism. The original force of the music was recaptured with authority. With Daniel Barenboim as a powerful soloist, the Bartok concerto began sternly and roughly. The pianist's motor-driven octaves splashed a bit, and he allowed himself so much sustaining-pedal as to blot and thicken some passages in the first Allegro where a tight, unambiguous pulse should guide the ear. With the slow movement, however, Barenboim collected himself for his concentrated best (with some beautiful wind-playing, too), and thereafter the performance was a model of intensity. As for the Rite, Boulez and the splendid LSO gave it a memorable re-creation. Any good account of this work should leave a potent impression, but this conductor's grasp of the score is probably unequalled now. Not only did it sound fabulous - and authentic, without extra colouristic tricks or wilful sideslips; it was paced with a sovereign confidence that betokened long, searching attention to Stravinsky's construction, and carried the music inexorably forward to the last cataclysm. The audience was wholly gripped: exciting Rites are not so rare, but only once or twice in a decade are we made to hear what a towering masterpiece it is. Sponsored by JVC</p>

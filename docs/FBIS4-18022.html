			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Report on Results of Signing of </F> Treaty on Social Accord 28 April 1994"]    [Text] The Treaty on Social Accord was signed by 245 of  the 248 participants in the Assembly.    The following did not sign the Treaty:    N.Ye. Vinogradov -- chairman of Vladimir Oblast Legislative  Assembly;    A.M. Tuleyev -- chairman of Kemerovo Oblast Legislative  Assembly;    G.A. Zyuganov -- chairman of the "Communist Party of the  Russian Federation" faction.    The following signed the Treaty with reservations:    M.Sh. Shaymiyev -- president of the Republic of Tatarstan;    A.Kh. Galazov -- president of the Republic of North Ossetia;    Yu.G. Biragov -- chairman of the Republic of North Ossetia  Supreme Soviet;    F.Kh. Mukhametshin -- chairman of the Republic of Tatarstan  Supreme Soviet;    V.Ye. Veshnyakov -- chairman of Chita Oblast Duma;    N.M. Semenenko -- chairman of the Medical Workers Trade  Union;    M.A. Voroshilov -- cochairman of the Russian Metal Workers  Trade Union;    V.V. Shulga -- cochairman of the Russian Trade Union of  Drivers and Urban Transport Personnel.    The republic leaders' reservations generally relate to the  Treaty's taking into consideration agreements concluded  previously as well as official amendments to the draft Treaty  submitted previously (Republic of Tatarstan). The leadership of  North Ossetia objects to the inclusion in the Treaty of a clause  regarding the creation of mechanisms to implement the Law on the  Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples.    The trade union leaders' reservations mainly boil down to  objections at the inclusion in the text of the Treaty of a  reference to the General Agreement for 1994.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean banana exporters seek clarification of EC regime BANANA EXPORTERS in the Caribbean have asked the region's governments to seek clarification from the European Community on several aspects of the new banana import arrangement which took effect last month. The exporters say there are many areas of the new arrangement which are causing them concern, and that they need to be assured that their industries are fully protected from factors such as natural disasters and price fluctuations. The EC's new banana import regime imposes a 2m tonnes-a-year quota on Latin American fruit. Imports within the quota will attract a duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 76) a tonne while those above that level will incur a duty of Ecu850 a tonne. The community's traditional suppliers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific group have access for the remainder of the EC's needs of about 1.5m tonnes per year. This fruit will pay no tariff. The Caribbean Banana Exporters Association has asked the region's governments to determine from the EC the factors allowing an increase in their quotas. 'The EC has allowed for quotas for the Latin American countries to increase as demand increases, but they have not, to date, allowed for our quotas to be increased,' said Mr Marshall Hall, the association's outgoing president. The exporters are also seeking a review of the distribution of national quotas. 'We are concerned that as far as the quotas which have been allocated to each of the Caribbean countries is concerned, there is no opportunity for a downturn in one country to be picked up by another country,' Mr Hall said. The EC is to be asked to treat the Caribbean countries as a cumulative quota-holder to allow shortfall in production in one country to be filled by another with surplus fruit. The association, which is made up of exporters from Belize, Dominica, Jamaica, St Lucia, Suriname and St Vincent, is also concerned about promised support for prices. They are contending that they will not be protected in the event that they cannot cover their production costs if prices for the fruit fall significantly. 'Although the community has talked about price support we have not been told how this will work,' Mr Hall said. Industry officials said that in the event of a fall in price or a natural disaster such as a hurricane, they could not depend on the community's Stabilisation of Export Earnings (Stabex) facility which was 'under pressure and does not have much money now.'</p>

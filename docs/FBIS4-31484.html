			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 7/6/1994 -- Tension has been  generated these last few days in Romanian political life by the  conflict between Greater Romania Party [PRM] Senator Corneliu  Vadim Tudor and organizations of December 1989 revolutionaries.  The series of mutual challenges expressed from the Senate floor  or from the street, climaxed with a statement made by the  senator who claimed to possess intelligence according to which  the parliamentary opposition was preparing together with those  organizations the assassination of Romania's president and the  establishment of monarchy.    Supporters of the Greater Romania Party and members of the  revolutionaries' organizations had an encounter near the Senate  house. Several leading dailies put the number of mobilized  forces at between 200 and 500 police and gendarmes to keep them  apart. No incident was however reported. "I think decency and  reason are needed" told the press Major-General Costica Voicu,  deputy chief of the General Police Inspectorate. He added that  "it is not the duty of police to check the information on the  assassination announced by the PRM leader" and that "this is up  to specially constituted institutions".    A press release from the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI]  issued yesterday afternoon reads: "The analysis of the operative  situation as well as the data we have in the reference domains  do not confirm for the near future the existence of real  intentions (or possibilities) of assassinating Romania's  president or restoring the monarchy". The release adds that  "the dissemination of such information, without sufficient  checking of their probability, causes useless confusion and  worry or, on the contrary, induce in the public opinion  disbelief in the seriousness of the allegation".</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: International rate pressures unsettle UK equities - Market report The surprise increase in base rates by a number of leading French banks and widespread disappointment across global markets with the outcome of the latest auction of German bunds provided the real trigger for a global slide in equity markets. London's equity market could not ignore such moves and came under pressure from the outset, eventually closing sharply lower after a session of thin and difficult trading. The French shift was preceded by a surprising retreat from Wall Street overnight and a stuttering performance by US equities at the US opening yesterday. Adding to Wall Street's discomfiture was slightly worrying economic data and renewed concerns over Mexico. At the close of trading, the FT-SE 100 index was at the day's lowest level, down 30.2 at 3,065.6. Second liners fared only marginally better, the FT-SE Mid 250 index ending the day 7.7 off at 3,498.4. Dealers said there was always an element of uncertainty in gilt/bond markets yesterday, and London had picked up the scent of trouble from the outset. UK gilts opened easier and moved progressively lower. One marketmaker pointed to the threat to French interests by terrorists from Algeria and the increasingly disturbing news from Russia. With the German bund auction said to have been badly received, there was only one way for international bonds to go. 'It looks very much now that the cycle of lower European interest has finally turned,' said an economist at one leading European bank in London. 'The chances of another reduction in German interest rates have virtually disappeared and the markets will have to cope with a period of stable German interest rates, which will be gently nudged upwards in the second half of the year,' he added. London began on a quiet note but down 14.4 at 3,081.4 in the wake of the poor performance by Wall Street overnight and the opening falls in gilts. A flurry of sizeable trades put through the market during the early part of the session caused some consternation around the City's dealing desks but these were eventually unveiled as 'bed and breakfast', or tax-related, deals and had little impact of prices. Thereafter, there was little institutional trading until mid-morning, when gilts turned off again, along with German bunds, triggering small pockets of selling pressure in equity leaders. The FT-SE 100 began to weaken in the run up to Wall Street's opening when it was down over 31 points. However, the US market came in level and began to edge higher, shrugging off news of slightly higher than expected leading indicators for November from the US. London staged a minor rally, reducing the fall in the FT-SE 100 to 22 points, but then fell as the market picked up the scent of a shift in French base rates. Senior marketmakers, although rattled by the sudden and unexpected move by the French banks, said it would be wrong to judge the mood of European markets on such a day; 'Dealing desks in London were only half-manned and no-one wanted to trade,' he said, adding that most big securities houses had already positioned themselves with level books going into the New Year. The expected surge of activity linked to over-the-counter option trades, specially tailored to client needs, failed to materialise. But many in the market are looking for a sudden burst of activity towards the close of trading this afternoon when derivatives traders are expected to try to influence some of the FT-SE 100's best and worst performers as the year comes to an end. Turnover, given a strong boost by 'bed and breakfast deals', accounting for turnover of some 74m shares, reached 426m shares.</p>

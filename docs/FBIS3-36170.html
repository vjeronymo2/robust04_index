Boris Yeltsin Dismisses Omsk  Mayor Yuriy Shoykhet and Cancels 20 March Mayoral Elections"]    [Text] On the eve of the dismissal, Omsk Oblast Governor  L. Polezhayev announced at a routine press conference his  decision to hold the Omsk mayoral elections 20 March. A week  has passed and the decree on the elections, already signed by  the governor, has not been published in the press. We have  learned that the likely mayoral candidates -- Yu. Shoykhet and  V. Obraztsov -- were persistently urged not to run, so as not to  impede the candidate whom the governnor wanted to see as mayor  of Omsk. Shoykhet and Obraztsov refused to accept these terms,  and this sealed the fate of both the mayor of Omsk and the  mayoral elections. Leonid Polezhayev flew to Moscow, met with  President Yeltsin and, according to the governor himself,  decided on the dismissal in the course of a conversation with  the head of state.    "A friend telephoned me round midnight and told me a piece  of  news that sounded like a practical joke," Yu. Shoykhet said.  "`Mayak' was reporting that Yeltsin had dismissed me for  'destabilizing the situation' and 'exceeding my powers.'"    The meticulous journalists at the press conference put some  very specific questions to Governor L. Polezhayev. Just what  constitutes a "destabilization of the situation," if there has  not ben a single strike in Omsk and the city has heat and the  cheapest food in Siberia? What exactly constitutes "exceeding  one's powers" if, according to the mayor of Omsk, there has not  been a single prosecutor's appeal against city administration  decisions? And, finally, why did he seek redress against a  mayor who had exceeded his powers not in the people's court but  in the president's office?    Polezhayev tried to get away with general phrases; he was  nervous, and finally stated that the main reason for Shoykhet's  dismissal was that the mayor of Omsk, who had run for the  Federal Assembly representing "Russia's Choice," had failed in  the election and had lost the voters' confidence. The answer  can hardly be said to have been successful....    Now it turns out that it was not the governor who deprived  Omsk people of their right to elect their mayor.... Polezhayev  was merely implementing the edict from President B. Yeltsin, who  deemed the election inexpedient. It was the president who took  the extreme action [kraynim okazalsya prezident].    Here is one more theory. Governor Polezhayev, skillfully  exploiting the political situation, has settled a personal score  with the mayor. These men have long been rivals. Shoykhet was  the first cooperative member in Omsk to set up a joint-stock  company with private capital. Then L. Polezhayev, as chairman  of the oblast soviet executive committee, set up the "Omskiy  Torgovyy Dom" [Omsk Trading House] Joint-Stock Company founded  by major monopoly state enterprises producing scarce goods such  as television sets, washing machines, tires.... Without  quitting as head of the oblast executive, Polezhayev became  president of the trading house. Small businesses were shocked.  In order to ship a tonne of condensed milk out of the oblast,  it was necessary to go all over to get permission from  Polezhayev's deputy. The trading house, naturally, had no  problems. There was a scandal. There followed a presidential  edict, under which Polezhayev was to have stood down as  president of the commercial structure. A deputies' commission  which exposed cases of the most basic kind of speculation in  state goods was silenced.    Last year the oblast inner soviet, on the initiative of  Governor L. Polezhayev, decided to end payments to the federal  budget. The next morning Mayor Shoykhet issued a radio  statement to Omsk people to the effect that Polezhayev and the  soviet were destroying Russia economically. On the basis of an  appeal by the oblast prosecutor, who had ruled the soviet  decision illegal, Shoykhet announced that the city would be  meticulous about paying its taxes.    A September-October session of the oblast administration  collegium decided to support the president. Shoykhet asked  bluntly whether that meant Rutskoy, who had taken the oath, or  Yeltsin. They took a vote -- Yeltsin won by a margin of two.  But in the Omsk newspapers the next day Yeltsin's name had been  dropped from the oblast administration decision. And that is  Polezhayev all over as a politician.    The story of the mayor of Omsk's dismissal brings to mind  some sad thoughts. The legal mechanisms for instituting  proceedings or removing someone from his job are not working,  but intrigues and telephone law are increasingly gaining ground.</p>

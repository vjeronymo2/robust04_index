			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  plans to offer an explicit apology to nations victimized by  Japan's war conduct next year when Japan commemorates the 50th  anniversary of its surrender in World War II, a top government  official said.    "Prime Minister Hata is considering putting an end to a fray  to alleviate all the troubles (surrounding Japan's war  reparation) by taking the opportunity on the 50th anniversary of  the end of World War II," the official said on condition of  anonymity.    Hata plans to resolve controversies involving redress for  former "comfort women," who were forced into prostitution by  Japan's Imperial Army before and during World War II, and  Japan's confiscation of postal savings of Taiwanese citizens  then under Japanese rule, he said.    Unpaid money that includes the postal savings deposited by  Taiwanese before and during World War II total 452.4 million  yen, according to a government estimate.    In a related development, Hata became the first Japanese  prime minister to meet with Korean and Philippine comfort women  Thursday [9 June]. The unofficial meeting was arranged in a  Diet corridor.    Hata also wants to arrange for a Diet resolution that Japan  will not invade other countries again and for various official  projects and ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary, he  said.    However, Japan remains reluctant to make any individual  reparation payments or to take "actions that could be a  substitute for the reparation," the official said.</p>

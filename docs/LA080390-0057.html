			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Court Rules in Boeing's Favor: The Washington state Supreme Court ruled that  the families of Japanese nationals who died in the crash of a Boeing 747 five  years ago in Japan cannot seek damages from the airplane manufacturer in U.S.  courts.  </P> <P> The ruling, if it stands, means all damage claims must be tried in Japanese  courts. The ruling was a major victory for Boeing Co. because high damage  awards are much harder to obtain in Japan. Boeing lost the liability portion of  the case earlier when a Superior Court judge said faulty repairs resulted in  cracks in the plane, which led to the crash.  </P></p>

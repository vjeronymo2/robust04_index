			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (3): Important issues still need to be tackled - The Economy ANGUISHED Filipinos often ask themselves why their country, which was once among the most prosperous in Asia, has been left behind by its rapidly developing south-east Asian neighbours. Several explanations spring to mind. The late President Ferdinand Marcos, overthrown in 1986, bequeathed a burdensome legacy of foreign debt and corruption and his supporters have undermined economic confidence by trying repeatedly to unseat President Corazon Aquino with a series of botched coup attempts. Mrs Aquino herself has failed to reduce the glaring inequalities between the mass of the Filipino people and the oligarchy of ruling families which dominates agriculture and business and which likes to protect local industrial ventures behind high tariff barriers. Above all, her government and the Congress have fallen prey to the temptation to bow to popular pressure at moments of crisis, first taking necessary decisions and then watering them down so much that they hardly do anything to address the original problem. Such tendencies are not new; earlier this century the flamboyant Filipino politician Manuel Quezon criticised his rival Sergio Osmena for taking politics too seriously. 'Our people do not understand that,' he said. 'They do not want it. All they want is to have the present problem solved, and solved with the least pain. That is all.' Given the Aquino administration's early failure to fulfil the hopes of its supporters, the reformist economic record of 1991 and early 1992 is somewhat surprising. Whereas most politicians use their 'honeymoon period' at the start of a term of office to give their citizens unpleasant economic medicine - and hope to reap the benefits of a healthy economy at election time - the Aquino Administration has done the opposite, letting the economy drift for the first few years and suddenly imposing necessary but unpopular measures shortly before the elections due in May. Part of the reason for this change of attitude was the realisation by the formidable economic team of Mr Jesus Estanislao, the ascetic finance minister, and Mr Jose Cuisia, the central bank governor, that the budget deficit, the trade deficit and inflation were threatening to run out of control in 1990. At the same time the International Monetary Fund has been withholding its seal of approval until financial discipline is restored. By the beginning of this year, it was clear that the IMF's 1991 targets were going to be met, and the Senate's approval this month of a number of tax reform measures appears to have paved the way for an IMF endorsement of the Philippines, a move which would release IMF and other donor money and pave the way for a rescheduling of Dollars 5.3bn of foreign debt. The total public sector deficit fell from 5.8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990 to about 2.7 per cent last year, and it is expected to remain under 3 per cent in 1992. Economists agree that the 1991 figures were in line with IMF demands but they caution against reading too much into the numbers; state spending was low because the budget was not approved until well into the year and capital expenditure, boosted again this year by road-building programmes, bore the brunt of the 1991 cuts. 'Last year can't be used as a test of political will for lowering the deficit,' says one economist. Nevertheless, the government did inflict a certain amount of pain to meet its targets. A special import levy of 9 per cent was in force, although it has now been lowered to 5 per cent and is to be abolished by June. Imports were stagnant, while exports rose about 6 per cent. The economy as a whole registered zero real growth, which meant falling living standards for the burgeoning population. This year real growth is expected to reach 2-3 per cent, approximately in line with the population growth rate. Some good news has lightened the gloom. Inflation has dipped to around 17 per cent and is expected to fall further. Textile exports and tourist arrivals are buoyant, the remittances of Filipino migrant workers in the Gulf and elsewhere are higher than expected, and oil has been found off Palawan. Gross international reserves rose to more than Dollars 4bn at the end of last year. Now in a relatively confident mood, the administration has embarked on several important economic reforms. Exporters are now permitted to retain 40 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings, instead of 2 per cent. Indeed, the ready availability of dollars - because of restricted demand for imports, and electoral campaigns financed by overseas dollar holdings - has all but eliminated the currency black market and strengthened the peso, leading to fears that the competitiveness of exports will be affected. A new local government law gives local authorities expanded powers to raise taxes, which may encourage further regional development as pursued with notable success by the island of Cebu and the region of Cavite south of Manila. A new foreign investment law has been enacted to attract foreign capital. On the negative side, a shortage of electricity is threatening industries in the southern island of Mindanao and there are fears that the main island of Luzon may also be affected. And while Filipinos hope for a consumer-led economic recovery boosted by election spending, the public sector deficit has helped to stifle productive investment by sucking savings into high-yielding treasury bills. Attempts to cut the overall public sector deficit have been stymied partly by the problems of a central bank plagued by liabilities dating from the Marcos era and costing some 30bn pesos a year to service. The bank's problems are not fully understood either in the cabinet or in the press, where it has been accused of inefficiency for making losses. 'In the early 1980s the central bank was ordered by President Marcos to provide forward cover for the oil companies,' says Mr Cuisia, who wants the government to take over the liabilities and leave the bank to handle monetary policy unhindered. 'Now we have enough dollars we may unwind these swaps,' he says. Under Marcos, says Mr Cuisia, the bank was also ordered to acquire the obligations of state companies and to pay national subscriptions to bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank (for which a presidential decree forbade the bank to charge interest). Nature has not been kind to the Philippines these past few years, inflicting an earthquake, a volcanic eruption, a typhoon and a catastrophic landslide on the islands. But economic recovery in 1992 and 1993 depends largely on whether the present government can hold its nerve up to the election and on whether the new administration will build on the reforms of the preceding year. Several important issues still need to be tackled, including the state of the environment and the conservation of remaining natural resources in a country still heavily dependent on agriculture, fishing and forestry. Mr Enrique Esteban of the Centre for Research and Communication says he is 'excited about the future' because he believes the recent economic reforms will help the Philippines catch up with its partners in the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean). 'The Philippines is part of the Japanese plan, so the Philippines has to be helped to develop by Japan,' he says. 'Japanese money is no longer going into Indonesia and Thailand because they are at maximum absorption. The Philippines is the last game in the Asean town." Others are less optimistic that the Philippines can emerge from the economic doldrums of the past decade without decisive actions by its own governments. As Mr Estanislao put it in a speech last month: 'The region around us has taught the rest of the world how to develop through exports. We have coined the appropriate slogans, but ask our exporters. All they ask is to be put on an equal footing with others. What has been our response until very recently? A clear preferential treatment for importers and industrialists who cannot see beyond the confines of our internal market; and a strong bias against exporters and agriculturists who have been manfully scouring world markets for foreign exchange. 'Isn't it time we moved beyond slogans, and put substantive actions behind grand words?'</p>

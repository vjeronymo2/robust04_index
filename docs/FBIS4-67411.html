			<p>BFN     [Text] Kwangju, April 20 (YONHAP) -- Greenpeace, the  international anti-nuclear and environmental protection group,  demanded Wednesday that the government and Korea Electric Power  Corp. (KEPCO) reveal all mishaps and precise information related  to the nuclear power plants in Yongkwang, West of Kwangju.    In a press conference at the Kwangju City Council building,  Greenpeace said the two nuclear reactors in Yongkwang were  highly hazardous due to technical flaws in their steam  generators and fire protection equipment, and urged the  authorities to disclose data about the reactors and mishap  details.    The nongovernmental body, on a 13-day Korean tour kicked off  April 12 by its flagship MV Greenpeace, traveled from the  Northern port city of Samchok and Pusan to arrive in Kwangju on  Wednesday while staging various antinuclear campaigns and other  activities to raise environmental consciousness along the way.  The group will reach Seoul on Friday after stopping off at  Inchon.    This particular steam generator, a core part of nuclear  reactors made by Westinghouse of the United States, is causing  accidents worldwide due to technical problems, Greenpeace  campaigners said.    Yongkwang's steam generators, which were built in a similar  period as those of other countries, could also have defects,  they said. A campaigner pointed out that a control rod had been  destroyed while a fuel rod was changed at the No. 2 Yongkwang  reactor in March 1988 but nothing was revealed about the mishap.  Greenpeace urged the government and KEPCO to look into the  possibility of nuclear accidents and conduct training for  emergency evacuations to ensure public safety. It pledged to  work with environmental coalitions in the area in staging  antinuclear campaigns and continue with its environmental  activities in Korea.    Later in the day, Greenpeace sponsored a seminar at Chonnam  University and showed a video tape of its activities.  Campaigners from various nations then visited the Mangwol  cemetery, where victims of the Kwangju uprising are buried, and  took part in a concert to get across their environmental message.</p>

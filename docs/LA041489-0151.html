			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ST. JOSEPH'S FERNANDEZ CATCHES MATER DEI LOOKING  </P> <P> The Mater Dei softball team may have taken studying for quarterfinal exams a  little too far, like out to the softball diamond.  </P> <P> The Monarchs got caught studying instead of swinging at pitches Thursday in a  2-1 loss at home to defending Angelus League champion St. Joseph of Lakewood,  the top-ranked team in the Southern Section 5-A.  </P> <P> Seven times on two-strike counts, Monarch batters watched as St. Joseph's Lisa  Fernandez, the Southern Section's top pitcher, delivered a third strike. She  had a total of 15 strikeouts.  </P> <P> "We're a little inexperienced," Mater Dei Coach Cathy Quesnell said. "I don't  think they understand that on a two-strike count you've got to protect the  plate, choke up and make contact."  </P> <P> All the scoring came in the first inning. With one out, Fernandez and catcher  Suzanne Picket singled. Bev Stiglbauer grounded to second baseman Jennifer  Cline, who flipped it to shortstop Rose Imbriano at second. But Imbriano  dropped the ball and Fernandez scored from second on the error.  </P> <P> Michelle Ourique singled up the middle to score Pickett from third before the  Monarchs (10-4-2 overall, 0-1-1 in league play) retired the side.  </P> <P> Mater Dei leadoff batter Beth Lomeli doubled down the first-base line.  Fernandez struck out the next two batters, then walked Cline before Amy Moeller  singled to left to bring Lomeli home for the last run of the game.  </P> <P> Quesnell was pleased with her team's performance. The Monarchs managed four  hits and one earned run against Fernandez, which is saying something. Fernandez  (14-0) has allowed only five earned runs in her four-year career. She is four  no-hitters away from breaking Michele Granger of Valencia's record for career  no-hitters (36) and three games away from Granger's record for career victories  (71).  </P> <P> "(Fernandez) is just such a fantastic pitcher that even to get one run and as  many hits as we did, to make the contact, was a confidence builder," Quesnell  said.  </P> <P> St. Joseph is 15-0, 3-0.  </P> <P> Mater Dei freshman Terri Kobata (6-2-1), coming off a 12-inning scoreless tie  against 4-A champion St. Paul Tuesday, had four strikeouts and gave up six  hits.  </P> <P> "I'm not making excuses, but she was a little tired," Quesnell said. "We're  having finals, and it's such a rotten week to play both St. Joseph and St.  Paul."  </P> <P> In other Angelus League games:  </P> <P> Rosary 8, Bishop Amat 7 (11 innings) -- Kristina Luna doubled in the  game-winning run with two outs in the bottom of the seventh to give Rosary  (8-6, 2-1) the victory at Lions Field. Luna had four hits and three RBIs.  </P> <P> In the Century League:  </P> <P> Canyon 11, Santa Ana Valley 1 -- Chanele Chambrone went two for two with a home  run and two RBIs, Tina French had two doubles and Krissy Kyriazis scored three  runs to lead Canyon (11-7, 2-0) at home. Santa Ana Valley is 6-10, 0-2.  </P> <P> Villa Park 5, Foothill 2 -- Chris Redman pitched a no-hitter, striking out  eight, for the Spartans at Villa Park.

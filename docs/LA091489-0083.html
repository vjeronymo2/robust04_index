			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Tibetan courts have sentenced 10 people to prison terms of up to life on  charges of rioting and spying for the Dalai Lama during an anti-Chinese  uprising in March, China's official New China News Agency reported. Among those  sentenced were four former Tibetan monks who received terms ranging from three  to five years, the news agency said. The rioting in Lhasa, the capital of the  Himalayan region, was the latest in a series of major outbreaks since violent  protests against Chinese rule erupted in September, 1987. By official count, 16  people were killed in the three days of disturbances, although Tibetans say  that between 20 and 30 died.  </P></p>

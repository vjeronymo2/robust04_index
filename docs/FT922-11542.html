			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / SIB acts against Manx company THE Securities and Invest-ments Board has appointed provisional liquidators for the assets of Asset Management Ltd, an Isle of Man-based investment company in which between Pounds 2m and Pounds 2.5m of investors money is believed to be missing. At least 20 to 25 investors are believed to have invested sums through AML, an associate company known as Financial Centres Ltd, based in St Albans, Herts, and through Mr Roger Shrubb, a director of both companies. None of the three is authorised to conduct investment business under the UK Financial Services Act of 1986. Mr Shrubb, AML and Financial Centres Ltd have also been barred by court order from disposing of any assets. Allied Dunbar, the life insurance and financial services company, said that Mr Shrubb was a so-called tied agent for the company from December 1987 until July last year. 'Any investor who purchased a bona fide Allied Dunbar product through Mr Shrubb has nothing to worry about,' Allied Dunbar said. The company noted that Mr Shrubb was not employed directly by Allied Dunbar, but was self-employed and sold its products exclusively. Mr Shrubb's contract with Allied Dunbar was terminated for 'poor performance' - a term used by life insurers to describe sales agents who either sell too few policies or who have unacceptably high numbers of policies cancelled in the first few years.</p>

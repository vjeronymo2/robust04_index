Deng Xiaoping Thought on and the Practice of Building  Special Economic Zones is a collection of materials. The  book collects Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important propositions  since 1978 on opening up to the outside world and on building  SEZ's; propositions on building SEZ's in important party and  government documents; and economic policies and statutes on  developing SEZ's promulgated by the National People's Congress,  the State Council, the governments of coastal provinces and  cities, and the governments of SEZ's. The book also illustrates  the profound changes and tremendous achievements of Shenzhen,  Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan since they were built into  SEZ's.    A Study of Deng Xiaoping Thought on Building Special  Economic Zones is a collection of treatises. It contains  the latest research findings by workers in theoretical circles,  as well as those engaged in practical work, over the past two  years regarding Deng Xiaoping thought on building SEZ's.  Specifically, the papers compiled by leading cadres,  specialists, and academics who spent many years assisting in the  construction of SEZ's illustrate the profound content and  theoretical significance of Deng Xiaoping thought on building  SEZ's, expound the great practical effects of the thought, sum  up the tremendous achievements and valuable experiences in  building SEZ's over the past 14 years, and outline problems  arising from the development of SEZ's during the nineties and  the measures for solving these, all from the perspectives of  different disciplines -- philosophy, economics, politics, and  sociology -- and by integrating the past and the present, as  well as theory and practice.</p>

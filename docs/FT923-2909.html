			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie rises strongly in good trade THERE WAS a buoyant res-ponse in the London stock market to Sunday night's concerted moves by Italy and Germany to overcome the threatened crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. Although the equity market's opening burst of enthusiasm proved well overdone, blue chip stocks overcame disappointment with the Bundesbank's reduction of only 0.25 per cent in the Lombard rate and 0.5 per cent in the discount rate and the FT-SE Index closed 51.2 up at 2,422.1. Strength in the US dollar and, after some early uncertainty, in the pound, brought demand for the heavyweights of the Footsie list. Trading volume, as measured by the Seaq network, increased but marketmakers warded off some early buyers by marking prices higher before the official opening of trading. However, the German interest rate cuts were feared to be insufficient to permit similar reductions in the UK in view of sterling's vulnerability in the ERM following devaluation of the lira. Investors remained cautious ahead of the French referendum next weekend on the Maastricht treaty. At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall warned: 'It is at least as likely as it was a week ago that UK rates will have to rise to defend sterling's ERM parity.' Similar views were expressed by Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull - 'sterling is not out of the woods yet' - and such views were emphasised when the pound slipped below the DM2.80 mark before the Bank of England came to its defence. Marketmakers decided that the Footsie could well rise by around 50 points on the dramatic overnight news and, without waiting for the size of the German rate cuts, marked shares up before the Seaq system was switched on. But the weight of early buying surprised them, and the Footsie jumped by 99.5 points to 2,470.4 at the offical opening. The running was taken up in stock index futures, where trading in the Footsie September and December contracts was extremely heavy as dealers struggled to take the increased demand into trading books purposely kept tight. As soon as share trading was under way, however, institutions began to sell into strength, unloading lines of stock of which they had been unwilling holders in the market's low volume days. Selling was not heavy but it soon clipped the Footsie back to a 36.3 gain on balance as strategists warned clients that, while the Bundesbank's action was a welcome move in the right direction, it did not alter Britain's currency/interest rate situation fundamentally, at least for the present. London had sensed a strong opening on Wall Street, which came in with an advance of 44 Dow points in UK hours, and the pound began to move up against the D-Mark. Good two-way trading in UK equities restored the Footsie to a rise of more than 56 points in the final hour of business. Seaq volume of 537.9m shares compared with Friday's 476.8m, worth Pounds 923.9m in retail, or customer, business. Once again the market was led higher by widespread gains in the dollar-earning issues.</p>

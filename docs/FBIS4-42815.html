			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irfan Sapmaz report: "Russia Active in the Caucasus Again"] </F>   [Text] Baku -- Russia has moved again to direct diplomatic  pressure on Azerbaijan to force it to agree to the plan it has  drawn up for peace in Daghlyk Karabakh. Vladimir Kazimirov,  President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, arrived in Baku and  held talks with President Geydar Aliyev the day before  yesterday. It has been reported that Aliyev and Kazimirov  argued rigorously in their six-hour talks in camera. It has  also been reported that no calls were transferred to their  meeting.    Several sources have said that Vladimir Kazimirov adopted a  hard line approach and outlined Russia's determination to deploy  troops in Daghlyk Karabakh, noting that Moscow will do whatever  is necessary to achieve its objective. However, they quoted  President Aliyev reacting to Kazimirov as follows: "Russia  cannot deploy its troops in Azerbaijan by itself. They will  have to tread over my dead body first. Russia's troops can be  deployed within the framework of an international force, which  the CSCE will establish."    Kazimirov shuttled between the presidential palace and the  parliament yesterday. He held talks with Speaker of the  National Assembly Resul Guliyev and Foreign Minister Gasan  Gasanov for five hours. It has been reported that heated  exchanges took place in that meeting. Guliyev and Kazimirov  were received by Aliyev in the evening.    Kazimirov has had intensive talks in Baku during the past  three days. However, the reluctance of the officials to make a  disclosure and the measures they have taken to avoid the  correspondents have drawn attention. In view of that, the  correspondents have been unable to establish the changes  Kazimirov may have proposed in Russia's peace plan on Karabakh.  The latest reports said that Azerbaijan objected to Russia  deploying its troops in Daghlyk Karabakh by itself and insisted  that an international force be deployed in that region.    It has been reported that Kazimirov will travel from Baku to  Yerevan to hold talks with the Armenian officials. He will then  return to Azerbaijan.</p>

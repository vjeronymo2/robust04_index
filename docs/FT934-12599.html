			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A test for unit trust managers Sir, Lex makes the point that some unit trust managers are against the Securities and Investments Board proposals, because it would be 'more difficult for them to make profits by holding units on their own account ready for resale' ('Unit trusts', October 22). Somewhat similar behaviour by stockbrokers and traders has been punished severely by stock exchanges everywhere. Could you publish a list of unit trusts which do not engage in this practice and also an interview with a fund manager who does? The interview should give him the opportunity to explain how he keeps the investors' interest paramount, and he may also tell us what happens to the units he has bought when the market takes a sudden fall.

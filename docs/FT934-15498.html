			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / More held in Japan construction scandal THREE senior executives of Japan's largest construction group, including the head of the construction industry association, were yesterday charged with bribery. The charges bring to a climax a public investigation into allegations of widespread bribery of provincial government officials by the construction industry, until recently a big source of campaign cash for Japanese politicians. The investigation has so far led to the arrests of 21 executives from Japan's top five construction groups, in the process hitting their profits and fuelling US complaints that the construction market is rigged against competition. The Tokyo district prosecutors' office yesterday indicted Mr Teruzo Yoshino, chairman of Shimizu and head of the influential Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, over the alleged payment of a Y10m (Pounds 62,500) bribe to obtain public works contracts. Two fellow board members, Mr Hiroyuki Koyama and Mr Akikazu Matsumoto, were also charged with bribery. Mr Fujio Takeuchi, former Ibaraki prefectural governor, was charged with receiving bribes. Mr Takeuchi is already facing bribery charges in connection with another construction group, Hazama. An irony of Mr Yoshino's indictment is that he was until his arrest leader of a campaign against bribery and bid-rigging in the construction industry. The Shimizu executives were arrested last month on evidence believed to have been gathered from the papers of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former political godfather of the Liberal Democratic party, who is now on trial for tax evasion on cash received from construction groups. Mr Kanemaru's downfall contributed to the LDP's recent election defeat. While Shim1zu is the biggest corporate target in the construction scandal, the national tax administration agency says its inquiries are widening. The agency has also asked local tax offices to investigate sub-contractors and suppliers suspected of concealing payments from construction groups. The five companies implicated have been temporarily banned from bidding for some public works contracts, causing most of them to reduce profits forecasts for this year. The psychological pressure on executives has been heavy, as was underlined when a Shimizu regional finance manager was taken to hospital on Sunday after apparently cutting his throat and wrists in a park outside the Tokyo prosecutors' office. Prosecutors had questioned him earlier.</p>

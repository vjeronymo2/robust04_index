			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / French promise to make Hoover pay dear: David Buchan in Dijon discovers why the switching of jobs to Scotland touched such a raw nerve 'IT IS social dumping, and it's shameful,' says a striker, stamping his foot yesterday outside Hoover's Longvic plant which is to lose most of its jobs to a more compliant Scottish workforce. 'We've nothing against the Scottish workers, just against Maytag (Hoover's owner) and the British government for not signing the European Social Charter,' adds another worker. 'The big lesson of the Hoover affair,' says Mr Jean-Claude Quentin, secretary general of the local Force Ouvriere trade union, 'is that social dumping does not necessarily come from south-east Asia, but from among us Europeans.' What is social dumping? Mr Richard Rankin, marketing director of Hoover Europe, says he is not sure. For him, Hoover has simply made a business decision to stem the red ink on its European operations by shifting all its vacuum cleaner production to its Cambuslang plant near Glasgow. This will entail the loss of 650 jobs at Longvic on Dijon's outskirts, but Hoover says it will save 25 per cent on its costs by having all vacuum cleaners made in one place. What is clear to everyone in France, as Mr Rankin ruefully acknowledges, is that 'we have upset - and provoked a powerful reaction from - the French government, and we will have to deal with it.' That is an understatement. Egged on by all political and union leaders, the French government has asked the European Commission to investigate whether Hoover was unfairly or illegally bribed with social and financial concessions, into shifting production to Cambuslang, and made clear that it will make Hoover pay dear for its decision. It is not clear whether Hoover will be able to carry out its decision. The government, for example, says the Hoover redundancies will be among the first to be affected by the new law sponsored by Mrs Martine Aubry, the labour minister who is also the daughter of Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. This law requires employers to produce alternative employment plans for redundant workers, and that without the approval of the government, and effectively of the unions, redundancies will be legally invalid. Why has the Hoover affair struck such a raw French nerve? It is not just that unemployment is bumping up against the 3m threshold less than two months before a general election, or that it is another sign that high interest rates and a strong exchange rate are killing the French economy. Other foreign companies are quitting France for lower cost venues, including the UK, with far less fuss. What has aroused French fury is the public concessions made by Scottish workers to win 400 extra jobs at Cambuslang. These include limited period contracts for new workers, constraints on their right to strike, a freeze on regular pay this year and cuts in overtime pay rates, flexible working time and practices and the introduction of video cameras on the factory floor. To the French, this is a clear case of the competitive undercutting of worker pay and standards to attract investment, or social dumping as it is catchily known on the continent. Not surprisingly, the Hoover management contests this. Mr Rankin says the company's decision to shift to Scotland was made on its calculation that it would cut costs by a quarter and that this calculation does not include the Cambuslang workers' concessions. The other key factor, says Mr Rankin, was the fact that social charges amount to 40 per cent of the payroll in France and only 15 per cent in the UK. Actual pay rates in the two countries are similar, as was the government aid offered. Why then did Hoover press its Cambuslang workers so hard? 'We have responsibilities to our customers to produce as efficiently as possible, to our shareholders to save their money, and to our workforce,' Mr Rankin says. 'You may not think we have exercised this last responsibility in regard to the Dijon workforce, but we have in regard to Cambuslang and our total 3,600 workforce in Europe.' But Hoover never sought similar concessions from its French workforce. Why not? 'The savings were so great in shifting to Cambuslang that the Dijon workforce would have to have made enormous concession to offset these,' Mr Rankin says. Hoover would not, in any case, have found the Longvic workers pliable. Mr Jean-Marie Groscolas, distribution manager at Longvic and leader of the protesting workforce, says they offered to freeze their pay this year, but would have flatly refused any other concessions. Alternative job prospects for the Hoover workers are not promising. The Burgundy region jobless rate has risen sharply in the last year. None the less, its prosperity remains well above that of the Glasgow region. That economic gap explains much of the different attitude of the workers of Scotland and Burgundy.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Proton wins a waiver on 30% foreign share ceiling PROTON, the Malaysian car-maker, has won approval from the Malaysian government for foreigners to own more than 30 per cent of its shares. Until now Malaysia has imposed a 30 per cent foreign shareholding limit on local companies involved in important areas of the economy. Proton has a Malaysian government shareholding of just under 50 per cent. Mitsubishi, the Japanese carmaker, which has been central in developing the Proton car, holds about 20 per cent of its equity. Foreign share buyers have shown strong interest in Proton recently and the 30 per cent shareholding ceiling was reached this month. The local market had expected Proton to apply for a separate foreign listing, but the government decided to waive the 30 per cent ruling. Analysts doubt the government will lift the 30 per cent foreign shareholding limit across the board. They say such moves will be made only when there is sustained foreign interest in a stock. There have been rumours that Hicom, the Malaysian government controlled industrial holding company with a 29 per cent Proton stake, might sell its shares in the car maker to raise cash for acquisitions.</p>

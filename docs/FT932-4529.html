			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Japan believes worst of banking crisis is over JAPAN will tell its Group of Seven economic summit partners that its banking system is over the worst of the problems left by the bubble economy of the late 1980s and that its economy is recovering. Although it may take two to three years for Japan's banks to work off their bad loans, the ministry of finance is satisfied operating profits have risen and that the crisis in the financial system is past its peak. The ministry's confidence has reached a point where officials are letting it be known that the government will not allow bank failures. Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, a finance ministry deputy director-general, said yesterday it was the ministry's policy never to allow a bank to fail. The government felt the financial sector was in part a public good and that some 'socialisation of risks' was necessary. Some banks in Japan have been bailed out recently at a cost to the country's deposit insurance scheme. While bank managers have been fired in such cases, depositors have not been affected. So far, the government says no tax revenues have been used in bailing out stricken banks. Instead, Japan's banking industry has been expected to carry the costs. The better outlook for Japan's financial sector will form part of an upbeat assessment of economic developments to be presented to Japan's G7 partners at next month's summit in Tokyo. The government is expected to counter US demands for fiscal action to boost growth by asserting that the economy bottomed out in the first quarter of this year and should return to annual growth rates of 3.5 per cent. Japan's Y2,190bn (Pounds 13.2bn) supplementary budget, designed to pull the economy out of recession, has become law, Reuter adds. It is the first time in 32 years that Japan has drawn up an extra budget during the 150-day ordinary parliamentary session ending in late June, the finance ministry said. The supplementary budget will increase government spending in 1993-94 to Y74,540bn overall. It will fund a Y13,200bn economic stimulus package unveiled in April. See Editorial Comment</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tokyo office economic reporter Yasuhiro Suzuki; from the </F> "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series; part one of a  three-part series of articles on the Labor Ministry: "Employment  Policy That Cannot Shed Its Old Skin"]    [Excerpts]Ministry Objects To Establishing  "Headquarters"    Soon after the new year started, on 6 January the government  set up the Emergency Employment-Measures Headquarters headed by  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. According to a senior  official of the coalition parties, the original plan was to have  only five economic ministers -- such as the finance minister,  minister of international trade and industry, and labor minister  -- participate in it in addition to the prime minister, but the  organization turned into one of pancabinet members at the strong  request of the prime minister.    But people at the Labor Ministry are not necessarily happy  about this. They are in fact cold about it and say: "That  headquarters has been created for reasons of publicity. No  concrete results can be expected from it."    It was on 27 December that the coalition made a formal  request to the prime minister concerning the establishment of  the headquarters. Labor Ministry officials, however, on the same  day were already telling coalition officials: "The Labor  Ministry will lead it. Please scrap the plan to make the prime  minister its head." Apparently, the establishment of the  emergency measure headquarters displeased the labor bureaucrats  who believe that "unemployment issues belong only to the Labor  Ministry."    Of course, the ministry is proud of itself. An official of  the ministry's Employment Security Bureau said, "We think that  we are doing everything that anyone could think of." The  comprehensive unemployment countermeasures under the Total  Program To Support Employment announced by the Labor Ministry in  December are worth 326 billion yen in budgetary terms. Tetsuya  Sakamoto, director of the ministry's Employment Policy Division,  said, "That is about three times the size of the employment  program implemented at the time of the high-yen-caused  recession."    The Labor Ministry for a long time has "upheld the high  employment rate" as the employment security administration's  royal banner. A typical example is the action taken to  establish employment subsidies in 1985 -- shortly after the  first [as published] oil crisis. It was a system aimed at  assisting companies which had trouble continuing employment for  their workers because the firms' production had fallen. Under  the system, the government paid part of the cost of keeping  employees on house leave (waiting at home), to provide job  training, or to reassign employees to different areas. Its  purpose was to prevent the companies from firing their employees  or from encouraging them to resign, and the ministry has used  this as a trump card to ride out unemployment problems during  recessions.  <H5>  Rising Criticism of the Subsidies </H5>   But now there are large amounts of criticism of the  subsidies  which insist that the subsidies are "pressuring companies into  maintaining employment and thus are hurting the liquidity of  labor. This system is becoming untenable for the mature Japanese  economy." The plan for expanded employment assistance subsidies  contained in the Total Program To Support Employment envisages  raising the wage subsidies for those in job training from the  current 75 percent to 80 percent [of wages received]. This is  an unprecedentedly high rate. Some within the ministry  complained, "The government's paying 80 percent of the pay makes  the employees almost public servants. Is it necessary to go that  far?"    More recently, critical voices are conspicuous about the  past  labor administration policy of emphasizing only employment  security. As for employment subsidies, some economists went so  far as to declare that they "impede Japan's efforts to improve  its economic structure." The rationale for the criticism is  that while the industrial structure needs to be converted and  improved without delay in preparation for the upcoming  deregulation and market liberalization, the labor sector, which  will form the basis for the structure, is not changing at all.    The Labor Ministry by all means wants to adhere to its  slogan  of "job security," and it is desperately resisting any attempt  to make it change that policy. [passage omitted on examples of  the ministry's policy]  <H5>  Inability To Come Up With an Aggressive Concept </H5>   In mentioning the Labor Ministry's reason for being negative  about increasing employment liquidity, Noriomi Soya, director of  the ministry's Secretariat, said, "We cannot yet see any  specific evidence of new industries emerging which will create  jobs." What he meant was that even though many people think  that deregulation will create new businesses in the fields of  communications, the environment, and social welfare, evidence of  this possibility has not yet even started to appear. Thus, the  ministry cannot agree to increased liquidity in jobs.    This cautious stand by the Labor Ministry led Teruto Emoto,  chairman of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers  Unions, to say: "These people cannot escape their turf  consciousness of the past. Many of the policies they come up  with are ex post facto in nature." Labor Minister Chikara  Sakaguchi himself complained: "Why can't the ministry come up  with a daring vision on industrial employment before other  people ask for it? The ministry is lacking in aggressive  ideas." [passage omitted explaining the ministry's passivity]    While criticism of the bureaucrats is growing, the Labor  Ministry is being asked to restructure itself as well.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Battles loom as US budget details due THE US administration is to publish its full budget today, fleshing out the outline package put forward by President Bill Clinton in February. However, this broad framework has already been altered by Congress, and the details of how the administration plans to increase taxes and cut specific programmes from beekeepers' subsidies to space stations will pave the way for fierce congressional battles. Several department heads have found it impossible to reshape their budgets in any significant way in the 11 weeks since they took office. Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, has already acknowledged that his department's budget is 'treading water' until he can review military needs and objectives from the bottom up. Nevertheless, the budget will bear the marks of the new Democratic administration, with lower defence spending and higher taxes on the wealthy aimed at cutting the deficit, and increased spending on environment, technology and infrastructure projects. The budget resolution passed by Congress sets out a path for government spending to climb from Dollars 1,507bn in 1994 to Dollars 1,801bn in 1998. This trims cumulative outlays over the five years by Dollars 218bn from the baseline budget submitted by former President George Bush just before he left office and by Dollars 19bn from Mr Clinton's original plan. Revenues are to rise from Dollars 1,242bn in 1994 to Dollars 1,554bn in 1998, Dollars 148bn more over five years than the Bush baseline and Dollars 48bn more than Mr Clinton's original plan. The budget deficit is projected to fall from Dollars 262bn in 1994 to Dollars 193bn in 1997, before climbing again to Dollars 202bn in 1998. These deficit projections, however, could be reduced still further if Mr Clinton is unable to persuade the Senate to pass the Dollars 16bn stimulus spending bill which he says is necessary to provide an immediate boost to the economy and safeguard the recovery. The Republican minority in the Senate has so far succeeded in blocking the bill, and Mr Clinton has agreed to discuss changes, but he is still fighting to preserve the bulk of it. Administration officials hope Republican senators will come under pressure from their constituents when they return home for the Easter/Passover recess, especially from the numerous Republican mayors who have endorsed the spending package.</p>

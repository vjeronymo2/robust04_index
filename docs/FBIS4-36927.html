			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] The petroleum ministers of the 12 OPEC  member-countries are to meet in Vienna today to decide on ways  to strengthen the oil market and to determine the production  ceiling for the next three months. Also on the OPEC agenda are  discussions for the election of a new OPEC secretary general,  and changing the headquarters of the OPEC Secretariat.    What is gleaned from the comments by the OPEC members'  ministers before the commencement of the session is that an  atmosphere of tranquility and understanding exists among the  OPEC members on improving the oil market; and in this  encouraging atmosphere, OPEC is expected to set the production  ceiling at 24.5 million barrels per day and to display its  determination on OPEC's uniformity in improving oil prices.    It should be noted that during OPEC's recent session held in  March this year, members set the production ceiling at 24.52  million barrels per day for 1994 in a bid to prevent a drop in  oil prices and committed themselves to help the stability of the  oil market by observing the set production ceilings.    Also, the drop in oil prices stopped two months ago and a  relative improvement was observed in the international oil  market. On the basis of figures published by oil sources, there  has been a $3-$4 increase in the price of each barrel of oil  over the past two months. Although this is encouraging, it is  still a far cry from the basic OPEC price which is $21 per  barrel.    Experts believe that the major reason for increased oil  demand during the past months is renewed economic growth in the  industrial world and the West's storing of oil for its fall and  winter fuel needs. This increase in demand by major consumers  and the observance of the OPEC ceiling production and oil supply  have led to an improvement in world oil prices.    Informed oil circles believe that the OPEC members that  depend on their oil income as the major source of foreign  exchange income, have lost billions of dollars because of the  drop in oil prices during the past months. Therefore, in order  to safeguard the interests of OPEC and of the members in this  important international organization, it is necessary to improve  oil prices and to increase them to $21-per barrel. Now, on the  eve of the 96th OPEC session, it seems that the atmosphere of  understanding among members, controlling the production ceiling  and the commitment of member countries to observe production  ceilings will be an attainable objective.    At any rate, the Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes any step  by OPEC that will lead to an increase in the prices of crude  oil, and in its oil policy it underlines the need for OPEC's  power, understanding among members, and the safeguarding of this  organization's interests.</p>

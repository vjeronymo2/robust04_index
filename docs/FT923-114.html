			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Jefferson Smurfit UK institutions are traditionally wary of Irish companies, and have every excuse to avoid them when they are barred from the Footsie. Even so, the market can hardly deny that Jefferson Smurfit's balance sheet is in fine fettle for a paper and packaging business at this stage in the cycle. ItsIPounds 220m of net cash is in impressive contrast to the position of most of its Scandinavian and Canadian competitors, whose debt in some cases exceeds their turnover. Admittedly there is some Dollars 2.3bn of off-balance sheet debt post the restructuring of JSC/CCA - but there is no recourse to Smurfit, and there is value in this US joint venture which may yet be cashed in. The immediate challenge for Smurfit, though, is earnings, hit by the familiar problems of overcapacity and keen pricing in US and European markets. The company can only hope that its proposed linerboard increase will stick, and that the pressures which have caused discounts of more than 30 per cent in North American newsprint really are starting to ease. But while the stronger dollar should also make an impact on the UK and Spain in the current half, profits are unlikely to be much more than IPounds 140m for the year as a whole. The shares, down another 11 per cent to 228p yesterday, have been conspicuously weak since the end of March. Earnings will rebound sharply one day, but the timing of recovery remains as elusive as ever. For the moment investors are unlikely to be trampled in the rush.</p>

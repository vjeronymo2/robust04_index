			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Chile woos multinationals to the market - How banks want to transform Santiago into a financial hub CORPORATE bankers in Chile are forging a new line of business by persuading multinationals to float their local subsidiaries on Santiago's buoyant stock exchange. Citicorp Chile and Bankers Trust Company have been sending emissaries to the headquarters of US and European groups to expound the financial logic of going public in Chile. Their sales pitch has three main points: parent companies could raise ready cash by carving out their Chilean businesses; they could finance acquisitions elsewhere in Latin America by tapping Chile's substantial pool of capital resources; and they could find local investors to fund their own expansion projects in Chile. Chilean banks want to transform Santiago into a financial hub for the Latin American operations of multinational companies. They believe this is possible because the spectacular growth of Chile's private pension funds and insurance companies has created a domestic savings pool worth Dollars 17bn. Pension funds, the largest institutional investors in Chile, are on the look out for new investment opportunities. They have recently been authorised to take part in project finance and invest in convertible bonds. As a result, the first multinationals are being coaxed onto the Santiago stock market, or Bolsa. Armco Chile, a subsidiary of the US steel group Armco, has announced it will be floating up to 60 per cent of its equity on the Bolsa early next year. 'Armco Inc needs cash after taking the strategic decision to concentrate its business in stainless and specialty steels in the US,' explains Mr John Barroilhet, Armco Chile's general manager. Bankers Trust persuaded Armco it could get a better deal by floating its Chilean affiliate than by selling it outright. Business is thriving as Armco dominates the Dollars 100m market for grinding systems in Chile's thriving mining industry. The initial public offering is expected to raise about Dollars 40m. Mr Lincoln Rathnam, managing director of Boston investment consultants Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, sees this as a trend, not only in Chile but elsewhere in Latin America. While Chile has the advantage of having a solid institutional investor base, other stock exchanges in the region have benefited from economic reforms that have wooed back flight capital. 'We are encouraging US companies to float their Latin American units as a cheap and effective way of raising capital,' says Mr Rathnam. 'I expect to see a lot of familiar names on local stock exchanges soon.' According to Salomon Brothers Financial Strategy Group, US companies have raised over Dollars 2.5bn in the past five years by carving out their foreign subsidiaries in overseas equities markets. To date, this has mainly taken place in Japan, where price/earnings multiples are several times higher than those in the US. Mr Jose Manuel Silva, vice-president of Citicorp Chile, says Latin American bourses have become attractive as a vehicle for multinationals to reduce the political risk of investing in Latin America. Many multinationals are seeking to expand their operations in the region, says Mr Silva, but they are being held back by weary shareholders at home. 'We are advising them to raise capital by floating their local business and let Chilean investors assume the political risk of their expansion plans in Latin America,' Mr Silva says. Chilean electricity companies, for example, have raised over Dollars 100m on Santiago's capital markets to buy large stakes in the privatisation of Argentine utilities. There is no reason why multinationals should not be able to do the same in other fields, Mr Silva says. Citicorp is pursuing flotation talks with about a dozen multinationals with businesses in Chile. Eternit, the Belgian manufacturer of construction materials, is expanding its holdings in Latin America through Ceramicas Cordillera, a Chilean ceramics group floated on Santiago's Bolsa last year. The Belgian group and its new Chilean partners have just agreed to an Dollars 18m capital increase in Cordillera to finance acquisitions in Argentina. If the purchases go ahead, Cordillera will control 40 per cent of the Argentine market for ceramic tiles. A further incentive for multinationals considering going public in Chile is that they often control businesses which are under-represented on the Santiago stock exchange. Public offerings from companies in consumer products, mining, and the fruit exporting business would probably be snapped up.</p>

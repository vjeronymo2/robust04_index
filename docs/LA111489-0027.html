			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> KRAUTHAMMER ON ISRAEL  </P> <P> Krauthammer joins such notable syndicated columnists as William F. Buckley,  George Will, Patrick Buchanan and others in taking his opportunity to stroke  Israel. He devotes his entire column to pointing out that Israel should only  negotiate with Palestinian "insiders" and not those Palestinians outside of the  occupied territories. This despite the fact that Palestinians, wherever found,  are almost 100% in favor of the PLO representing their interests.  </P> <P> Krauthammer could well have pointed out that Israel has consistently violated  the human rights of the Palestinians in the occupied territories. He could have  written of deportations, confiscation of property, demolition of homes of those  suspected of throwing stones, appropriation of land, midnight visits by Israeli  troops battering down doors, concentration in camps of thousands without charge  or trial, beatings of prisoners by soldiers and shooting indiscriminately into  crowds when confronted by stone throwers.  </P> <P> But our columnists know which side butters their syndications.  </P> <P> These "honorable" writers are able to discern human rights violations in the  Soviet Union, Cuba, Panama, China and any number of other countries. However,  their pens dry up and their word processor screens are blank when they have an  opportunity to bring, via their columns, some slight indictment of Israel for  the violations visited on Palestinians.  </P> <P> It is truly unthinkable that many of our most noted figures of the media,  together with our Administration and Congress, have become toadies to Israel  and are unable to bring themselves to write the truth as Americans know it.  </P> <P> LOWELL E.

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Business outlook worsens in north A STEEP DROP in orders, a fall in home and export sales, plunging confidence and pessimism about prospects are highlighted in the latest Business Survey North of businesses in Cumbria and north-east England, published yesterday. The survey, a stark contrast to previous upbeat predictions that northern England might lead the country out of recession, says the northern economy took a pounding in the third quarter. Main indicators such as sales, orders, investment and employment suggest that the survey's findings, based on responses from 788 northern-region companies, are more than just a 'kneejerk reaction to the events of Black Wednesday', says the report. It was produced by Northern Development Company (NDC) and the Tyne and Wear and Teesside chambers of commerce. 'Worsening results combined with growing uncertainty could have extremely damaging consequences for the northern economy,' it warns. The NDC and the chambers, concerned at the survey's findings when the region faces the loss of more jobs in the mining, offshore, marine and defence sectors, wrote yesterday to Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, calling for more government aid to create new employment. The survey shows that only 15.9 per cent of companies were working at more than 90 per cent capacity, down from 21.5 per cent in the second quarter. Investment in plant and machinery and buildings declined and training expenditure was cut sharply. Nearly two fifths (38.1 per cent) of companies expected business conditions to deteriorate over the next three months; just 12.8 per cent anticipated an improvement. In the second quarter, 33.5 per cent expected an improvement and 9 per cent forecast a decline. Manufacturers and service companies were equally pessimistic about prospects. The report predicts further fourth-quarter deterioration in employment. The modest post-election improvement was 'another false dawn', it says.</p>

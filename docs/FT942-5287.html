			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / China plans way to bridge 57km sea channel China plans what would be the world's biggest sea-crossing construction  - a chain of bridges and a tunnel, linking the Shandong and Liandong peninsulas jutting into the Bohai sea. An official in the Liaoning government in north-east China said feasibility studies, expected to take several years, had begun on the Yn60bn (Pounds 4.6bn) project to bridge the 57km Bohai channel. Work was unlikely to begin, however, before early next century and the project would take about 10 years to complete. In the meantime, Liaoning and Shandong are planning a Yn1.3bn train ferry linking the two provinces. This would run between Dalian, the main port in Liaoning, and Yantai in Shandong. Both are important ports and railheads connected with China's interior. The ferry is expected to be operational by 1998, and would be capable of handling 10m tonnes of goods a year. Capacity would double by the year 2005. The plans to bridge the Bohai channel and improve transport between Liaoning and Shandong, two of China's most important provinces economically, reflect a new drive to boost economic development in the north-east. The official China Business Weekly reported last month that efforts were under way to improve the economic integration of the Bohai rim which encompasses 680,000 sq km and includes the provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Liaoning, and the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin. This followed a government decision taken in 1992 to declare the Bohai rim an independent economic zone under China's strategic economic development plan. An important aim is to match explosive economic growth in southern China. Development in the north-east, home to much of China's heavy industry, has been lagging behind programmes around the Pearl River and Yangtze River deltas in the south. Some of China's largest cities are located around Bohai Bay, including 11 cities with populations of more than 1m people. But Bohai rim development has been hampered by inadequate transport and crumbling infrastructure. The Bohai channel project, combining a railway and highway, would involve the construction of seven long bridges and causeways as well as the tunnel. Other schemes under consideration in the region include the building of a large power plant to make use of the bay's tides and a plan eventually to turn the Bohai into the world's largest fishing pond.</p>

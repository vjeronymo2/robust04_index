			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Kravchuk is resorting to the powers  granted to him by the Ukrainian Supreme Council in regard to the  enforcement of Ukrainian laws in the Crimea, stated Mykola  Mykhalchenko, chief of the Presidential Service for Issues of  Domestic Policy, commenting on the president's decree concerning  Yuriy Meshkov's decision on holding a poll among the Crimean  people.    He emphasized that separatist circles in the Crimea will  accuse President Kravchuk of not giving the Crimea the  possibility to conduct reforms. Nevertheless, in the opinion of  Mykola Mykhalchenko, in the long term, the Ukrainian president's  decree will stabilize the political situation in both Crimea and  Ukraine, and it serves as a serious argument in the battle with  separatism, preventing the creation of a legal basis for  Crimea's secession from Ukraine.</p>

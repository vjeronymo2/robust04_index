			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Strong sales lift European operations - The Paris World Auto Show General Motors' Opel/Vauxhall operations in Europe lifted net profits in the first six months of 1994 to Dollars 603m from Dollars 520m in the same period last year. The half-year figures have already exceeded profits for the whole of 1993, when the company was burdened by heavy restructuring costs, in particular in Germany in the second half of the year. The group also announced that Mr Richard Donnelly had been appointed president of General Motors Europe, as part of a reorganisation of the top management of GM's automotive operations. He will succeed Mr Louis Hughes as head of the Opel/Vauxhall and Saab car and light commercial vehicle activities. Mr Hughes previously combined this role with his presidency of all GM's vehicle business outside North America. Mr Donnelly is head of GM's Powertrain (engines and transmissions) operations in North America and a member of the GM North American operations strategy board. On the results, Mr Hughes said Opel/Vauxhall was the most profitable volume carmaker in Europe for the fifth year in succession. Net profits were halved last year, to Dollars 598m from Dollars 1.12bn in 1992, under the impact of a steep decline in west European new car sales. Mr Hughes said Opel, GM's German subsidiary, had returned to 'solid profitability' in the first half after falling into loss in 1993, and would achieve a substantial turnround in the full year. The Opel/Vauxhall brand (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) was the top-selling single marque in Europe in the first nine months, with sales of 1.15m and a 12.5 per cent share of the west European new car market. Mr Hughes said Opel had recently added a third shift for the production of its Omega executive car at its plant in Russelsheim, near Frankfurt. The move was spurred by strong demand. GM Europe is entering a new market segment this autumn with the launch of a small coupe, the Opel/Vauxhall Tigra developed from its Corsa small car, with planned sales of 50,000 in Europe in 1995. Mr Hughes forecast that overall new car sales in west Europe would increase this year by around 5 per cent to 11.8m. However, he admitted that a large part of the recovery was stemming from government actions in France and Spain to stimulate sales through financial incentives for scrapping of old cars. Sales next year are forecast to recover further to 12.3m, but Mr Hughes warned they would not return to the record level of 13.45m in 1989-1991 until the 'latter part of this decade'.</p>

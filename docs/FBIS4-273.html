			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E Oelofse] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 6 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Volksfront  [National Front -- AVF] has demanded that the April 27 elections  be postponed and that all parties concerned return to the  negotiating table. The demand comes in the wake of the  announcement by the Independent Electoral Commission chairman,  Mr Justice Johann Kriegler that elections cannot be held in the  current political climate in kwaZulu.    The AVF, in a statement released on Wednesday [6 April],  said  the situation in Natal/kwaZulu was clear proof that negotiations  had failed. "There can never be peace before the freedom of the  Zulus and the Afrikaner is properly addressed," said the  statement.    The attempts by the National Party [NP] and the African  National Congress to intimidate the Zulu nation had also failed.  Military steps were being directed at Inkatha Freedom Party  members and certainly not at ANC members who were the  aggressors, said the AVF. Which was why violence in the region  had not been curbed.    The AVF said an end had to be brought to the "soft" way in  which the NP dealt with the hunger for power exhibited by the  ANC-South African Communist Party.</p>

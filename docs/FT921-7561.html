			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Further action considered to recover Outhwaite losses THE Lloyd's Names who were not included in last week's out-of-court settlement in the Outhwaite case are examining legal action of their own in an attempt to recover losses. About 150 of the Outhwaite Names received legal advice this week from the solicitors DJ Freeman and will meet on Monday evening to consider their next move. Names are the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Last week, 987 Names backed legal action against RHM Outhwaite and 80 other agents on the grounds of negligence and breach of contract and won Pounds 116m in a negotiated settlement. Other Names on the syndicate - of whom most appear to have been working Names (Names employed by Lloyd's agencies or brokers) - opted not to join the action and do not benefit from the deal. 'The non-litigant Names felt legal action was not the way to proceed but are now unhappy that their interests have been ignored,' said an Outhwaite Name who has helped co-ordinate the action. Mr David Tiplady of DJ Freeman said that because more than six years have elapsed since Mr Outhwaite underwrote the loss-making US liability contracts that were at the centre of the original legal case, future actions could be 'time-barred'. He has examined a number of technical arguments to circumvent this obstacle. Separately DJ Freeman, which represents three other groups of Names involved in legal disputes with their agents, has dissociated itself from the campaign by a separate firm of solicitors, Michael Freeman, to prevent Lloyd's from drawing down Names' deposits in order to meet cash calls (to fund anticipated insurance losses). Mr Michael Freeman issued motions for the injunctions - which seek to prevent Lloyd's drawing down on Names deposits - on Wednesday.</p>

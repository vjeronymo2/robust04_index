			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Towards open government A STRANGER to UK shores might conclude that Britain was about to adopt a Freedom of Information Act, so persuasive was Mr William Waldegrave yesterday that his new white paper would bring open government. Mr Waldegrave announced a further increase in the amount of official information available to the public. And he proposed that the parliamentary ombudsman should police Whitehall's performance in opening up access to information. True, the white paper proposes a lengthy list of exemptions from the presumption of access to official information. This includes information given in confidence, information on the effective management of the economy, incomplete analysis and commercially sensitive information. As Mr Waldegrave points out, however, even countries with freedom of information legislation permit exemptions, often for categories not so very different from his. Whether yesterday's white paper marks a step forward will depend on how permissive government bodies are in deciding whether these exemptions apply in particular cases. Take, for example, the new right of access to health and safety information. If that works well, it will remove at one stroke the biggest single cause of complaint over government secrecy. It ought to mean that the transport department publishes the data it collects on the pollution standards and safety of new cars. But if this information is covered by the exemption on third party commercial confidences, the complaints will not abate. Similarly with the other significant new right in yesterday's white paper - access to personal files. The most important part of personal records is often observations from third parties which might be covered by the exemption for information given in confidence. To be denied these would in many cases render the right of access nugatory. Decisions over the coverage of the exemptions will be policed by the parliamentary commissioner, the ombudsman who investigates maladministration in central government and the health service. There is much to commend in this choice, since the ombudsman offers a cheaper and probably faster appeals process than would the courts. His is also a well-established office, with experience of scrutinising official papers and ruling on complaints. Although he cannot force departments to comply with his decisions, they are almost invariably accepted. He is accountable to parliament through a Commons select committee, which ought to be strengthened with a view to increasing his authority in his new responsibilities. The success, therefore, of the drive for greater openness will rest with the ombudsman. If he takes a robust attitude in assessing the public interest when considering appeals, then yesterday's white paper could mark a real step forward in rolling back the secretive culture of Britain's public administration. Until the practical workings of these procedures can be judged, there will be widespread scepticism about Mr Waldegrave's reforms. At present, access to UK government information is often easier in Brussels, Washington or even Moscow than in London.</p>

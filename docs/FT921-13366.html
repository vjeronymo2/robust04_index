			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Letter: Wilful limitation of expenditure hits a compelling spending concept Sir, In his excellent 'Economics Notebook' (January 20), Peter Norman discusses the idea of boosting the economy via local authority spending. The concept is compelling and yet, he tells us, a Treasury spokesman dismissed the idea on the grounds that 'local authorities do little infrastructure spending apart from housing'. If that Treasury spokesman sent his children to a local school he would be only too aware of an area of local authority infrastructure crying out for more spending. As long ago as 1987, the Audit Commission estimated that Pounds 2bn needed to be spent on school maintenance; a recent Labour Party survey reckons that schools now need Pounds 3.3bn to put their buildings in order. In my children's school, the Victorian building has outdoor lavatories, no damp-proof course and a heating system that needs constant attention. The other half of the school has been housed in 'temporary buildings' for the last 30 years. The local authority has no money to pay for the upgrading that is needed and would no doubt welcome the release of some of the cash that is 'slumbering in the banks'. A similar story could probably be told for every education authority in the country. Will another generation of schoolchildren have to make do, while the Treasury continues to limit expenditure so wilfully? Martin Stoll, 45 Canfield Gardens, London NW6</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Frederick Cooper US growth FREDERICK COOPER, the metal finishing, architectural hardware and electrical products group, is expanding its US coating operations through the Dollars 6.98m (Pounds 4.56m) purchase of Florida-based Spectra Metal Coating. The move gives the group a manufacturing base in the US for its Cooper Coated Coil subsidiary. Parallel with the agreement to buy Spectra, Cooper has entered into a sales agreement with Spectra Metal Sales, controlled by Mr Thomas Snell, a shareholder of Spectra Metal Coating. Spectra Metal Sales has been taking over 70 per cent of the Metal Coating output, but Mr Ed Kirk, chairman of Cooper, said this proportion would drop as the metal coating company expanded sales. Cooper is financing the deal by bank borrowings to raise gearing to 60 per cent, from 21.9 per cent at end January.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UN chief orders resumption of aid to Bosnia: Speculation mounts that High Commissioner for Refugees is considering her resignation MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, said yesterday he had written to Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, asking her to ensure that humanitarian relief deliveries in Bosnia-Hercegovina are immediately resumed. In reply to a question on whether Mrs Ogata agreed with such a decision, Mr Boutros Ghali said: 'I am supposed to direct this operation.' The UN secretary-general's instructions to Mrs Ogata to reverse her decision to suspend relief supplies to many parts of Bosnia, which came only 48 hours after the original decision was made, is a clear indication that there has been a serious communications breakdown among senior UN officials. Diplomats representing members of the Security Council have been expressing surprise and consternation that Mrs Ogata acted without prior consultation with the Council and the secretary-general. Although she is reported to have given advance notice of her decision to Mr Cyrus Vance, one of the co-chairmen of the Bosnian peace conference, Mr Vance is understood to have advised her against taking a decision without consulting Mr Boutros Ghali. The UN chief was on a visit to Japan. A UN spokesman said he did not know whether Mrs Ogata intended to visit UN headquarters in New York in the near future. But there is speculation she might be considering resigning, in spite of the high regard in which she is held by member governments. UNHCR operations have been crippled by the refusal of local Bosnian Serb commanders to allow relief supplies into Moslem-held towns in eastern Bosnia. This prompted last week a Bosnian govern-ment boycott of deliveries to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. General Philippe Morillon, head of the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) in Bosnia, said on Thursday that he thought he had won pledges from Bosnian Serb leaders to allow a delayed UN aid convoy escorted by his troops to travel to the Moslem strongholds of Gorazde and Zepa. But hopes that this could prove a signal for resumed UNHCR operations were dashed yesterday when a reconnaissance mission to Zepa was turned back by Bosnian Serb forces. The main convoy will try to reach Gorazde again today, after emergency repairs to a hole in the road. Ms Sylvana Foa, a UNHCR spokeswoman, yesterday defended Mrs Ogata from accusations that the decision to suspend aid was taken without proper consultation. She said Mrs Ogata had spoken the previous day to Mr Vance and had recently warned Mr Boutros Ghali that suspension might be necessary. The decision had aroused intense controversy. A private meeting on Thursday of about 20 countries involved in the aid effort in the former Yugoslavia had backed Mrs Ogata's stand, Ms Foa said. Meanwhile, the Security Council yesterday decided to renew the mandate for 23,000 UN peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia for an interim period of six weeks, to give international mediators extra time to broker peace agreements in Croatia and Bosnia. The decision, which covers the period from February 21 to March 31, is intended to strengthen Unprofor in the Krajina region of Croatia, where it has been unable to ensure the full implementation of a peace plan concluded in January 1992. The resolution, drafted by France, which has seen 12 of its peacekeeping troops killed in conflict so far, invites Mr Boutros Ghali to take 'appropriate measures' to strengthen the security of Unprofor. The resolution specifically mentions for the first time that Unprofor will be acting under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. This chapter governed allied operations in the Gulf war and allowed member states to use military means to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolutions. Although the resolution was adopted unanimously, China expressed reservations about putting Unprofor's operations in the framework of Chapter 7. The Chinese representative said the implementation of Chapter 7 should be considered an exceptional case and should not constitute a precedent for future peacekeeping operations.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Borrowers continue issuance with short maturities The euromarkets saw a small number of issues yesterday, mainly with a short maturity and targeted at retail investors, although some syndicate managers reported large purchases by institutions. Issuance is expected to decline until after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday. Syndicate managers suggested the Republic of Italy might wait to see the impact of the FOMC meeting on US interest rates before issuing its long-awaited Y400bn bond, which could come in three tranches; a three-year, a 20-year, and a tranche of between six and 10 years. In the US dollar sector, the largest deal yesterday was the Republic of Austria, which brought a Dollars 200m bond via Lehman Brothers, which said the strong name had stimulated very strong European retail demand. 'I've had syndicate managers coming out of the woodwork trying to get into this deal,' said a Lehman official. Norddeutsche Landesbank brought a Dollars 150m bond via Paribas Capital Markets, which said the offering had been greeted with solid demand in Switzerland and Belgium, as well as Germany and south-east Asia. Some UK institutions had bought the bonds, which were given a 13-month first coupon to help the borrower effect a swap. The first Argentine corporate borrower since the Republic of Argentina brought its Dollars 500m global deal last month braved the euromarkets yesterday. Yesterday's bond came from Astra Compania Argentina de Petrolio, the Argentine oil and gas group which has been listed on the stock market in Switzerland for 70 years, via Swiss Bank Corporation which reported strong demand, some of it from US institutions. The bonds came at 412 basis points over US Treasuries. The Republic's bonds were brought to market at a spread of around 350 basis points over US Treasury bonds, and by yesterday had widened out to around 366 basis points over. Banco Nacional, the Brazilian bank, brought an Dollars 80m bond via Citibank which targeted the offering at retail Swiss, US, Latin American and Asian investors. The deal had been talked about as a Dollars 75m bond but was increased to Dollars 80m. When freed to trade, the bonds tightened by one basis point. Two issuers each brought Pounds 100m sterling deals. Portman Building Society, the UK's 14th largest, via BZW which said the deal offered an alternative to expensive paper in the secondary market. Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein brought a Pounds 100m bond through HSBC Markets, which reported strong demand with blocks of Pounds 5m and Pounds 7m being sold to institutions attracted by the highly-rated name. In the Australian dollar sector, ABM Amro Australia brought a ADollars 100m bond through ABM Amro, which reported strong demand with one block of ADollars 25m going to a buyer in the Netherlands. The Council of Europe issued a ADollars 100m bond through BZW. Syndicates are expecting the first convertible bond to emerge from Brazil this month. It is expected to be a Dollars 100m issue with a 10-year maturity from a highly-rated company.</p>

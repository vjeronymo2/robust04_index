Applicants failing to meet the requirements of that or other sections of the regulations will not be selected as potential grantees irrespective of their standing in the competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Specific Rating Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rating criteria and the weights assigned to each are described below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> An understanding of the problems of migrant and seasonal farmworkers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Range 0 to 20 points.

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Major shifts economic policy MR JOHN MAJOR last night unveiled a significant shift in economic policy to give priority to growth and employment as his government sought to restore its battered authority at Westminster. After Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, agreed to widen the scope of his promised review of closures in the coal industry, the prime minister signalled that he hoped for further cuts in British interest rates. With Conservative MPs deeply gloomy about the economic outlook and the Treasury forecasting no early end to the recession, Mr Major said the government intended to build a strategy for growth and jobs. In an interview with ITN after the new approach was unveiled by Downing Street, Mr Major said: 'A strategy for growth is what we need; a strategy for growth is what we are going to have.' Earlier he indicated that international deflationary pressures should allow borrowing costs to drop below the present 8 per cent level without risking an upsurge in inflation. The government would not be indifferent to the level of the pound on the foreign exchange markets but it had no specific target. Mr Major told colleagues that he wanted an 'early, strong but sustainable' recovery which would take advantage of the competitive edge provided by sterling's devaluation, while keeping inflation low. But he also warned colleagues that next month's Autumn Statement would foreshadow the tightest squeeze on public sector pay in recent memory to convince financial markets that the government remained serious about containing the pace of price rises. The prime minister said he was determined that the sharp cuts in most Whitehall spending programmes needed to meet the Treasury's overall spending targets should not fall on projects which had a direct impact on 'jobs and growth'. That implies that increases in public sector pay will be held below 2 per cent and might be frozen. He indicated that he wanted the government to offset the inevitable reductions in some capital spending programmes by scrapping Whitehall rules inhibiting private sector involvement in large infrastructure projects. One suggestion last night was that reductions, for example, in the Department of Transport's road-building programme could be matched by a drive to make it much easier to allow the private sector to build toll roads. Mr Major's stance - signalled by Downing Street and later confirmed in a series of television interviews - marks the beginning of a determined attempt to restore his grip on the Tory party at Westminster. Senior ministers conceded that sterling's ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last month and this week's U-turn over coal had severely weakened the government's - and the prime minister's  - authority. Mr Major had now responded to the unease among Conservative MPs and in the country at large by signalling that his first priority was an end to the recession. He also made it clear that on one issue - his absolute determination to ratify the Maastricht treaty - he was not prepared to give any ground to his critics on the Conservative backbenches. The Maastricht bill is scheduled to return to the House of Commons next month and Mr Major told colleagues: 'I think people would be well-advised to accept that I say what I mean on the subject of European policy. If people don't trust me, they had better find someone they do trust.' Mr Major's new emphasis on economic growth rather than the defeat of inflation was seen at Westminster as evidence that the threatened rebellion by Conservative MPs over the government's original coal closure plan reflected much deeper unease over the depths of the recession. With the public spending cuts under consideration in the run-up to the Autumn Statement threatening much larger job losses in both the public and private sectors, Mr Major was concerned to stress that his commitment was to economic recovery. But his decision to emphasise that priority appeared also to mark a more fundamental re-assessment by the Treasury of the balance of risks in policy-making after the latest batch of gloomy economic news. Despite the sharp devaluation of the pound since last month and the accompanying two-point reduction in interest rates, the government now appears convinced that further deflation poses a greater risk than an upsurge in inflation.

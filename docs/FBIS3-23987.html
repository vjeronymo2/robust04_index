			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Petrovskaya: "Is the Last `Paragraph' at </F> Hand?"]    [Text] I was called Tuesday evening by Boris Berman, the  artistic director of the creative association Command-2. "Watch  my program on 11 February," he requested. And he added sadly:  "The last `Paragraph' is at hand."    That day the chairman of the All-Russian Television and  Radio  Company, Oleg Poptsov, informed the collective of a reduction  and possibly even full cessation of all original broadcasting  starting in March. Programs like Berman's "Paragraph," on which  budgetary resources are expended, will go off the air.    The reason is trivial--the state does not have the money to  maintain its own television. At a meeting with managers of  state companies, S. Dubinin, acting minister of finance,  officially announced a 50-percent reduction in their financing  which, accordingly, will also lead to a reduction in the volume  of programming by approximately one half.    I do not believe that the government does not have the  money.  Millions of dollars and billions of rubles [R] were found to  restore the burned White House. It was ready to find $500  million for the construction of a new parliamentary center.  Until recently, various statesmen gave assurances that the money  will also be found for television.    At the end of December, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin,  while  presenting the new manager, A. Yakovlev, to the board of  directors of Ostankino, recognized the exceptional  "significance" of the electronic resources of mass information  and declared firmly: "We will support state TV no matter how  difficult it might be. We are not really that poor." At that  time the prime minister reported on the government's decision to  allocate resources from the budget to pay the debts of the  television and radio company to the Ministry of Communications.    It is February outside, but last year's debts have still not  been paid. The communicators are threatening to strike. The  companies are feverishly searching for a way out of the  situation that has developed, having realized long ago: Saving  the drowning is a matter for those who are drowning.    There is no big panic in Ostankino--they are developing  scenarios there of the kind of economic structure in which no  one will come off the loser. Moreover, Ostankino expends budget  resources basically to pay for the services of the Ministry of  Communications--independent companies conduct a majority of the  programs with their own money. The concern of the first channel  is only to invest it in its own air time. Very expensive  advertising, which is through the roof on the first channel,  makes it possible to pay for a few programs of Ostankino itself.  Thus, no matter how much you curse the predominant influence of  advertising on the screen, without it the number of programs  would have been cut a long time ago--there would have been  nothing with which to make them.    The situation of the second channel, the Russian channel, is  far more difficult. Practically since its first days it has  existed as a poor relative that is given crumbs from the grand  table. The situation with equipment is bad, the accommodations  are tight, there is less advertising, its cost is lower than  Ostankino's, and you can count the number of independent  producers on one hand--the main part of production has to be  produced by the company itself. Russian TV [RTV] is filled up to  the ears with promises: In almost three years, five government  decrees were adopted concerning RTV. Not one of them has been  implemented.    In the meantime, many RTV workers justly think that they  deserve more attentive treatment for themselves on the part of  the authorities: It was precisely Russian TV that in the most  tense and most tragic moments of the life of the country  demonstrated social and civic responsibility, placing the  interests of the country and society above all else.    This, however, was appraised in a way. I had occasion to  attend a meeting of Deputy Prime Minister V. Shumeyko with RTV  immediately after the October events of last year. V. Shumeyko,  on behalf of the government, thanked everyone for the selfless  work on the night of 3-4 October, calling it a great deed. Oleg  Poptsov then expressed the fear. He said, you are now thanking  us, you promise manna from heaven, but will it not happen that  after a month or two we will be forgotten once again? And we  will once again come face to face with many of our problems?  Shumeyko promised firmly not to forget, and presented the  collective of the company a gift from the government--a mantle  clock. "It would have been better if he had presented us a  couple of extra microphones," remarked Sveta Sorokina, who was  sitting next to me.    "Now this clock is ticking off the last minutes of the life  of many programs that we will have to drop," Anatoliy Lysenko,  RTV's general director, joked bitterly, telling me about the  impending cut in broadcasting. The RTV collective is agitated:  After cutting broadcasting, a cut in personnel is inevitable.    Given the total tragedy of the situation for those specific  people whose programs will be canceled in the near future, it  should be noted for the sake of objectivity: The programs of  both channels required creative revision a long time ago.  According to data of the Vs. Vilchek Service, the early morning  and late night audiences cannot even be measured--there are  practically none. It is also reasonable, in the opinion of many  specialists, to have a daytime interval--ongoing daytime  programs for business people also have a rating close to zero.  Consequently, morning, day, and night segments can be cut  without pain to the viewers when, really, there is not enough  money. Of course, it would be nice if such a "revision" was  conducted accurately and professionally--so that viewers'  favorite programs would not suffer qualitatively.    Although, as is believed by the deputy chairman of the  Federal TV and Radio Service of Russia, Valentin Lazutkin,  quantitative economy will lead to nothing, and will hit the  communicators first and foremost: The entire system of signal  transmission devices was created for specific volumes of  broadcasting. It is unrealistic, in his opinion, to give the  freed capacities to "private owners": There are no strong  nonstate broadcasters today who would be able to pay not only  for the production of programs but also for their dissemination  to cities and villages. In addition to all this, it is  unprofitable to the state. What really unites the country?  Television and radio. If the system of federal television and  radio broadcasting breaks down--the country will also break  down. This is what the people making decisions should realize,  believes one of the main Russian television chiefs.    Is there a way out of the developing situation or a dead  end?  Have we arrived there? In my opinion, and in the opinion of many  specialists, there is a way out. It is time finally for the  state to determine--does it need its own television at all? If  it is necessary, it should calculate how much television it is  able to handle--after all, the problem of survival that the two  major national companies have encountered is also facing oblast  and regional companies. And they are all over Russia--90 of  them! Without exception, all are on hunger rations, they are  feeding only on promises, and they do not know what awaits them  tomorrow. At the same time, it is always demanded of them to  support and explain to people the policy of a government that  wishes to order the music but stubbornly refuses to pay.    But all the rest of television that cannot be afforded--give  it away. Owners will be found. What they will entertain the  viewer with is another question. But a lit-up screen, in any  case, is better than a blank one. We lived through this  once--and there was nearly a complete "stop."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Thailand Business Council for Sustainable  Development, comprising 50 leading company members, has  initiated five projects aimed at protecting and saving the  country's environment.    The council was established six months ago to address  environmental issues and is chaired by former Prime Minister  Anan Panyarachun.    The five projects are: pesticide-free agricultural villages,  renovation of Khlong Lot, study of lignite and its impact on the  environment, environmental conservation circle (ECC), and green  labelling.    The council's objectives are: to provide reliable  information and guidance to distinguish genuine  environment-friendly products; to encourage the production of  green products using clean technologies; to promote energy  conservation and recycling; to promote the establishment of a  third-party labeller who can offer an unbiased opinion to back  up marketing claims, to establish more demanding standards for  companies to make environmentally sound products; and to promote  environmental awareness among manufacturers and consumers.    Chaiyot Bunyakitdi, director of the Thailand Environment  Institute's business and environment programme, said the green  labelling project will be significant in helping identify  projects that have proven to be less destructive to the  environment. To date, 19 member firms have agreed to  participate in the labelling project.    Environment-friendly products have achieved international  popularity among environment-conscious consumers.    Mr Chaiyot said the council will vigorously promote this  project and hopes to establish guidelines to assist firms in  their marketing claims, often not entirely accurate, of products  less damaging to the environment.    The Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development  (TBCSD) has proposed establishing a committee, to be chaired by  Permanent Secretary for Industry Siwawong Changkhasiri, on green  labelling guidelines and comprising representatives from the  Federation of Thai Industries, Board of Trade, Thai Industrial  Standards Institute, Office of Consumer Protection,  Environmental Engineering Association of Thailand, Press  Association, Public Relations Confederation of Thailand,  Marketing Association of Thailand and no more than 25  representatives from TBCSD.

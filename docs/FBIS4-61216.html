			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Asuyev] </F>   [Text] Groznyy, 5 May -- "Rumors regarding Ruslan  Khasbulatov's political activities are very much exaggerated."  That is how Ruslan Khasbulatov's close relative, who wishes to  remain anonymous, commented on a rumor in the press alleging  that the former chairman of the Russian parliament has virtually  headed the opposition in Chechnya. In a conversation with an  ITAR-TASS correspondent, he admitted that Ruslan Khasbulatov has  frequent meetings with his compatriots, but "these meetings are  always held at the request of the residents themselves and they  practically do not touch on Chechnya's domestic political  problems."    An ITAR-TASS correspondent did not succeed in meeting Ruslan  Khasbulatov himself. The former chairman avoids journalists or  answers with one and the same phrase: "I have come to Groznyy to  meet relatives and have a rest."    According to information from Ruslan Khasbulatov's immediate  entourage, he is preparing to resume not his political but his  scientific activities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] Official negotiations between Russia and Great  Britain ended in the Kremlin a few minutes ago. The documents  signed at them are a mutual acknowledgement of the fact that the  Russian Federation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and  Northern Ireland are not enemies. This was said in the official  joint statement by the president of the Russian Federation and  the Prime Minister of Great Britain.    [Correspondent Sergey Suntsov] The official visit to Moscow  of the British Prime Minister John Major began today. [passage  omitted]    A joint statement was signed following the talks. It says  that the two leaders will give necessary instructions on mutual  non-targeting of strategic nuclear missiles, to be accomplished  not later than 30 May 1994.    Answering questions, Boris Yeltsin and John Major praised  the  state of bilateral relations. The British premier said he  supports the Russian reforms and observed that cooperation is  developing in political, trade, and military spheres.    The situation in the former Yugoslavia was also discussed  during the talks.    [Begin Yeltsin recording] I must say that our positions  generally coincide. They coincide in the main thing - that is  that heavy equipment around Sarajevo should be handed over to  the UN forces, and so the shelling there will stop. Second -  both the Serbs and the Muslims should be forced, by way of  negotiations, to sit down at the negotiation table and resolve  the issue by a peaceful political way and stop the war in  Yugoslavia.    Some are trying to resolve the Bosnian issue without  Russia's  participation. I would like to stress that this will fail, we  will not allow it. Of course Russia will participate actively  both in the negotiations and in the peaceful solution to the  tragic events in Yugoslavia. I am happy that Mr. Major is  supportive of our view.

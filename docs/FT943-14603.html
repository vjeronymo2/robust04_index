			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Japanese cars lose ground in Europe Japanese carmakers have suffered a heavy loss of market share in the west European new car market in the first six months this year, their competitiveness hit hard by the rapid appreciation of the yen. Overall sales have risen by 6.8 per cent to 6.5m from 6.08m in the corresponding period a year ago, according to industry estimates. Sales by Japanese carmakers, by contrast, have fallen by 5.8 per cent to an estimated 712,000 depressing their share to 11 per cent from 12.4 per cent a year ago. Seven of the eight Japanese manufacturers in the west European market have seen volumes fall in the first six months - Suzuki and Daihatsu have both lost over a fifth. Last month, total sales rose in west Europe by an estimated 12.9 per cent to 1.065m from 943,000 a year ago. The recovery has strengthened significantly in the past two months, and new car car sales in west Europe have been higher than a year ago in five of the past six months. Last year, they fell by more than 15 per cent, the steepest annual decline in the post-war period. In June sales were higher than a year ago in all 17 markets across west Europe led by the UK, Spain and Scandinavia. In the first half of the year, sales were lower than a year ago in only four markets - Italy, Austria, Portugal and Greece - while sales in Germany rose only marginally. Significantly, demand has picked up in the past two months in both Germany and Italy, the leading European volume markets. Sales in Germany in June rose year-on-year by an estimated 5.6 per cent; in Italy by 7.1 per cent. Four of the big six volume carmakers in the west European market - General Motors (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK), Peugeot Citroen, Ford and Renault - have all gained ground. Peugeot sales have risen by an estimated 13.1 per cent in the first six months helped by recovery of the French market. Volkswagen is suffering from weak demand for VW and Audi, but has seen sales rise for Seat and Skoda, its Spanish and Czech subsidiaries. Some of the biggest gains have been achieved by the specialist makes, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volvo and Rover.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------- January-June 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------                         Volume      Volume   Share (%)   Share (%)                        (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Jun 94  Jan-Jun 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET         6,498,000        +6.8       100.0       100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group     1,066,000        +3.6        16.4        16.9  -Volkswagen           694,000        +0.3        10.7        11.4  -Seat                 173,000       +23.9         2.7         2.3  -Audi                 169,000        -2.2         2.6         2.8  -Skoda*                30,000       +19.1         0.5         0.4 General Motors***      840,000        +7.5        12.9        12.8  -Opel/Vauxhall        805,000        +6.9        12.4        12.4  -Saab**                27,000       +32.8         0.4         0.3 PSA Peugeot Citroen    816,000       +13.1        12.6        11.9  -Peugeot              488,000       +10.0         7.5         7.3  -Citroen              328,000       +18.1         5.1         4.6 Ford group***          759,000        +8.5        11.7        11.5  -Ford                 753,000        +8.5        11.6        11.4  -Jaguar                 6,000        +3.0         0.1         0.1 Fiat group****         749,000        +4.5        11.5        11.8  -Fiat                 579,000        +7.8         8.9         8.8  -Lancia                99,000        -3.2         1.6         1.7  -Alfa Romeo            64,000        -9.4         1.0         1.2 Renault                689,000        +9.3        10.6        10.4 BMW group              399,000        +7.0         6.1         6.2  -BMW                  201,000        +1.1         3.1         3.3  -Rover                198,000       +13.8         3.0         2.9 Mercedes-Benz          229,000       +39.7         3.5         2.7 Nissan                 210,000        -1.6         3.2         3.5 Toyota                 168,000        -3.4         2.6         2.9 Volvo                  111,000       +25.3         1.7         1.5 Mazda                  102,000        -8.4         1.6         1.8 Honda                   86,000        +6.0         1.3         1.3 Mitsubishi              66,000       -16.4         1.0         1.3 Suzuki                  44,000       -21.3         0.7         0.9 Total Japanese         712,000        -5.8        11.0        12.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS: Germany              1,762,000        +0.7        27.1        28.7 Italy                1,058,000        -2.6        16.3        17.9 United Kingdom         956,000       +14.0        14.7        13.8 France                 938,000       +15.3        14.4        13.4 Spain                  455,000       +19.6         7.0         6.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------- * VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ** GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. *** Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **** Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: industry estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

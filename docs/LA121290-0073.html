			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> NEW ALBUM, OLD SHOES KEEP LAINE ON THE RUN  </P> <P> When celebrated pop crooner Frankie Laine -- whose 21 million-selling singles  from the late 1940s to the middle '60s included "Mule Train," "I Believe," and  "Rawhide" -- moved to Point Loma in 1968, it was purportedly to retire.  </P> <P> He has yet to do so. In fact, he's getting ready to record a new album in New  Orleans with jazz trumpeter Al Hirt.  </P> <P> Laine had planned to start recording in January, but Hirt decided to get  married, which has moved the sessions to March, around the time of Laine's 78th  birthday.  </P> <P> "Al's getting married to some gal from Minnesota on Dec. 28, and we have to  wait until he gets back from his honeymoon," Laine said. "And I'm allowing him  plenty of time to get his honeymooning over with.  </P> <P> "Then we're going to choose the songs, do the backgrounds, go over the  arrangements, record everything and put the vocals in."  </P> <P> The album, which doesn't yet have a title, will be recorded at a private studio  owned by New Orleans band leader Ronnie Kole, a longtime friend of both Laine  and Hirt.  </P> <P> "Ronnie is kind of tying the whole thing together," Laine said. "I gave him the  idea (for the collaboration) and he flipped and went after Al," Laine said.  "He's got his own studio and his own record company; he's quite an  entrepreneur."  </P> <P> Joining Laine and Hirt in the studio will be reed siblings Wynton and Bradford  Marsalis. "We're asking them each to do a cameo," Laine said.  </P> <P> Another potential guest: Aaron Neville, the resident canary of New Orleans  rhythm-and-blues group the Neville Brothers.  </P> <P> "He seems to be doing a lot of guest appearances these days with people like  Linda Ronstadt," Laine said, "and we're really hoping to get him."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Laine is keeping busy here in San Diego. Local nostalgia radio  station KPOP-AM (1360) has put together a pre- Christmas promotion around one  of his old songs, "Old Shoes," seeking donations of old shoes for the homeless.  </P> <P> Laine and KPOP morning man Don Howard have cut a series of promo spots asking  listeners to bring their old shoes to any Dixieline Lumber Home Center.  </P> <P> "Then the people at Dixieline will take the shoes over to the St. Vincent De  Paul Center so that Father Joe Carroll can disperse them to all the people who  need them," Laine said. "So far, it's really going well.  </P> <P> "I just got back from San Francisco, where KFRC-AM is picking up on it, and  we're going to do the same thing up in Los Angeles, at KMPC-AM."  </P></p>

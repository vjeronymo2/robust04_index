			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases for gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters are zero for level 1, since it is the same as the baseline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $7.35 for level 2, $24.05 for levels 3 and 4, $59.60 for levels 5 and 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $108.55 for level 7 and $901.80 for level 8. For electric water heaters the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer price increases are $6.85 for level 1, $42.04 for level 2, $361.36  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for level 3, $394.38 for levels 4 and 5, and $834.31 for levels 6 through 8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 1 is zero for a gas water heater because it is the same as the baseline;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.87; standard levels 3 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 by $7.46; standard levels 5 and 6 by $9.20; standard level 7 by $13.32; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level 8 by $53.02. For electric water heaters standard level 1 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce energy expenses by $14.66, standard level 2 by $26.78, standard level 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by $195.01, levels 4 and 5 by $207.13 and levels 6 through 8 by $250.79. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturers Impact Model results for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all classes of water heaters show that any of the revised standards would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause a prototypical manufacturer to have negative short-run return on equity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is caused in part by the very low base case return of 0.4 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicative of an industry which is extremely price-competitive. The negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-run return on equity's are especially severe at the three most stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels. Standard levels 1 through 8 are projected to produce negative short-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run return on equity's of 0.2 percent, 0.3 percent, 3.3 percent, 3.5 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.7 percent, 17.1 percent, 18.1 percent and 31.7 percent respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, revised standards will slightly increase the prototypical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's long-run return on equity at standard levels above level 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard levels 1 through 8 are projected to produce long-run return on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equity's of 0.4 percent, 0.4 percent, 0.8 percent, 0.8 percent, 0.8 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.6 percent, 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. See Technical Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, most financial data of the type needed to characterize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports. Also, DOE based its assumptions for the prototypical firm strictly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on information regarding water heater manufacturers. The Department seeks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on how to better characterize a prototypical firm when heat pump  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters are included in the mix of products. For example, it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that room air conditioner manufacturers become the system manufacturer, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the water heater tank becoming a purchased part. In that case, at those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels where heat pumps are assumed, it may be reasonable to introduce some of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the financial characteristics of the room air conditioner industry since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat pumps in question are very similar to room air conditioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Life-cycle cost and net present value <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A life-cycle cost is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative classes, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 8, the max tech level, for gas water heaters are less than the baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit. Of the eight candidate standard levels, units meeting levels 4 and 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for electric water heaters and units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting levels 3 and 4 have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for gas water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters. See Technical Support Document, Figures 4.2 and 4.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

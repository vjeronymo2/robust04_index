			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 26 SAPA -- Although the issue of the  defence industry raised moral and political questions, in  reality it could contribute significantly to reconstruction and  development, Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise said on Thursday.  In a statement welcoming the lifting of the United Nations arms  embargo on South Africa, he said the industry had become one of  South Africa's largest exporters of manufactured goods.    "Should South Africa's present 0.4 percent share in the  world  armaments market be increased to only one percent, this will  result in 20,000 new job opportunities."    There need be no fear that arms and equipment would fall  into  the wrong hands. The trade had to be conducted in a responsible  and accountable manner.    Mr Modise said he was delighted that the embargo belonged to  the past. This development had far-reaching and constructive  implications for South Africa and the region.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITES PROBLEM AS HE DEVELOPS LEGISLATIVE AGENDA;  </P> <P> BUSH CALLS HOMELESS 'NATIONAL SHAME'  </P> <P> From behind the thick glass of his armored limousine, President Bush spotted  the cluster of homeless people on Vermont Avenue here as he sped to a speech at  a downtown hotel.  </P> <P> From his windows in the White House, he can see them too -- "ragged, pathetic  figures huddled over the steam grates of the Ellipse," he said.  </P> <P> They are, he told an insurance agents' conference Tuesday, "an affront to the  American dream -- a national shame, if you will."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faces Problems  </P> <P> The President used his speech to the national legislative conference of the  Independent Insurance Agents of America to call attention to this problem and a  number of others that he said he must address as his legislative agenda takes  shape.  </P> <P> "My agenda is this: to confront the emerging problems of the future today,"  Bush said.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that the President, "within  the next few days," will outline his views on the recent report from his  handpicked ethics commission on improving ethical standards for government  officials, and that he is setting in motion a series of Administration meetings  with congressional leaders on the federal budget.  </P> <P> Bush also spoke of a need to review the awarding of huge damage judgments by  juries in insurance cases.  </P> <P> On the homelessness problem, he said: "Homelessness affects a small proportion  of Americans but concerns us all. We must seek the root causes and devise the  most practical solutions for the homeless."  </P> <P> When asked whether the President was planning an initiative to tackle the  problem, Fitzwater told reporters that the remarks represented "a follow-up to  his general concerns expressed during the campaign."  </P> <P> He said that Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development, is "looking  into a number of housing proposals at HUD with the President's direction and  promotion."  </P> <P> "The word has gone forth to come up with solutions, and that's the direction  we're moving in," he said.  </P> <P> On the subject of "tort reform," Bush told the insurance agents: "Of course,  there are many litigants who deserve a jury's sympathy -- we can start from  that premise.'  </P> <P> But, gaining a wave of applause from the insurance agents, he said: "When local  governments cannot install playgrounds, when businesses are bankrupted, when  mothers struggle to find an obstetrician . . . then it is time to consider  limiting some of these outrageous settlements."  </P> <P> "Tort reform is critical to the health of businesses and volunteer  organizations alike," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Studying Proposals  </P> <P> Later, Fitzwater said that the Justice Department "is taking a look" at reform  proposals.  </P> <P> At the start of the day, Bush dropped in on a meeting among leaders of the  Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and senior White House officials.  </P> <P> "We must condemn all attacks on the Jewish religion, the Jewish heritage,  clearly, unequivocally and without exception," he told the group. "This nation  must stand for tolerance, for pluralism and a healthy respect for the rights of  all minorities."  </P></p>

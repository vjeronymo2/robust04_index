This amendment is prompted by an investigation into an uncontained PW JT8D engine failure caused by severe corrosion on the 9th stage HPC disk. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fracture of the HPC disks, which can result in uncontained release of engine fragments, inflight engine shutdown, and airframe damage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective November 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Pratt &amp; Whitney, Publications Department, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108.

That action proposed to require a record search, initial and repetitive on-wing and shop inspections to detect corrosion on high pressure compressor (HPC) disks, and removal from service of engines with HPC disks corroded beyond serviceable limits. The inspections, and replacement, if necessary, would be accomplished in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6038, Revision 3, dated May 8, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that disks that are recoated when complying with the inspection requirement of the AD should be zero-timed with regard to the next inspection interval. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concurs. A paragraph has been added to the compliance section that addresses recoated disks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that there have not been enough disk failures to warrant issuance of an AD. The FAA does not concur. The need for an AD is based on a determination that an unsafe condition exists that is likely to exist in a product of the same type design. That determination rests on many factors, including the risk and hazard level of the failure mode, which in turn are based on several factors, one of which is the number of failures that have occurred. Other data, such as inspection data, analytical models, and potential consequences are also considered when determining risk and hazard level. The FAA has determined in these instances that an unsafe condition exists that is likely to exist in engines of the same type design, and, therefore, an AD is warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The ministers of foreign affairs of the European  Union and the members of the Commission responsible for external  relations, of the one part, and the minister of foreign affairs  and the state secretary of the Ministry of International  Economic Relations of the Republic of Hungary, of the other  part, attended the first meeting of the Association Council  between the European Union and Hungary in Brussels on 7 march  1994.    2. The Association Council adopted its rules of procedure  and the rules of procedure for the Association Committee, which  will in future prepare its meetings and in general ensure  continuity of the association relationship and the proper  functioning of the Europe Agreement. The Association Committee  may, under the authority delegated by the Association Council,  adopt decisions concerning the implementation of the agreement.    3. The parties welcomed this inaugural meeting of the  Association Council, following the entry into force on 1  February 1994 of the Europe agreement between the European Union  and Hungary. They regard the meeting not only as a symbol of the  important new stage reached in their relations, but also as a  practical step towards achieving the goals set out in the  agreement including, ultimately, the common goal of Hungary's  future membership of the Union which guides the co-operation  between the parties.    The Association Council welcomed the entry into force of the  treaty on European Union as a further impetus to the process of  co-operation and integration in Europe.    4. The parties discussed a number of political issues and  confirmed the importance of maintaining a bilateral political  dialogue in accordance with the provisions of the Europe  Agreement.    The parties noted with satisfaction that a multilateral  framework for a strenghtened political dialogue and consultation  on matters of common interest has been set up by the Copenhagen  European Council; they looked forward to its full  implementation. On this basis, the Association Council also  welcomed the fact that at the initiative of Foreign Ministers  Hurd and Andreatta the Council is currently considering  modalities to further intensify multilateral political dialogue  with the associated countries.    The Association Council is deeply concerned by the  continuing  crisis in the former Yugoslavia. Both parties welcomed recent  promising developments on Sarajevo and the agreement between the  Bosnian and Croat sides as important steps towards ending the  war throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. They expressed their full  support for an early negotiated settlement between all the  parties involved in the conflict on the basis of the European  Union action plan. During the discussion, the Hungarian side  described its special situation and sacrifices in connection  with the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.    The European Union side expressed its understanding in this  context.    The parties agreed on the utility of sustained and concerted  efforts in order to preserve the peace and stability and to  enhance mutual understanding and peaceful relationships on the  European continent. In this context, they looked forward to  continuing consultations on the preparation of a conference  launching the stability pact, which is the subject of a joint  action of the European Union.    5. The Association Council welcomed the success of Hungary  in establishing stability of democratic institutions, the rule  of law and the respect of human rights. It welcomed also the  progress made towards completing the process in transition to a  functioning market economy. It recalled the Community's  commitment, expressed most recently by the European Council in  Copenhagen last June, to assist in that process. The  Association Council agreed that the implementation of the Europe  Agreement should play an important role in promoting sustainable  non-inflationary growth and in further liberalizing and  integrating European markets.</p>

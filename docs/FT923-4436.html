			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Arts: Earth-mother of Eurotrash - Edinburgh International Festival ONCE MORE into the Vale of Tears, dear readers. Thanks in part to the European Arts Festival, Pina Bausch and her Tanztheater Wuppertal have returned to Britain for the first time in 10 years - at the King's Theatre. Cafe Muller, though by no means the best of Bausch is the current offering, both popular and echt. Cafe Muller is set in an empty cafe. Wooden chairs and tables litter a large box set. Early on, two important scenes occur. A woman, eyes closed, sleepwalks barefoot in her nightie, her hair flowing, and an earnest young man, in spectacles, keeps shifting furniture, to save her from blundering into it. She seems driven by deep personal need - but, though he keeps guarding her, her need never includes him. Instead, she finds another unseeing sleepwalker, and it is this man who is plainly her destiny. The scene tinges Romantic somnambulism with violently neurotic urgency. As soon as she and this new man blindly embrace, the next episode begins. A third, older man enters and rearranges their limbs. He is, evidently, an artist. No sooner does he walk away than the woman tumbles from the position into which he has put her. And no matter how often he arranges her, she tumbles every time. A funny scene, this at once introduces us to Bausch's talent for irony. It's absurd that a man should model these two sleep-lovers as if they were clay (but isn't that what choreographers do?). It's absurd they let themselves be models. It's absurd the modelling doesn't last. The contrast between these two episodes is a sign of Bausch's theatrical mastery. But the fact is that these scenes, with the few meanings (however strong) they offer, occupy some 20 minutes. And the rest of Cafe Muller is a series of obvious repetitions and variations on these two situations. The two sleepwalkers are sado-masochistic. They throw each other against walls, they grieve, they are never happy - but they seek only each other. Other people - voyeurs and/or manipulators and/or helpers - try to draw their attention, but these lovers keep eluding anyone else who enters their spheres. The six participants in Cafe Muller are excellent performers, unflinchingly committed. But, even though this piece asks them to do little real dancing, it still shows that they are simply terrible dancers - poorly co-ordinated, effortful (big lumpy calf muscles are a Bausch trademark), imprecise. But then, if Bausch had better dancers, she wouldn't know how to use them. Like so many European theatre artists, she has made a house style out of strain, hysteria and technical inadequacy. As a theatre artist, Bausch is important and can be haunting. In dance (for want of a better word), she has had a fell influence far and wide. She herself performs the most isolated and lonely role in Cafe Muller. It is odd to watch this bleak, unhappy, middle-aged waif and to realise that this is the earth-mother of Eurotrash.</p>

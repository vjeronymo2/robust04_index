			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dixons refinances Belgian offices CODIC, the Belgian property subsidiary of the Dixons electrical retailing group, has refinanced its Beaulieu office development in Brussels with a group of international banks, valuing the site at Pounds 93.3m. But the transaction will not be reflected in Dixons profit and loss account due to expected changes in accounting standards practices. The refinancing, via a new company, Espace Beaulieu, guarantees Codic a minimum level of profit and removes the risk of holding the property in an uncertain market. But, following the recommendations of the proposed Statement of Standard Accounting Practice ED 49, Dixons will treat Espace Beaulieu as a consolidated subsidiary company. 'The reality is that we have transferred the risk and have effectively made a sale, but for projected accounting reasons we have been unable it to register it as a sale,' Mr Robert Shrager, Dixons finance director, said yesterday. 'It will have no immediate effect on the profit and loss account until Espace Beaulieu sells it to a third party when the profit can be recognised.' The refinancing was arranged by Citibank, with ASLK-CGER Bank acting as the senior lead manager.</p>

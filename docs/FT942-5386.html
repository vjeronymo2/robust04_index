			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Boost for bonds Regular readers of the Highest Rates table may have noticed the interest on guaranteed income bonds creeping up over the past few months, particularly on longer-term investments, writes Bethan Hutton. Three months ago, the best rate for a five-year guaranteed income bond was 5.7 per cent net. Two months ago, it was 6.5 per cent, one month ago 6.9 per cent. Now, it has reached 7.45 per cent. Generally, rates are slightly lower for monthly income. Anyone who invested in March will now be regretting it as guaranteed income bonds are fixed-rate, fixed-term investments. The question for anyone considering investing now is whether to hang on for a while in case the trend continues, or to lock in to the present rates in case they fall. Economists have been predicting base rate rises later this year, but fixed investment rates may have risen already to take this into account. Variable rates could still have further to go, however. Chase de Vere's Moneyline says many investors are hedging their bets by dividing their savings between fixed and variable rate accounts until the situation becomes clearer. Many building societies are offering escalator bonds or stepped interest accounts, which start by paying a relatively modest interest rate in the first year and rise by a fixed amount each year for five years. These may appear to offer the best of both worlds in the form of fixed, increasing rates. But, in fact, if interest rates do rise over the five years, the pre-set increases may not be as high as the general increases in variable rates. Also, penalties for early withdrawal tend to be stiff on these accounts - if this is even possible.</p>

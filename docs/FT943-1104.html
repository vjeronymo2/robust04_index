			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / US warns Haiti junta to co-operate after 10 die in clash with marines US officers bluntly warned Haiti's military chiefs yesterday that they must co-operate with the intervention force, after US marines killed 10 Haitians in a fierce gun battle at a police station at the weekend. President Bill Clinton, who will address the UN General Assembly today, said he regretted the loss of life, but vowed US troops would continue to respond to hostile action against them. The outgoing Haitian strongman, General Raoul Cedras, was called, grim-faced, to an airport meeting with the head of the US-led intervention force, General Hugh Shelton, to discuss co-operation and flew by helicopter to the site of the clash in the northern town of Cap Haitien. The US said other officers would be meeting the Haitian military to 'ensure their co-operation'. The clash on Saturday night - the first involving US troops since they landed a week ago - came after steadily rising tension between marines and Haitian authorities in the town. A US officer said pro-democracy demonstrators taunted armed men outside a police station as marines arrived on patrol. When one of the armed men raised a sub-machine gun, a marine shot him dead and a gunfight broke out, the officer said. A US sailor was slightly hurt. Gen Cedras accused the US of atrocities and demanded the court-martial of a marine colonel, but the US brushed aside his angry reaction. Hundreds of jubilant Haitians yesterday ransacked police stations and an army barracks in the town, as soldiers and police abandoned their posts. The crowd carried off beds, tables, desks, electric fans and stacks of papers, before US marines restored order. A leader of the Haitian paramilitary voiced concern that violence could spread to the capital, Port-au-Prince. 'Things are getting tense,' he said. 'I feel in danger from the mobs.' Dozens of demonstrators, emboldened by the presence of US troops in Haiti, staged an unprecedented mock funeral for Gen Cedras outside the airport in Port-au-Prince. Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the US Senate armed services committee and a member of former president Jimmy Carter's team that negotiated the Haitian generals' agreement to leave power, warned there might be more conflict. 'This is the first bad incident we've had involving, directly, American troops, but it won't be the last,' he said. In New York, Mr Clinton last night had talks with UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali on plans for turning over the US mission in Haiti to UN peacekeepers. The weekend gun battle is likely to increase the pressure on the Clinton administration to get US troops out of Haiti as quickly as possible. The exiled president, Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom the US wants restored to power, declared yesterday he would call the Haitian parliament into session on Wednesday to consider the plan to grant an amnesty for the military rulers who ousted him. The military rulers agreed to step down when an amnesty is passed, and the exiled president, who is still in the US, clearly hopes to speed their departure.</p>

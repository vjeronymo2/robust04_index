			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 43. Data Base Searches and Cost Reimbursement for Paperwork Burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters stated that contractor data bases do not contain the type of information that EPA is requesting and, therefore, contractors would not be able to provide complete certifications on conflicts of interest. Other commenters expressed concerns that the development of data bases and the other administrative costs associated with the rule will not be recovered by the contractors and have not been included in the total cost for conflict of interest systems. They recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that EPA provide a mechanism for contractors to recoup these costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not require that contractors establish any particular kind of information retrieval system. EPA recognizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contractors often do not have all of the information readily accessible upon which to base their certifications. Therefore, the certifications contain the statement that the contractor is certifying to the best of its knowledge and belief as of the date of the certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerning the costs associated with the rule and a conflict of interest system, the rule states that costs associated with conflicts of interest may be chargeable to Government contracts under the provisions of FAR Part 31. Following the expiration of the contract, no certifications are required. For expired contracts, which involved efforts at sites, the costs associated with search effort associated with the LOFC clause should be minimal. These post contract costs would normally be allocated to the contractor's bid and proposal pool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Section by Section Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a description of the final rule's EPAAR clauses and our response to comments on the specific clauses and their prescriptions which are not addressed in the preceding general comments section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;71, Organizational Conflicts of Interest <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , is modified to specify that notification of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest should be made prior to commencement of work. However, in emergency situations, work may begin with notification being made within five work days. The clause also identifies specific subcontracts and consultant agreements for which this clause is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of public comment, the following changes have been made to the proposed modification of this clause and its prescription: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The term ``apparent'' has been removed from this clause and all other clauses in the rule in response to comments that the term is vague and difficult to define.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The prescription to this clause, paragraph (c)(1) of EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses, has been redesignated as paragraph (a), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause. In addition, the reference to FAR 9.508&hyph;2 has been removed from this paragraph since FAC 90&hyph;1 removed this section from the FAR. These minor changes have been made to conform with the numbering changes to FAR subpart 9.5 based on FAC 90&hyph;1, and are in accord with public comments urging that the final rule be consistent with any changes to the FAR. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other comments and EPA's response include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Clarification of ``any work''. One commenter requested that the term ``any work'' in paragraph (b) of the clause be clarified. ``Any work'' would generally refer to any billable hours to the issued work assignment. The term ``work assignment'' in this rule includes other similar tasking documents such as a delivery order or a technical direction document. Our intent is for contractors to report potential conflicts prior to beginning work on a contract or a work assignment issued under a contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Immediate reporting of whether a conflict of interest exists. Some commenters objected to EPA's requiring the immediate reporting of whether or not a conflict of interest exists and recommended that such reporting not be required until ten days after a work assignment is issued. Some also pointed out the difficulty in responding without knowledge of future assignments and access to reliable data on PRPs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We disagree. Conflicts of interest must be identified immediately so we can avoid issuing work when a conflict exists. We recognize that contractors may not always have sufficient information to identify all conflicts when work assignments are issued since PRPs are continually being identified, but this should not delay a good faith disclosure of any conflicts that can be identified prior to beginning work. Moreover, in response to comments, the final rule does not require contractors to certify regarding conflicts of interest related to work assignments until 20 days after receipt of the work assignment. (See EPAAR 1552.212&hyph;71, Work Assignments, Alternate I.) Additionally, it should be noted that in emergency situations contractors may begin work immediately with notification to follow within five days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

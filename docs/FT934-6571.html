			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Watchdog urges banks to heed customer needs in product sales Bankers need a separate course in ethics to stop them selling their customers products that may not meet their needs, said the industry's consumer watchdog yesterday. According to Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman, bankers are subject to an increase in commercial pressure to be competitive in their approach to customers. In his annual report Mr Shurman highlighted the pressure to 'oversell' insurance products, saying the commission earned was very profitable. He criticised the banks for not always explaining the limitations of policies clearly enough to potential customers. He added that this was only one example of the increasingly competitive environment. He said banking ethics should be taught as a formal subject to underpin the banking practice code, which is currently being reviewed. According to Mr Shurman's report, the numbers of complaints against banks in the year to September showed signs of levelling out. However, consumer pressure groups said this still left complaints at an unacceptable level. The apparent levelling follows an increase of 60 per cent over the previous 12 months. Mr Shurman said small-business complaints for the six months to the end of September represented just under one-fifth of complaints to the ombudsman. However, the complaints scheme has been open to small companies only since January this year. The numbers are expected to rise next year. The total of new complaints rose to 10,231, compared with 10,109 in the year to September 1992. There was, however, a sharper rise in the number of complaints accepted for full investigation - which the British Bankers' Association says gives a truer picture of the scheme. These rose to 1,111 from 956, an increase of 16 per cent. The average award made was just over Pounds 1,000, but the highest award - to a small company - was Pounds 81,700. Complaints that existing customers had not been told about new deposit accounts with better terms, and reports of difficulties with cash machines have fallen since last year, while mortgage complaints have risen. Mr Shurman urged banks to show more sensitivity even when they were in the right.</p>

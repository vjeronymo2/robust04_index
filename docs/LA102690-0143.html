			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REMEMBERING 'THE GREATEST FIGHTER PLANE IN THE WORLD';  </P> <P> AIRCRAFT: JEAN-LUC BEGHIN FIRST SAW THE P-51 MUSTANG IN THE SKIES OVER EUROPE  DURING WORLD WAR II. THUS BEGAN A LOVE AFFAIR THAT HAS LASTED 46 YEARS.  </P> <P> Though 46 years have passed, the moment remains vivid to Jean-Luc Beghin. He  can still see the planes chasing each other in the skies over war-torn  Brussels. The German plane, he remembers, was dark and menacing. The other, an  American fighter, its engine thundering, was brightly decorated with huge white  stars on its wings and fuselage.  </P> <P> "It was a dogfight," Beghin says of that spring day in 1944. "I was in  kindergarten and all the kids wanted to watch."  </P> <P> Beghin does not remember much about the German plane. "I was only 5 years old  at the time," he explains. But he recalls every detail about the American  fighter and especially the words of one teacher who joined her students staring  up at the sky. "I remember her saying, 'That's a Mustang.' "  </P> <P> The P-51 Mustang. Just the name brings a smile to Beghin. For it was, he says,  more than a fighter plane. It was a symbol. Proud. Flashy. Powerful. "It was my  image of America," he says.  </P> <P> Today, Beghin lives in Westchester, only a mile or so from the former North  American Aviation plant where the P-51 was born and built. And Beghin is among  those celebrating the 50th anniversary today of the fighter's first test flight  over Inglewood.  </P> <P> The 51-year-old artist is completing a pen-and-ink rendition of the aircraft's  cockpit for the French aviation magazine, Info Pilote. The publication's  six-page tribute to the P-51 will be among many celebrations worldwide,  including air shows and exhibits this weekend from Santa Maria, Calif., to  Duxforth, England.  </P> <P> But none of the anniversary tributes will be any more personal than Beghin's.  For the P-51 Mustang inspired Beghin as a boy and launched a love affair with  aviation that continues today, particularly in his pen-and-ink drawings of  aircraft.  </P> <P> "It is my main purpose in life," he says.  </P> <P> From his days as an aviation illustrator for the Belgian Air Force to his  employment today as a flight coordinator for Air France, Beghin's life has  revolved around aviation.  </P> <P> His works, displayed at the Smithsonian Institution and NASA's Houston Museum,  depict aircraft subjects ranging from Charles Lindbergh's "Spirit of St. Louis"  to the Apollo cockpit. In all, about 20 renderings by Beghin have been  commissioned for aviation exhibits and publications.  </P> <P> Now, those works will be joined by Beghin's drawings of the P-51, an aircraft  originally commissioned by the Royal Air Force only months before the United  States joined World War II.  </P> <P> "In 1940, the British were short of fighter planes and came to North American  Aviation, which had built the AT-6 trainer for England," says Beghin, who has  followed the P-51's history since his youth.  </P> <P> Given four months to design and build a new fighter for England, the aircraft  company (later absorbed by Rockwell International) unveiled the P-51 Mustang, a  sleek, soaring aircraft faster than any fighter before it. Soon, the aircraft  established itself as the finest American-built fighter used by the Royal Air  Force.  </P> <P> By the time the United States began purchasing the fighters, the RAF had  replaced the Mustangs' unreliable first engines with 1,600-horsepower engines  built by Rolls-Royce. Later, the same engines, built in the United States by  Packard, were installed in the P-51s commissioned by the U.S. Army Air Corps.  </P> <P> The new engines allowed the P-51 a top speed of 487 miles an hour. And the  addition of auxiliary fuel tanks extended its flying range enough for the  aircraft to escort American bombers all the way from England to Berlin. Those  bombers included the B-17, whose exploits have been popularized in the current  movie, "Memphis Belle."  </P> <P> "It became the greatest fighter plane in the world," says Beghin.  </P> <P> After Germany unveiled the world's first jet fighter, it was a P-51, flown by  the soon-to-be-famous test pilot Chuck Yeager, that downed a Messerschmidt 262.  </P> <P> And of course, when Beghin was a boy, it was a P-51 that he remembers helping  to liberate his homeland.  </P> <P> Over the years, he says, his fascination with the aircraft has never waned.  </P> <P> In 1981, he spoke with the P-51's designer, Edgar Schmued, who lived in Rancho  Palos Verdes and died in 1985. And two months ago, Beghin took his first flight  in a P-51 during a trip to Paris. "When we took off, I had some tears in my  eyes," he says.  </P> <P> Someday, Beghin adds, he will finally finish a book on the P-51 Mustang. "I've  been working on it for some time," he says.  </P> <P> In the meantime, he will continue his drawings. And, he says, there are plenty  of memories of the P-51 that will forever connect him to his youth.  </P> <P> Like the time, just after the war, when Beghin bought package after package of  Belgium chocolate bars, just to collect an aviation history card of the P-51  Mustang. "Some of my friends had the card and I kept buying the chocolate just  to get one. I don't remember how many bars I finally ate," he says.  </P> <P> Or the moment, after Belgium's liberation in September, 1944, when Beghin got  his first close look at one of the aircraft.  </P> <P> "They had a Mustang on display in the public square. I remember going up and  touching the bare metal and seeing the plane up close. The bright colors and  that white star.  </P> <P> "It was," he says, "like Disneyland before its time."  </P></p>

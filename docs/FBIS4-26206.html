			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Group Aims To Improve the Economy"] </F>   [Text] Serving the country's economic development will be  the top priority of the All-China Federation of Returned  Overseas Chinese, said a top official with the group.    Getting overseas Chinese involved in mainland projects will  be encouraged, Yang Taifang, the newly-elected chairman, said at  the final session of the federation's fifth national conference  in Beijing on Saturday.    Co-operation with the overseas Chinese will be expanded to  trade, science and technology, culture and education as well as  hygiene and sports.    Yang encouraged returned overseas Chinese to join the  country's policy-making process.    In January, 1991, the Chinese People's Political  Consultative  Conference, China's top advisory body, for the ruling party and  government, accepted the federation as a group participant.    Yang vowed at the meeting to develop the federation into a  "home to returned Chinese and their relatives."    Yang, 67, is the former minister of Posts and  Telecommunications and has wide connections with overseas  Chinese.    To draft the laws pertaining to overseas Chinese,  legislators  must solicit opinions and suggestions from them. The  federation, in turn, will support the government's efforts to  protect the interests and rights of overseas Chinese and their  relatives, he said.    If necessary, the legislature will set up new projects, Yang  added.    He also said the NPC [National People's Congress] has sent  several teams to investigate and prepare to draft laws that will  protect overseas Chinese investors.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told Congress he expects to give final  approval by August to a plan for restarting nuclear reactors in South Carolina  that make materials for atomic weapons. Watkins told a special panel of the  House Armed Services Committee he had begun reviewing restart recommendations  from Westinghouse Electric Corp., which operates the Savannah River Site  reactors near Aiken, S.C., under an Energy Department contract. The three  reactors, which produce tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads, at  Savannah River have been shut down for nearly a year because of safety  problems.  </P></p>

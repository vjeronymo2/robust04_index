			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Aircraft emissions sky high Considering the number of aircraft in the sky, surprisingly little is heard about their effect on the environment. Yet aircraft emit large quantities of pollutants, often at high altitudes where their effect is greater than at sea level. Leonie Archer's new book* does not claim to break new research ground but puts the case for a more concerted approach to the problem. It is very difficult to measure aircraft emissions at high altitude. Most of the statistics are estimates based on fuel consumption figures. Furthermore, the emission regulations for aircraft were last revised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in 1981 and only apply up to 3,000 feet, after which aircraft are deemed to be 'cruising'. So there is little regulatory pressure on manufacturers to fit cleaner engines. The book suggests there is a consensus that civilian aircraft emit about 550m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year - equivalent to about 3 per cent of the carbon dioxide created by man. Aircraft also account for 2-3 per cent of the nitrous oxide and 0.18 per cent of the sulphur dioxide. These are not alarming amounts, but at high altitudes may damage the ozone layer by enabling acid to form. Aircraft cause the greatest potential damage by emitting water which, when it freezes, creates a thin veil over the sky which could contribute to global warming by reflecting back the earth's heat. There are several ways to restrict the environmental impact of the expected growth in air travel. Technology can improve aerodynamics and engine efficiency. Air traffic control can also be improved to shorten journey times. Archer says much can be done by tightening regulations and researching the impact of aircraft emissions more closely. *Aircraft Emissions and the Environment, by Leonie J. Archer.

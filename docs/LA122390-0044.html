			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMILES AMONG SLUMP  </P> <P> The hand-wringing and wailing in "Dealing With the Downturn" (Dec. 2), makes me  smile. Finally, justice for the greedy.  </P> <P> My spouse and I, in our early 30s, bring home about $50,000 a year before  taxes.  </P> <P> Yet we can't even dream about owning a home.  </P> <P> Perhaps we could qualify for a loan, but we have no money for even a 10% down  payment. We don't have rich relatives who could give or even loan us that  money. At our current level of savings ability, it would take us 15 years to  build up enough for a down payment, and by then the currently exorbitant prices  will only be worse.  </P> <P> But instead of whining about our straits, I'd rather gloat over justice for the  true villains in the "slump." Greedy homeowners, you're the ones twisting the  knife into young adults like us, stuck throwing money away on rentals (which  also are overpriced.  </P> <P> Greedy real-estate agents -- you overdressed folks laughing all the way to the  bank in your sun-roofed Mercedes with multiple cellulars. How obscene that  you've been reaping tens of thousands of dollars per house for some paper work  and phone calls.  </P> <P> Even if the $300,000 home up the street crashed to half-price, my spouse and I  couldn't afford it right now. Experts say even a 25% price drop would come only  with economic catastrophe. But perhaps you homeowners, real estate agents and  others who have profited from a commodity almost as fundamental as food will  take a lesson from this. And reread the lines in the Times articles that  mentioned crowds swarming to affordable properties. No shortage of buyers --  just of fair prices.  </P> <P> T.J.

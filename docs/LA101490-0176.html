			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Syracuse officials refused to allow a female student reporter to enter the  locker room after Saturday's football game against Penn State and forced her to  decide whether all other reporters also would be banned.  </P> <P> Suzanne Yohannan, an assistant sports editor of the Daily Collegian, the Penn  State student newspaper, said she was given the option shortly after Penn  State's 27-21 victory.  </P> <P> "I was approached by a Syracuse sports official who said that the players could  be brought out of the locker room and the locker room itself would be closed to  everyone, or the locker room would be open to all of the press except me,"  Yohannan said.  </P> <P> She said felt pressured by the offer from Larry Kimball, sports information  director at Syracuse.  </P> <P> Yohannan, 21, a senior English major from Allentown, Pa., was accompanied by a  male reporter from her newspaper, and he went into the locker room with other  male reporters.  </P> <P> Kimball said the university has a policy: "The locker room is either open to  everybody or no one."  </P> <P> But, he said, the team bans women.  </P> <P> Penn State's locker room is closed to all reporters. Players are taken into a  separate room for postgame interviews.  </P></p>

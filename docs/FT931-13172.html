			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / The greatest years may lie ahead It is fashionable to argue that the US is a superpower in relative decline. Since the publication in 1987 of historian Paul Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of Great Powers, a succession of pundits has compared the US's position today with that of Britain in the late 19th century. Distracted by global military and diplomatic responsibilities, the argument runs, the US has neglected its economy and ignored festering social problems. The result, as with Britain a century earlier, is a prolonged decline in economic competitiveness that now threatens the US's ability to provide global leadership. In his inaugural address, President Bill Clinton seemed to accept much of this 'declinist' thesis. Speaking metaphorically he said the US was in 'the depth of winter'. He spoke of drift and deadlock, of stagnant wages, of shaken confidence and of increasing inequality. It was time, he claimed, to 'force the spring' and heal a fractured economy and society. Hardly anybody doubts that there is a lot wrong with contemporary America. Lack of access to healthcare, appalling inner-city poverty, racial discrimination and levels of crime far above those in other industrialised countries are all signs of a seriously malfunctioning society. But the broader 'declining superpower' thesis is less compelling. The US has lost economic ground relative to other industrialised countries since 1945, when it produced about half of world output. But this is less a reflection of US decline than of the distorting impact of the second world war, which boosted the US economy while devastating those of Europe and Japan. Once allowance is made for an initial catch-up, the evidence for continuing US decline is, at best, mixed. Surprisingly, the US share of the industrial output of the 24 rich members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is larger today than in 1970. If allowance is made for 'purchasing power parities' (differences in domestic costs), Japan was the only country to advance relative to the US during the 1980s. And OECD calculations suggest Japan's per capita gross domestic product was only about 80 per cent of the US's by the end of the decade. After adjusting for internal purchasing power, the leading European countries failed to make any headway relative to the US in the 1980s; (west) Germany, the most prosperous, ended the decade with living standards about 15 per cent lower than in the US. The US, like other advanced countries, has experienced slower productivity growth since the early 1970s. But it has retained a large absolute advantage. This is true even in manufacturing industry, although Japan and Germany are challenging its dominance in particular sectors. America retains many other socio-economic advantages. It is still easily the least crowded of the large developed economies, with a population density less than 10 per cent of Japan's. This means it can continue to reap the economic benefits of relatively liberal immigration policies. It has a younger population than Japan or most European countries, meaning that it faces less acute fiscal challenges as a result of population ageing. It is better endowed with raw materials and physical capital than most of its competitors. And it has the world's most extensive (and arguably best) system of higher education, which partly compensates for flaws in US high schools. Perhaps the least appreciated US advantage is the fact that it has the lowest per capita tax burden of any OECD country, bar Turkey. This means that the supposedly intractable fiscal problems are not really intractable. If it chooses, the Clinton administration can reduce the budget deficit, increase investment and tackle social problems without imposing tax burdens higher than those already faced by most citizens of most advanced democracies. There is a lot of fiscal wiggle room, even if this is not often apparent to US politicians. So why is there so much fear of decline? It partly reflects a confusion between growing inequality and economic decline. Many families have lost ground because the benefits of economic growth have accrued mainly to the top 30 per cent of the population. This in turn reflects the tighter link between pay and productivity (which reflects education) in an increasingly competitive global economy. 'Declinism' may also be partly media- driven: for 12 years academics and journalists (many of whom are Democrat sympathisers) had an incentive to denigrate the US as a way of discrediting Republican presidents. With their man in the White House, it would not be surprising if the mood now grew more upbeat. Rather than comparing the US with Britain at the end of the 19th century, it might make more sense to compare it with Britain in 1815 after the victory over Napoleonic France. The US, after all, has just won a lengthy and debilitating war against communism. This sapped its economic strength and distorted its national goals, just as did Britain's long struggle for supremacy with France. With a new, energetic president, and with the same party controlling both White House and Congress, the US now has a chance to flower economically, politically and socially. The next 50 years could be its heyday rather than a period of painful decline.</p>

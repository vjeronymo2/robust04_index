			<p>BFN     [Text] Once again, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy has  committed a journalistic "blunder." This time he said he would  make every effort not to dissolve Congress, which caused  commotion in congressional circles. As a way of showing how  "sorry" he was, Wasmosy sent two notes to Congress explaining  his remarks and "renewing" his confidence in Congress. He  expressed profound indignation and vexation over what had been  published in the morning newspapers. His "justification,"  however, has not prevented harsh criticism from both opposition  and official blocs, which termed his attitude as "dangerous" for  democracy.    The president's remark that he would do everything possible  to not dissolve Congress provoked a shower of criticism from  legislators of several blocs. This compelled the chief of state  to clarify his remarks. He sent a note in which he renews his  "confidence" in Congress.    The president's new and controversial remarks were published  by the Argentine newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO. Despite an  attempt to "apologize" to Congress, he was unable to prevent an  overall rebuke from opposition and official blocs for his  remarks, which were termed as an attack on democracy.    Wasmosy's "justification" note arrived at Congress at noon.  He expresses his vexation over the Argentine newspaper report  that he would do everything possible to avoid dissolving  Congress.    Hugo Saguier Caballero, secretary general of the Presidency,  handed the official note to Senate President Evelio Fernandez  Arevalos and Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de  Vargas. Wasmosy's note states: "I am extremely vexed over the  information that appeared in the newspapers today which  indicates that I will do everything to avoid dissolving  Congress."    The note adds: "Unfortunately, the article does not honestly  convey my thoughts. No one can presuppose that I intend  violating express constitutional clauses." Wasmosy emphasizes:  "I deem it necessary to emphasis my decision to use all my  efforts to prevent situations that could harbor the idea of  violating the Constitution."    The note concludes: "I believe it is neccessary for me to  address these lines to you with the sole intention of renewing  my confidence and my hope of good governing through the  rectitude and honor of the members of Congress."</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUMBER OF CHILDREN GOING TO FOSTER HOMES GROWING  </P> <P> The number of California children going into foster homes is increasing at an  alarming rate, and until preventive measures are taken the figure is expected  to continue rising, according to a report issued Thursday by a coalition of  children's welfare groups.  </P> <P> The Chief Probation Officers Assn. of California, the County Welfare Directors  Assn. of California, the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services  and 14 other groups released the report during a news conference at a  children's service center in Hollywood.  </P> <P> The report's findings support a pair of legislative proposals that would direct  more of the state's child welfare money to services that will help families  remain intact.  </P> <P> "Our state is really upside down in the way it approaches the family care  issue," said Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), author of the two bills.  "Our attention has all gone into placing children in foster homes -- the most  expensive and least effective use of money."  </P> <P> The report states that California has "over-invested" in foster care programs,  and that for every $10 of the $875 million spent last year on housing displaced  children in California, about $1 is spent on programs that try to keep children  and their parents together. Los Angeles County alone spent $186 million for  foster care last year.  </P> <P> Because so little money went to preventive programs, the number of children in  out-of-home care statewide increased by 65% between 1985 and 1989, the report  said. More disturbing, the report stated, the number of infants in foster care  rose by 235% during the same period. In the state, about 4,400 infants were in  foster care in 1989.  </P> <P> Anne Powell, a consultant to Bronzan, said his bill takes into account the  "disproportionately high number of minority children who are being placed"  outside of the home.  </P> <P> "The bill states that preference be given to serving minority communities," she  said. "We are not doing a very good job of reaching those families."  </P> <P> Many factors lead to children being separated from their parents, said Los  Angeles County Superior Court Judge Paul Boland. Parents' drug use, their lack  of parenting knowledge and a lack of affordable child care are some, said  Boland, who presides over the court's juvenile departments.  </P> <P> The Assembly bill proposes that some of the funds now being used for foster  care be applied to drug treatment, parenting instruction -- particularly  classes for new mothers -- and an emergency fund to help pay for minor home  repairs, furniture, and unexpected transportation costs, the report stated.  </P> <P> About 18,000 cases of child abuse or neglect entered the county court system  last year. In about two-thirds of those cases, Boland said, the child was sent  to live with relatives, in a county-funded group home, or with a foster family.  Boland estimated that half of the "out-of-home placements" can be avoided if  more emphasis were placed on prevention.  </P></p>

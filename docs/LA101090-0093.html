			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / TREASURER;  </P> <P> BROWN SEEKS TO TIE HAYES TO CLAIMS OF BOND MONEY MISUSE  </P> <P> California Health Facilities Financing Authority, incumbent Treasurer Thomas W.  Hayes and others are being sued by two counties for allegedly mismanaging a  $200-million health facilities bond issue, according to documents released  Tuesday by Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate for treasurer.  </P> <P> Santa Cruz and Stanislaus counties contend in the unusual legal action that  they have lost millions in interest payments while investment bankers, brokers  and even the health facilities' authority have reaped huge financial benefits  from handling the $200-million bond issue.  </P> <P> The bond issue touches the administrations of the three officials who have held  the office since 1986: the late Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh, who died in August,  1987; Elizabeth M. Whitney, a former Unruh aide who served as acting treasurer,  and Hayes, who was confirmed in January, 1989, and is running for the office as  a Republican.  </P> <P> The Hayes campaign immediately denounced the release, contending that both the  lawsuit and Brown's press statements were politically motivated and meant to  embarrass Hayes.  </P> <P> Hayes aides, in turn, released a petition filed by the office of Atty. Gen.  John K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat, seeking to dismiss the case. It argues, in  part, that "it is highly likely that Hayes was named solely for the damage it  could bring to him and his reputation."  </P> <P> Specifically, the suit, which was filed in San Jose and alleges securities  fraud, asks a federal court to freeze interest earnings from the $200-million  proceeds of the health facilities bond sale.  </P> <P> Since 1986, only $56 million of the $200 million has actually been lent to  nonprofit agencies to construct health facilities. The counties contend that a  Swiss bank, with a branch in the Cayman Islands, alone earned $2.7 million in  loan administration fees "during a period when virtually no loans were  approved." Fees also were earned by E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. and Lehman Bros.  Inc., both of which also were named in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> The suit is the first to be filed by an agency served by the California Health  Facilities Financing Authority.  </P> <P> In January, before the suit was filed, two Santa Cruz County supervisors wrote  Hayes a letter complaining that "the chief beneficiaries of the bond issue seem  to have been the financial institutions and law and accounting firms which  acted with or for the (health facilities) authority."  </P> <P> William M. Marticorena, a Costa Mesa attorney who is representing Santa Cruz  and Stanislaus counties, said, "The state sold this program as a means to help  counties provide health facilities at a low cost. Unfortunately, a whole lot of  people made a whole lot of money -- everyone except the counties."  </P> <P> Marticorena conceded that many of the causes of action listed in the suit  occurred before Hayes became treasurer. But he said that for the last six  months, Hayes' office has been heavily involved in the program.  </P> <P> Suzanne Burton, an assistant state treasurer who sits on the health facilities  authority as a proxy for Hayes, called the suit "nonsense." She said all fees  paid to banks, lawyers and consultants were strictly in line with industry  standards.  </P> <P> Brown said even though much of the action occurred before Hayes took office he  should have stepped in and seen to it that the bond money went for health  facilities. "This is another example of Hayes being asleep at the switch," she  said.  </P> <P> The issue marks the latest chapter in the bruising race between Brown and Hayes  for the treasurer's job.  </P> <P> Last week, Hayes cited a report by the California Commission on State  Government Organization and Economy, known also as the Little Hoover  Commission, sharply criticizing financial practices of the Los Angeles Unified  School District during the six years Brown served on that board.  </P> <P> Among other things that Hayes pointed to was a commission finding that the  district had "mismanaged" $1.8 billion in taxpayer dollars during the decade of  the 1970s.  </P> <P> Brown said she so far has been unable to obtain a copy of the report and would  not comment until she did. "I will have a specific response after I've had a  chance to look at it," she said.  </P></p>

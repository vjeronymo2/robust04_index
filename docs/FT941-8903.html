			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Health reforms to be widened: GPs faced with radical extension of fundholding scheme The government plans a radical extension of the National Health Service reforms, with all Britain's general practitioners becoming purchasers of hospital services in the internal market. Plans agreed by the Department of Health will force GPs to choose between being fundholders buying services on behalf of patients from hospitals, or delegating their purchases to a new administrator - a fundholder manager linked to a district health authority. The department also intends to provide purchasers of medical services with improved information about the efficiency of individual hospitals by introducing two new performance measures. The government is determined to push the GP fundholder scheme, launched in 1991, to the point where all GPs will take part in the market for hospital services. One health department official said: 'The way to counter the two-tier arrangement (in which fundholding GPs are said to have unfair advantages over non-fundholders) is to push forward with the reforms.' The introduction of such a system could upset the medical profession, which has been promised that GPs will not be forced to become fundholders. At present, when a non-fundholder GP sends a patient to a hospital the costs of the treatment are met by the district health authority. Under the new proposals, fundholder managers would manage the health purchase budgets of small groups of doctors. Ministers have not yet outlined the fine detail of the relationship. However, in consultation with their GPs, the managers would aim to ensure that the provision of services by hospitals is more closely matched to demand. The critical unanswered question is the extent to which GPs would be asked to turn over decision-making to administrators on which hospitals their patients would use, and which services would be purchased for them. At present, 6,000 GPs in 1,000 practices manage their own budgets as fundholders. They cover a quarter of the population. However, ministers believe there will be a significant increase on April 1 when the next batch is due to sign up, extending coverage to a third of the population. One of the new hospital performance measures is an index of labour productivity, which compares the amount of work done by individual hospitals with the number and cost of their staff. The other measure compares the length of stay in hospital for a particular kind of treatment with a benchmark length of stay, and is intended to be a proxy of the relative cost of treatment. Both sets of data are already being collected and used on an experimental basis. The information is likely to be made available to all fundholder GPs and district health authorities. The publication of the figures may encourage private operators to offer services in direct competition to health service hospitals that fail to increase output or bring down costs per admission.

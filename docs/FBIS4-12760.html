			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Hopeless Israeli Maneuver"] </F>   [Excerpts] At a time when the Palestinians are doing all  in their power to conclude the negotiations on implementing the  Gaza-Jericho First accord and are being subjected to immense  pressure by various parties to make concessions to Israel, so  much so that they have nothing more to concede, the Palestinian  people in the occupied territories are being subjected to a  different kind of pressure. Israel has arbitrarily imposed  blockades and an economic siege on them. This situation has  alienated the people and the leadership from the accord and  implementation. Clearly, by this policy, Israel wants to create  a rift between the leadership and the people. If pressure on  the people in the occupied territories is coupled with  concessions by the negotiators abroad, the result will be -- or  so Israel thinks -- that trust between the inside and outside  will be shaken. If this is the aim of the multipronged  offensive, Israel and the United States will discover that this  policy will fail because the Palestinians, who have been burned  by the fire of repeated offensives, know how to wage these  battles. This policy will not succeed in paralyzing the  Palestinians' power of confrontation. [passage omitted]    Israel has repeatedly tried to avoid dealing with the PLO to  no avail. Ultimately, it was forced to conclude the Oslo accord  with the PLO. Has Israel returned to its old attempts to  confuse the Palestinians and raise doubts about the Palestinian  people's real address? As if they can find another address to  peddle their schemes and avoid commitment to the Oslo accord's  clauses, or at best to implement the accord in accordance with  the Israeli interpretation. Israel fails to realize that all  these attempts are doomed to failure. It would be better for  Israel to accelerate implementation of the peace process in a  way that responds to legitimate Palestinian demands. This is  the only way to prevent the deterioration of the situation and  stop acts of violence from both sides.    The situation cannot endure maneuvering and foot-dragging.  Israel might be thinking that time is on its side. This may be  so in the short-term, but over the long-term Israel will realize  that it has lost a golden opportunity for achieving a settlement  with the Palestinians. If Israel is betting on fragmenting the  Palestinian people's national fabric, this is not in its  interest because it will have to return to square one, namely,  to the cycles of the conflict from the beginning. If today  Israel is rejecting the Palestinian address, in the future it  will find not one but several addresses for negotiations -- one  more radical than the other.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> NATIONALISM IS WHAT KEEPS GAME AFLOAT, DESPITE STALL TACTICS  </P> <P> Surely it is the nationalism that makes the World Cup riveting. It can't be the  soccer -- the stultifying, four-corners,  sit-tight-and-hope-we-win-the-penalty-shoot-out mentality that has clamped down  even tighter since first-round pool play ended 10 days ago.  </P> <P> The argument that the sport is not broken is the estimate, by organizers of  Italia '90, that a record 1 billion will watch the July 8 championship game on  worldwide television, that a TV audience of 26.5 billion will have seen the  monthlong tournament and that the 52 World Cup games will have been attended by  an average of 53,000 per game.  </P> <P> But the argument that soccer needs fixing is on the field, where nothing  happens most of the time and not much happens all of the time. Even people who  dearly love soccer -- Europeans and South Americans who have grown up following  the game passionately -- sat fidgeting and sighing in front of the dreadful,  no-initiative quarterfinal between Argentina and Yugoslavia. Asked late in the  game if the score still was 0-0, one of the faithful grumbled: "At the very  best." A 0-0 score gave that game too much credit.  </P> <P> Today, the semifinals began with what appears to be a worthy final four of  soccer powers: host Italy, three times the World Cup champion, against  Argentina, the defending champion. It is followed Wednesday by England, lordly  inventor of the sport, against West Germany, now in its eighth semifinal in the  last 10 World Cups.  </P> <P> In fact, though, two of those sides are still alive mostly because of soccer's  vagaries: Argentina (2-1-2) has been described as "looking as though it is  tired of holding the Cup." And England (3-0-2, with two of the wins coming in  overtime) mostly has appeared incapable of hitting the water if it fell out of  a boat.  </P> <P> Even Italy (5-0-0) has scored only seven goals, and four of those by former  bench warmer Salvatore Schillaci. "Salvatore" means "Savior," and for all of  Italy's lovely passing in midfield, it certainly needed saving.  </P> <P> At least West Germany (4-0-1) can score a bit; it has 13 goals so far, although  nine of those came in the two first-round games against the United Arab  Emirates and Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> Naturally, winning coaches will not stand still for criticism of their styles  of play, and criticism is hurled at them daily by the soccer-daft Europeans.  But the level of excitement has been sinking so low in this tournament, most of  the talk is of boredom. Through the first two rounds -- the first 44 games --  there was an average of one goal per 40 minutes of playing time.  </P> <P> Yet winning counts more than creativity, as Brazil, more artistic than most but  less so than it used to be, learned when it was upset by Argentina, which may  be the worst team in this World Cup if not for two brief works of art by Diego  Maradona -- and Sunday's crazy penalty shoot-out.  </P> <P> So far, the desperation that Cameroon's instinctive play wrung from its  opponents has given the tournament its best time. But Cameroon is gone now, and  old discussions of possible solutions to soccer's mental and physical lock-step  are raging.  </P> <P> Should soccer officials expand the World Cup field from 24 to 32 teams (a  probability) in 1994, and play single-elimination from the beginning instead of  first-round pool play? Should they mix the 32-team field with a first-round  knockout format, go to pool play with the remaining 16 in four groups, to set  up the semifinals with the group winners?  </P> <P> Which system -- if any -- better guards against playing for ties just to  advance?  </P> <P> And should they ditch penalty shoot-outs for play-to-the-death overtime? That  format once produced 17 quarter-hour overtimes in an NAIA game and was really  dull. Should they break ties by counting the corner kicks in games? Should they  decide ties by alternating corner kicks instead of penalty shots?  </P> <P> With 1 billion people on the edges of their seats to see the championship  telecast, don't get your hopes up for change.  </P></p>

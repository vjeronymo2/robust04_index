			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scheme designed for long-term unemployed Sir, While your paper's interest in the worsening problem of very long-term unemployment is to be applauded, your report of our institute's evaluation of the pilot Workstart schemes is misleading ('Work scheme misses short-term jobless', December 16). The Workstart pilots were explicitly designed to help the very long-term unemployed back into jobs. It is therefore hardly surprising that the pilots 'miss the short-term jobless', as your headline states. Workstart has never sought to help the short-term unemployed, and they are specifically excluded from its ambit. Furthermore, your report states that 'just under half of the employers who participated in the scheme . . . hired a long-term unemployed person, where they would previously have recruited someone out of work for less than two years'. This is not so. Our research found that, in the absence of a subsidy, just under half of these employers would have hired someone other than the very long-term unemployed, that is including, but not exclusively, the short-term unemployed. The correct figure for the short-term unemployed is 22 per cent. What is needed now is to ensure that the new generation of Workstart-like initiatives announced in the Budget learn the lessons of the pilot schemes. Your report does not help this much.

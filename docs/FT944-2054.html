			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Property: Carden Park up for sale - Cadogan's Place Receivers have put developer John Broome's project, Carden Park, Cheshire, on the market, at the request of the Bank of Scotland. Broome had set out to produce a hotel, golf, leisure and sport resort of outstanding quality, spending Pounds 23m in the process. Carden opened in October 1993 in 730 acres. Broome has established an 18-hole irrigated golf course on ground that varies between pine woods, parkland and water meadows. Its complement is a beautifully-built golf academy with a 13-bay driving range. Carden also offers pheasant shooting on the estate, rough and driven, with rights over a further 1,400 acres of adjacent land. There is also fishing and rallying. Croquet is the surprise. Broome laid down a 4.5-acre croquet lawn, of world championship standards, which looks big enough to hold 10 games simultaneously. A vineyard above the croquet lawn produces a thoroughly drinkable Seyval Blanc - the grapes go south to Bletchley for pressing - and there are plans for a swimming pool and exercise centre in the walled kitchen garden. The garden is some distance from the site of the former 'big house', a typical Cheshire hall in black and white timbering that burnt down in 1912. There is a large deer park and Broome's plan was to build a new big house, or an 80-bedroom extension to the hotel, on the site of the old hall. The hotel is set out in nine blocks around paved yards, and the rooms classed as ambassador (lowest), earl, duke or Prince of Wales (one only). All categories are of unusual comfort and luxury. There are also self-catering cottages. Situated near Manchester and Liverpool, and not too far from Birmingham, this no-expenses-spared development should be a sure success, especially for the corporate market and for croquet competitions. Savills (0295-263535) has not indicated a guide price but the sum already spent gives a top limit. It still needs Pounds 2m-3m for the exercise centre, a clubhouse for the golf course and a central lounge/bar in the hotel. Covered walkways between the hotel blocks would also be welcome. A full information pack is available to serious potential buyers for Pounds 150, plus VAT. This grand scheme is so nearly complete, and is so well done, that a good profit must lie in store. Not, alas, for Broome, creator of the highly successful Alton Towers amusement park, which now belongs to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. * * * In the US, a superb conceit of a house is on sale in Irvington-on-Hudson, 40 minutes by train from Manhattan. I should love to have it. The octagonal Armour-Stiner house, at 45 West Clinton Avenue, was built in 1872 and has three acres. It combines the style of Beaux Arts Paris at its most extravagant with a big traditional American porch with cast iron railings and elaborate columns and capitals. On top of the dome is an observatory with views of the Hudson river and the Palisades. The price is a negotiable Dollars 2.45m (Pounds 1.49m). Inquiries to Fern Masters of William B May (914-591-8984). * * * No 12 Eaton Square, London SW1, is one of the last seven houses in the square in single family use. Well-renovated and rich in marble, granite and wood, this is an important, traditional property. Its asking price, from Cluttons London Residential (071-584 2044) or De Groot Collis (071-235 8090), is Pounds 6.75m, with a ground rent, at present, of Pounds 6,000. It has a small patio garden at the back. * * * For Dollars 4m, you can escape to a ranch of 120,000 acres in Tanzania, 185 miles north of Dar es Salaam. Mkwaja Ranch has 11,000 head of cattle, a private beach on the Indian Ocean, an airstrip and its own game reserve with elephants, hippos, giraffes, lions, hyenas, monkeys and many more species.

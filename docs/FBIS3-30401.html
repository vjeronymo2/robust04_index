			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 3 (AFP) -- A convoy of British  armoured military troop transporters headed Thursday to break a  Bosnian Serb blockade west of Sarajevo with instructions to use  force if necessary.    The force of four or five vehicles will negotiate first, and  "use force if necessary," if Bosnian Serb forces did not lift a  two-day blockade of UN forces using a key route between Sarajevo  and central Bosnia, said UN spokesman Major Jose Labandeira.    All tracked UN vehicles have been prevented from passing the  blockade at Kobiljaca, around 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of  the Bosnian capital.    The blockade contravenes a Geneva agreement reached on  November 18 guaranteeing free movement of UN peacekeeping  forces, said Labandeira. The military leadership of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] forces in Bosnia was "determined" to exercise  the right of free movement, he added.    A British officer was shot in the shoulder Wednesday as he  patrolled in an unprotected vehicle on the "Diamond Route" in  central Bosnia. The officer, whose life was not in danger, was  evacuated from the British military base at Vitez. Gunfire came  from Bosnian Croat positions.    British troops in an armoured "Warrior" armoured personnel  carrier fired shots over the heads of a crowd which tried to  ransack lorries carrying aid at Opara, on the "Diamond Route"  between Novi Travnik and Gornji Vakuf in central Bosnia, the  spokesman added. The crowd dispersed after a few shots were  fired.    Relative calm in Sarajevo on Wednesday was broken overnight  by a bombardment with 395 incoming shells, while 24 shells were  fired from the city, UN forces said.    A French sentry at the Skenderija base, south of Sarajevo,  came under sniper fire but was not injured, the spokesman said.  The sniper fire was not returned, he added.</p>

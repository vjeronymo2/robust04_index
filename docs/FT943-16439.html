			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Caldera critics face wave of security raids Venezuelan security forces have carried out a wave of raids in recent days using the special powers assumed last week by the government of President Rafael Caldera. The raids have been directed at retailers, to prevent what the government calls 'hoarding and speculation'; slum city dwellers, to round up violent criminals; and prominent individuals, in connection with alleged efforts to destabilise the government. On June 27, Mr Caldera announced the suspension of six constitutional civil and economic rights, giving the police broad powers of search, seizure and arrest only previously used during uprisings. Since last Thursday, security forces have visited the homes of Mr Orlando Castro, who owns a radio station that has been critical of the Caldera government; retired army general Carlos Santiago Ramirez; and Mr Anibal Romero, a political science professor and a sharp critic of Mr Caldera, among others. Maj-Gen Rafael Montero, the defence minister, said at the weekend that the raids were part of an intelligence operation that would be continuing. Appearing before a congressional committee recently, the general said the security forces were investigating groups on the left and right that were trying to destabilise Venezuela's democratic system. Press reports suggest at least 10 prominent individuals are being held by security forces and that hundreds of youths have been detained following raids on the slum cities. Mr Romero, whose home in Caracas was visited at night by a group of heavily-armed state security (Disip) agents, said he later met the Disip director and answered some 'general questions'.</p>

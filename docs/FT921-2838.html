			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A NERVOUS futures market fell away in volatile trading as investors acted cautiously in the wake of little concrete news to drive sentiment, writes Christopher Price. The March contract opened at 2,482 and initially edged ahead as a small number of buyers came into the market, squeezing it higher. However, many traders were keen to unwind their positions in a jittery session and sellers soon moved into the fray compounded by independent traders being caught short. By 9.30am March was down to 2,455. Support was found from the cash market and a recovery began, March moving up to 2,473 by midday. With Wall Street opening weak, however, March came under renewed pressure, and although it held ground most of the afternoon, a late selling spree saw the contract close at 2,462, down 5 from the previous session and at a discount of nearly 11 to its four-point fair value premium to cash. Turnover came to 7,319 contracts. In traded options, nearly half of the 33,000 contracts dealt were in the FT-SE 100 or Euro FT-SE. Asda was the top traded equity contract, followed by Barclays - the March 360 puts were particularly in demand - and Glaxo.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Klaus </F> Bresser and Klaus-Peter Siegloch; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Siegloch] Mr. Kohl, there are more important  issues than the election campaign in Germany. A war is going on  in the center of Europe, in the former Yugoslavia. On Monday  [21 February] the NATO ultimatum is going to expire. Would you  also be in favor of air strikes if the Serbs were to fail to  completely withdraw their heavy weapons by then?    [Kohl] Yes, I have said right from the beginning that I  think that the decision that NATO made, also with our support,  is right. Still, I think that in the hours until Monday every  chance should be used to bring some reason to the situation,  even in the very last minute.    [Bresser] The situation is deteriorating. You have just  talked to President Clinton on the telephone, and yesterday to  President Yeltsin, and you are planning to talk to him on the  phone again tomorrow morning. If air strikes are actually  carried out on Bosnian territory will the Russians permit the  situation to escalate to a conflict?    [Kohl] Nobody can say that exactly. Together with others, I  am trying to convince the Russian leadership, above all Boris  Yeltsin himself, that the present state of affairs is  intolerable.    [Bresser] He is not convinced yet?    [Kohl] I cannot quite say that for sure, at the moment, but  there is tremendous domestic pressure. After all, Russia is the  old protective power for the Serbs. There is great pressure in  Moscow, in parliament, and elsewhere. Still, I think it is  important that we now take advantage of the excellent contacts  that have developed, not least between the U.S. and the Russian  presidents, and also with us. One of the problems that I see is  the psychological situation, something that is difficult to pin  down. Russia is not part of NATO, Russia is no longer the Soviet  Union. The time when NATO and the Warsaw Pact were standing face  to face is over. Now there are major psychological problems,  and Russia is wondering whether the West will act unilaterally.  This has a lot to do with Russia's prestige and pride. And I  think that talks in this connection are still necessary.    [Siegloch] Still, many people here are asking themselves:  What will Germany's role be? Can we really keep out of it if  things continue to deteriorate. Considering the dying in  Bosnia, do we not, at least, have to provide medical units?    [Kohl] Well, first of all, the constitutional situation  remains the way it is, at least in principle. I regret that,  and if I had had my way we would have changed the constitution a  long time ago. I regard the current situation as absolutely  impossible and unbearable. We are all, not least the foreign  minister and I, constantly finding ourselves in most awkward  situations. We give advice and questions then remain in the air.  So far we have encountered a lot of understanding for our  situation. However, it will not stay like that. We will have a  decision from Karlsruhe in the foreseeable future, and I hope it  is a decision that will finally restore our ability to act.  That is one thing.    The other is that, even if our constitution had been changed  or interpreted as I would like, the question remains whether,  after the historic events between 1941 and 1945, the Germans  would now be the proper partners.    [Siegloch] Not even by providing medical units?    [Kohl] I will come back to this issue. I am now speaking  generally regarding combat forces which I am not in favor of it.  I have always said that, and I think history is still very much  alive in this connection. It is a completely different matter  where decisions have to be made about what we can do to help,  for example as far as logistical support is concerned, which  might, of course, include medical support. In that case, I  would be in favor of going to the very limit of what is possible.    [Bresser] Does that also mean the Bosnian border, or are you  thinking of logistical support within Bosnia?    [Kohl] This would then have to be considered very carefully.  Still, I want the world to realize that the Germans also want to  help if they get involved, particularly in the sphere of  humanitarian help that benefits people.    [Bresser] Mr. Chancellor, foreign policy could become an  issue in the election campaign, particularly if extremist forces  were to seize power in Russia. With a view to the ultimatum,  Zhirinovskiy has once more threatened World War III. Do people  here need to be scared again?    [Kohl] I think that one thing has become clear -- it has  been clear all the time but has become more obvious again now --  namely that we did not enter a peaceful world overnight, but  that the evil spirits that have dominated this century are not  dead, and they do not only reside in the Balkans but can  emigrate from there at any time. Specifically, for me this  means that, despite all problems in terms of domestic policy,  what Bismarck said remains true --that a country's peace and  freedom, and, we would add today, its prosperity -- depend on  foreign and security policy. We can do what we like in domestic  policy, but as long as peace and freedom are not protected it  will all have been in vain. There are now six years to go to  the end of the century, a century that has witnessed enough  misery, suffering, and death, and we must now do everything to  take what precautions we can. That is why I am such a  passionate advocate of European unification. Not first and  foremost because of the most important economic advantages we  can derive from Europe, but because only a really unified Europe  that is able to act jointly in foreign, security, and military  policy -- along with the Americans in NATO, for example -- only  such a Europe can prevent war in our region. This is the most  important argument for European unification.    [Siegloch] Chancellor, this is an election year. Whether  foreign policy will play a central role, remains to be seen. In  any case, unemployment will play a central role. For the first  time, there are more than 4 million unemployed, and many more  people fear that they might lose their jobs. When will it get  better, when will the number of unemployed go down again?    [Kohl] The problem we are now facing is that failures are  becoming apparent that have built up over many years, failures  by almost all groups. It has not been a normal recession as we  usually have it every eight, nine, or 10 years. If that were  the case we would get out of it fairly quickly. What we are  experiencing now are structural weaknesses becoming apparent.  And we can only stop and cut unemployment if we start making  decisions now, in spite of it being an election year, that will  improve our situation and start thinking anew. Anybody who  talks about maintaining the status quo will lose the future.  There are many examples of this. Just think of the many issues  that have not been dealt with over the years, like privatization  of the post office and railroad. That means modernization, new  jobs -- tens of thousands in the post office --  telecommunications technology. This means something quite  specific. The legal framework has been created. And now we will  have to work on it. Take the Dutch, whose situation is similar  to ours which allows comparisons. Some 34-35 percent of Dutch  jobs are part-time. In Germany it is just under 15 percent. We  have 2.5 million people in Germany who work full time but would  like to work part time. We could introduce these jobs tomorrow.  All the conditions are there, if the companies, employers,  employees, and the state as well -- we have made our mistakes as  well, we have not done enough, I have now given the whole thing  a push -- if we did a bit more about it. Let me just say  something about part-time work, because this is often  misunderstood: There could be other solutions, it need not be  either in the morning or afternoon. It could be various days, a  week in a row. There are plenty of ideas.    [Siegloch] But this will only solve part of the basic  problem. Even if the economy picks up, unemployment will stay.  Production is increased, with the number of jobs declining.  Companies might also move to the cheaper countries.    [Kohl] We can, of course, do something about that.    [Siegloch] What is the government doing about whole sectors  of the population being paralyzed, so to speak, because they are  out of work on a permanent basis?    [Kohl] First of all, we have to clarify something. Creating  jobs is not primarily something the government has to do, but it  is something that concerns everybody. It is above all an issue  industry has to deal with. The government has to create  framework conditions.    [Bresser] Economic policy is made by the economy. Do you  share this view?    [Kohl] Economic policy is made by the economy to a very  great extent, with the economy also meaning the partners in pay  negotiations. We are one of the two important exporting  countries in the world, the second after Japan. Up to now we  have always regarded Asia as competition: Taiwan, the People's  Republic of China, Hong Kong. Now we have competition on our  doorstep; and we want to have it there. We want the Russians to  come to terms with the market economy and democracy, just like  the Poles, the Hungarians, the Czechs, the Slovaks. One does  not have to go to Taiwan to compare wages. I have just looked  at a big company working in both countries. A metalworker in  Mannheim earns 46 German marks [DM] an hour, his counterpart in  Brno [Czech Republic] gets DM3.    [Bresser] Does this mean you are in favor of cutting wages?    [Kohl] No, this would not get us any further. Wages in the  Czech Republic will go up as well. No, we must do a number of  things in saving wages and ancillary wage costs. We must have  new ideas. It is quite absurd that until recently we have had  the shortest machine operating hours -- this is now beginning to  change. This is a homemade German problem. Among the 12 EU  countries, we are in 11th with the most expensive machinery and  particularly short operating hours. All of a sudden, there are  examples: the big car manufacturer in Kaiserslautern, where  completely new shift systems are being introduced, and where  greater continuity in production is being achieved. All of us  -- and I say this without blaming anybody -- will have to ask  ourselves whether during the past 20 years we did not think too  little about the future. And this is the only way to cut  unemployment, or to get it to a more acceptable level. We will  not be able to do away with it altogether in the foreseeable  future.    [Siegloch] Mr. Chancellor, you have called for longer  machine-running times -- O.K. But you have also said that we  should all work longer hours. On the other hand, people at  Volkswagen have said that the reduced amount of work has to be  distributed more evenly. So who is right?    [Kohl] I do not see a contradiction here. Volkswagen has  not offered a permanent solution -- after all, we are talking of  unemployment over an extended period of time -- but a temporary  solution. The other question can easily be answered when one  looks at demographic figures. For almost 30 years we have been  the country with the lowest birthrate in the world. We can be  proud of positive developments as far as health care is  concerned. In the year 2000 we will have more than 3 million  citizens above the age of 80. Look at these developments: a  reduction -- a major reduction -- in the number of children that  are born. We no longer have a population pyramid, and there are  many more elderly people. When I also look at the fact that  last year -- 1993 --the average retirement age of men was 59;  when I see that university graduates in the natural sciences are  30 years old when they enter professional life; that means 30  years of training, 30 years of professional life, and 20 years  of average life expectancy in retirement; this makes 50 against  30 years, and that cannot work out.    [Siegloch] As far as pensions are concerned you are  certainly right. Yet if we all were to work harder and longer  hours, could we then not make do with even a smaller work force?    [Kohl] We need a larger work force. There are many areas  where we do not yet have sufficient labor. We are engaged in an  -- excuse my language -- idiotic controversy over the  nursing-care insurance.    [Bresser] We will come back to that.    [Kohl] Let us discuss the nursing-care insurance now.  People are getting older, the number of single people has  dramatically increased: in many big German cities more than 50  percent of all households. It means that the generation that is  now becoming older will also require nursing-care, because the  traditional family structures no longer exist. At the moment we  have 30 days of annual leave, and 12-14 holidays. This makes  eight weeks of vacation --one of the longest periods of vacation  in the world. And now we are arguing about two holidays; we  should not abolish them but just not pay wages for them, or  those who so choose could give up two days of annual leave.    [Bresser] Mr. Chancellor, this is a good example of what  people mean when they say today that nothing is going on in Bonn  any more, no problems are being tackled. The question is why  have you haven't long since reached agreement with the Social  Democratic Party [SPD] on the issue of the nursing-care  insurance, because what the SPD is meanwhile requesting is  exactly what your Minister Bluem originally proposed?    [Kohl] Excuse me, we have failed to reach agreement with the  SPD on two issues, because the SPD has made it a dogma that wage  payments cannot be suspended for two holidays. This is a  position that I absolutely cannot understand. I am in favor of  protecting the system of autonomous wage negotiations. Still,  this system would not collapse if we said that we need the wages  of two holidays for nursing-care insurance. And here comes the  SPD's second objection, something that Bluem made clear in his  earlier calculations: One unpaid holiday might just be enough  for the time being -- for the time being. Yet, what about the  future? I am strictly against putting any new additional burden  on the economy, particularly on medium-sized businesses. We  will soon see that calculations that have been made so far were  much too tight -- this is always the case in the sphere of  social policy -- and that we will need more.    [Siegloch] But, Mr. Chancellor, why do you not simply make a  start. The first step could be to finance nursing-care in  people's homes through one day of unpaid leave. And then you  could say that in two or three years one could look how it is  working and maybe revise the calculations?    [Kohl] Well, in two or three years this would, of course,  not work. The communities need clear decisions. For me  personally as federal chancellor, this is not the most pressing  question. Yet the institutions, the insurers, and local  communities need clear regulations. I am ready for a compromise  in which we say: let us now vote on the two days and add a [word  indistinct] clause, which would clarify things in two or three  years -- this clause would never be used; and everybody in the  SPD knows that also; after all, everybody in the SPD knows that  it would not work in any other way. What is at stake now is the  election, not nursing-care insurance. If it were nursing-care  insurance, and we were to have a free vote, there can be no  doubt that there would be a huge majority for this model in the  Bundestag. It is impossible to tell anyone that a country where  everybody has eight weeks of leave a year -- including public  holidays -- is not able not to pay wages for two days of holiday  -- because the two holidays would remain -- or that people  should not be able to give up two days of vacation.    [Bresser] Let us talk about social policies. An  increasing number of people are no longer covered by  unemployment insurance but have to resort to social welfare. It  is the poorest of the poor that the austerity measures of your  government mainly affect. Is one of the reasons you are  pursuing those the fact that you sometimes think that these  people will not vote for you anyway?    [Kohl] No, not at all. You are not talking about reality.  Your statement that we are reducing expenditure for the poorest  of the poor is simply propaganda. We are saving in all areas.  We just talked about security. We will have to save over DM1  billion with the Bundeswehr, which is particularly hard for me.  This really affects the basic issues of security and freedom in  our country.    [Bresser] But unemployment benefits are being reduced.    [Kohl] I will talk about this in a minute. Let me first  give you another example. Another measure that was extremely  difficult for me was the reduction in funding for transportation  for this year. Thus, if you think logically, investments are the  most important thing. We just mentioned jobs. The more  investments the state carries out, and the less we concentrate  on consumption, the better our position is in the fight against  unemployment. We must indeed save in all other areas as well.  This also applies to unemployment benefits. One cannot deny  that it must be ensured that the relationship between social  benefits and low incomes is sensible. A public debate is going  on in this respect.    [Siegloch] Let us turn to another topic. People are  complaining about rising rents, rising prices, tax increases,  and rising social contributions. Exactly at this point, you are  calling for a pay freeze in the public sector.    [Kohl] Well, this is a sweeping statement that is not true.  I would like to stress that. You should not forget that you are  talking with the chancellor. If local fees are increased, one  must check carefully.    [Siegloch] I did not blame you for that.    [Kohl] Let me just point this out once more. Whether local  fees should be increased to such an extent and whether it is  wise to include other things.    [Siegloch] But the citizens can only spend their money once.    [Kohl] Let us discuss the public sector.    [Siegloch] Let me ask you the following question in this  respect: If an ordinary clerk with two children who has a net  salary of DM2,800....    [Kohl] You do not know what you are talking about. You are  taking something for granted that has not yet been decided.  First of all, let me comment on the wage negotiations.  Concerning the public sector -- that is the government, which  covers slightly less than one third, the laender, and the  communes -- thus, I am also an employer and the right person to  talk to -- one must take into consideration the overall economic  situation. One must be aware that the situation in the  metal-working industry is extremely difficult. One must also  see what has largely been neglected in the past -- that a job in  the public sector is secure. We just discussed unemployment.  This means specifically that good and secure jobs in this area  must be valued highly.    Moreover, everybody is familiar with the budget situation.  For me this means that ideas about wage increases that were  expressed years ago -- we did not consider the extent of  increases right at the time -- cannot be repeated. Thus, we are  proposing a pay freeze. But whether we talk about a pay freeze  or about whatever results will be achieved -- I do not want to  comment on the extent of pay rises because I do not want to  interfere in the negotiations -- one thing is clear: One cannot  treat all incomes in the same way. That means that for the low  incomes settlements must be found that are different from those  for higher incomes.    [Bresser] Are you suggesting some kind of minimum wage?    [Kohl] We will have to investigate that. It is a technical  question. Yet I do not advocate equal pay raises for all. Let  me mention the popular example of the postman. The same applies  to the professional soldier, the fire fighter, and others. I  believe that one must differentiate here.    [Bresser] All sectors of the population are affected by the  cutbacks in an election year. There are still seven or eight  months to go until the Bundestag election.    [Kohl] I would appreciate the same approach among other  groups. The government has just proposed a pay freeze. I would  like to mention this, too, because the media usually ignore that.    [Bresser] The voter, Chancellor, gets the impression that  this government is no longer up to it. Even on economic issues  the opposition is meanwhile thought to be more competent. Is  this not an alarm signal for you?    [Kohl] Of course it is an alarm signal. But you are talking  about election results that are not yet taking place. For me it  is absolutely clear that this coalition will win the Bundestag  elections in October. I do not have the least doubt about that.  You know, these premature burials, I have been living with them  for two decades. As party chairman I have been buried all the  time, and I am still here -- quite lively, too. As candidate in  elections -- in 1976 they hardly gave me a chance at all. As a  candidate from Mainz, they said he comes from the country.  Well, then I was on the verge of winning an absolute majority,  which people might or might not remember. In 1982-83 I  initiated early Bundestag elections. Everybody, well not  everybody but most people, said I was crazy.    [Bresser] This is the past. Let us talk about the future.    [Kohl] No, no, we want to talk about past predictions. We  should talk about them. People said, he cannot win with the  stationing Pershings, the medium-range missiles. We won the  elections. In 1987 -- just look at the opinion polls before the  1987 Bundestag elections. Back then, I was just one of the  candidates. And in 1990, four years ago -- I can still see you  on television back then -- four years ago we had the first free  elections in the People's Chamber. In February they said, well  this Christian Democratic Union [CDU],... this is traditional  Social Democratic Party [SPD] country: Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt,  etc. The CDU does not stand a chance. And we won the elections.  Why should I discuss election results with you now? I am  convinced that we will win the elections.    [Siegloch] You quoted a whole number of figures and old  predictions. One of them was made eight months before the last  Bundestag elections, when 59 percent said they believed that the  coalition would win. Now it is 17 percent, and 48 percent say  Rudolf Scharping will win the elections. Does this not bother  you a bit?    [Kohl] Of course, but I am not troubled, I want to fight, I  am determined. Of course, I know that the situation today is  far more difficult than in 1990. There is much more turmoil all  over Europe. We are facing problems like unemployment, there  are people's fears, there is the situation in the new laender.  Taking all this into account, things are difficult. But I can  point out that we have achieved something.    [Bresser] That is right, we do not doubt your achievements  over the past years. We know that you have been chancellor for  quite some time now. But a desire for change can be felt in  this society.    [Kohl] How do you know?    [Bresser] People also got tired of Adenauer and Schmidt.  Do you not think there will be a time when people want to see  new faces?    [Kohl] You are certainly right in that. But the question is  when this will be.    [Bresser] When do you think it will be?    [Kohl] You may hope that it will be in October. I am  certain it is not going to be in October. You know, these are  questions I will not answer now. For me there have, of course,  been certain considerations after 10 years in office. And these  have not been ordinary times. The question was whether I run  again or not. And I did not decide to run again for reasons of  prestige. I made that decision because I am convinced that I  stand a better chance than others -- if I make use of it -- of  taking political unification in Europe and unification in  Germany a big step forward. Adenauer said: German unity,  European unity, two sides of the same coin. And because I am  deeply convinced that if we only concentrate on German issues  and isolate ourselves within Europe, evil spirits will turn up  in some form. And at the beginning of this 21st century -- not  that I want to stay until the 21st century -- during these  years, where important breakthroughs have to be made in Europe,  I want to take part and want to help. And I can help. I can  say that more than anybody else, because there was no chancellor  before me that had equally friendly, close relations with  Washington, Moscow, London, and Paris. And I want to contribute  this.    [Siegloch] And you have never, not even once, regretted  this decision?    [Kohl] No. You know, this is a question I ask myself -- if  I should have become federal chancellor at all. When I was in  Mainz there was general mourning when I departed. I left Mainz  and people were sorry that I left. This is a moment you have to  wait for, when people are sorry that you leave, and not when  people overwhelm you with praise insinuating that you should go.  You have to sense that yourself. At that time, people would  ask me: Are you mad? Giving up that relatively easy job in  Mainz to become leader of the opposition in Bonn. Nobody had  ever done that before. Let us see how others will do. Then I  have not only experienced good years here but also bitter ones.    [Bresser] I think we should now be talking of the future,  and here the issue is the landtag election in Lower Saxony, the  European election, the election in Saxony Anhalt.    [Kohl] Nineteen elections altogether.    [Bresser] It is quite safe to say that the CDU does not  stand much of a chance in any of the three elections. When  must the trend, which is running against you, reverse so that  you stand a chance in the Bundestag election?    [Kohl] Excuse me, but how do you know that the CDU/CSU  [Christian Social Union] does not have good chances in the  European election? You are simply claiming that. But you did  the same in the last European election four years ago, or five  years ago.    [Bresser] When you finished ahead of the SPD by only a very  narrow margin.    [Siegloch] And lost 8 percent.    [Kohl] Excuse me, but in the last European election many  people here said that if the CDU/CSU did badly, the party  leadership would come together and the Kohl era would be over.  After the election, I asked the CDU leadership: Would anybody  like to say something? And I looked around and waited. Nobody  wanted to say anything.    [Bresser] Your optimism is...    [Kohl] This has nothing to do with optimism. You cannot be  German chancellor for almost 12 years and chairman of the CDU  for 21 years on the basis of cheap optimism. I am a realist,  and I know what the situation is like, and I can assess  situations.    [Bresser] So I ask you, as a realist, by when will the mood  have to change, to reverse, so that you can come first in the  Bundestag election?    [Kohl] Let me tell you something: I want to win the  election. I am not talking of moods, and on what day a certain  mood will change, because it is hard to measure this mood. I am  certainly not impressed by the polls. The differences in the  results from the various institutes have meanwhile become so  bizarre that I do not want to comment any further on it.    [Siegloch] Let us now turn to the European election, for  which you are quite optimistic. Does that mean that Mr. Kohl,  the European, will go into this election campaign as the head of  the CDU. Will you campaign in the election ex officio, so to  speak?    [Kohl] Not at the head, because that would mean that I am  running in the election, and I am not running in the election to  the European Parliament. No, I have never thought much of  running in an election when everybody knows that it is only pro  forma. I will fight in the European election -- just as in all  other elections, be it the Bundestag or a Landtag election --  for every single vote. At the moment we are still discussing  the details of our election campaign. Still, everybody knows  who is the chairman of the CDU, and everybody knows who is  federal chancellor. The CDU and CSU are classic European  parties, which is why I do not have to demonstrate that I am  also in favor of Europe. This is something that absolutely  everybody knows. Even people asked in surveys will never  challenge my European credentials.    [Bresser] So we will see who will appear on the election  posters for the European election. The first poster was put up  today. Its slogan is: Politics without a beard.    [Kohl] But that is not an election poster.    [Siegloch] So what is it?    [Kohl] It is an ordinary poster and not an election campaign  poster.    [Bresser] But it was put up today.    [Siegloch] And it was put up in front of the Adenauer House.    [Kohl] [passage indistinct] and it is a nice picture.    [Bresser] So this is the way you are trying to fight against  Rudolf Scharping.    [Kohl] In what way?    [Bresser] After all, it is an allusion to Rudolf Scharping.    [Kohl] Come on, what counts is the head and not the beard.    [Bresser] Rudolf Scharping has often been compared with the  early Helmut Kohl. Where is the difference between you and  Rudolf Scharping, apart from the beard?    [Kohl] I have to tell you that I have absolutely no  intention of responding to journalistic games that treat  politics as entertainment. Rudolf Scharping is the chairman of  the SPD.    [Bresser] True.    [Kohl] He is the leading candidate of the SPD -- also true,  even though he has not been formally nominated. The SPD is a  major party with a great tradition, and it is the SPD's business  to determine its candidate and chairman. Why should I comment  on it? It has nothing to do with me. He is the candidate and  that is a fact. I did not comment before on whether I preferred  this person or that one. That is a bit like the weather. The  SPD chooses its candidate, and we choose ours.    [Siegloch] All right, Mr. Chancellor, you do not want to  comment on the person, but maybe on the issues. One strategy is  interesting, namely that the SPD has taken up CDU policies on  many issues -- the asylum issue, internal security, many issues.  Is not dangerous for you when the differences between the two  parties are narrowing?    [Kohl] No, not at all. The election campaign offers many  opportunities for the SPD to make it clear what they stand for.  So far, the Social Democrats have not said anything yet in  connection with their position in foreign and security policy.  At the end of his era, Willy Brandt once said ironically: The  SPD against the rest of the world. The SPD is leading this  country into total international isolation. Not a single  reputable member of the Socialist International in Germany  understands the SPD's foreign policy. Besides, most SPD experts  in foreign policy also fail to understand their party in this  connection. The chairman of the SPD Bundestag group, Mr. Klose,  is much closer to my position on some issues -- for example  constitutional amendments -- than to that of his own party. The  problem is that the party congress adopted the wrong policies,  and now they are stuck with them.    Let us now talk of domestic policy issues, economic issues.  The SPD must explain to the German voters, such as the miners  in the Ruhr area or the Saarland, how German coal can have a  future without an energy mix. An energy mix means: coal, gas,  alternative energy, and nuclear power. The civilian use of  nuclear energy is, of course, inevitable. Yet, they refuse to  understand that. How do they intend to build a modern  industrial society without inexpensive energy? Even within the  SPD it is agreed that we need that. Even a man like Mr.  Schroeder, who certainly does not lean toward the right of his  party, set out to promote an energy concept but gave up on the  way.    [Siegloch] There is a list of other things, too, including  the great bugging campaign. The SPD now supports wiretapping,  but your coalition partner [the Free Democratic Party] is  against it.    [Kohl] Well, if we are talking about legal policies, I would  like to stress the following. I would have adopted the asylum  law two years ago. It took the SPD two years to agree to a  sensible solution under pressure from localities and the local  SPD chairmen, Landtag members, and mayors. You mention  wiretapping. One has to examine the proposal very carefully  with a view to the Basic Law. The proposal is not designed to  permit the wiretapping of private residences. First, it is  aimed at causing quarrels with the coalition. This is quite  legitimate, and I have nothing against this strategy. [sentence  as heard] Second, other issues have to be settled, too, in  connection with the wiretapping bill and the whole package,  including access to accounts to prevent money laundering, which  we are not ready to allow. I do not share these ideas about  property.    [Bresser] What effect do you expect from your strategy to  blame the SPD in 1994, at the beginning of the election  campaign, for its policy vis-a-vis the German Democratic  Republic [GDR] pursued in the 1980s? The voters are concerned  about Germany's future. Yet you are focusing on the past. Or  do you believe that you can win votes in east Germany with this  strategy?    [Kohl] I do not understand your question. I do not blame  the SPD for things that happened in the past and which are no  longer topical. What is happening? The Social Democrats have  opened this debate. When the first candidate for the office of  the federal president was presented, the SPD denounced an honest  man in an incredible manner. Just remember the statements by  SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping at the party congress.    [Bresser] There was also criticism from your own party.    [Kohl] That is a completely different matter. Every  candidate faces criticism. Let us analyze the situation. The  SPD also presented a candidate for the president's office. This  candidate claims that he wants to be the president of all  Germans. Thus, he must be ready to face questions from the CDU  and me and every citizen in this country as to where he was when  the interests of people in Germany were at stake. I do not need  to investigate the Stasi files in this respect. That is  nonsense. I am not talking about Stasi files. I would like to  point out the following: In view of the Wall, all the laender,  including those governed by Social Democrats, agreed to set up  the office in Salzgitter for the documentation of crimes against  humanity against German citizens in the former GDR. In 1984, the  SPD Bundestag group decided to abolish this documentation center  at Mr. Honecker's request. Thus, I claim that the SPD candidate  for the president's office cannot speak for all Germans if he  unnecessarily withdrew support for this documentation center  against crime in 1987. He did not want to spend any money on  this office at a time when he knew -- as I did -- that there  were still 2,000 political prisoners in the GDR, and that  Honecker wanted at all costs to remove this documentation  center. The candidate must be able to give an answer. This is  not a question that merely affects the past. The man is now  running for office. If I think of the questions that our  candidate was asked, the minister president of North  Rhine-Westphalia must at least answer this question.    [Bresser] Mr. Kohl, let me ask you a short question. The  longer the division [of Germany] lasted, the more your party and  your government tried to develop better ties and humanitarian  relief.    [Kohl] That is a completely different issue.    [Bresser] In this connection, quite a few things were  questioned that were considered significant earlier, including  citizenship and Salzgitter.    [Kohl] Let me make the following clear: What I just stated  has nothing to do with state security. Let me repeat that. The  SPD candidate abandoned -- one can also say betrayed -- an  important principle of human coexistence at a certain point with  the support of his party. We have protested against inhumanity  in South Africa, in Chile, and other parts of the world. There  were over 2,000 political prisoners in the GDR, and the SPD  wanted to do Honecker this favor. Others prevented the  abolition of the office in Salzgitter. What else was discussed  is another thing. I did not initiate this discussion. You  mentioned the topic. I never abandoned single German  citizenship. During my era, there was never the slightest  chance for the government to do so. Honecker was quite aware of  that. But the Social Democrats -- leading Social Democrats --  assured Honecker in 1987 and before and after that date that  they would abandon single German citizenship if they should come  to power, and that the 17 million should receive dual German  citizenship and would thus be citizens of a different country.  What would this have meant in the summer of 1989 when the  Hungarian government did not comply with Honecker's wishes and  opened the borders with Austria, citing one single German  citizenship?    [Bresser] My original question on that issue was whether an  election campaign involving national unreliability, as  presidential candidate Hamm-Bruecher called it, is something  that might convince voters?    [Kohl] Excuse me, it is not a matter of convincing voters,  it is a matter of the SPD nominating a presidential candidate  who claims to be a suitable presidential candidate for all of  Germany, and who must now accept that, in an important decision  over the past 10 years, he did not decide in favor of his fellow  countrymen but in accordance with Mr. Honecker's wishes. I have  to take blame from morning till night. And this is part of my  job.    [Bresser] Honecker had a number of wishes. Among other  things he wanted billions of marks in loans, which he got from  you.    [Kohl] That is something completely different. The loan did  get us where we wanted to go. This was the result of an astute  policy. With the major loan we did not give anything up for  Honecker, but we bought something. We gave Mr. Honecker a loan  -- which did not cost the government anything by the way -- and  then we made him let people leave the country, the former GDR,  in increasing numbers. And anybody who knows about the real  psychological change in the GDR will know that the moment when  millions of our fellow- citizens were here in the West, the  propaganda machinery of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany  [SED] collapsed.    [Siegloch] But let us now take a look into the future after  talking about the past for so long. There are three days to go  before the CDU party conference, and your party does not seem  very united.    [Kohl] How do you know?    [Siegloch] Well, let us think of some controversial  comments: Biedenkopf says pensions are not safeguarded, other  party members say we will have to pay for our own glasses in the  future, for dentures. Others are trying to persecute smokers.    [Kohl] Let me tell you something....    [Siegloch] Should the party chairman not put an end to this?    [Kohl] I do not have any doubts that an end will be put to  all this after the party conference. You know just as well as I  do -- you can see this from the time when the SPD was in  government, if you are talking about health care reform -- that  a party that is in government, that has to make proposals,  interpret proposals, is a choir with many voices; that there are  people in our party -- I do not want to mention names here,  there is a whole number, and this is part of a democratic party,  an open party -- who consider it a matter of their prestige to  turn to the public. And it is a fact -- you are more familiar  with the media than I am, I think, because it is your job --  that you will only appear on the ZDF [German TV Two] news if  you say something against the party line. Saying the government  is doing a good job will not get you into the news. So, there  are a certain number.... This happens in every party, it is not  an issue for the CDU alone. Just read documents of the time of  the SPD government, and you will see the number of disputes. I  am not pleased about this, and I am not defending it. I find it  absolutely unacceptable in some cases. I will express this very  clearly on Monday. You can follow that and you can broadcast  it. This is one thing, but the other thing is that this party,  the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] will go into the election  campaign as a single body.    [Bresser] Do you not sometimes get the impression that the  CDU/CSU is somewhat lacking in enthusiasm at the moment, not  motivated enough for such a difficult election?    [Kohl] Why are you talking about the CDU? Is there anybody  that is not unenthusiastic? I talk from morning to night.  [sentence as heard]    [Bresser] You probably exclude yourself.    [Kohl] Yes of course. And I know many others. No, this  is part of the so-called image, something that is fashionable.  I keep hearing people talk about weariness, disenchantment with  political parties. It is a general weariness. There are people  leaving political parties. Trade unions are losing many more  members than for instance the CDU. Employers keep quiet and do  not talk about the wave of people leaving. There is talk about  the churches, the figures have been published. Take sports. Do  you know of any field where we do not breed weariness. And I do  not have to tell you -- just watch television in the evening, on  all channels, and you will go to bed weary. There are hardly  any programs that make you go to bed in a cheerful mood.    [Siegloch] But you are confident. You have been party  chairman for 20 years, and chancellor for 12 years. Would you  say that the 16 October election is the most difficult one of  your life?    [Kohl] No, I would not say that at all. You know, these are  just common sayings. On the one hand they say -- and this is a  phrase coined by Adenauer --election campaigns are fountains of  youth. These are just words. What are the facts? Well, I sit  in my office, attend election events. I go there, usually quite  fed up. I could imagine something more pleasant than talking  for five hours between lunchtime and evening. And all the  hassle.... But when I stand in front of the audience, when I  enter the assembly halls, when I talk to the people, when I see  them in front of me -- let me put it somewhat infomally -- then  you feel like an old army horse: You hear marching music, you  raise your head and you march. There is duty, and then there is  inclination. You know, I am not somebody who got into politics  via the backdoor. I have always been politically active. I  organized my first campaign rally in 1949, at age 19. And this  party is not just any organization for me, it is part of my  home. There are personal, human relationships, both in the ups  and downs. This is how a proper party works. This is the same  in every party, not just in ours. And one has a moral  obligation toward one's political friends. I am standing on  their shoulders. I could not survive in this office if I did  not have the confidence of the great majority, and confidence is  a matter of giving as well.    [Bresser] You also need another shoulder. You want to  continue the coalition with the FDP. The question is, whether  they want it as well. By when do you expect a clear statement  by the FDP?    [Kohl] They will do it in time. I know that journalists  have to conduct such discussions because they have to write  something. But you know very well that the FDP will not do it  now. I can understand that. The FDP will do it during its  party conference.    [Bresser] As early as in June?    [Kohl] The FDP will have a party conference and every FDP  member will be asked when a statement will be issued. Well,  then they'll go into the summer recess. And if they do not  issue the statement before the summer recess, they will be faced  with the question all summer. So, the FDP will be sensible  enough -- it is not up to me to give advice to the FDP -- to  make its decision at an appropriate time. And it will take a  decision that is logical. The FDP cannot go into the election  campaign saying: We have done an excellent job for four years,  but now we will leave. Neither can The FDP say we will not  commit ourselves at all. Then the SPD might want to form a  coalition with the CDU, and the CDU could work with the SPD. I  am not at all afraid. They will also be in parliament. This is  another death knell that is being rung all the time: will they  get in, will they get beyond the 5 percent? Franz Josef Strauss  always used to talk about this. I used to say: `Stop it. Every  time you say the FDP is in a bad position, they will not get  into parliament, people will say in the end -- but we want the  FDP in.' This was an old trick that Hans- Dietrich Genscher was  perfect at. He always put on a worried face; the others said  the FDP would not get in, and then he achieved good results.    [Siegloch] Chancellor, we journalists love speculating. It  could be that the FDP will not be enough. This means that a  grand coalition could become necessary. Helmut Kohl,  chancellor of a grand coalition -- would you say that is out of  the question for you?    [Kohl] I do not want to say anything about this. I do not  want a grand coalition. Not because I am against grand  coalitions in general. Let me say again, a grand coalition can  be unavoidable in certain situations. In Baden-Wuerttemberg my  friends have formed a grand coalition, and I supported them.  But I do not think that a grand coalition would solve the  problems any better. What must be done now -- investment in the  future, a real change in the country -- cannot be achieved in a  grand coalition.    [Siegloch] Mr. Kohl, the question was whether you would be  chancellor of such a grand coalition?    [Kohl] I do not know. Why should I say no definitely? I  have a certain responsibility for my own party.    [Siegloch] Does this mean, if there is no other way?    [Kohl] No, this is something you are inserting into the  debate. This is not my opinion. I will decide, it is my choice.  I am a free citizen in a free country. Nobody forced me to  become chancellor, and nobody will be able to force me to make a  decision [contrary to what] I think right at the time. But I am  now taking with you. I am not expecting it will come to that.    [Bresser] What will happen if the CDU/CSU does not become  the strongest party in the 16 October Bundestag election? In  this election year you will be 64. Have you, the chancellor of  unity, ever thought that you might have missed the right moment  to resign?    [Kohl] No, I have never thought that I might have missed the  right moment. I would have chosen the right moment. Had I not  been convinced that what I have done is right, I would not have  done it. After all, nobody forced me to do anything. I could  have easily have said at one point: Well, I am now on a pedestal  and expect everybody to worship me. In Germany those who  resigned have always been the greatest. If the Lord were to  give me that, I would have great expectations. [Sentence as  heard] But this has never been my intention. My intention is  -- for the reasons that I have mentioned -- to bring things a  bit further ahead in a critical situation of the world, in which  things are changing rapidly, and to make my contribution as a  German, who, together with our people has been able to enjoy the  support for unification by others.    [Bresser] If the voters want that contribution..    [Kohl] Yes, if the voters want it. This is why I am  fighting for each individual vote. When you broadcast the  result of surveys and predict on television that my end is near,  I look at you with amusement and say: Let us wait until  election night.    [Siegloch] And then we will know more.    [Bresser] What if the voters do not want it? Then you would  no longer be chancellor.    [Kohl] The voter is the supreme sovereign of the country.  This is the difference from you television people, for example.  You do not have a supreme sovereign. I have to pay my fees  whether I agree with you or not. You can vote me out, but I  cannot vote you out. That is a big difference.    [Bresser, Siegloch] Thank you very much, chancellor.</p>

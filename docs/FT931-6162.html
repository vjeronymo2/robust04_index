			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / US longer in Somalia US forces may have to stay in Somalia in large numbers for another two months before the United Nations takes command of military operations, the US military said yesterday, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. The process could take even longer if the UN Security Council does not pass a resolution setting up a peacekeeping force for Somalia this week, Colonel Fred Peck said. The US, which has just over 15,000 troops in Somalia, plans to contribute 5,000 to the new UN force which will take over the task of protecting relief supplies, disarming militias and encouraging reconciliation. Mr Robert Oakley, US special envoy to Somalia, declined to predict how long it would take to complete the process of transition from Unitaf to Unosom 2, the slightly smaller UN force that will take over.</p>

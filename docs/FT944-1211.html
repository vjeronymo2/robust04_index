			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Stet expects 30% earnings gain Stet, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications holding company, announced yesterday that its net consolidated profit should reach about L2,000bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in 1994, 30 per cent higher than last year. The announcement comes in the wake of Stet's launch of an international newspaper advertising campaign, aimed at softening up investors and impressing potential strategic partners ahead of further privatisation in 1995. Following a board meeting yesterday, the company said it expected turnover to surpass L34,000bn for 1994. In 1993, it announced a net consolidated profit of L1,539bn on turnover of L29,800bn. The underlying increase in turnover this year will be about 9 per cent, if the effect of absorbing Iritel, the old government department responsible for international and long-distance traffic, is stripped out. Stet said debt would come down to just over L19,000bn by December 31, against L22,085bn at the end of last year. The group is one of Italy's five largest quoted companies, but 64.2 per cent of the shares are held by IRI, the state holding company. Stet in turn owns 62 per cent of Telecom Italia, the quoted operating company, which came into being this year following the merger of five separate state-controlled telecoms companies, as well as holdings in software, multimedia and equipment subsidiaries and international joint ventures. The Italian government committed itself in October to sell a further tranche of shares in Stet by June next year. Analysts fear political turmoil could put that timetable in jeopardy, particularly if the establishment of a regulatory authority for the sector is delayed.</p>

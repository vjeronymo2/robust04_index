			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG SEEN BUYING FEWER HOMES  </P> <P> Home ownership is declining among young Americans but increasing among those 65  and older, according to a Harvard University study released Thursday.  </P> <P> Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies said in its annual report on the  state of housing in the United States that the home ownership rate for those in  the 25-34 age group was 45% in 1988, down from 52.3% in 1980.  </P> <P> Among households headed by people 65 and older, however, the rate increased to  75% in 1988 from 72.3% in 1980. The report said that many of those people  already owned homes before housing costs increased in the 1970s and early  1980s.  </P> <P> Young people, the study found, are increasingly unable to accumulate the down  payment and other costs involved in buying a house.  </P></p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Major's Leadership in Crisis: Tory infighting ends camaraderie a break with the dogmatic autocracy of the Thatcher era. After a decade spent dodging prime ministerial brickbats, Mr John Major's promise to replace ideology with consensualism was greeted with child-like enthusiasm by cabinet colleagues. That was two-and-a-half years ago. Now Mr Major is charged with ineffective leadership and a preference for favourable headlines over hard policy decisions. In Mr Norman Lamont's book, consensualism has degenerated into compromise and politics has subsumed policy. The charge contains more than a grain of truth. But it was liberally sprinkled with personal invective and self-justification. His former colleagues dismissed the critique as one of style rather than substance. But the most persistent concern of many, both inside and outside Mr Major's government, has been whether he possesses that intangible but vital quality for political leaders - grip. Without it, even active governments can appear to lack direction. With it, the most opportunist administrations can conjure up the illusion of certainty and authority. In part it is a question of personality. In some politicians - Mr Kenneth Clarke is the obvious example - centrist, pragmatic, man-of-the-people instincts can be symbols of political strength. In others the same traits are too easily seen as indicative of weakness, indecision. Mr Major has yet to convince his peers at Westminster that he does not fall into the latter camp. Whitehall officials fear his commitment to painstaking and democratic decision-making has stalled the workings of government. Too many judgments are made on a lowest-common-denominator basis. Too many others are shelved. The Downing Street machine - the policy unit and the prime minister's private office - have neither the drive nor the authority to break the logjams. Mrs Sarah Hogg, the head of the policy unit, is criticised for concentrating on the detail of individual initiatives instead of shaping the broader political direction of policymaking. Outside No 10, two-and-a-half years of economic recession, the war within the Conservative party over Maastricht and the debacle of sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism have replaced the 'we're all in it together' camaraderie of November 1990 with more traditional backbiting. Rows over the pit closure programme, reform of the police, London hospitals, economic policy-making and most recently school testing have been freely leaked by the protagonists. Mr Lamont's critique sits uneasily with his equally strong claim that his stewardship of the Treasury was marked by a bold long-termism which invariably put policy before politics. Many in Whitehall believe that he was as ineffectual as any in the cabinet. Described by one mandarin as 'idle', the former chancellor was viewed by many officials as unwilling or unable to punch the Treasury's weight in Whitehall. He also had a personal score to settle during Wednesday's performance. The two men who most impressed on the prime minister the need for a new chancellor were his party managers - Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip. It is hardly surprising that the former chancellor claimed that too much weight had been given to their views in the inner circles of government. They are both extremely influential. Mr Ryder is one of the men closest to the prime minister. His authority in a government with a majority of only 18 is much greater than that of his predecessors during the 1980s. Sir Norman meanwhile represents Mr Major's links with the party activists. He is temperamentally close to the prime minister - another man from Middle England. Mr Lamont is not alone in believing that their influence has sometimes been too great. There has been resentment also about the role of Lord Wakeham - the arch-fixer of Mr Major's administration frequently charged to settle interdepartmental disputes. Mr Clarke is among those who have called for more active leadership of the parliamentary party at Westminster, arguing within the cabinet that timidity and delay can be more destablising even that sometimes unpopular decisions. The new chancellor complained bitterly when his proposals to shake up the police fell foul of the more cautious instincts of colleagues. He is more convinced than the party managers that if the government leads with confidence its supporters can be dragged behind it. Mr Major's aides have an answer. Even in tranquil times managing a parliamentary majority of 18 would be difficult after 14 years in government. Add in Maastricht and the recession and it is obvious that the prime minister must face up to political realities. Remember how Mrs Margaret Thatcher backed down over coal privatisation, how she sacked Mr John Moore for his efforts to cut welfare spending. She had a majority of more than a 100. That is all true. So too is the argument that Mr Major's administration should be compared to the early, indecisive Thatcher years rather than to those of her unchallenged hegemony of the mid 1980s. Yet it was obvious yesterday that Mr Lamont had struck a nerve. Too many at Westminster and in Whitehall admit the sense of drift for it to be dismissed as the bitterness of a broken politician. In the words of one of the more astute - and incidentally loyal - of his ministers: 'If Mr Major is to survive he must demonstrate that he is in charge of the government, and that the government is in charge of the country.'</p>

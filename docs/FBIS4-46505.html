			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Litovkin: "Military Construction </F> Personnel on Strike. They Are Not Asking for Money, They Want  To Earn It"]    [Text] Worrying reports are coming in from military  districts and fleets. The latest was from the Northern Fleet.  An unprecedented event has occurred there -- military  construction personnel have gone on strike. According to our  information, around 2,000 military construction personnel,  including 915 commissioned and 200 warrant officers, and 8,500  of their civilian colleagues have not received full pay since  the beginning of the year. The military personnel are there to  serve, but there is no work for them. There are no construction  materials and the electricity has been switched off.    They received only one-third of the pay for a completed  production assignment, and then a large part of this sum was  automatically taken off them by the city bank in Murmansk for  overdue municipal payments and taxes. The military construction  personnel marched to the central square in Severomorsk, the  fleet's main base, to demand money, to demand that their minimum  social needs be met.    "The situation is critical, unfortunately," I was told by  Lieutenant General Oleg Borisov, deputy chief of Construction  and Troop Billeting of Russia's Armed Forces, when I asked him  to comment on the report. "And not only in the Northern Fleet.  We have unpaid accounts totaling half a trillion rubles [R],  and I have no idea where we are going to get the money to settle  up with the construction personnel."    The Army constructs housing and other facilities -- combat  missile complexes, naval stations, airfields, and nuclear weapon  dumps -- using state funds. According to the draft federal  budget, R3.7 trillion were to be allocated for this purpose,  although the requirement was three-four times greater, but the  military had received only R795 billion as of 25 May.    Moreover, in May the allocation of money for the  construction  of housing was 30 percent down on April. Military construction  personnel I know told me that if it goes on like this the  military construction complex will collapse altogether.    The problem is aggravated by the fact that under the state  program providing housing for servicemen, as approved by the  president, the army was supposed to construct 220,000 apartments  in 1993-1995 from federal budget means. Local authorities were  constructing another 180,000 apartments for officers discharged  into the reserve or who have retired. This would make it  possible by the end of this year to cut the number of people  waiting for apartments to 118,000. Now, because of the failure  of the program, the waiting list, instead of decreasing, will  increase to 155,000 families. Incidentally, the army's figure  for people without apartments now stands at 133,700.    Even the 8 billion plus German marks allocated by the FRG to  house families leaving Germany and credits from other foreign  states are not much help. The problems are not solved merely by  40,000 extra apartments. Moreover, there is no money for the  construction of cultural and consumer facilities, as the  official documents say, alongside the housing: boiler houses,  stores, kindergartens, schools and hospitals, utilities. How  can you give people houses without heating, water, and drains?    One reason for the parlous state of the army's military  construction complex is the fact that the money allocated by the  state budget for the construction of housing was not fully  indexed by the Finance Ministry, or the indexing came very late.  The money that has entered the military units' accounts is not  commensurate with the current levels of prices of construction  materials, electricity, heat, and machinery. Because of this, a  debt of R290 billion built up last year. Only R110 billion were  allocated to pay the debt. The question is -- Where to get the  remaining R180 billion.    But, according to generals I know, the military does not  want  and does not intend to go cap in hand to the government. The  military is well aware that state money is in short supply, so  it is prepared to seek its own way out of the situation.    For instance, it constructed 3,000 apartments last year  using  nonbudget sources -- sale of vacant property that no longer had  any military importance, and wheeled engineering equipment --  and the resources of housing construction cooperatives and  individual builders. Just as many will be provided this year.  But these apartments are a drop in the ocean of housing  problems.    The military is prepared to use the experience accumulated  by  Moscow construction workers, who, despite meager funding, are  annually providing thousands of apartments for people on the  waiting list and providing their construction complex with new  machinery and materials. This is being done in Moscow by  auctioning off part of the housing constructed under city plans.    Why does this right not extend to military construction  personnel? They would be able to partly rectify matters by  auctioning off a proportion of the apartments they have  constructed.    Taxes are another problem. The army being what it is, a  state institution that is unable to make a profit, it should be  exempt from transport and special taxes, payment for allocation  of land, and from value-added tax.... All this takes the lion's  share of the budget funds allocated to it for capital  construction and restricts the latter's pace and potential.    According to the plan, military construction personnel  currently owe officers 20,000 apartments. This figure could  double by the end of the year. Dozens of military construction  units are without work. In the Northern Fleet they have now  switched to ways of fighting for their rights, such as strikes,  which are unthinkable as far as the military is concerned.    But there is still no visible way out of the crisis for  them.</p>

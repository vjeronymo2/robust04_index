			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Howard suffers new Lords defeat Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, suffered a defeat in the Lords last night over his plans to end the requirement on councils to provide gypsy caravan sites. Peers voted by 133 votes to 104 in favour of a Tory demand for repeal of the requirement to be delayed by five years. It was the latest in a string of defeats for the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill, which implements law and order pledges Mr Howard made at last year's Conservative party conference. Last week peers watered down his plans for secure training centres for persistent young offenders.</p>

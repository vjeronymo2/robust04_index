			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON BUYS INTO HIGH-TECH FIRM, WILL SHARE FUTURE PROFITS  </P> <P> The Pentagon said Monday that it has made a $4-million investment in a small  Santa Clara, Calif., high-technology company in return for a share of any  future profits and a non-voting seat on its board of directors.  </P> <P> The investment is the first step in a unique experiment being launched by the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon's research and  development arm, and will expand that agency's role in cultivating domestic  industries involved in critical technologies.  </P> <P> In November, Congress greatly expanded DARPA's mandate, enabling it to act more  like a venture capital firm and in so doing to help pick critical companies and  technologies. Previous efforts already have sparked a debate over what role the  government should play in picking winners and losers.  </P> <P> The investment in Gazelle Microcircuits Inc., a supplier of gallium arsenide  chips used in electronic and military applications, represents the first time  DARPA will receive a percentage of the profits. In return for its $4-million,  DARPA will get royalties from any products developed with the funds or payments  calculated on the appreciation of Gazelle's stock.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Planned increase in terror premiums condemned COMMERCIAL insurance buyers yesterday condemned swingeing increases in premiums for terrorism insurance planned by Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company. The government announced last Friday that it would press Pool Re to increase rates for policies starting after July 1, following the IRA bombing of Bishopsgate in the City in April. According to a letter sent to one leading UK company by the Department of Trade and Industry, large London-based businesses will face increases of more than 300 per cent. The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce, which represents commercial insurance buyers at more than 300 UK companies, says moves to penalise city-centre businesses, particularly those in London, is 'short sighted and could prove counter-productive'. The association said it would prefer 'the traditional and proven insurance involving the spreading of risk. It is more equitable.' The Confederation of British Industry also renewed warnings to the government about the potential impact on business of raising terrorism insurance premiums on City and West End properties by up to 300 per cent. The DTI letter said: 'The most significant change is the removal of the discounts which had previously been given for large sums insured. We concluded that while this may be an appropriate approach for fire insurance, it is unsuitable for terrorism insurance.' An 'extra large' property based in central London and valued at Pounds 500m would pay Pounds 720,000 for its terrorism insurance after the revision compared with between Pounds 175,000 and Pounds 262,500 before. A 'very large' central London property worth Pounds 100m would pay Pounds 144,000 (Pounds 51,000-Pounds 76,000), while a 'small' building in central London (valued at Pounds 1m) would pay Pounds 1,400 (Pounds 900-Pounds 1,350). Smaller properties outside central London would benefit from lower rates.</p>

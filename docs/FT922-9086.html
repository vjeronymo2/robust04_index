			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets (At a glance): Charity donation limit cut The minimum limit for donations to charity which receive tax relief under the government's gift aid scheme is to be reduced from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400, as planned in the Budget. In answer to a parliamentary question, Sir John Cope, Paymaster General, said the forthcoming finance bill would change the limit with effect from May 7. The rules governing tax relief on some charitable covenants will also be relaxed - to allow charities to continue receiving relief after the four year renewal date - from the same time.</p>

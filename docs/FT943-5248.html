			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sime Darby lifts profits by 7.5% Sime Darby, the Malaysian conglomerate that boasts of being southeast Asia's biggest multinational, has reported a 7.5 per cent improvement to MDollars 904m (USDollars 354m) in pre-tax profits for the year to June. The result was below most analysts' expectations but was viewed as satisfactory for one of the region's most conservatively run and cash-rich companies. A final dividend of 17.5 Malaysian cents was recommended, compared with 16.5 Malaysian cents in the previous year. Group turnover rose to MDollars 8.21bn from MDollars 7.04bn. Sime Darby, once largely plantation-based, has diversified into a wide range of activities including the oil and gas industry, property, motor and heavy equipment franchises and the manufacture of various rubber products. The main money-earning base was once again Hong Kong. Pre-tax profits in Sime's division in Hong Kong, where it acts as the main automotive and heavy equipment distributor, were MDollars 227m compared with MDollars 195m last year. Analysts say Sime benefited from buoyant demand in its motor distribution in Hong Kong, particularly for European-sourced cars, but its overall performance in the territory was not as impressive as in previous years. Sime's operations in Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia reported lower profits while Singapore registered improved results. Profit from the plantations division fell by nearly MDollars 20m due to lower average prices for palm oil products. Depressed rubber prices also hurt profit margins. However, with palm oil prices now recording 10-year highs and rubber prices strengthening, it is likely that plantations will have a far better year. Sime should also benefit from its involvement in various infrastructure projects, including its share in an independent power producer scheme in Malaysia. 'The board believes the group will have another year of record profitability in 1994-1995,' it said.</p>

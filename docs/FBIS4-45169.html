			<p>`Money   Laundering Center'   <F P=102> PY2705151194 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0021 GMT 27 May 94 </F> <F P=103> PY2705151194 </F> <F P=104>  Madrid EFE </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] La Paz, 26 May (EFE) -- According to the latest  report issued by the Bolivian company Muller and Associates  Economic Analysis, Bolivia runs the risk of becoming an  international "money laundering" center of funds derived from  drug trafficking.    In its latest report on Bolivia entitled "Behavior and  Assessment of the Banking System," the company states that  "international drug enforcement organizations are concerned over  the high dollarization of the Bolivian economy."    The report adds that in December 1993, "72 percent of demand  account deposits, 91 percent of savings deposits, and 91 percent  of time deposits" in Bolivia are in dollars.    It states that "because of the high dollarization of the  (Bolivian) economy, it is very easy to introduce `coca-dollars'  into the banking system."    Moreover, it states that "money laundering" in Bolivia is  not  a crime, and that the Bank Secrecy Law in force does not allow  drug enforcement organizations to have access to information in  conducting their investigations.    After Peru, Bolivia is the second largest world producer of  coca leaf, the main staple for cocaine manufacturing; and the  second largest world cocaine refining center in the world.</p>

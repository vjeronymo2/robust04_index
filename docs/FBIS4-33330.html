			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] As for the statement made by President-elect Ernesto  Perez Balladares regarding an amnesty that would put an end to  political persecution, President Guillermo Endara announced this  morning that he is preparing a pardon to benefit those who  committed some type of political crime during the previous  government.    Endara said he will ask the Cabinet Council on Wednesday for  an 11-day leave to travel abroad starting on 10 June. During  his absence Vice President Guillermo Ford will be in charge.  The president also said he is preparing a pardon that would  complement the amnesty law being discussed at the Legislative  Assembly.    [Begin recording] [Endara] Since the elections, since before  the elections I had planned to grant a pardon immediately after  the elections. Great progress has been made on the pardon. The  Legislative Assembly, however, has had the same idea, but the  fact that I will grant a pardon does not mean the Legislative  Assembly cannot grant its amnesty. They are separate measures.  I will proceed with my studies of the pardon, and, perhaps  before I take my leave, I will have the pardon ready.    [Unidentified reporter] Will the pardon benefit those who  have committed different types of crimes?    [Endara] Only political-type crimes. I am fundamentally  concentrating on the 510 corregimiento representatives, who made  a political decision, a very dumb one by the way. It was a  political-type decision, and they do not have to be politically  persecuted for that political decision. I am talking about the  case of the 510 corregimiento representatives who made that  decision. I am also concentrating on the case of the Council of  State, which elected Francisco Rodriguez president even though  it did not have the authority to do so. It was strictly a  political decision. I am fundamentally concentrating on those  two cases. [end recording]    President Endara noted that the pardon will not benefit  Colonel Eduardo Herrera, who is under arrest and is accused of  plotting against the government.    [Begin Endara recording] As for the case of Mr. Eduardo  Herrera, he committed serious mistakes against a budding  democracy in its most critical moments. He was one of the  persons who was called upon to protect democracy, but the first  thing he did was to try to overthrow it. I am not going to  include Mr. Herrera in my pardon. [end recording]</p>

But Then It May Not"]    [Text] The Supreme Council of Ukraine has obligated the  Crimean parliament to bring the Constitution of the peninsula  into compliance with the Ukrainian Constitution currently in  effect. At first sight, this was quite a logical step,  especially if we recall that the federal authorities of Russia  have also repeatedly taken care of compliance by the  constitutions of republics belonging to the Russian Federation  with the Main Law of the country. However, to this day there are  many nonconforming constitutions in Russia. As a rule, in Moscow  they pay particular attention to articles in the constitutions  of the republics that are openly disloyal to the center and try  to ignore the still more nonconforming articles in the  constitutions of Federation components that are friendly to  Moscow. Just one republic belongs to Ukraine, and for as long as  it was led by Nikolay Bagrov, the Supreme Council in Kiev did  not strive to work on the constitutional problems of the Crimea,  probably proceeding from the same Russian rule--loyalty in  exchange for legality. The situation has changed following the  victory of Yuriy Meshkov in presidential elections in the  Crimea, and the gun Bagrov has loaded may now very well be fired  in the hands of the new Crimean president. Nonetheless, the  Constitution of Crimea does not contradict the current Ukrainian  Constitution so seriously as for strict compliance with its  norms to be really able to bring about some kind of explosive  consequences in relations between Ukraine and the Crimea.    In passing their decree, the members of parliament probably  proceeded from a certain outlook, just as they did when they  offered President Leonid Kravchuk new powers in keeping with  which he now has the right to cancel by his decisions all  unconstitutional decrees of the Crimean authorities. First, the  already adopted Constitution of the Crimea could fail to conform  to the new Constitution of Ukraine, which is being worked on. In  this case, the Crimean parliamentarians will have to turn to  their Main Law yet again, of course, if they follow  recommendations from Kiev right now. Second, the Supreme Council  of Crimea, like the Supreme Council of Ukraine, is living out  its last days, and not even months. The members of parliament  from Kiev counted on boosting their preelection ratings by this  decree (many of them are running for the new Supreme Council,  too), whereas following the commandments from Kiev will hardly  be helpful to the Crimean parliamentarians. However, Kiev has  given the deputies of the Supreme Council of the Crimea a good  opportunity to restrict the powers of the Crimean president,  whom the Supreme Council intensely dislikes, while it is still  possible.    The defeated "party of power" in the Crimea may very well  take advantage of the legal base proposed by Kiev in order to  make presidential powers not so wide by far--after all, they  were written up for Nikolay Bagrov, and not at all for Yuriy  Meshkov. However, the Crimean parliamentarians will hardly go  for this open confrontation with the new president precisely  because the Supreme Council of Crimea does not have much time to  work. The opportunity to comply with the decision of Kiev may  come to the fore only in the event that the "party of power,"  which was defeated in the presidential elections, wins a rematch  during the parliamentary elections and looks for a pretext to  consolidate its power and restrict the power of the president.  In that case, the decree of Kiev might come in very handy. It  may be that the Constitution will be amended without any regard  for the decree, simply in keeping with the wishes of the new  parliamentarians. However, it becomes clear from the results of  the presidential elections in the Republic of Crimea and a  public opinion poll that forces supporting Yuriy Meshkov and a  number of figures subscribing to political views that are  similar to his have a chance to win the elections to the Supreme  Council of Crimea, too. This kind of new parliament will hardly  pay any attention at all to the decrees of the parliament in  Kiev.</p>

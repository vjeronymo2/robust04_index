			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- 2,800 men have been called  up for mandatory service in the Lithuanian armed forces during  this year's spring conscription.    Of all recruits who reported to medical boards, only 42  percent were pronounced fit for military service, which is  slightly more than last year.    More than 6,500 recruits did not report to call-up  commissions. Approximately one-third of the number will have to  pay fines of 118 lits ($30). Action will be brought against 30  persons, who may face up to 2 years in prison for evading  military service.    But the number of persons dodging military service decreased  from 50 percent in 1993 to 38 percent this year. The level of  education of recruits decreased, as well, with less than a half  of this year's rookies being high school graduates.</p>

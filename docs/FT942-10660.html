			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US delays patent move over Argentina Washington has postponed for 60 days its threat to start proceedings against Argentina for its failure to enact new laws for the protection of intellectual property. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said last month he would investigate damage to US companies in Argentina caused by inadequate patent laws. The investigation could then have led to the imposition of trade sanctions. Pharmaceutical companies are said to be the most affected. Estimates of damage vary between Dollars 500m (Pounds 335m) and Dollars 900m a year. The Argentine drugs market has grown rapidly in the last three years, with annual sales of Dollars 3bn. However, the US embassy in Buenos Aires has said the postponement was a 'positive gesture which, the United States hopes, will give Argentina sufficient time to pass adequate and effective patent reform legislation'. The US has been in the forefront of developed country pressure on Argentina to introduce new patent laws. The government introduced legislation into Congress three years ago to upgrade the current 1864 law, but the bill has made little progress. Local laboratories, together with the nationalist wings of both the governing Peronist partyand the opposition Radical party, have obstructed debate. US and European multinational companies complain that the government has been giving the bill a low priority. However, both President Carlos Menem and Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, have said they would press the Congress to pass the bill as soon as possible. Mr Cavallo said this was 'not due to US pressure, but because it is necessary to attract investments' to Argentina.</p>

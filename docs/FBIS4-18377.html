			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 1 (A.A.) -- Social Democratic  Populist Party (SHP) [SDPP] leader and deputy prime minister  Murat Karayalcin said today that his party will apply to the  High Election Board to void the results of the local elections.    Karayalcin told a press conference prior to his party's  group  meeting, which will decide on whether to continue the coalition  government, that his party was receiving a great number of  documents, complaints and evidence, showing that the elections  were fraudulent.    Karayalcin advised the citizens, already perplexed by the  overwhelming victory of the fundamentalist Prosperity Party  (RP), not to be provoked.    "Turkey is a state of law and the warranty of our freedoms  is  the legislation, not the municipalities," he said.    Karayalcin went on to say that no one had the right to  intervene into the way people dressed, to the length of dresses  women wore.    Karayalcin stressed that the country definitely did not have  a Moslem-secularist conflict.</p>

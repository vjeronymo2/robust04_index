			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Tecs aim to renew companies link A PRIVATE company is being established to act as a broker between Training and Enterprise Councils, which deliver government training schemes in England and Wales, and large providers of training for young people and unemployed adults. Many national companies that had offered training, particularly to young people on Youth Training, pulled out of the scheme when Tecs took over responsibility for the government-funded programmes. Companies including Midland Bank and the Debenhams and Dixons retail groups complained that they had to sign separate and often widely differing contracts with up to 82 Tecs if they wanted to take on trainees round the country. Previously the government had contracted with them centrally through its National Providers Unit. The Department of Employment said yesterday the unit had not been privatised. Tecs and providers had 'disengaged' the responsibility from the government. According to an interview in Personnel Today, the magazine for specialist personnel staff, the new company will be called the National Training Partnership. Mr Roger Shaw, president of the British Printing Industry Federation, who will be one of the directors of the new body, said companies that had dropped out of Youth Training were expressing fresh interest. The government is expected within the week to announce the successor body to the National Training Task Force. The voluntary body, under the chairmanship of Sir Brian Woolfson, advised the government on establishing Tecs.</p>

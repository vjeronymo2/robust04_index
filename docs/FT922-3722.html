			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Hoisting a new green standard Companies in search of a green badge of approval might be tempted to conform to the rigours of the new environmental management standard from the British Standards Institution (BSI). Compliance with the standard, known as BS7750, will indeed signal some form of environmental credibility but, more importantly, it promises to transport companies down a route which could have striking effects on the corporate culture. 'Don't do it for publicity,' warns Michael Gilbert, the project manager of the BSI's environment initiative. 'Using 7750 is like total quality management - you can't go at it half-heartedly. It's about cultural change and if you're not willing to bite the bullet, then forget it.' BS7750 describes the type of management systems and procedures that have to be in place for companies to produce a sound environmental performance. A small number of pioneering companies, such as BP, have been doing this privately for some time. The standard was launched in April and is now being tested by 50 companies. It will not become a formal standard for at least a year. The BSI wants it to be consistent with a number of other emerging standards, such as the EC's Eco-Audit regulation and its eco-labelling scheme. It looks likely that 7750 will be the backbone on which the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) builds its environmental management standard. The BSI is contributing to a draft international standard scheduled for completion in September. BS7750 establishes an institutionalised system which can be verified by outsiders, in the same way as the closely related quality management standard, known as BS5750. The BSI's environmental management standard is significant on both a practical and political level. Its uptake will, for example, indicate just how keen business is to regulate itself. Business leaders, such as those on the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the UK's Advisory Committee on Business and Environment, have been arguing strongly for the benefits of self-regulation rather than imposed legislation. Compliance would also send important signals to the market. An increasing number of customers are demanding high environmental performance from their suppliers. Conformance with a recognised environmental management standard, such as 5750, could become a minimum requirement in contracts. 'A lot of companies went for the quality management standard (5750) to get a badge on the wall to satisfy customers. In some sectors, especially waste management, the same will apply to 7750,' says Tony Bishop, manager of environmental services at PA Consulting. The environment standard has been written to appeal to almost any business in any sector. 'The oil industry has had a positive experience with 5750 and we are hoping for the same with 7750,' says Mike Northover, a member of the health, safety and environment management group at the UK Petroleum Industry Association. 'I don't think it is the commercial side that our industry is interested in. We are trying to improve our operations rather than trying to show that we are more green. But I don't think that any of us will decide to go for it gung-ho until we find out how practical it is,' he says. Ray Nash, development manager at Beaman Bodyworks Barnstaple, a small Devon company that repairs damaged cars, says compliance with the standard will be good for the company's efficiency and marketing. Beaman was the first business in its sector to comply with 5750. It is keen to conform to 7750 too, although it has decided against being part of the initial pilots. 'One thinks that these standards will cause a lot of hassle but it's not like that at all. We have become more efficient and it takes one person five to 10 hours a week to manage 5750. But I must say that if we had not managed to implement 5750 I don't think we would have even begun to understand 7750,' says Nash.</p>

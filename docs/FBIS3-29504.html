			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's cabinet on Friday [18 February] adopted its platform  for fiscal 1994 tax system revision, featuring income tax cuts  and tax incentives for housing purchases to prop up the flagging  economy.    The outline, endorsed at a morning cabinet meeting, is based  on a tax revision framework produced by the ruling coalition  parties and a report by the Tax Commission, an advisory panel to  the prime minister, both issued earlier this month.    The government's package to amend tax laws will be submitted  to the current ordinary Diet session.    The platform calls for tax cuts worth 4,391 billion yen but  leaves out any decision on a possible consumption tax hike and  other measures to finance the tax cuts.    The government "will continue discussing tax reform to  realize it by the end of the year," it says.    The tax cuts comprise 3,843 billion yen in national income  taxes, 172 billion yen in inheritance taxes, 306 billion yen in  abolition of special corporate taxes, and 70 billion yen in  reducing the 4.5 percent consumption tax rate on passenger cars  to 3 percent.    The income tax cuts are limited to one year, and the  reduction amount does not include planned local resident's tax  cuts.    The platform recommends revising land and housing tax  systems  to stimulate the land market and facilitate home purchases,  estimating tax breaks worth 15 billion yen.    To back smaller businesses, deadlines on special tax breaks  on their streamlining investments will be extended for six  months to three years.    Various unfair tax treatments are also subject to revision,  including donations at nonprofit organizations and entertainment  expenses on smaller companies.    On unexplained expenses that are said to be used by  companies  to write off political donations and bribes, the government is  to impose a punitive levy of 40 percent on top of regular  corporate tax, but this will be limited to a period between  April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1998.    The outline also calls for higher liquor tax rates.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Danish owner of Maersk Navigator says fire on board is being contained The Danish owners of the Maersk Navigator, the fully-laden supertanker involved in a collision at the northerly entrance to the Strait of Malacca last Thursday, said yesterday that a fire on board was being contained and that oil leakage from the vessel had been reduced, writes Kieran Cooke. The supertanker, which was carrying nearly 2m barrels of crude oil, is being kept out at sea and towed to an area about 80 miles west of the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and about 60 miles south of the Indian Nicobar Islands.</p>

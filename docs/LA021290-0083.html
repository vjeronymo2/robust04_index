			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> LORENZO'S LINE JUST WON'T FLY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS  </P> <P> The empire of Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air Corp., is in serious,  serious trouble. And it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  </P> <P> Lorenzo's problems don't involve airline unions or the managers of conventional  airlines, who loathe and fear Lorenzo and for years have wished that he would  shrivel up and blow away. The problems don't even directly involve the  humongous 1989 loss of $886 million that Texas Air, which owns Eastern Air  Lines and Continental Airlines, reported last week.  </P> <P> Part of Lorenzo's problem is the evaporation of the financial markets' enormous  enthusiasm for airline assets. The enthusiasm -- which peaked in late summer,  with Texas Air stock in the $20 range -- burst like a bubble in October when  the $300-a-share United Airlines buyout cratered. Suddenly, everyone remembered  that airlines are cyclical businesses.  </P> <P> But most of Lorenzo's problem is self-made. Lorenzo, whose debt-laden  Continental Airlines couldn't make money on its operations last year, a boom  time in the airline business, has had his credibility shattered by recent  developments at Eastern.  </P> <P> Until recently, the creditors of Eastern, which has been operating under  Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since March 9, 1989, loved Lorenzo and  believed his every word. Especially the magic words: 'I'll pay 100% of your  claim." Lorenzo had paid everyone 100% after he put Continental into bankruptcy  in the early 1980s, so he could do it again.  </P> <P> But the affair between Lorenzo and Eastern's creditors came to a shocking end  -- shocking for the creditors, that is -- in late January, when Lorenzo  unveiled Eastern's plan to emerge from Chapter 11. Oops! Even though some of  Eastern's creditors were to get 100% of face value, lots of people were being  offered securities and cash ranging from maybe 45 cents of face value (for  unsecured creditors) to less than 5 cents (for some preferred stockholders).  </P> <P> The jilted creditors feel betrayed, to put it mildly. As William Congreve would  have said if he wrote about bankruptcy rather than more earthy passions, "Hell  hath no fury like a creditor scorned."  </P> <P> To sweeten his plan, Lorenzo offered the unsecured creditors 40% of the stock  of the new, post-bankruptcy Eastern. Given that Lorenzo, renowned for tough  bargaining, is making an initial offer of 40%, it seems reasonable to assume  that when and if the New Eastern emerges from Chapter 11, Lorenzo's Texas Air  will own much less than the 60% that it proposes to keep. It may end up with  very little of Eastern -- or none at all.  </P> <P> Then there's another problem, involving Eastern's dealings with other Texas Air  companies. Up to now, no one in the bankruptcy proceedings except Eastern's  labor unions seemed to care very much about these deals in which Eastern always  seemed to get the short end. And the unions, as the Miami Review showed in two  excellent articles in December, haven't been a factor in the bankruptcy  proceedings.  </P> <P> Under the new circumstances, Eastern's creditors now care about these deals. A  lot. A report by a court-appointed examiner is due one of these days, and it  should make interesting reading. Lorenzo, who always defended the deals, told  airline securities analysts in a Jan. 30 meeting that he has made a settlement  offer for those transactions. How much, he didn't say.  </P> <P> But isn't Lorenzo well rid of Eastern, which wasn't worth anything anyway? No,  because Texas Air can't just walk away from Eastern. It has guaranteed payment  of interest and principal on $240 million of Eastern preferred stock that it  gave to Eastern's stockholders in 1986 when it bought the company. The  dividends run about $6.7 million every three months, and Texas Air has made the  last three quarterly payments.  </P> <P> And then there's the real doozy: Eastern's unfunded pension liability, an  obligation for which not only Eastern but also Texas Air and all its companies  are "jointly and severally liable." That's lawyer talk for "on the hook." Last  month, Lorenzo talked about a $450-million pension shortfall at Eastern. The  U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which crunches the numbers using different  assumptions, puts the shortfall at $1.1 billion and has gotten involved in the  bankruptcy proceedings to protect its interests.  </P> <P> How deep is the pension hole, and how much will Texas Air have to put in toward  filling it? Who knows? But it's obviously a lot.  </P> <P> Given the confusing way in which Lorenzo's empire reports financial results --  for example, the reported cash positions of Texas Air, Eastern and Continental  as of Sept. 30 seemed to add up to $100 million more than the cash actually on  hand -- it's hard to tell the true circumstances of Continental or Texas Air.  But they can't be very good.  </P> <P> The bond market is treating Texas Air as if it's going to default on its debts.  The last time I looked, the Texas Air bonds maturing this October were yielding  about 25% a year. Bonds due in 1992 had annual yields in the 35% to 40% range.  If the bond market's pricing is even close to right, Texas Air stock, recently  at about $6, is overvalued.  </P> <P> Lorenzo has escaped disaster before. But this time, with the financial markets  against him, fuel prices rising and his credibility in tatters, he may be on  his final flight.  </P> <P> When Lorenzo took over Eastern in 1986, he was hailed as a genius, and Texas  Air stock rose to the $50 range. What an irony it will be if Eastern turns out  to be what sinks him.  </P></p>

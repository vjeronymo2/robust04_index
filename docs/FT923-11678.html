			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Papers to challenge ban on reporting NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS are to challenge a magistrate's reporting ban on proceedings being taken against a man who faces jail for refusing to answer questions from the Serious Fraud Office. In the High Court yesterday the newspapers, including the Financial Times, were given leave to seek judicial review of the ruling by a magistrate at Clerkenwell court in London last week. The man, who has been charged with criminal offences and cannot be identified, had been served with a notice under section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act requiring him to give information to the SFO. When he refused, the SFO took action against him under a provision in the act that makes a failure to comply, without reasonable excuse, an offence punishable by a maximum jail sentence of six months, a fine or both. The case came before the Clerkenwell court on July 15, when the ban was imposed. Two days later the newspapers applied unsuccessfully to have it lifted. Yesterday the newspapers said they wanted to challenge the magistrate's ruling that they did not have the legal standing to apply to him to have the ban, made under the Contempt of Court Act, set aside. They also contended that the ban was too wide because it appeared to prevent reporting of background matters relating to the criminal charges the man faces, and that reports of the proceedings in the magistrates court would not prejudice the pending criminal trial. The newspapers' application was opposed by counsel for the SFO and for the man concerned who argued that there was clearly a 'gross and obvious' risk of prejudice to the criminal trial if the ban were lifted.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Instem shares lose 19p on halfway drop to Pounds 410,000 PRE-TAX PROFITS of Instem, the USM-quoted electronics and information systems group, fell from Pounds 551,000 to Pounds 410,000 in the six months ended July 31. The shares dropped 19p to 142p. However, the directors were encouraged by a record order intake. On balance, the performance was in line with their plans for the period. The business segments concerned with electricity transmission and distribution, power generation and nuclear fuel processing moved forward broadly in line with plans. Also the performance of the electronics manufacturing operation recovered, in part due to the result of increased business from the merger of the mining equipment business of Dobson Park Industries with Meco International. Datatox F1 software product did not achieve satisfactory performance in a number of site trials. That resulted in management changes and a delay in the next release to early 1994. Turnover rose from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 9.5m. Interest charges were Pounds 11,000 (Pounds 3,000 received). Earnings per share were 6.01p (7.96p) but the interim is held at 1.3p.</p>

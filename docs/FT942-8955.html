			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Arts: La traviata - Opera When La traviata first came to London, Queen Victoria forbade the Court to attend. A story about a prostitute who dies on stage was thought an improper subject for the theatre and it cannot have helped that Verdi intended the opera to be performed in modern dress, bringing its message even closer to home. That it what Music Theatre London is about: lifting well-known operas out of their historical context and throwing them down in the fast lane of the present-day. The Mozart/Da Ponte operas and Rossini's Cenerentola have been swept along by their irreverent ebullience; this Traviata is their first try at a serious opera - a commission from the Covent Garden Festival as part of its adventurous programme of opera and music theatre. Violetta's house-party is a yuppies' rave and when Gaston bursts out from a back room, it is to collect an orange presumably to go with a plastic bag and some ladies' stockings. Later, Alfredo comes in from doing the weekly shopping at Sainsbury's, any suburban boyfriend from the home counties. For a producer updating a stage work this is the easy bit. When it comes to bringing the characters alive, the producer William Relton does not aim to score many points, but some of the shots he does try are bull's-eyes: as Violetta sings her solo scene, she removes her blond wig, peels off her false eyelashes and wipes clean the prostitute's face to reveal the untainted woman underneath. By the last act she is in the terminal stage of some unnamed (unless I missed it) modern disease. Her end comes not in a grand Parisian apartment, but in a National Health hospital - every last drop of romance sanitised by the surroundings. Watching Mary Lincoln's Violetta trying to turn in bed during her final aria was painful in the right way and a fitting end to a portrayal that one could always believe in. The company is lucky to have a Violetta who can sing what Verdi wrote, whereas one generally wishes that the musical arranger, Tony Britten, would help out his actors by re-writing more boldly. Tim Godwin sings the English words as if he has been listening to too many Andrew Lloyd Webber records, but his young puppy of an Alfredo ('hung like a horse' is his recommendation) is very touching. David Burt makes heavy weather of Giorgio Germont. The moral force of this role is more difficult to update. The cameos include Liza Sadovy as a stylish slut of a Flora and Simon Butteriss's Gaston, who returns as a gypsy in drag with a talent for reading palms. He might predict success for this show if some of the bathetic rhymes in the translation can be sharpened and the string quartet rehearsed more thoroughly. La traviata is an opera of today and Music Theatre London has chosen well. Sponsored by British Gas. Performances until May 21 at the Donmar Warehouse</p>

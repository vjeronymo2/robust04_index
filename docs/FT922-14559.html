			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Justinian: Promise with sting in its tail When all the electoral dust has settled, the new UK administration will set about framing its legislative programme and making ministerial decisions. So what happens to all those proposals and promises in the election manifesto, which may have helped the party to win? The question is not without legal significance. A decade ago, the judges had something to say about the legal status of election manifestos when the now defunct Greater London Council sought to implement an election promise by the Greater London Labour party to introduce a 'fares fair' scheme for London Transport. Bromley Borough Council successfully challenged the implementation of the proposal for a 25 per cent overall reduction in fares because it was motivated solely by the belief that the majority party on the council was bound to implement a pre-election promise. The judges held that, while an election manifesto may, and often does, contain firm and unequivocal proposals, which the electorate might reasonably expect to be fulfilled, there can be no question that the authors of the proposals bind themselves irrevocably to honour the pledge. It is accepted by the law that a proposal may turn out to be unworkable or impossible of attainment. Indeed some of the judicial pronouncements in the fares fair case indicated that the moral obligation to fulfil an electoral promise was even less compelling. When the party making the proposal gets into the power, the judges said, it should positively consider afresh any proposal or promise without feeling obliged to honour it or being committed to it. If that is the right approach, it reduces election manifestos to little more than present good intentions to induce the support of voters without involv Whatever the law's pronouncements on proper regard for election promises, political parties are likely to attach greater or less importance to their rivals' political commitments. Political advisers will doubtless keep a keen watch on how much or how little is translated from manifesto to legislative or executive action. Other commentators with specialist interests will want either to remind the politicians of their commitment to a particular proposal or to seek to persuade them of the impropriety or undesirability of it. If the Labour party becomes Her Majesty's government on April 10, there is one proposal in its manifesto that is already worrying a body of informed, non-partisan opinion, concerning the future protection of the rights and interests of children. The Labour party's manifesto promises to establish 'an independent children's commissioner and a children's minister'. The sting in the proposals' tail is that the minister will be 'within the Home Office to co-ordinate policies for children across departments'. Those who have been urging the establishment of a children's rights commissioner to promote, among other things, compliance with the UN convention on the rights of the child, adopted by the General Assembly in November 1989, are mystified by the proposal to put such a minister for children's rights in the Home Office. It had been widely assumed that the appropriate ministry would be the Department of Health. To assign the task of child welfare to the Home Office would be to put the clock back two decades and convey the wrong message. At the time that the Labour administration passed the Children and Young Persons Act in 1969, it took the imaginative step of transferring the children's department from the Home Office, the department primarily concerned with law and order, to the department responsible for the health and care of children. It was a step welcomed both within and outside the government. When the House of Commons Social Services Committee in 1984 recommended that the Department of Health and Social Security should establish a working party to review childcare law, the government speedily accepted the suggestion. The responsibility for the review and the legislation rested with the Department of Health, which co-ordinated work with other government departments. The result was the Children Act 1989, which came into force last October. Throughout the extensive consultative process and detailed parliamentary examination of the legislation the Department of Health was the ministry that promoted the cause of child welfare. It, and not the Home Office, was the prime agent of law reform. Any change in ministerial responsibility now would be seen as detracting from the real advances made in persuading politicians to take children's rights and interests more seriously.</p>

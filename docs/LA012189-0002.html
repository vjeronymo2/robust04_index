			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: TEARS FOR A DREAM IN AMERICA  </P> <P> A man called Rodriguez flew out of Los Angeles on Thursday to live in Spain,  leaving behind a driveway stained with his wife's blood and the angry memory of  an episode of brutality that transformed their dream into a nightmare.  "Criminals took our future," he said to me the day he left, "and they tore it  to shreds. I don't know if we'll ever come back." And then he cried.  </P> <P> Rodriguez isn't his real name. He was afraid to have me use it, he said,  because he still has relatives living in America and doesn't want them hurt, an  irony not lost in a nation long glorified as a haven for the oppressed. You  might recognize his real name if you heard it. He was a soccer star for 20  years in Latin America and Spain, and at his retirement was being paid $1  million a year.  </P> <P> After months of searching, Rodriguez bought a house in an affluent area of the  San Fernando Valley and took a year to turn its 6,000 square feet into the kind  of home he had always wanted for his family. They moved in two days before  Christmas: Rodriguez, his wife, a teen-age daughter and a younger son.  </P> <P> "This is where we would stay," he said in a voice that trembled. "This is where  we would put down roots." But on Thursday, Jan. 12, on a driveway that has come  to symbolize his family's anguish, the dream died. It was only 20 days old.  </P> <P> We'll call his wife Elana. She left their dream house at 2 in the afternoon to  shop and meet their daughter. Rodriguez was visiting friends. Later, he would  pick up a car that had been shipped from Spain. Colombian-born, he had lived in  the United States for 22 years but also held Spanish citizenship to play for  Spain's national team, a situation that kept him continually on the road. But  now all the wandering, all the road trips, all the instability was over. They  were family again. They were home.  </P> <P> Elana parked her 1987 Mercedes in the driveway. She and Maria, 16, were about  to get out of their car when both doors were abruptly jerked open. Two men in  their 20s pulled them onto the driveway, grabbed their purses, ripped off their  jewelry, punched Maria once and began a vicious and unprovoked beating of her  mother. Not a word was said. They took the Mercedes and left Elana unconscious  on the driveway, her blood staining the concrete. Maria screamed, "They've  killed my mother!"  </P> <P> Both women suffered concussions. Maria's eye was blackened and an ear torn when  her earrings were ripped off. Elana's shoulder was dislocated by the fists that  pounded her with lunatic frenzy. Rodriguez says there wasn't six square inches  of her body that wasn't bruised. "'When I got to the hospital, the first thing  she said to me was 'Let's get out of this country.' "  </P> <P> Elana was hospitalized for three days. On the day of her release, she and their  two children left for Spain. They never set foot in their dream house again.  </P> <P> Rodriguez went back to the house last Sunday. He saw his wife's blood on the  driveway, like crimson patterns of evil etched in concrete. "I went crazy," he  said. "I smashed doors, I kicked walls. When I left, I knew I would never go  back to that house again. I had movers take everything and ship it to Spain. I  gave the keys to my brother. I don't care what he does with the house. The  dream is over."  </P> <P> In two hours Rodriguez would catch a plane to Madrid. Would he ever return to  America? Had the violence against his wife and daughter translated to hate for  the country he once loved? There were tears in his eyes, but his jaw was set in  anger. They would surely come back to visit relatives, but as for living in  America again . . ." I don't know," he said. "I just don't know."  </P> <P> What he hates is not the country. "There is crime all over the world," he said.  "We are just another statistic. I don't accuse the United States. I accuse  those men who took my future in this country away from me."  </P> <P> The tendency is to mock a rich man fleeing from an incident that most likely  will never be repeated; to chide him for so hastily abandoning the dream of a  lifetime, like a soldier surrendering a hard-won mountain top. But who am I to  judge the depth of his family's terror? Fear, someone wrote, leaves a rusty  taste, and anyone who has ever been afraid, either for himself or for someone  he loves, knows how long the taste can last.  </P> <P> I keep thinking about the stains of blood on the driveway and the tears  Rodriguez shed for his dream in America. In ways we may never understand, he  cries for us all.  </P></p>

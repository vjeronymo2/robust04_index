			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER SUPPLY AND TRASH DISPOSAL  </P> <P> I applaud your recent editorials "Dangerous Decision" (Oct. 5) and "Not the  Right Spot to Begin With" (Sept. 30). I, too, agree that the expansion of the  Azusa landfill is a dangerous decision in the wrong spot. In fact, I was  startled by the State Water Resources Control Board's decision to support the  expansion of the Azusa Western Landfill.  </P> <P> Is the board not aware that Environmental Protection Agency has designated the  San Gabriel ground-water contamination problem as the worst in the Western  United States? It has been over 10 years since EPA detected this contamination  and yet every day the residents of the San Gabriel Valley wonder if their  drinking water is safe -- and how long it will remain so. Clearly, to build a  landfill in the area would only contribute to the polluting of this aquifer.  </P> <P> The State Water Resources Control Board members seemed so impressed by the  presence of William Ruckelshaus (former EPA administrator) that they failed to  see past the economic interests of his company, Browning-Ferris Industries  (BFI). May I remind them that BFI is a company interested in making a profit.  </P> <P> The San Gabriel ground-water basin provides 90% of the water supply for 1  million people. If this aquifer is lost, where will these people obtain their  water? The Metropolitan Water District is overburdened. Besides, this is an  impractical and unnecessary alternative.  </P> <P> As chairman of the Environment and Labor Subcommittee of the House Small  Business Committee, I have come to realize that the ground-water contamination  problems in the San Gabriel Valley have been brought on by years of neglect, as  well as by willful actions by responsible parties. We have a duty to stop that  neglect as well as to find those responsible for the dumping. Preventing the  expansion of the Azusa landfill would help to stop the neglect.  </P> <P> Like the MWD and the San Gabriel Valley Watermaster, I am thoroughly convinced  that the expansion of the dump poses an unnecessary risk for further  contamination.  </P> <P> I fully anticipate that the watermaster and other interested parties will file  a petition to allow the court to intercede in this matter. It is vitally  important to San Gabriel Valley residents that they succeed.  </P> <P> REP. ESTEBAN E. TORRES  </P> <P> D-La Puente  </P></p>

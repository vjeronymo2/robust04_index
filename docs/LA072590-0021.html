			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONS RAISED BY OIL-RECYCLING PLANT CLOSURE  </P> <P> Nelco Oil Refining Corp. ducked a blow from state officials that would have  shut the doors on the National City oil recycling plant, by closing shop and  filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in federal court.  </P> <P> The company's move into bankruptcy last week has raised a slew of questions for  state officials about where the money will come from to pay for a final  inspection and any cleanup of contaminated soil, equipment or materials that  might be at the site.  </P> <P> Officials at the State Department of Health Services Toxic Substances Control  Program were in the process of denying Nelco an operating permit when the  company filed for bankruptcy. One reason cited for the denial was the company's  failure to obtain liability coverage and financial assurance that, in the event  of an accident or plant closure, would provide the money for a cleanup.  </P> <P> A quick look around the plant Monday by a county hazardous-materials team found  no immediate health risk to the community or environment, officials said. The  plant is near the Civic Center Drive exit off Interstate 5.  </P> <P> The 54-year-old company, which stopped operations July 13, had been operating  under an interim permit since 1985, state officials said. The bankruptcy lawyer  handling the Nelco case said it was the high cost of state-required insurance  that forced the company to seek protection from its creditors.  </P> <P> "They couldn't afford to pay for it. They just couldn't economically continue  operation, because of the expense of the insurance," attorney Dennis Burns  said. "It didn't make sense to keep going. Why beat a dead horse?"  </P> <P> Nelco, co-owned by brothers Roger and Steven Humphreys, claimed just more than  $197,000 in assets in its bankruptcy filing, while the corporation's total debt  is estimated at $700,000, Burns said.  </P> <P> Under Chapter 7 liquidation, the court will appoint a trustee who will take  over the corporation's assets, sell them and then distribute the money among  creditors, Burns said.  </P> <P> "In this case, it's kind of like we give up; take us," he said.  </P> <P> Nelco has a checkered past of compliance with hazardous-waste laws, according  to state officials.  </P> <P> The company was cited in December for 17 alleged violations, including material  spilling out of hazardous-waste containers and using an oil treatment method  not allowed under the guidelines of their interim operating permit, said Allan  Hirsch, spokesman for the state toxics program.  </P> <P> These latest citations and previous ones that included illegally storing 1,500  barrels of acid sludge waste near I-5 in the early 1980s contributed to the  state's decision to deny Nelco the operating permit, Hirsch said.  </P> <P> Dan Avera, assistant deputy director of environmental health services for the  county, said there are still about 200 55-gallon drums stacked three high on  pallets at the plant, some of them bearing contaminated-soil labels. Because of  the way the drums are stacked, he said, inspectors cannot tell exactly how many  have the labels.  </P> <P> Inspectors also noticed about 10 above-ground tanks that can hold 5,000 to  10,000 gallons of material. Avera said the next step is to find out if there is  anything in the tanks.  </P> <P> "We wanted to see what was really going on and to see whether there were any  obvious problems," he said. "There were no obvious problems as of yesterday."  </P></p>

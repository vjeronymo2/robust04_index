			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / BSkyB to float with 19 on board An enormous 19-strong board has been created for the Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4.5bn flotation of satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting, including five non-executive directors from outside the entertainment industry. The move, which will more than double the size of the board, will be outlined today in the pathfinder prospectus. The price range for the shares is expected to be 233p-268p. Another point of interest is likely to be the latest BSkyB subscription figures. By the end of June, BSkyB said it had 3.45m cable and satellite subscribers. Recent estimates of a 60,000-a-month growth rate would suggest that demand is slowing. . The new directors include Sir John Collins, chairman of Vestey Group and former chief executive of Shell UK, and Mr Dennis Stevenson, chairman of SRU consultancy and a director of the Tate Gallery as well as Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times. Mr Sam Chisholm, BSkyB's chief executive, will remain a director but with a new contract directly with BSkyB. Concern has been expressed that Mr Chisholm, who has played an important role in BSkyB's turnround, was contracted to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, at present owner of 50 per cent of BSkyB. Other new non-executives are Mr Geoffrey Bible, chief executive of Philip Morris, Bass director Mr Philip Bowman and Mr John Thornton of Goldman Sachs, who set up an auction between News Corp and Pearson over Star TV in Hong Kong. The existing two non-executives - Lord St John Stevas and Dame Anne Mueller  -continue. Mr David Chance, deputy managing director, and Mr Richard Brooke, finance director, also join the board. Other News Corp representatives will be Mr Murdoch, Mr Dave Devoe, Mr Gus Fischer and Mr Arthur Siskind. On the old BSB side Mr Frank Barlow will remain chairman, Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief executive, will join, as will Mr Jerome Seydoux, Chargeurs chairman. Mr David Sneddon, chairman of Trinity International, will represent the old BSB minorities. News Corp and Telstra in pay-TV venture, Page 21</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THAIS PLAN LOGGING BAN TO CUT FLOODING  </P> <P> The Thai Cabinet has approved a nationwide ban on logging, which was blamed for  aggravating November floods that killed more than 350 people, a Thai official  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Floods fed by heavy rain caused havoc in 12 southern provinces. In the  worst-hit area, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, many people were killed when mud, logs  and trees cascaded down barren hillsides and buried entire villlages.  </P> <P> The ban would end the 301 logging concessions awarded nationwide. It is  expected to take effect when Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and King  Bhumibol Adulyadej sign it within two weeks.  </P> <P> Choonhavan says Thailand's need for wood products can be met by imports.  </P></p>

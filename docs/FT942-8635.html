			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ready and eager for the next phase - The growth of DCC, which makes its market debut today According to Mr Jim Flavin, the founder and chief executive of DCC, the Irish industrial holding company which makes its debut on the London and Dublin Stock Exchanges today, 'it is the end of the beginning'. At its flotation price of IPounds 2.50 the company will have a market capitalisation of IPounds 182m (Pounds 178m). It started out in 1976 as a venture capital company with just IPounds 1m in equity and according to one broking firm in Dublin, 'has achieved an annual 23 per cent compound return for its shareholders since then'. Evolving into an industrial holding company in 1990 and expanding rapidly since, the flotation is the step that Mr Flavin hopes will enable DCC to grow to a market capitalisation in excess of IPounds 1bn early in the next decade. 'There is a sense of excitement here about the next phase' said Mr Flavin at his headquarters in Dublin, where he heads a staff of 18 executives. Together they run a group which includes snack foods manufacturing in Ireland, waste oil recycling and natural gas distribution in the UK, and health care services in the US. Europe, however, is where DCC is planning its next phase of expansion. Through its Printech subsidiary it is already a leading supplier of computer manuals to the continental European market. Further expansion of that business is under way following investment of IPounds 11m in plant and machinery and the signing of large customers such as IBM, Apple, Digital and Dell. A computer products distribution division, with IPounds 70m turnover last year, plans to expand through acquisitions in Europe, primarily in France and Germany. 'Both divisions are becoming pan-European. US and Japanese companies increasingly want to deal with a European-wide company rather than individual companies in each country. We are developing that capacity,' he said. DCC's 11 per cent stake and a directorship in Fyffes also gives it a substantial interest in the development of the European fruit distribution business. Mr Flavin said that the flotation, which is raising IPounds 6m in new equity, is aimed primarily at giving DCC greater financial flexibility as it plans its expansion on to the Continent. 'If you want to grow you have to attract international investors,' he said. The ones he has in mind are the European fund managers in the UK who he says are now taking a much greater interest in Irish companies than they were a few years ago. No large rights issue is planned for the time being, however. Mr Flavin points proudly to DCC's record of the past three years in which IPounds 114m has been spent on capital investment and acquisitions without recourse to shareholders, and yet the business still has net cash. About IPounds 25m has been raised through the disposal of 18 non-core businesses in the past four years, but Mr Flavin's secret is in cash flow. 'All our businesses are quite cash generative. It has been our strategy to invest in cash-generative companies and which have strong positions in niche markets,' he said. The flotation will give DCC the flexibility to finance the next deals through the issue of paper rather than by using cash, and which he expects to be modest bolt-on acquisitions in the IPounds 5m to IPounds 15m range. 'We won't do anything which will unbalance the ethos of the company and we are unlikely to make any acquisition larger than IPounds 50m,' he said. A key part of that ethos is to keep management teams in place in the companies acquired whenever possible. 'We are not hell-bent on taking control . . . We seek to encourage and develop the businesses we are in. We invest further, rather than slash costs and rake all the cash out.' In most of the DCC subsidiaries, the management teams have retained a significant equity participation, giving them a strong incentive to make the businesses perform well. Significantly, in four of DCC's six main subsidiaries the key executives are also those companies' founders. 'Development of the businesses we are in is part and parcel of the group's culture. We are long term in our thinking and believe that strong businesses are built over the long haul,' Mr Flavin said. Evidence of that is Mr Flavin's relationship with Fyffes. DCC first took a stake in FII, an Irish fruit distributor run by the McCann family, in 1981. He advised the McCanns on FII's flotation on the USM that year and later advised them on the takeover of Fyffes in 1986. It is widely believed that it was Mr Flavin who blocked the Dole bid for Fyffes last year. If Dole were to return with a better offer Mr Flavin says he is unlikely to be interested. 'Big businesses are built through constancy. We have a long-term perspective on Fyffes and we are there to stay,' he said. But while Fyffes will continue to have a role in DCC as the largest of its associated holdings, Mr Flavin said that controlled subsidiaries would be the main profit centres of the group. 'I do not anticipate that controlled subsidiaries will contribute less than 80 per cent of group profits in the future,' he said. At present they contribute 76 per cent. He plans to keep DCC diversified across four or five divisions and not to borrow heavily to finance acquisitions or investment. 'We like to manage risk by spread and financial prudence . . . I would be uncomfortable to have interest cover less than five,' he said. That financial caution - mirrored incidentally by Fyffes' own aversion to debt - has brought DCC to the market with a strong balance sheet, no net debt, and total net assets of IPounds 101m for the year ending March 1994. Pre-tax profits of IPounds 22.2m last year translate to earnings per share of 19.6p, which at the flotation price gives an historic p/e of 12.8. Its prospective p/e is about 11.4. According to Goodbody stockbrokers in Dublin: 'For a company with DCC's quality, financial strength and potential for growth, we believe its opening multiple is very undemanding.' The meritocratic Mr Flavin, who told reporters last week 'I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth,' could not wish for a better accolade to mark the end of his beginning.</p>

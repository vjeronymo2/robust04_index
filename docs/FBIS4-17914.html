			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty], 28 Apr -- Having completed his  official visit to Kazakhstan, Li Peng, the prime minister of the  State Council of the People's Republic of China, left  Kazakhstan's capital this morning. It remained unclear until  the last minute whether the Chinese delegation would fly to  Mongolia, where the situation is tense at the moment, or to  China. It has just been revealed by well-informed sources that  the delegation went to Ulaanbaatar, from where it is to return  to Beijing tomorrow night.    Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev and other  officials saw Li Peng off at the Alma-Ata airport.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AFFORDABLE HOUSING  </P> <P> Traveling through east Sepulveda/Panorama City the other day, I noticed a large  amount of construction going on. I was pleased to see some revitalization  taking place.  </P> <P> However, I was also disappointed to learn that seemingly none of it was set  aside for lower-income housing.  </P> <P> I feel there is a tremendous need for affordable housing in the San Fernando  Valley, particularly in the northeast. The area between Sepulveda and Van Nuys  boulevards has plenty of open space to provide some decent, inexpensive  housing. I hope Councilmen Joel Wachs and Ernani Bernardi or city housing  officials have looked or will look into this possibility. It would be a shame  if this "New Sepulveda" was completed five years from now without taking into  consideration all of its citizens.  </P> <P> JOHN W. SULLIVAN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CAMBODIA;  </P> <P> REBELS REJECT PLAN FOR FREE ELECTIONS  </P> <P> The Khmer Rouge guerrilla group rejected a 12-point Vietnamese proposal for  free elections in Cambodia, saying it was simply meant to preserve the  Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh. Hanoi's proposal, put forward in  talks with the United States earlier this month, is supposed to guarantee free  and fair elections as the key to ending more than 11 years of conflict in  Cambodia. But the essence of the proposal calls for elections to be held under  the existing government, thereby allowing Vietnam to control the process.  </P></p>

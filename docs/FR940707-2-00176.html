			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and with Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to improve the CBOE's capacity to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Act and the CBOE's rules by enabling the Exchange to monitor more efficiently all discharges or terminations of employment of registered persons, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal to require CBOE members to file Form U&hyph;5 notices for any discharge or termination with the Exchange, rather than only for ``terminations for cause,'' should facilitate the CBOE's oversight of members' personnel by providing a more complete and accurate record of the employment history of registered representatives. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The Commission also believes that the proposal should help the Exchange to fulfill its responsibility under Section 6(c) of the Act to deny membership to those who have engaged in acts or practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. In addition, the proposal should simplify the Exchange's procedures by eliminating the need for members to determine whether there has been a ``termination for cause'' and requiring, instead, that members file a Form U&hyph;5 notice for all discharges and terminations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> After the proposal is approved, the CBOE is expected to continue to review members' Form U&hyph;5 filings with the CRD on a daily basis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  May 30 Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposal is designed to help to ensure prompt compliance with CBOE Rule 9.3 by requiring members to file a Form U&hyph;5 immediately, but no later than 30 days after a termination. Moreover, by requiring members to file amendments to Form U&hyph;5 within 30 days after learning of facts or circumstances giving rise to the amendment, the proposal advises members of their continuing obligation to amend to Form U&hyph;5 to report relevant changes and should help to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the Exchange's records. Finally, the Commission believes that allowing members to submit the filings required under CBOE Rule 9.3 through the NASAA/NASD CRD will facilitate timely compliance with the requirements of CBOE Rule 9.3 and reduce the cost to members of complying with the rule. As noted above, the CBOE is under a continuing obligation to review the CRD submissions on a daily basis. This will ensure that the CBOE is aware of the U&hyph;5 filings from CBOE members in a timely manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;56) is approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWS WATCH  </P> <P> HIGH MARKS: Of 58 areas rated in the nation, Orange County's major hotels rank  eighth, according to a survey being released today (D5). . . . Eugene H. Zagat  Jr., who's publishing the second edition of his "Zagat United States Travel  Survey," says the county's hotels rank so high because they offer such outdoor  amenities as tennis courts, golf courses and gardens. They also rate high in  cost: 10th nationally. Top rated: The Ritz-Carlton. Tom Hamilton and Cathy  Curtis  </P></p>

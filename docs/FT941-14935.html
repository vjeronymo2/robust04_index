			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Arts: Carmina Quartet ripens nicely - Concert Since its formation ten years ago the Carmina Quartet, basically Swiss but with a fine American violist, has won steady European acclaim - rare for a young team in the hallowed string-quartet medium. While the players still counted as very young, they seemed impressively mature for their years: not always a good prognosis for later. But the quartet's Wigmore Hall recital on Saturday, slightly uneven, was greatly encouraging; there was a new sophistication in its playing, and a febrile new intensity. It sounded like a not-quite-mature quartet intent upon developing its early promise into something far richer. A splendid Viennese programme was on offer: Berg's early, superb op. 3 Quartet (atonal music, but not 'twelve-note') flanked by late Haydn and by Schubert's last, incomparable work in the medium, D887 in G major. In the so-called 'Emperor' Quartet from Haydn's op. 76 set, the Carmina maintained a narrow-gauge precision and delicacy. If there was a perceptible debit in the jovial-grandeur department, its taut counterpoint held the ear continuously; and the famous variations on the 'Emperor's Hymn' were treated as private musings, almost prayerful, taking the closest care with Haydn's almost-Wagnerian harmonies. It was no surprise, then, that the quartet could focus Berg's Expressionist chromatics to such electrical purpose. There, I missed only some broader trailmarks (even at his most intricate, Berg signposts his music with big gestures) and some extra muscle for the fraught rhythmic motifs. With the grand Schubert G major there was suddenly a new, resplendent Carmina sound. In the context it felt like switching into Cinemascope and stereo - a public world, not a private one; and yet there were marks of the players' tenderest attention everywhere. Their performance was crowned by a Finale that seemed to race brilliantly, insouciantly along, but with the undertone of harried desperation that other late Schubert finales carry (cf. above all the 'Great' C major Symphony): something that cannot be faked histrionically, and only makes itself felt in a rigorously faithful performance. One anxious reservation: the Carmina leader must look to his pitch, for it was worryingly hit-or-miss whenever his part ascended into the ledger-lines. More than one British quartet of distinction has had an inspirational leader who blotted its copybook just so, at some real disadvantage to their collective careers. Chamber-music aficionados tend to have keen ears; one evening's encounter with casual mistuning can put them off forever.</p>

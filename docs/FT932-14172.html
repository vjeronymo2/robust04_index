			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Tata group plans for the end of the licence-raj - How India's largest company is coping with liberalisation A LONG boardroom battle at Tata Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest company, ended yesterday with the dismissal of 75-year-old Mr Russi Mody, the chairman. Mr Mody had refused to abide by a controversial new retirement policy. Mr Ratan Tata, deputy chairman and a member of the founding Tata family, succeeded Mr Mody, with the support of Mr J. R. D. Tata, the family's 88-year-old patriarch. The Tisco board, meeting in Mr Mody's absence, dismissed him for allegedly attacking the company in the press. Mr Mody criticised the company after Mr Ratan Tata and Mr J. R. D. Tata pressed him to resign against his will after more than 50 years service. MR RATAN Tata, the head of Tata, India's largest industrial group, this month completed a deal that would have been unthinkable five years ago: he sold a controlling stake in one of the group's oldest companies - Tata Oil Mills. Mr Ratan Tata's disposal of assets highlights the challenge India's large family-based groups face with economic liberalisation. No longer can they hide behind protectionist rules. The panoply of controls, known as the licence-raj, is giving way to an economy in which market forces are being given rein. This is creating opportunities but also exposing Indian companies to competition. The Tata group, with annual sales of Dollars 4.5bn in everything from lorries to luxury hotels, looks well-placed to take advantage of change. Its name is a by-word for commercial integrity; it is strong in steel, cement, power, vehicles and engineering, all industries vital to India's future; its international collaborators include top-flight groups, such as IBM and AT&amp;T of the US and Germany's Daimler-Benz. Yet Tata's success is not assured. The company seems to have lost some of the pioneering spirit it showed before 1970, when it founded India's first steelworks, luxury hotel, airline and large-scale software export business. Other groups have grown faster that Tata's 46 operating companies, notably Reliance Industries, the textiles and chemicals combine. Moreover, the group has been torn by a boardroom battle involving Mr J. R. D. Tata, the group's 88-year-old patriarch, Mr Ratan Tata, his 55-year-old successor, and Mr Russi Mody, chairman of Tata Steel, the group's flagship. The struggle over the Tata family men's efforts to force Mr Mody to retire, has absorbed the energy of executives for more than a year. A Bombay businessman, a confidant of Tata managers, says: 'It's like the last days of the Roman Empire at Tata. There's a vacuum at the top and there's no-one to fill it. The group is drifting.' Mr Ratan Tata, who took over in 1991 as chairman of Tata Sons, the group's nerve centre, admits the group has lost some of its unity. But he believes it is regaining it. He aims to stamp his authority on the group and focus on markets in which the group has a strong position or can achieve one. Other businesses must sold or wound down. Mr Ratan Tata's task might have been easier if he had started earlier. But Mr J. R. D. Tata delayed his retirement from the chairmanship of Tata Sons until he was 86. Mr Mody and chiefs of other leading operating companies increasingly ran their businesses independently, sometimes even entering into competition with each other. Mr Ratan Tata's answer was last year to introduce a controversial retirement policy, requiring managing directors of group companies to retire at 65 and chairmen at 75. Tata Steel's Mr Mody refused to go. But, with Mr J. R. D. Tata's support, Mr Ratan Tata yesterday won the encounter. Mr Ratan Tata's problem is that Tata Sons, a privately-owned company controlled by Tata family trusts, and its affiliates, hold only modest stakes in the larger public-quoted operating companies. Since Tata Sons lacks capital, Mr Ratan Tata wants group companies to take stakes in each other. But some bankers in Bombay wonder why outside shareholders should support such investments. Greater group discipline will not alone bring Tata success in the wake of liberalisation. Tata companies must also concentrate on activities in which they hold competitive advantages, and pull out of others. The disposal of Tata Oil Mills, a lossmaking oils and soaps producer long overshadowed by Hindustan Lever, Indian offshoot of Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever, shows Mr Ratan Tata is serious. Tata also needs to cut costs in those businesses it plans to keep. High-cost production from the years of protection must now be phased out. But cost-cutting at Tata has its limits: Tata does not wish to lose its reputation as a generous employer. Moreover, Indian law virtually bans large-scale sackings. Tata executives say they will go as fast as they can, shedding labour through retirements. Mr Ratan Tata wants the group to invest in new businesses, particularly those based on high technology. But a proposal for a Dollars 1bn petrochemicals complex at Haldia near Calcutta has been repeatedly delayed and, according to Mr Ratan Tata, is now under review. The group has had its successes - notably Titan Watches, a new venture in watchmaking in partnership with Timex of the US. But this is modest compared with projects on the drawing board. The only large project to have gone ahead is the Dollars 1bn modernisation of Tata Steel. Partly, the group has been held up by red tape. Partly, too, Tata's ageing top executives were less adventurous than some competitors. Even before he became chairman, Mr Ratan Tata tried to galvanise the group with a series of joint ventures with foreign companies in electronics, oil exploration services and financial services. Foreign partners include Honeywell, the US electronics group, American Express, the financial services combine, and AT&amp;T. But with turnover of less than 10 per cent of Tata Steel's, and patchy profits, the ventures have yet to make a significant contribution. This year, the group has launched a joint venture with IBM, to sell the American group's computers in India and to export software. Similarly, in cars, Tata would like a foreign partner for the joint production of passenger cars. The government's decision this month to lift controls on new investment in the auto industry could enable Tata to revive a planned joint venture with Honda of Japan. Fortunately for Tata and other domestic groups, the government is giving them time to adjust. Import duties will be phased out slowly. And, although the licence-raj is being abolished, foreign companies will still face hurdles to entering India. But if Tata is to take advantage of this breathing space, it will need to move faster in the next five years than it has in the last five.  ------------------------------------------------------------                       TOP TATA COMPANIES              Figures for year to March 1992 (Rs bn)  ------------------------------------------------------------                           Sales     Pre-tax     Tata Sons                                     profits      % stake  ------------------------------------------------------------ Telco                     30.2        2.1          16 Tata Steel                26.8        2.6           8 ACC                       14.2        2.1          12 Tata Electrical Cos       10.8        0.5           9 Voltas                     6.5        0.2          22 Tata Oil Mills             4.2        0.0          20 Tata Chemicals             3.5        0.9          30 Tata Tea                   3.4        0.8          30 Total 46 companies       132.9        9.9           -  ------------------------------------------------------------ Note: Tata Oil Mills sold Apri 1993        Source: Tata Sons.  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Volvo It is just as well that Volvo has finally drummed up some significant shareholder support for its proposed merger with Renault. Independence is simply not an option for an automotive company with such a limited product range. Management's apparent victory, though, is largely tactical. The French clarification of the golden share issue and privatisation programme pulled the rug from under the feet of opponents. Their visceral dislike of ceding a national champion to foreign control will remain. Volvo, therefore, still needs to work hard at its investor relations, which have taken a knock from Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar's strong-willed style. Besides, a close alliance between the company and its owners will help defend Volvo's interests in the Renault deal. In the short run the French company's deteriorating profits will dilute Volvo's earnings. In the longer term Volvo must adapt to the awkward position of having no direct control over its largest asset. Admittedly, Volvo will be the largest single shareholder in Renault-Volvo after privatisation and theoretically be able to exercise considerable influence. But the French side will dominate the executive, and the car industry is littered with examples of failed mergers. The best are those, like Peugeot-Citroen, which involve the maintenance of distinctive brands as well as just cost savings. Volvo must ensure that its brand is not devalued if the merger is to make sense. If not, it could be left with an indifferent investment of no strategic value.</p>

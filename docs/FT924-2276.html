			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Bucking the Trend: Bogus customers produce genuine profits - Guy de Jonquieres explains how a market research company has grown rapidly despite the recession AT A TIME when British companies are paring costs to the bone, asking them to spend as much as Pounds 200,000 a year to serve bogus customers hardly sounds like a winning formula. Yet it is providing BEM Research, a small market research company, with the basis for a business that has thrived through the recession. BEM specialises in measuring customer service. Formed six years ago by three partners with no market research experience, it now has more than 60 clients, for many of which it monitors service standards continuously. They include the Automobile Association, electrical retailers Comet, Currys and Dixons, Ladbroke's betting shops, McDonald's hamburger restaurants, the Forte hotel and leisure group, several local councils and a clutch of regional electricity boards. The company has doubled turnover every year to reach Pounds 2m this year, on which it will earn profits of Pounds 170,000, up from Pounds 36,000 last year and Pounds 18,000 in 1990. UK market research spending as a whole stagnated last year, although it has recovered since the spring. BEM's special edge is the use of 'mystery' customers, who visit retail outlets unannounced. Drawn from a team of 2,000 part-time researchers, they are trained to evaluate service by acting as ordinary members of the public. Mr Steve Jolliffe, managing director, says BEM has prospered during recession because it delivers immediate feedback to its clients and identifies cost-effective ways of improving customer satisfaction. His claim is endorsed by Mr Martin Grant, managing director of Ansells Retail, part of Allied Lyons: 'When times are tough, the most important priority is to keep the business you've got. BEM has done so well because it provides a tool which helps companies retain customers.' Ansells says its 600 managed pubs have increased market share in the two years since BEM began monitoring them and highlighted the importance to customers of points such as clean lavatories and friendly bar service. Mr Jolliffe, a 34-year-old former mining engineer, hit on the idea for 'mystery' customers - and decided to make a business out of it - after receiving poor service at a restaurant several years ago. Incensed, he wrote to the parent company recommending improvements. Many were put into effect, and he was invited to survey other restaurants in the chain. Since then, the technique has been refined. Before carrying out research, BEM asks clients' customers what kind of service they expect and involves employees in setting objectives. Other market research companies, some of which initially frowned on 'mystery' customers, have begun to use the technique. But Mr Jolliffe is confident that BEM can maintain its lead by continuing to invest in people and technology. 'Our competitors have lots of resources but little experience. They use trained interviewers who are used to holding clipboards and are easily spotted. Our mystery customers only do one thing,' he says.</p>

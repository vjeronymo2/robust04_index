			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Quinton Chan] </F>   [Text] At least four villagers are still being detained by  the Guangdong Public Security Bureau (PSB) after a mass peasant  protest ended in violence last weekend. Residents in Gangbei  village said they had yet to be notified when the men would be  released. They were arrested during the anti-corruption riot in  which police fired more than 10 rounds of tear-gas. The men's  families say the four are being held in the PSB office in  Zengcheng, and that they have been seriously beaten and barred  from seeing visitors.    The village, which is about 70 kilometres from Guangzhou,  has  returned to normal although undercover PSB officers are still  stationed in the area and passing vehicles are checked.  However, residents say the peace is superficial. PSB officers  have systematically summoned villagers for questioning. Most  residents are staying indoors, not daring to go out. "I am very  scared," a villager said.    Officials in Shitan county, where the village is located,  are  investigating the case. "The county government is checking the  account by the village committee and the result will be  announced later. If any official is involved in corruption, we  will handle it according to the law," an official notice in the  village states.    The riot among the 3,000-strong crowd broke out over  inadequate compensation for farms taken for urban development.  Residents also accused village representatives of corruption,  of taking compensation assigned to the area but not passing it  on. They claim it dates back to the economic reforms which  started in the early 1980s. "There are more than 200 hectares  of farmland in the village, but since the start of economic  reform, more than two- thirds of it has been taken by the  government for urban development. "The government sells it to  foreign investors, mainly Taiwanese and Hong Kong businessmen,  but we have yet to receive any compensation," said villager Shan  Fu.    Villagers' incomes have been sharply cut because of the land  takeover. "Even worse, we still have to pay the agriculture tax  of 500 yuan [about HK$444] every year," he said. The angry  villager pointed to new Spanish-style houses: "The officials  have taken our compensation and built these houses for  themselves. It is very corrupt here."    The mounting discontent flared when villagers learned that  only 800,000 yuan was left in the village's public account.  "There should be millions of profit from the land sale. Where  has the rest of the money gone?" angry villagers asked. The  entire community gathered in the main street, waving banners  bearing the words "anti-corruption".    Shortly afterwards dozens of PSB officers arrived and fired  tear-gas to curb the protest. "It was just like a war, I was  really scared. Tear-gas was everywhere," one eye witness said.    Shan Yuexin, whose son Sin Sanguang was arrested during the  riots, said he was caught only because several Hong Kong  reporters were in his restaurant when the protest broke out.  "They pulled my son out of the restaurant and beat him up with  a police stick, they were so cruel," he said. "They said my son  had hidden Hong Kong reporters, but it was a fact the  journalists were interviewing villagers in our restaurant."    There were three Hong Kong reporters in the establishment  when the disturbance started, and it was reported the crowd  prevented the police arresting the journalists. "I went to the  PSB office but they didn't allow me to visit my son. I was told  that he was beaten again," Mr Shan said. Another three young  villagers, two of whom were brothers, were also detained. The  brothers' mother burst into tears when she spoke to the Sunday  Morning Post "I don't like to talk anymore, I am very scared. I  am afraid they [the PSB] will give my sons trouble again," she  said.    Village representatives deny the allegations. "We have  invested the money in some enterprises and villagers can get  their money back after they make a profit," said one, but who  refused to give his name. Meanwhile, the peasants have been  scraping together the little spare cash they have to help win  the release of the four still detained, even though their  families have not been notified of the conditions for their  release.    In a bid to appease the angry villagers, the authorities  also  announced that every villager would get 200 yuan compensation  for their loss of farmland. But residents said the amount was  far from enough and added they were considering taking their  case to the Guangdong provincial government. "It isn't even  enough for us to live for a month," one said.    Newspapers and Guangzhou Television have reported the case  without mentioning the riots, saying there was only some  discontent among villagers.    Locals set up an anti-corruption movement last year after  complaining of official graft concerning land compensation.  This latest outburst over land and corruption is the fourth  this month in Guangdong. A farmer of Baigang village, in  Huiyang county, was shot in the leg on April I after scores of  angry villagers clashed with PSB officers over land  compensation. Three days later 200 Xinhua villagers protested  to Huiyang county officials over the amount of compensation  being offered to farmers. They also accused village  representatives of corruption. And residents of Xiaqinwei  village, in Danshui city, also complained of corruption among  their village representatives.    But this may not be the end of the story. A Guangdong  People's Congress delegate, Wang Zhutian, said he was worried  such outbursts would continue if no settlement was made. He  said the disturbances were mainly due to the misunderstanding  between peasants and the government over land resumptions. Mr  Wang added some corruption might be involved and the government  should attack any malpractice.    An official in Guangdong Land Department, who refused to be  named, said all land in the mainland was state-owned, and  peasants only had the right of use. "When we sell the land to  foreign investors we have to spend a lot of money on basic  facilities in the area like road links, water and electricity  supply," he said. "That is the reason for the big difference  between the sale price of the land and the compensation to  villagers." He said the provincial government was highly  concerned about the cases, and was discussing ways of finding a  solution.</p>

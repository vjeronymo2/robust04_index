			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFIDENCE IN ECONOMY RISES, SURVEY INDICATES  </P> <P> Consumers' confidence about the economy increased in December, boosted by low  inflation, low unemployment and growth in personal income, a business-financed  research organization reported.  </P> <P> The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 119.8, up nearly  7 points from November, the board said in a report released today. The index  had declined in November to 113.1 from October's figure of 116.9.  </P> <P> Those surveyed were particularly positive about the current economic situation,  the board said, with this component of the confidence index the highest since  the late 1960s.  </P> <P> The monthly survey of 5,000 U.S. households is conducted for the board by  National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio.  </P> <P> "The consumer's very favorable assessment of prevailing conditions reflects the  continued vigor of the economy and bodes well for the immediate future," said  Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's consumer research center.  </P> <P> "Unemployment is at its lowest level in many years, personal income continues  to grow, and the inflation rate is virtually imperceptible to the average  shopper," he said. "All these factors contribute to a high level of confidence.  </P> <P> "Still, there is some uncertainty about the future, with the policies of the  new Administration on such major issues as the federal budget and the foreign  trade deficits still unknown," he added.  </P> <P> Buying plans remained at roughly the same level for the past few months, the  board said. About 7% of respondents said they plan to purchase a car within six  months, 3.5% intend to buy a home in the period and nearly 29% plan to buy a  major appliance.  </P></p>

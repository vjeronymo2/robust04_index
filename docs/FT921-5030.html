			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Accounting guidelines planned THE ACCOUNTING treatment of post-retirement benefits other than pensions is to be scrutinised by the Accounting Standards Board. The board will also examine reclassifications between fixed and current assets. The urgent issues task force of the ASB, the UK accounting standards body, is expected to produce guidelines on these issues by summer. They would apply until superseded by the more detailed financial reporting standards being drafted by the ASB. Members of the task force will consider whether SSAP 24, the existing guidelines on treatment of pensions, should cover other benefits, such as private medical care. The amount at which transfers should be made between current and fixed assets when revaluations take place will be discussed. Members are also considering the presentation of long-term debtors in current assets, and the accounting treatment of low-start finance. The task force, which was launched last year, has already issued guidelines on the treatment of goodwill on acquisition, restructuring costs and premium put options.</p>

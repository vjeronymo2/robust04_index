			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Principal Hotels goes into administration PRINCIPAL Hotels Group, the shares of which were suspended last Friday while the company's financial position was clarified, went into administrative receivership last night with borrowings of more than Pounds 100m. The Harrogate-based group has 19 hotels in Britain, two each Denmark and the Netherlands and one in France. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountants, will carry on running the group to try and sell it. About 1,000 jobs are involved. Mr Edward Klempka, a partner in Coopers' Leeds office, said: 'The hotels are viable. We will continue to expand until they can be sold.' A management buy-out, trade sale or even reflotation are possible options. Hotels include the Norbreck Castle in Blackpool, the Palace in Copenhagen and the Douglas in Aberdeen. The group was formed in 1988 as a hotels and financial services operation, but sold the latter in 1989. It borrowed heavily to refurbish old hotels on prominent sites and became over-geared. The recession hit bookings and the vital conference trade, pushing losses for the 16 months to last October to more than Pounds 10m. In January, Principal postponed interest payments on its 11 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock pending restructuring.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUNGBLOOD RUNS, PASSES CARSON PAST BANNING, 41-0  </P> <P> Armin Youngblood completed 12 of 21 passes for 254 yards and three touchdowns  to lead Carson to a 41-0 victory over Banning Thursday night before a national  TV audience and an estimated 12,000 fans at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Carson has five consecutive victories over its neighborhood rival, including a  55-7 win in last season's City 4-A Division championship game.  </P> <P> Banning controlled Carson's short passing game early, forcing the Colts to work  on the ground late in the second quarter. In a six-play, 50-yard drive,  Youngblood gained 32 yards on consecutive runs, setting up a five-yard  touchdown run by Abdul Muhammed.  </P> <P> On the next Carson possession, senior wide receiver Michael Ross caught  Youngblood's 24-yard touchdown pass to make it 14-0.  </P> <P> Ross, who holds most of Carson's season and career receiving records, caught  four passes for 104 yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Colt defense, led by All-American linebacker Nkosi Littleton and lineman  Marcus Long, held Banning and its standout senior quarterback, John Ma'ae, to  19 yards in the first half.  </P> <P> Banning's comeback hopes received a major blow on the last play in the first  half, when Ma'ae injured a knee. Ma'ae, who completed four of five passes for  35 yards, was removed from the field on a stretcher and taken to Long Beach  Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> Youngblood and Ross hooked up on a 19-yard touchdown pass play in the third  quarter, and Michael Jefferson's two-yard scoring run in the same period made  it 28-0.  </P> <P> That was increased in the fourth quarter, Youngblood connecting with Tydus  Winans on a 44-yard touchdown pass play, and linebacker Mathew Faraimo scoring  on a 12-yard fumble recovery. Carson improved to 7-1; Banning is 6-2-1.  </P></p>

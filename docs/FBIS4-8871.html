			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by S. Georgievski, "Rating Issue One -- 1994: </F> Popularity Among People"]    [Editorial Report] The 18 March edition of the Skopje  weekly PULS reports the results of a popularity poll conducted  during 11-15 March in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  (FYROM) by the Data Press Agency exclusively for PULS. The  survey provides the first indication of public response to  leadership changes in the largest Albanian party and is the  first poll reported since Greece imposed a blockade on  Macedonia's southern border.  <H5>  Methodology </H5>   The survey was conducted by telephone, using a sample of 300  names chosen from the telephone book, a method which virtually  eliminated respondents from rural areas (less than 4 percent of  the sample). According to the polling organization Data Press,  the respondents are representative of the population in terms of  sex, age, and educational background. Seventy-five percent of  the respondents are Macedonian, 19 percent are Albanian, 3.33  percent are Serbian, 0.33 percent are Turkish, and 2.33 percent  are from other ethnic groups. While three-fourths of the  respondents claimed no political affiliation, the rest were  members of or were sympathetic to a range of political parties:  12 percent for the Party for Democratic Prosperity and People's  Democratic Party (two ethnic Albanian parties that are part of  the governing coalition), 4.67 percent for the Social Democratic  Alliance of Macedonia (the main party in the governing  coalition), 2.67 percent for the Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian  National Unity (or VMRO-DPMNE, an opposition party with the  largest number of seats in the country's parliament), another 2  percent for the Liberal Party (a member of the governing  coalition), and the remaining four percent distributed among the  55 other parties in Macedonia. Data Press's sample includes:  20.67 percent unemployed, 42 percent employed in the state  sector, 10.33 percent working in the private sector, 2.33  percent students over age 18, and 24.67 percent retired. The  margin of error for this survey was not given.  <H5>  Highlights </H5>   Only five politicians received 50 percent or better approval  ratings: President Kiro Gligorov (85.63 percent), Assembly  Chairman Stojan Andov (62 percent), Foreign Minister Stevo  Crvenkovski (about 60 percent), Interior Minister Ljubomir  Frckovski (51.67 percent), and Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski  (about 51 percent). Gligorov and the two Crvenkovskis have  maintained their popularity relatively unchanged since a similar  poll published by PULS in December 1993. Among the more notable  changes for other politicians were:    --the continuing decline in popularity of Democratic Party  leader Petar Gosev, whose ratings were 52 percent in September  1993, 49.53 percent in December 1993, and 41.67 percent in the  most recent poll;    --Minister of Defense Vlado Popovski's growing popularity  from 18 percent in March 1993 to 35 percent in December 1993 and  48 percent in March.    --the increasing prominence of Todor Petrov, an independent  parliamentarian and notable critic of the government, who was  not even mentioned in the December 1993 poll but who is now  viewed favorably by almost half of the survey sample. [See FBIS  Foreign Media Note 94-028, 25 February, for details of the  earlier PULS polls and an earlier poll conducted by the "BriMa"  polling organization, apparently using dissimilar methods.] PULS  also noted that, despite the VMRO-DPMNE's negative appraisal of  the government's foreign policy, 75 percent of VMRO-DPMNE  supporters still viewed Foreign Minister Crvenkovski favorably.  <H5>  The Ethnic Factor </H5>   In a popularity ranking of political leaders, ethnicity  proved to be the most salient factor. Albanian leaders scored  high among Albanian respondents and low among non-Albanians, as  for example happened to Djeladin [Xheladin] Murati, the leader  of one faction of the Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity,  who received 94.74 percent approval from Albanian respondents,  but only a 10.22 percent positive rating from non-Albanians. The  ethnic factor is also significant in the case of the Macedonian  nationalist VMRO-DPMNE representatives. For example, the  approval/disapproval ratings for VMRO-DPMNE leader Ljupco  Georgievski by ethnicity of the respondents are: Macedonians  20.89/66.67; Albanians 3.51/91.23; Serbs 20/70; Turks 0/100; and  other ethnic groups 28.57/57.14.    The poll also points to ethnicity as a factor in the ratings  of Macedonia's president. Only 42.11 percent of Albanians  surveyed gave Gligorov a positive rating, compared to 96 percent  of the Macedonians, and nearly 100 percent of the Serbs, Turks,  and other ethnic groups. Similarly, Stojan Andov received  approval/disapproval ratings of 22.81/54.39 among Albanians.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |Approval      |Disapproval   |No Opinion    |Not Recognized|  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kiro Gligorov |86            |6             |8             |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Stojan Andov  |62            |23            |15            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Stevo Crvenko-|60            |21            |18            |1             |  |vski          |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ljubomir Frck-|52            |31            |16            |1             |  |ovski         |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Branko Crvenk-|51[.sup]1[/]|26[.sup]1[/]|22[.sup]1[/]|1             |  |ovs           |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vlado Popovski|48[.sup]1[/]|2[.sup]1[/] |17[.sup]1[/]|15[.sup]1[/]|  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Todor Petrov  |47[.sup]1[/]|4[.sup]1[/] |16[.sup]1[/]|13[.sup]1[/]|  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Petar Gosev   |42            |42            |16            |--            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jovan Andonov,|36[.sup]1[/]|14[.sup]1[/]|35[.sup]1[/]|15[.sup]1[/]|  | former deput-|              |              |              |              |  |y prime minis-|              |              |              |              |  |ter, now mini-|              |              |              |              |  |ster-coordina-|              |              |              |              |  |tor           |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kiro Popovski,|35            |33            |17[.sup]1[/]|15[.sup]1[/]|  | deputy chair-|              |              |              |              |  |man, parliame-|              |              |              |              |  |nt            |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bekir Zuta, d-|32[.sup]1[/]|31            |20[.sup]1[/]|17[.sup]1[/]|  |eputy prime m-|              |              |              |              |  |inister       |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ante Popovski,|30            |28            |22[.sup]1[/]|20[.sup]1[/]|  | leader of MA-|              |              |              |              |  |AK [Movement  |              |              |              |              |  |for All-Maced-|              |              |              |              |  |onian Action] |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jane Miljovsk-|29            |21            |26            |24            |  |i, minister w-|              |              |              |              |  |ithout portfo-|              |              |              |              |  |lio;

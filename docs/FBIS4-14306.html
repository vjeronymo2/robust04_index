			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister </F> Sa'ud al-Faysal Al Sa'ud and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher in Riyadh on 28 April]    [Text] In reply to a question on whether he had discussed  with the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques the project for the  extension of the telecommunications network in the Kingdom and  whether one of the U.S. companies had won the deal, the U.S.  Secretary of State said: I did not discuss this matter with the  King and I am certain that the matter will be examined carefully  here in Saudi Arabia. I am also certain that the government  will seriously study the bid made by U.S. IT&amp;T.    Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal Al Sa'ud replied to a  question on whether he had received a pledge from the American  side to speed up the Middle East peace process and said: As Mr.  Christopher has noted, they are endeavoring on this path and the  U.S. is hoping and is determined to contribute in speeding up  the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and in  pushing forward the other processes.    Prince al-Faysal was asked about the outcome of the  discussions on the Arab-Israeli peace talks in the other  processes. In reply he said that the Custodian of the Two Holy  Mosques told Secretary Christopher that he hoped that during his  current visit to the states in the region, progress would be  achieved and that serious and persistent efforts would be made  toward a just and comprehensive solution in the Syrian process.  He also reaffirmed the need to advance on the Lebanese process.    Asked if he was prepared to lift the boycott of Israel the  Saudi Foreign Minister said: Yes. We have discussed the  question of the boycott and as you know this issue was reviewed  within the framework of the Arab League. We expect and we hope  that progress will be made in this respect after the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles. We also hope  that this will take place after progress has been made in the  other processes of the talks.    Moreover, Christopher replied to a question on the foreign  ministers' meeting in Europe next week on Bosnia and whether he  had discussed the matter with Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev  yesterday and whether he had any reaction to a report released  in Geneva today on the situation in Gorazde and he said: The  contact group must be given the necessary time to explore the  matter with the various sides but only after they are given the  opportunity which will enable them to do that. He indicated  that the contact group would present a report to the foreign  ministers of the countries concerned. He added: We discussed  this issue in general terms yesterday and we wanted to give the  contact group, which has links with many sides, the opportunity  to explore the matter but as soon as possible. We will move  quickly to start the talks on Thursday and Friday. He expressed  the hope to see this take place at the appropriate time in the  near future. He indicated that this was the moment which would  give the opportunity to achieve some progress in the context of  NATO's clear success in Gorazde.    Responding to a question on the lifting of sanctions on  Iraq,  Secretary Christopher said: I believe that the statement I have  made is self-explanatory on this subject. However I can say  that I believe that when the Security Council member states see  that Iraq is not complying with the resolutions and the existing  sanctions, these states will realize the importance of  maintaining these sanctions. I also believe that it is high  time the U.S. and all those interested in the situation in Iraq  stood together to prevent Iraq from getting the impression that  there will be any easing of the sanctions.    Responding to another question, Foreign Minister Sa'ud  al-Faysal Al Sa'ud said: I would also like to refer you to a  statement made by the Gulf Cooperation Council on the subject  and which I read at the beginning. Moreover, I would like to  say that these sanctions, in our opinion, are an integral part  and Iraq must commit itself to implement all the Security  Council resolutions, particularly the resolution on the  recognition of the Iraqi-Kuwait borders which is considered to  be the core of the conflict. We do not wish to see a repetition  of this conflict in our region. Thus, we must ensure that this  point in the UN resolutions is fully implemented; and we would  also like to ensure that what is going to be implemented is not  only related to the issue of weapons mentioned in the  resolutions.    I also reaffirm what Secretary Christopher has said to the  effect that this common stand which we are adopting is not a  hostile stand toward the Iraqi people but it is a stand aimed at  ensuring that the conflict is not repeated in the future between  Iraq and the countries in the region, as this would cause  further pain to the people of Iraq and the peoples of the  region. If anybody is responsible for the situation in which  the people of Iraq find themselves, the government of Iraq is  certainly responsible. In a nutshell, the UN resolutions deal  very clearly with the humanitarian aspects; therefore, the  government of Iraq is entirely responsible.    Asked whether he has discussed with Gulf ministers the  situation in Yemen, Secretary Christopher said: Yes, during my  meeting with the GCC ministers and during my meeting with King  Fahd the situation in Yemen was discussed. The ministers and  King Fahd insisted on the need for the two parties concerned in  Yemen to resolve their disputes for the sake of peace in the  region. The Saudi foreign minister might want to add something  to that.    At this point, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal spoke and said: Thank  you. I believe that our two positions reflect our hope that all  disputes, whatever they may be, are resolved through  negotiations and talks. Furthermore, many Arab and other sides  are intervening in this respect and we hope that these disputes  will be resolved peacefully and amicably within the framework of  Yemen's unity.</p>

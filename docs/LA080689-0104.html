			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: GETTING THE REAL SCOOP ON ICE CREAM IN ITALY  </P> <P> It is warm this August afternoon. I think I'll slip down to the kitchen and  have a glass of iced coffee and a scoop of store-bought sherbet.  </P> <P> I will do that because it is there, and I have vowed not to stray far from my  desk. If I were free to wander anywhere for an ice cream break, I'd go to Italy  -- home of the winsome gelato.  </P> <P> Perhaps I would head for a table at the gelato palace of Vivoli, near the  magnificent Santa Croce Church in Florence. Santa Croce is a Franciscan  showplace, a splendid art museum and the site of Michelangelo's tomb.  </P> <P> Santa Croce also is the home of a best-buy leather goods shop, with wares made  by students of the church's leathercraft school.  </P> <P> On August afternoons I imagine that the students and friars also are tempted to  slip over to Vivoli at 7 Via Isola delle Stinche. I would nod to them in  passing as I chose a cup of the sinfully rich gelato called Tira Misu, a flavor  that blends espresso, dark chocolate and real cream. The name translates as  "pick-me-up," which is what I need this afternoon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glittering With Tiles  </P> <P> Farther south in Tuscany I would walk up from the fan-shaped Piazza del Campo,  in the medieval heart of Siena, to a gelateria called Nannini.  </P> <P> The emporium at 99 Banchi de Sopra glitters with pink and white tiles. Flavors  are arranged as if on an artist's palette: pastel sherbets (called granita) are  at one end of the spectrum, the deepest chocolate combinations hold down the  other.  </P> <P> It was at this Nannini (other branches serve less ice cream and more other  stuff, like jawbreaker panforte cakes) that I first tasted tartufo, a flavor as  decadent as a double chocolate truffle.  </P> <P> The evening passeggiata, or promenade, winds down the curving street, past  Nannini and its neighbor, the ornate headquarters of the Monte dei Paschi di  Siena. Said to be the world's oldest operating bank, it opened two years before  Columbus visited America.  </P> <P> On its stone piazza is a statue of Sallustio Bandini, a Siena economist and  priest. He is wearing a full-length cassock. The fifth button from the top is  unbuttoned, as are three at the waist. He is scowling across at Nannini. Could  these things be related?  </P> <P> In the towered hill town of San Gimignano I would line up at the gelato window  of the Pasticceria Mercella e Armando, near the central Piazza della Cisterna.  Walnut and filbert are among their homemade treats. The owners are proud  members of the Italian gelato society, which assures that the ice cream is made  on the premises and is of superior quality.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Famed for Mosaics  </P> <P> In Ravenna I would go back to the Gelateria San Vitale on the Via Cavour near  the Basilica of San Vitale, famed for its dazzling 6th-Century mosaics. Trays  of wild strawberry ice cream are topped with small crimson berries. Slices of  kiwi fruit and curls of lemon are other flavors. The house specialty is Cremino  San Vitale, which smacks of frozen cappuccino.  </P> <P> In Rome, near the Piazza Colonna, there is the marble-floored Giolitti, where  Romans would do battle -- in season -- for a dish of the fresh chestnut puree  called marroni. Bittersweet chocolate is always a winner.  </P> <P> But all roads don't lead to Rome, or even Italy. If my craving for ice cream  took me to Paris, I'd happily cross the footbridge behind Notre Dame Cathedral  and merge with the faithful at Berthillon's parlor on the Ile St. Louis.  </P> <P> From a chalkboard of fresh flavors I would order ripe Camembert ice cream, or  Glace au The de Chine (made with smoky Chinese tea, perhaps Lapsang Souchong),  or some splendid concoction I have never tried before.  </P> <P> Berthillon's is where I was first forced to eat my words about the blandness of  vanilla ice cream. The family boasts of using vanilla beans from Madagascar,  which they favor over the beans from Tahiti. The result is like an exotic nut  swirl.  </P> <P> Not long ago I again scoffed at vanilla ice cream -- this time on an  all-Hawaiian menu in the Garden restaurant at the Mauna Kea Hotel on the Big  Island. Why would anyone choose plain vanilla -- even if made with local beans  -- in a land lush with guavas, mangoes, coconuts and pineapples? On an island  where Kona coffee grows, and there are macadamia nut trees?  </P> <P> I clung to my macadamia instincts for dessert, but my husband ordered the  vanilla and insisted that I have a taste.  </P> <P> I can only describe its silky texture, subtle crunch and heady sweetness by  confessing that it was as wondrous as chocolate.  </P> <P> And that's the real scoop, if not the real skinny.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Former S&amp;L Owners' Trial Delayed: U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon has  delayed the criminal trial of the former owners of Orange-based Ramona Savings  &amp; Loan until June 13 because of a scheduling conflict. John L. Molinaro and  Donald P. Mangano were scheduled to stand trial begining today on more than 30  criminal charges including bank fraud and conspiracy in connection with a Palm  Springs real estate deal that regulators say contributed to Ramona's September,  1986, collapse. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office said a lengthy  civil lawsuit Kenyon is currently hearing forced the postponement.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEATING DENIES HE TRIED TO GET OFFICIALS FIRED;  </P> <P> HEARING: BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGES TAKING COMPLAINTS ABOUT ONE TOP OFFICIAL TO THE  WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.  </P> <P> Financier Charles H. Keating Jr. on Wednesday rejected a suggestion that he  tried to remove any thrift regulator who challenged him, but he acknowledged  that he took his complaints about one top official as far as to the White House  chief of staff.  </P> <P> Office of Thrift Supervision attorney James Murphy, defending the government's  April, 1989, seizure of Keating's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., suggested  during the hearing in U.S. District Court that Keating believed that every  regulator who challenged him was motivated by personal animosity and that  Keating tried to have that person fired or removed from his case.  </P> <P> Keating, finishing eight days of testimony in a hearing related to his suit to  recover the thrift, denied that.  </P> <P> "Had I been listened to, this country would be $500 billion better off," he  said.  </P> <P> However, asked whether he had tried to get Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal  Home Loan Bank Board, fired, Keating replied: "I spoke with the Administration  about it. Yes. I thought he was wrecking the industry."  </P> <P> In response to a question from U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, Keating  identified then-Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan as the Reagan Administration  official.  </P> <P> Keating told reporters that he did not believe the meeting in Regan's office  influenced Regan, who he said had become unhappy with Gray long before.  </P> <P> Gray has said Regan tried to force him to resign before his term expired at the  end of June, 1987.  </P> <P> The Regan meeting is only one example of the length of Keating's political  reach. Five senators who accepted political contributions from Keating are  being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for having met with  regulators on his behalf in April, 1987.  </P> <P> The Office of Thrift Supervision has asked Sporkin to dismiss Keating's suit.  Sporkin could eventually decide to uphold the seizure, find it invalid or order  a full trial.  </P> <P> Earlier in his testimony Wednesday, Keating testily dismissed a government  attorney's suggestion that he had used Lincoln in an attempt to persuade Saudi  investors to support his Arizona real estate ventures.  </P> <P> "That's absurd!" Keating responded.  </P> <P> The contention that Keating used the federally insured deposits in Lincoln for  his holding company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, is a key point in  the government's argument justifying the seizure of Lincoln. They estimate  Lincoln's collapse will cost the taxpayers $2 billion.  </P></p>

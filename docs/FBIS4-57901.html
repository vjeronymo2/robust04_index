			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Claudia de Souza] </F>   [Excerpt] On 23 May, Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero began  to train entrepreneurs for the fixed exchange rate system that  will follow the implementation of the real. He said he is  concerned about the consequences the new system will have for  exports. The minister mentioned studies on taxation  modifications and anti-dumping laws, without giving, however,  any concrete details.    At Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries in Sao Paulo,  Ricupero said "what in the past was compensated for with an  exchange rate adjustment, should now be compensated for with  more efficiency and productivity, and this calls for greater  efforts from entrepreneurs." The economic team has already  decided to adopt a fixed exchange rate system. When addressing  the entrepreneurs, however, the minister preferred to use the  expression "stable exchange rate. Fixed is a strong word  because as physics has demonstrated, there is nothing fixed in  the world. In a stable economy, there is no reason for the  exchange rate to be unstable."    Yesterday, Ricupero adopted a more categorical position on  the economic plan: "We are betting strongly on the stability of  the currency and the economy," he said. He refused to debate  the inflation rate in real value units or to make any forecast  about it: "These are hypotheses that predict failure." [passage  omitted]</p>

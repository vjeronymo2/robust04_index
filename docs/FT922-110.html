			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Newmont says bank interested in backing Uzbek gold project NEWMONT MINING, north America's biggest gold producer, says the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is interested in leading a syndicate of European banks to provide about USDollars 60m of project finance for Newmont's joint venture in newly-independent Uzbekistan. Mr Gordon Parker, Newmont's chairman, says that the venture is 'a perfect project for the EBRD and fits the bank's charter and purposes exactly'. He points out that the main attraction from the bank's poimnt of view is that Newmont and Uzbekistan, which used to account for about one-third of the former Soviet Union's gold production, intend to export all the gold produced from the venture for sale at world prices. However, Newmont is still working on a bankable feasibility study so the EBRD cannot yet give any commitment. Other European banks are 'queueing up to get involved,' Mr Parker says. Mr Peter Philip, Newmont's president, says the capital cost of the venture is likely to be between USDollars 80m and Dollars 100m. Project finance will provide about two-thirds of the cash while Newmont and Uzbekistan will share the rest equally, as they will share the profit on the gold. Newmont will retain its share of the revenue not needed for capital expenditure outside Uzbekistan. Newmont revealed earlier this year that it aimed to use its heap-leach technology to extract gold from low-grade ore stockpiled at Muruntau, reputed to be the world's biggest gold mine. The mine's mill cannot treat this ore. The joint ventures estimate that there is 3m troy ounces in the stockpile and hope to produce between 180,000 and 360,000 ounces annually for at least ten years, starting in 1993. Mr Parker says that Newmont's 20-year agreement with the relevant state committee was, at the US company's request, given additional authority by a cabinet decree. He says Newmont was careful not to drive too hard a bargain so any new government was unlikely to throw out the deal because 'it is good for Uzbekistan'. The joint venturers have agreed to follow Swedish law as Uzbekistan has no mining laws of its own.</p>

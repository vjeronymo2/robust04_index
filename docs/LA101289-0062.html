			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Hold the organ music: Friday the 13th has apparently exacted its curse on  Valentina Vitale and Anthony Nunzio, the title characters of "Tony n' Tina's  Wedding." The producers of the environmental theater piece that re-creates an  Italian-American wedding celebration have canceled this Friday's press  performance. The reason: anticipated noise interference from a Rip magazine  party-concert (featuring Faster Pussycat, Wolfsbane, Phantom Blue, Love Hate,  Johnny Krash, Mimes) that will be going on in a room directly above a ballroom  at the Park Plaza Hotel, where the mock wedding is staged.

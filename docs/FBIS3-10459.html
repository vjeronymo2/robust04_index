The new acquisitions fall within an overall plan to  modernize  the Chilean Armed Forces' equipment, and in the FACh's case they  are to replace the old Hawker Hunter fighters and other aircraft.    Gen. Vega said there is still nothing definite about the  purchase of Mirage fighters, although he admitted "it is a  possibility the FACh is assessing."    Vega made this statement after a ceremony in which he  received a Spanish-made CASA transportation aircraft, model  C-212, the first of a group of six to replace the Twin Otter  aircraft that operate in southern Chile.</p>

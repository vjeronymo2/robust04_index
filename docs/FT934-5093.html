			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Pay-freeze policy prompts union fury - Public sector Britain's 5m public-sector workers face an almost unprecedented pay bill freeze, lasting until 1997 under the government's plans to curb public spending. The chancellor said in his statement that central government running costs 'including pay bills' are to be 'frozen at this year's cash level' of Pounds 20.1bn. He added: 'Pay increases for public-sector staff will have to be paid for by greater efficiency or savings in the cost of running government.' In the long history of public-sector pay restraint since 1945, no government has attempted to freeze public-sector pay bills for three consecutive financial years. In 1978-79 a tight 5 per cent pay policy ended in the infamous Winter of Discontent, while public-sector pay pauses and freezes imposed in the 1960s by governments failed to last. Union reaction was swift and hostile. Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, associate general secretary of Unison, the public service union, said: 'This policy is not sustainable. You can't treat people in this cavalier fashion when the consequence will be massive unemployment.' The Trades Union Congress said last night: 'The outlook for the public sector is very grim indeed. The chancellor's options in the public sector are substantial job cuts, a continuing wage freeze, or more efficiencies which will be extremely hard to find.' The Budget announcement was a hardening of Mr Clarke's policy on public-sector pay for the next financial year announced in September when it was made clear that any pay rises for the 1994-1995 would have to be met by efficiency savings of at least 2 per cent and from other economies. Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation said: 'This is unprecedented and it marks a substantial extension of the government's public-sector pay policy. The longer the policy lasts, the harder it will be to sustain. It will undermine public-sector morale, encourage labour turnover and widen enormously the earnings gap between the public and private sector.' Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said last night that he was holding back Pounds 50m in grants from the Further Education Funding Council until there had been 'satisfactory progress within colleges towards more flexible contracts of employment'.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Dangers of a US share and bond bubble: Group warns of 'irresponsible' Fed US Federal Reserve monetary policy is irresponsibly expansionary and creating a bubble in bond and share prices, according to a group of US monetarists. If it does not change course soon, the US will face an 'asset price bubble' similar to that which destabilised financial markets in Japan in the late 1980s, the group says. In recent days the bull market has shown signs of fragility with sharp falls in share and bond prices. In late trading yesterday, however, confidence returned, pushing the yield on the long bond back below 6 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 17.89 higher at 3,633.65. The critique comes from the shadow open market committee, a group of economists set up 20 years ago to challenge conventional wisdom on US monetary policy. The monetary base has risen 11 per cent in the past year - double the rate of growth of nominal GDP of 5 to 5.5 per cent, Prof Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, the head of the group, said this week, publishing its twice-yearly report. The economy is thus awash with liquidity most of which has found its way into financial markets. Long bond yields have fallen steeply, he claims, not because of confidence that inflation will remain low but because, with growth of reserves far exceeding loan demand, excess cash is being used to purchase government securities. 'We believe the Fed has delayed too long in responding to an emerging bubble in asset prices,' he says. 'The time has long passed when the Fed should have tightened monetary policy.' The criticism that Fed policy is too lax runs counter to the views of many mainstream economists who argue that the Fed ought to consider cutting rates further in order to stimulate a still sluggish economic recovery. Those wanting the Fed to be more expansionary complain that M2, the main measure of broad money, has barely grown at all in recent years. Prof Meltzer and colleagues, however, prefer to focus on narrow measures of the money supply, such as the monetary base which consists of currency in circulation plus banks' reserves with the Fed. Unlike M2 this measure has not been distorted by a shift from bank deposits to money market instruments in recent years. The initial impact of excessive growth of the monetary base is to raise asset prices. But it will eventually feed through into higher consumer price inflation, the group warns. The Fed has thus been lulled into a false sense of security. 'We urge the Fed to slow the growth of the monetary base by three percentage points to an annual rate of no more than 8 per cent,' says Prof Meltzer. He refuses to predict how large an increase in short-term rates this might require but concedes that it will be more than the quarter-point increase which was recommended by some analysts earlier in the summer. In congressional hearings, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has indicated that real short-term interest rates (the nominal interest rate minus inflation) are close to zero and cannot be maintained at this historically low level indefinitely. But the Fed has so far postponed a raising of rates because economic growth has been slower than expected and because an apparent spurt in inflation in the spring has since been reversed.</p>

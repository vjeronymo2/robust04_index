			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "For the Report's Indication of `Trade Barriers' </F> To Be Persuasive"]    [Text] It is difficult to maintain the free trade system  with ordinary efforts. When we read the 1994 report on unfair  trading practices, we feel this sharply.    The report was compiled by a subcommittee of the Industrial  Structure Council (an advisory body to the minister of  international trade and industry). The Industrial Structure  Council [ISC] surveyed 10 nations and region, including the  United States and the European Union (EU), that are Japan's  major trading partners to determine whether those nations and  regions adopt unfair trading policies and how unfair those  trading policies are. This year, the ISC surveyed China and  Taiwan, too. As its highlight, the report calls on Japan's  major trading partners to address their unfair trading practices.    The report's analysis is clear-cut. The report uses accords  of the GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is to  be founded under a new multilateral agreement, and international  trade rules as criteria for determining whether trade policies  adopted by those nations and regions are fair or not.    The report points out to Japan's major trading partners  rather than accusing them one-sidedly. Noting that there are  trade barriers in many nations including Japan, the report urges  those nations to work cooperatively together to remove them.    The basis for the report's analysis is undisputable and we  agree with many points the report advocates. The report proposes  that trade frictions be settled by multilateral arbitrations in  accordance with international trade accords. We agree with the  report's proposal.    The question is whether the report is persuasive or not.    This spring, the EU abolished its long-standing  discriminatory measures against and quantitative restrictions on  Japan. South Korea also has abolished discriminatory measures  against Japanese material patents, including medicine, and the  country is now moving toward halving its quantitative  restrictions on Japan.    How about the United States? Of 13 sectors surveyed, the  report identifies that the United States still keeps trade  barriers in place in 10 sectors, an increase of one sector over  a year earlier, through quantitative restrictions, subsidies and  antidumping measures.    There was some improvement last year. To site an example,  Japan ended its voluntary restraint on the export of automobiles  and machine tools to the American market at the request of the  United States.    Meanwhile, the United States unilaterally imposed  countervailing tariffs on steel products exported by the EU and  enacted a protectionist law governing the standard and  certification system for imported automobiles. Last year, the  United States revived the Super 301 Provision which allows the  administration to unilaterally slap sanctions against U.S.  trading partners. This is a matter of the greatest concern.    The U.S. market still has plenty of affluence and  potentiality although the U.S. economic power is said to have  been waned. The U.S. market is widely open and highly  transparent. It is easy to gain access to it. Both industrial  nations and developing countries therefore are aiming to gain  access to it.    Japan has a huge amount of trade surplus with the United  States. How much did the package of measures serve to address  the trade imbalance between the two countries? Although it is  said that both Japan and the United States need to make  concerted efforts to address their trade imbalance, we cannot  help but say that Japan's speedy measurers are crucial in  balancing the bilateral trade.    If Japan, whose economic power ranks second in the world  following the United States, opens its market and expands its  domestic demand, this would reinforce the credibility of the  report's objective and detailed verifications.    The report stresses the need to fully use the accord on the  WTO, which is to be founded in January 1995, in accordance with  a multilateral agreement hammered out at the multilateral trade  negotiations (the Uruguay Round), but prospects for this are not  necessarily optimistic. The Diet in Japan and the Congress in  the United States have yet to deliberate the accord for  ratification.    Japan needs to speedily defuse the trade friction with the  United States and to work vigorously to get the WTO inaugurated.  Japan should not let the United States rush to protectionism.</p>

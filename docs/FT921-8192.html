			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Red tape cuts to be accelerated REGULATIONS on betting shops, employment agencies, licensed taxis and some professional partnerships could be revised or abandoned under the government's initiative to cut the red tape surrounding British businesses. Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, yesterday reported on progress to reduce the 'irksome burdens' on business and set out plans to step up deregulation over the next year. He said the Home Office was considering if betting shops should be allowed to open late to reflect the increase in evening race meetings. Licensing controls on taxis and other passenger-hire vehicles were being reviewed by the Department of Transport to establish if they were unnecessarily restrictive. Mr Redwood said the Department of Trade and Industry also intended to ease restrictions on the size of large partnerships offering a mix of professional disciplines. On a broader front, Mr Redwood said businesses had been relieved of 163 forms and guidance documents in the past 12 months. As part of the initiative, government departments had also identified 20 of more than 400 types of business licences which they intended to scrap during the coming year. Mr Redwood said the thrust to eliminate outdated and often costly regulatory measures was being targeted partially at Brussels, which produced many regulations and directives affecting business. He said the British government intended to oversee 'a deregulatory presidency', particularly in respect of the single market, when it assumed the EC presidency in the summer. The minister stressed that government departments were also examining ways of reducing the statistical burden on industry and commerce. Local authorities were being encouraged to examine the necessity of regulations and to ensure enforcement was consistent. Mr Redwood said the government was particularly concerned to ease the burden for small businesses. Increasing numbers of companies could now make much simplified tax returns, and a review was under way to see if audit and accounting requirements for very small businesses could also be reduced. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, yesterday announced a scheme to bring senior academics into industry for up to six months to work on technology projects.</p>

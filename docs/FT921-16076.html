			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / European Diary (Czechoslovakia): Monastery tempts Prague's elite with taste of Hell LATE in the evening, when most of Prague is asleep, black Mercedes and BMWs make their way to the 800-year-old Strahov monastery on a hill above the baroque capital. A hand-made sign swings from a tree at the main gate. It reads Peklo or 'Hell'. The monastery, confiscated along with all church property by the communist authorities in the 1950s, was recently returned to the Roman Catholic church. The abbot of the monastery, Father Opat, has found ingenious ways to raise money for much-needed restoration. Five metres underground, in cellars where monks did penance in earlier centuries, the local nouveau-riche mingle on a disco dance floor with ambassadors and foreign visitors. At dawn all is quiet again, and the sign is taken down. 'I think he just believed me when I said the club would not hamper the monastery's life,' says Mr Doriano Maltaliati, the club's manager, speaking of his arrangement with Father Opat. Mr Maltaliati, an Italian who owns six restaurants in Milan, had to do some hard bargaining with the priest to secure the three-year rental contract. Fr Opat was considering offers from about 10 other western investors. 'This is going to be a private elitist club, for members only and without any shabby business going on,' the Italian businessman explains. Not a note can be heard outside the cellars; parties take place between 12th century walls, moist with four natural underground water sources. 'In July we were wearing winter coats to come down here. Everything was damp and not a single light could be lit. It was a complete ruin. Forty-three permits from various ministries were needed to restore it.' Mr Maltaliati points to the elegant black steel lamps hanging on the walls. 'I designed everything. Czech entrepreneurs made it all.' Fr Opat, meanwhile, is making a small fortune renting the floor space at a price which rivals Paris or Milan. Hell is raising profits. The priest is also planning to rent some of the monastery grounds to a foreign company which wants to build a hotel. Mr Maltaliati runs a restaurant within the club, but getting the right food has not been easy. 'It's really hell,' he admits, laughing. Every day I have to send one person to go around the city to find just lettuce.' He says most goods have to be imported from Italy in small quantities, to get through the borders. 'Officially, samples of imported food products should be left at the Agriculture Ministry for approval but it would take months.' In a dark enclave next to the dance floor, the young waiter wearing a black tie says he earns twice the average local salary, and then asks: 'You mean officially or unofficially?' Mr Maltaliati's ambitions do not stop with Hell. He is buying a restaurant at the foot of the medieval Charles bridge in the heart of Prague. It will specialise in traditional Czech cuisine, a rarity in the city judging from uniform menus offering the same five or six dishes. Plans also include a cafe serving espresso coffee and croissants, and a showroom next to the Old Theatre which will offer luxurious bathroom equipment. 'I was making more money in Milan but Prague has a special air about it,' says Mr Maltaliati. 'You can just do crazy things here you could never afford in other western towns.'</p>

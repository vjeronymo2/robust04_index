			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PERU AID ON LINE, DRUG CZAR SAYS  </P> <P> Federal anti-drug chief William J. Bennett said today if a reluctant Peruvian  President-elect Alberto Fujimori refuses to sign a new drug-fighting accord, it  could cost his nation future U.S. economic aid.  </P> <P> "One is a condition of the other," Bennett said. "If we don't see serious  efforts against the drug traffickers, then we aren't going to be inclined to  offer economic assistance."  </P> <P> Bennett added, however, that he is hopeful Fujimori will ultimately approve the  accord under which the United States would provide Peru with $39.9 million in  military aid in fiscal 1991, all in equipment and training, to help Peruvian  forces combat cocaine growers, processors and smugglers.  </P></p>

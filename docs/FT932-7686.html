			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Ireland's president to take tea at the palace AFTER seven decades during which British monarchs seemed to overlook the existence of the neighbouring Irish Republic, the royal frost has now thawed a little. Ireland's President Mary Robinson has been invited to London for tea with the Queen. Buckingham Palace did not announce next Thursday's visit, but it confirmed leaks from Dublin. It will be a private visit, a courtesy call, a palace official said yesterday. There is no question of a state occasion. The Queen went to Germany last year, hoping to heal wounds of the second world war. She visited Spain in 1988, shrugging off the UK's territorial dispute over Gibraltar. In the US, once a British colony, the Queen draws crowds. The French have been known to wave flags for her. But historical divisions between Britain and Ireland live on. No British king or queen has met an Irish president. The last monarch to visit southern Ireland was Edward VII in 1903 - almost 20 years before the partitioning of Ulster and the creation of an Irish Free State. Next week's visit illustrates the improvement in UK-Irish government relations which - even as late as the 1980s - were punctuated by ill-tempered outbursts over the extradition of Irish terrorists, or the quality of British justice. The neighbourliness is not reflected, however, in Northern Ireland. Yesterday local election results in the province set back hopes of Irish and British ministers that 'round-table' political talks on the province's political future would be re-started soon. The better-than-expected performance of the Rev Ian Paisley's hard-line Democratic Unionist party will only encourage him in his pledge not to resume negotiations until Ireland compromises on its territorial claim on the north. Also faring well was Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA which is excluded from talks by both the Irish and the British governments. The territorial dispute over Northern Ireland remains the unofficial reason why diplomats in London and Dublin continue to advise their respective heads of state against a formal meeting. But there are, perhaps, personal memories too; the Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA in 1979. Northern Ireland election results, Page 6</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping: "The State Must </F> Be More Thrifty"]    [Text] The modernization of the state retail sector is a  continuous political task. This does not just apply to Germany,  but is a particularly valid point considering the stagnation in  this sphere in Germany over the past few years. In the process  of expanding EU institutions, the need to restrain the extent of  public services in good time must also be given greater  consideration in Brussels.    Every EU country is currently holding a debate on the  application of EU law on its terrirory, and on accelerating  approval procedures. New concepts of efficiency in the state and  in the administration are being developed. New trade forms are  being worked out that conform to a more modern management of  services, also taking into account the experiences of the  private economy. But solutions for modernizing the state sector  are not being introduced at the expense of this sector's  efficiency. The state sector's efficiency must protect the  common good from group interests. Therefore the question is not  whether the state must act, but where and how it must act.  Also, the objective is not the reduction of state sector  activity to zero, but to adapt the state administration to  modern requirements in good time.    Modernization means setting clear goals, permitting  efficient  activity, making a more economical use of resources, reaching  decisions faster, and concentrating state activity on important  matters. This means "purifying" state and communal activity  and giving it a more efficient shape. The public sector is  reformable as long as everyone -- the citizens, working people,  trade unions, and politicians -- wants it reformed. Public  administration must continue to develop in accordance with  changing requirements. This includes a reorganization of the  administration to bring it closer to the people, so that the  administration can become a public-oriented service. But it  also includes accelerating and simplifying decisionmaking  processes and administrative procedures. Genuine reform also  includes a regular critical appraisal of tasks. The laender and  communuity administrations must check whether a particular task  really has to be performed by the public services. New  "management" [preceding word in English] is required in the  public sector, together with an elimination of the excessive  hierarchical structures there, and a far-reaching  decentralization involving the distribution of the  decisionmaking process among smaller "autonomous" administrative  units.    I am not committed to the idea of the provision of services  by private firms, but I wish to make it clear that no general  decision can be made whether and to what extent public tasks and  services will be performed by private structures and what form  these private structures should take. That can only be decided  on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, careful consideration  leads one to conclude that in the process of transferring from  publicly to privately provided services, one must avoid at all  costs the emergence of private monopolies in the provision of  particular services. In addition, privatized services should be  offered constant protection. One must also consider whether or  not the quality of services should be retained as it is or  improved, and whether working people should be protected against  excessive costs thereof. Privatization also involves social  security.    Rhineland-Palatinate is also at the beginning of state and  communal modernization. But its government, in office since 21  May 1991, has already gone from theory to practice on several  points. We have embarked upon the path of greater state  efficiency and are including private industry in state  processes. Our new Investment and Structure Bank is aimed at  implementing the government's industrial and  structural-political objectives. An amalgamation of the  instruments and companies that promote the economy is expected  to produce a synergy effect. Government employees have already  joined the Investment and Structure Bank, and personnel savings  can be achieved in the district governments.    Once the rules governing the administration of districts  have  been amended, most state tasks can be transferred to the  districts. This involves turning state employees into district  employees. Rhineland-Palatinate has accelerated this process  with its "Tax Office 2000" project. Income tax declarations  will no longer be processed in up to 15 separate stages by as  many different employees, as is the case at present; instead,  they will be handled by just one employee, who will at the same  time have broader authority. A test conducted in February 1993  resulted in a shortening of the average length of time in  processing a tax declaration from nine weeks to just three  weeks. Eleven tax offices are now participating in this  experiment.    The public administration can be made even more efficient  and  economical when greater use is made of the experience and  creativity of employees. For this purpose, a competition for  the best ideas on simplifying administrative procedures is being  prepared, and will be held throughout Rhineland-Palatinate. I  expect it to provide results before the end of the year.    The following is also established practice in  Rhineland-Palatinate: A new tax office in Neuwied and police  precinct in Alzey have been built with the use of private  capital and the experiences of private industry in construction  projects.    Our ministry for the economy has developed a unique way of  financing road construction programs out of private capital in  view of the tight budget. In contrast to past methods of  private financing, smaller enterprises will no longer be  accorded second place before larger ones.    Rhineland-Palatinate has scored a hit on a national level  with the construction of the Langenlosheim Bridge (Bad Kreuznach  region), which was only possible with private capital. The next  project involves the building of a bypass in the Westerwald  region. The decisive advantage of the "Mogendorf model" is that  when tenders are awarded, enterprises with medium resources,  facing high costs because of the need to obtain loans to finance  a project, are no longer at a disadvantage compared to large  enterprises with a lot of capital. In this way, the lending  bank can offer the borrowing enterprise attractive interest  rates by means of certain refinancing opportunities on the  capital market. Thus, an enterprise can receive attractive  interest rates, just like the state can.    Rhineland-Partnership has also set an example of partnerlike  cooperation between the state and private sectors in another  sphere -- the elimination of problem waste. In the company that  handles this waste, the state has 51 percent of the shares, and  private waste removal organizations have 49 percent of the  shares. For the processing of special waste in two additional  furnaces, Rhineland-Palatinate was able to establish cooperation  with the firm BASF within the framework of "public-private  partnership" [preceding two words in English].    Steps have been taken to reorganize state construction in  Rhineland-Palatinate. A personnel management concept has been  drawn up to prevent an excessive expansion of posts and permit  the reduction of present posts.    The combination of state, communities, and industry will be  intensified even further on the basis of experience. Since  1991, a permanent link between the state, industry and science  has been guaranteed in the form of the "Rhineland-Palatinate  Future Initiative" association. This association has involved  itself mainly in practical dealings. Its chairman is the  president of the largest enterprise, and his deputy is the prime  minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Basel, Switzerland, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Frenchman Robert  Raymond has been appointed managing director of the new European  Monetary Institute [EMI] by its Board, the latter announced here  on Tuesday [8 February] after a meeting.    The Board consists of the 12 European Community central bank  governors and of institute president Alexandre Lamfalussy of  Belgium. The institute is the forerunner of the European  Community's central bank.    Raymond, 60, is managing director for credit at the Bank of  France, the French central bank.    The institute Board also appointed the heads of three of the  five departments within the European Monetary Institute.    Dutchman G.P.J. Hogeweg, coordinating director at the Dutch  central bank, will head the Economics and Statistics Department.    Hanspeter K. Scheller, from the secretariat of the E.C.  governors' committee, will head up the general secretariat.    And J.S. Etherington of the Bank of England will manage the  Department for Communication and Information Systems.    Lamfalussy told correspondents that "one or two appointments  have not yet been decided on at this stage." The institute also  has an Administration Division and a Finance Division.    On another matter, Lamfalussy said the European Community  central bank governors were not much worried about consequences  of the mild increase in U.S. interest rates announced on Friday  by the U.S. Federal Reserve.    He said after a meeting in Basel with governors of E.C.  central banks that "The consensus was that some such measure had  been expected, and that it was not really a surprise."    "The majority of the governors thought that, so far, the  financial markets' reaction had been relatively calm. The  governors did not express any major worries about the conduct of  European monetary policies, at this stage."</p>

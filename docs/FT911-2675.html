			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / The European Market: US lobs a cut-price spanner into Europe's cosy soda ash market - The looming upheaval in production of a major industrial chemical one of the world's main bulk chemicals - is entering a period of upheaval, after 40 years during which the pattern of trade hardly changed. The soda ash story illustrates both the continuity of the European chemicals business and the forces of change now working on it. In the case of soda ash, these include: Low-cost US producers whose prices can undercut the European manufacturers at current exchange rates; The EC, which dealt the European companies a double blow late last year, by fining them Ecu48m (Pounds 33.4m) for allegedly running a soda ash cartel and by lifting an anti-dumping duty that had kept US producers out of Europe; The opening up of eastern Europe's huge soda ash market to western manufacturers. Solvay of Belgium has dominated the soda ash business since the 1860s when Ernest Solvay founded the company to synthesise the material - used in glass making and other industries - from cheap raw materials (salt and limestone). During the late 19th century Solvay built a network of soda ash plants across the continent from Russia to Spain, while licensing Brunner, Mond - a predecessor of ICI - to use his process in the UK. Today Solvay, Belgium's second largest company, makes about 4m tonnes a year of soda ash in west European plants. Soda ash - currently selling for about Dollars 200 per tonne - still represents 11 per cent of Solvay's BFr255bn (Pounds 4.16bn) a year turnover. The company has long used soda ash as a 'cash cow' to help finance expansion into other fields. ICI makes 1m tonnes a year of soda ash in the UK. Smaller European producers, including Rhone-Poulenc of France, Akzo of the Netherlands and BASF and Henkel of Germany, produce 1.5m tonnes a year. The sales pattern established in the 19th century persists today. ICI has more than 90 per cent of the UK and Irish soda ash markets and sells very little on the continent. Solvay, conversely, has 70 per cent of the continental market. Solvay and ICI abandoned their formal market-sharing agreement in the 1960s and insist that there is now no collusion between them. The EC competition directorate disagrees and in December fined Solvay Ecu30m and ICI Ecu17m for operating a cartel and offering illegal price rebates to lock in large customers. In addition BASF was fined Ecu1m. The companies are appealing against the fines. The rebates are normal commercial practice, they say, and the trading patterns result from the nature of soda ash, a bulky low-value chemical which is expensive to transport and requires special supply facilities. Customers do not maintain large stocks of soda ash - a glass manufacturer keeps less than a week's worth on the premises - and they rely on the suppliers to keep the material flowing steadily into the works. For example Pilkington, the leading UK glass maker, has a very close working relationship with ICI, which has supplied virtually all its soda ash for many decades. ICI's soda ash factories in Cheshire are conveniently close to Pilkington's glass works in St Helens on Merseyside. Mr Olivier Montfort, manager of Solvay's soda ash business, says his company recently offered to supply Pilkington in St Helens with Solvay soda ash at the same price as it sells the material to Flachglas, Pilkington's German subsidiary, with transport costs added. 'They could not accept it,' he says. The great misfortune for the synthetic soda ash producers was the discovery in the 1950s of vast deposits of a mineral called trona in Wyoming, USA. Trona is a naturally occurring form of soda ash (sodium carbonate) and represents a cheaper source of the material than the Solvay process. In 1986 the last Solvay plant in the US closed down after making heavy losses for several years, leaving the US field clear to a group of six companies selling natural soda ash. The group operates an export cartel, American National Soda Ash Corporation (Ansac), which has had great success selling US ash in Asia and South America. Small quantities have come into Europe, particularly when the dollar was very weak in the mid 1980s, but the EC anti-dumping duty of Dollars 65 per tonne effectively shut out US imports. After the EC lifted the duty last October, it told Ansac that it could not operate as a cartel in Europe. That decision has somewhat delayed US shipments to Europe, while the six individual companies make their own export arrangements, but sources in the industry say that significant amounts of American ash are beginning to reach UK and west European ports. The US producers say they are aiming to win at least 5 per cent of the European market. But they are acting cautiously, in response to an EC warning that it would monitor their activities closely and re-impose the anti-dumping levy immediately if there was any evidence of unfair activities. Richard Bell, ICI's commercial manager for soda ash, says some US material is reaching Europe at prices very close to dumping levels. Mr Montfort says Solvay accepts that the Americans will win a slice of the west European market. Some glassmakers near good harbours - for example in the Rotterdam/Antwerp region - may take as much as 10 per cent of their soda ash from the US, he says, although they will be reluctant to go beyond that level and jeopardise the long-term security of their relationship with Solvay. Solvay plans to make up for the loss of market share in western Europe by winning business in the east. The company is close to regaining control of the Bernburg plant in eastern Germany, which was appropriated from Solvay in 1940. As soon negotiations with the Treuhand privatisation agency are complete, Solvay will invest DM200m in Bernburg, which can produce 500,000 tonnes per year. Meanwhile ICI says it has been approached by a number of east European countries. 'We're looking at a variety of options,' said Mr Bob Collicut, ICI soda ash manager. 'I think that soda ash is an industry that eastern Europe might want to concentrate on, since it is not environmentally one of the worst industrial activities and it is used in so many other basic industries - particularly glass, detergents and chemicals.'</p>

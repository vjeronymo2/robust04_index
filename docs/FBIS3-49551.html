			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Ferenc Kulin, head of the </F> parliamentary group of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Tibor  J. Keri on 10 January; place not given: "Fur Has a Chance To  Become Party Chairman"]    [Text] In the last week's issue of MAGYAR FORUM, Istvan  Csurka strongly attacked the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]  and one of its spiritual leader, Janos Kis. Among other things,  Csurka wrote the following: "With the death of Jozsef Antall,  with the fall of the silent partner, the Hungarian political  life became unipolar and the boss is now called Janos Kis."  According to Csurka, Kis played a decisive role in forcing the  national trend and the national radicalism out of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF]. The present MDF, one that "calms" Kis  and his followers, "is small, broken, without principles, far  from its original power, namely its Hungarianness, and from  taking on the representation of the vital issues of Hungarians;  a party that has hidden itself in illusions and frequent  substitute actions; a toothless lion" -- Csurka wrote.    Ferenc Kulin said last week that the MDF could not envisage  any coalition or cooperation with an SZDSZ controlled by Janos  Kis.    My position regarding Janos Kis and the SZDSZ is totally  independent from Istvan Csurka's article -- Ferenc Kulin told  our correspondent. From 1989, the SZDSZ has been the anti-pole  of the political space in which the MDF is the other determining  factor. This distance only increased, instead of decreasing, in  the last four years. According to Kulin, this distance became  even more clear by the fact that the SZDSZ seems to initiate  cooperation with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the other  rival of the MDF. Kulin mentioned Janos Kis because it is Kis  who has been formulating and dictating the political strategy of  the SZDSZ from the very beginning. Kulin added that if anyone  had any doubts about this, these doubts would be dissipated by  Janos Kis's article published in the Christman issue of MAGYAR  HIRLAP. "This is the simple explanation to the question of  whether there is a chance of MDF-SZDSZ cooperation. I can say  that there is no such chance" -- Kulin declared.    According to Ferenc Kulin, the fact that there are no  chances  whatsoever of any contact or cooperation between the two parties  can be explained with pragmatic causes. Kulin pointed out that  the MDF is a center party that is polished and formed in the  daily political practice, a party that learns from every  conflict and corrects them; Janos Kis's SZDSZ is a party  "created at a desk, a party adjusting itself to doctrines and  following a strategy." Therefore, it is questionable  politically whether these two markedly different political  forces can get closer to each other -- Kulin pointed out.    In connection with Csurka's writing, Ferenc Kulin said that  he did not agree with a single sentence of the essay published  in MAGYAR FORUM. His judgment differs from his opinions on  previous Csurka-writings because, in the past, he could accept a  lot of elements of Csurka's diagnoses. However, this latest  writing is the spiritual flight of a man who lost his sense of  political reality -- Kulin said. He added that Csurka's words  on his role and "danger" are among statements that no longer  contain anything surprising and, therefore, they need no  defense. Kulin also finds it unfortunate that the  "objectionable attack" on Jozsef Antall's activity definitely  discredited everything that Csurka ever did in Hungarian  politics.    In connection with the future, Kulin pointed out that he  agreed with Sandor Lezsak, who declared that the corridors that  were still open between the MDF and the Hungarian Way Circles  closed definitely in the wake of Csurka's attitude following  Jozsef Antall's death. These contradictions will only become  stronger in the election campaign.    Speaking about the election prospects of the MDF, Kulin said  that he was even more optimistic than Lajos Fur, who predicted  20 percent of votes for the MDF. "We still have all the chances  to achieve a decisive victory in the individual electoral  districts" -- Kulin said.    In conclusion, Kulin pointed out that he would not accept  even the nomination for the position of party chairman at the  national conference to be held in February. He did not know how  many people were running for this position, but he said that  Lajos Fur had a good chance to win the position.</p>

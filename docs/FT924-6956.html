			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Companies challenge allegations THE reaction of British companies named in Labour's list as alleged to have traded in arms and related equipment with Iraq was mostly low-key. It was claimed that the information was either not new or did not relate to defence. British Aerospace reacted dismissively to its inclusion in the list, along with the Royal Ordnance arms manufacturer which it took over in 1987. The company said it always scrupulously adheres to government approvals in all its activities. 'This is a party political activity and we have no comment on it.' ICL, the UK-based computing services company now controlled by Fujitsu of Japan, agreed it had supplied computer peripherals to Iraq during the period in question but categorically denied that any trade regulations had been breached. The company said: 'ICL traded in Iraq until August 1990 and the Iraqi Ministry of Defence was one of our customers. We provided mainframe computer equipment to the Iraqi Ministry of Defence between 1988 and 1990.' Racal is identified as having supplied battlefield radios. The electronics company said: 'This all came up last year. Racal has historically supplied tactical radios to Iraq, with the full knowledge of the government and the relevant export licences. The last orders were taken in the mid-1980s and the last deliveries were in 1989.' Thorn EMI said it exported a 'small quantity' of Cymbeline battlefield radars to Iraq in 1974. Over the following years the electronics group 'received a number of logistics orders' from Iraq. These were for spares, maintenance and training required for Cymbeline, but it had supplied no new radars after 1974. Bimec Industries is also named on the list as having supplied a metal treatment plant, but yesterday the company said it was no secret that it had supplied a plant for phosphating and zinc-plating small metallic objects, along with another plant for spray-painting office furniture, in 1988 and 1989 respectively. Gatewood Engineering and the former Blackwood Hodge, owned since November 1990 by the BM Group, are named for supplying earth-moving equipment. Although the financial relationship between the two companies is not clear, it is understood that Gatewood supplied equipment in Middle East markets where Blackwood Hodge could not do business because of its trading links with Israel. Mr Dick Cameron, a former joint managing director of Blackwood Hodge, said: 'Someone has dreamed up the idea that these 40-tonne off-highway dumptrucks could be used for carrying bombs.' Marconi, GEC's defence subsidiary, said it had sold the A-METS artillery meteorological system to Iraq in 1970 and have since supplied spares, all under Department of Trade and Industry export licences. Rolls-Royce said it had supplied refurbished engines for Jet Provost training aircraft under DTI licence. The list includes three companies - Astra Holdings, Walter Somers and Sheffield Forgemasters - involved directly or indirectly in supplying components for the Iraqi supergun project. A legal case in connection with the supergun affair against Walter Somers was dropped on the grounds of insufficient evidence in November 1990. The company was not available for comment last night, but in evidence submitted to the Commons trade and industry committee Walter Somers said that it had been told by the DTI an export licence for steel - supposedly for a petrochemical project - was not required. Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners, a Glasgow-based consultancy, was one of 36 British companies named earlier this year in a US Senate report, which suggested it had been involved in the design of air bases and bunkers with hardened shelters for aircraft in about 1985 or 1986. The company could not be contacted yesterday. However, in March a senior partner said he did not know whether the shelters were ever built.

Computer in 1984 Thorn EMI Cymbeline battlefield radars (1974) Gatewood Engineering Earth-moving equipment IMS Designed and equipped missile complex WS Atkins Provided employees for above project Colchester Lathes Machine tools BSA Tools Machine tools Wickman Machine tools Astra Holdings Munitions BMARC Munitions - subsidiary of Astra. Walter Somers Supergun parts Sheffield Forgemasters Supergun parts Global Technical Management Services Naval technology FMT Machine tools Bimec Industries Metal treatment plant THE OFFICIALS Exporters contact government (DTI) if licences required. Tony Steadman was head of the export licensing unit when many UK exports to Iraq were approved.  A grade seven civil servant, he would advise the trade minister how export guidelines should be interpreted.  He also briefed Alan Clark before the crucial meeting with machine tool company executives in January 1988 on how they should fill in their export applications. THE COMMITTEE If licences were required, applications would go to the inter-departmental committee. This consisted of officials from the DTI, the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office.  In 1988 the committee met 12 times, in 1989 nine times and in 1990 11 times.  The IDC was set up in early 1980s to deal specifically with licences for Iran and Iraq.  In 1989 the value of export licence applications approved totalled Pounds 50m for Iran and Pounds 130m for Iraq.  Those refused amounted to Pounds 70m for Iran and Pounds 20m for Iraq.  In the period up to the following June - just before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait - approvals were Pounds 120m for Iran and Pounds 75m for Iraq.  Those refused were Pounds 5m for Iran and Pounds 1m for Iraq. THE MINISTERS In difficult cases, applications were referred to ministers This would normally be at minister of state level - William Waldegrave, Alan Clark and Lor Trefgame - for most of the period involved.  But evidence given to the supergun inquiry by a Foreign Office official confirmed that it could be any minister from secretary of state down. THE CLIENTS* Hutteen State Establishment:  Subordinate to Iraq's State Organisation of Technical Industries (SOTI) which is responsible fo the conventional defence industries.  SOTI is in turn responsible to both the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Industry and Minerals.  Hutteen is the main ammunition manufacturing plant in Iraq. Naser Establishment for Mechanical Industries: A plant involved in armaments manufacture.  Among other things it sought to buy moulding machinery to produce polyurethane internal filler parts for missiles. * For machine tools, weapons and defence-related equipment</p>

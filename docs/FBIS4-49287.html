			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China's current reform of  its taxation and foreign exchange systems has made it favorable  for the healthy growth of foreign-funded enterprises instead of  obstructing it.    The conclusion has been drawn from facts in Jiangsu Province  over the past few months since the institution of the new  taxation and foreign exchange systems at the beginning of this  year. Jiangsu ranks the second in China in terms of the number  of foreign-funded enterprises.    The Nantong Chia Tai Group Company, a Sino-Thai joint  venture  in Jiangsu Province, reported a gain of 3.7 million yuan in  profits in the first quarter of this year. It has decided to  spend an additional three million yuan on upgrading its  technology and equipment.    "We firmly endorse the new tax system and take the lead in  implementing it," said Tanes Seriburi, vice-president of the  agro-ind. business group under the Chia Tai group of companies,  in a letter to the provincial tax authorities.    Kam Sueg Hoon, manager of the Lianyungang Jinwu Seasoning  Company Ltd, said, "the new tax system is getting closer to  international conventions. It has many points in common with  the tax system in the Republic of Korea. It is much easier to  understand than the old one."    Teruju Kawakami, general manager of the Nanjing Fujitsu  Telecommunications Equipment Company Ltd, complained of  increased expenditure due to the unification of the exchange  rates, but he had to admit that the reform is fair to all  enterprises in the country.    He is optimistic about the future of his company in China as  China's market of posts and telecommunications is fast expanding.    China abrogated the former consolidated industrial and  commercial tax, which required tax payment at every link of  production and circulation, and instituted the value-added tax,  which requires part of the former tax payment. Parallel with  the reform is the unification of the state pegged rate and the  swap market rate.    "The reform measures are favorable for further opening to  the  outside world and promote the development of foreign-funded  enterprises," said Wong Ronghua, director of the provincial tax  bureau.    "The reforms have equalized the tax burdens of all  enterprises, thus putting them on an equal footing in  competition," he said. "The new tax system would make it  favorable for enterprises to improve their economic efficiency."    Jiangsu had approved 21,161 foreign-funded enterprises by  the  end of March this year, ranking second in the country after  economically booming Guangdong Province in southern China. More  than 8,000 of them are in operation.    A sample survey shows that most of the foreign-funded  enterprises have expressed their understanding of and welcome  for China's current reform. "While the new tax system is being  enforced, the preferential policies with regard to income tax on  foreign-funded enterprises remain intact," he said. "For  foreign-funded enterprises which have their tax burden increased  due to the payment of turn-over taxes, the province adopted the  method of postponing such payment pending the promulgation of  the detailed rules for the implementation of the state  regulations on tax refund for foreign-funded enterprises."    He said that the current tax reform has in fact reduced to  varying degrees the tax burdens of most foreign-funded  enterprises.    A survey of six foreign-funded enterprises in Zhenjiang  shows  that five have found their tax burdens down while only one said  its tax burden has increased. Computed according to the base  figure of 1993, the average tax burden of the six enterprises  has been reduced by 31.9 percent.    The reform of the exchange rate system over the past four  months proved that it has not caused any difficulty to  foreign-funded enterprises in the use and settlement of foreign  exchange.    Zhang Bingyu, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Foreign  Exchange Center, said foreign exchange markets and offices are  still carrying on their business of servicing foreign-funded  enterprises which sell and purchase foreign currencies.    According to statistics, foreign-funded enterprises sold 124  million U.S. dollars on and purchased 266 million U.S. dollars  from these markets and offices in the first quarter of this year.    Zhang noted that a foreign-funded enterprise may open a  foreign currency account with a bank and transfer and use its  foreign currency. So far, the province has 175 banking offices  engaged in such business, ranking first in the country.    A survey of 5,078 foreign-funded enterprises shows that  these  enterprises generated industrial output value amounting to 10.37  billion yuan in the January-March period, up 56 percent over the  same period of last year, obtained sales income totalling 7.82  billion yuan, up 60 percent, and made profits of 180 million  yuan, up 29 percent.    These enterprises exported 346 million U.S. Dollars-worth of  goods in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 18.5  percent over the same period last year, and accounting for more  than one fourth of the province's total.    Accord)ng to the survey, therare still a few  foreign-funded  enterprises affected by the reform of the tax and exchange rate  systems and their production cost has increased.    "So long as these enterprises improve their production  management, they are still able to gain ideal economic  efficiency," an official in charge of the survey said.    One example is the Huafei Color Display Systems Company Ltd,  a large Sino-Dutch joint venture in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu  Province. The company has overcome the rise in the cost of  production materials by rearranging its product structure,  raising the percentage of product qualification and reducing  production costs.    The company exported more than three million U.S.  dollars-worth of products in the first four months of this year.    According to the provincial commission of foreign economic  relations and trade, a number of noted companies from the  Netherlands, Britain, Singapore and Japan have increased their  investments in Jiangsu this year.</p>

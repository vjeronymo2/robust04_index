			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wentworth warning on dividend payment WENTWORTH International Group said yesterday that it was unlikely it would be able to pay a dividend for the year to March 31. Last time it paid 0.1p. Mr Robert Gill, chief executive and acting chairman of the USM-quoted plastic packaging products group, said the board was examining past accounting practices which he described as 'sharp' and 'at the cutting edge'. He expected that 'material' provisions would have to be made. He cited Mr Terry Smith's book Accounting for Growth, and said that the board was looking at areas such as the capitalisation of interest, fair value accounting, the charging of consultancy fees to acquisition targets and the capitalisation of acquisition costs. Mr Gill said Wentworth would not score nought out of 12 against Mr Smith's criteria, but would score higher than its shareholders might want. Mr Gill joined the group, which is 62 per cent owned by Banque Indosuez, six weeks ago, replacing Mr Haque Khan, the chairman and chief executive who retired early at the end of July. Mr Gill said he was 'the prime mover' behind the examination of the accounting practices, but that Banque Indosuez was 'highly supportive'. The board comprises Mr Gill, three non-executives from Banque Indosuez, Mr Tim Palmer, the finance director since 1990, and, also since 1990, Mr Simon Davies, the group development director who is responsible for the preparation of the group's accounts.</p>

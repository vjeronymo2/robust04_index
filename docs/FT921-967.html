			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Turkish Forces Raid Kurdish Rebel Camps In Iraq THE Turkish military yesterday mounted air raids on neighbouring Iraq, switching attention to rebel camps of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), after five days of civil unrest in Turkish towns near the border. Turkish military sources, quoted by the official Anatolian news agency, confirmed that bombing sorties were made early in the day against two alleged PKK targets up to 18 miles inside Iraq near the Iranian border. Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, warned this week that Turkey would seal the 170-mile border with Iraq to prevent incursions by the PKK, which is fighting for a separate Kurdish state in southern Turkey. The raids yesterday mark a heightening in the conflict and coincide with the worst civil unrest in the eight-year Kurdish troubles. In further clashes in Turkey, six people were killed including two pro-government village militia near Diyarbakir, the provincial capital in the south-eastern region. Two policemen were shot in separate incidents in Adana, southern Turkey, and Ankara, the Turkish capital. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers were still deployed in a string of towns near the Syrian and Iraqi borders after clashes between security forces and demonstrators at the weekend left up to 60 people dead. The Turkish government is to send a four-man delegation to the border area today to investigate the unrest. However Mr Demirel's coalition is under pressure from both the army and conservatives in his True Path party to continue to take a hard line against the PKK. Politicians of the Turkish Labour Party (HEP) were said to be ready to withdraw from the coalition because of the government's failure to fulfil promises of human rights reform. Support from the 22 Kurdish HEP members was central to Mr Demirel's earlier promise of reforms aimed at winning over the Kurds.</p>

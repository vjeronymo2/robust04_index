			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RUDE AWAKENING FOR 'DREAM HOUSE' BUYERS;  </P> <P> LAND DISPUTE: OWNERS OF 100 HOMES BUILT ON 96 ACRES THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO  REMAIN OPEN SPACE ARE WAITING TO SEE HOW THE SITUATION IS RESOLVED. DESPITE  REASSURANCES, THEY REMAIN UNEASY.  </P> <P> When Marina Hills resident Rick Mortensen opened his newspaper one morning and  found a front-page story with a map of his neighborhood, it was "kind of a  novelty." But as more articles appeared almost daily, Mortensen began to worry.  </P> <P> Especially troubling to Mortensen were accounts of a stormy City Council  meeting at which angry environmentalists demanded that the public be  compensated for the loss of 96 acres of land which had been set aside in 1985  as open space to buffer the Salt Creek Corridor Regional Park from development.  </P> <P> Since May the Orange County district attorney has been trying to find out how  the land wound up in the hands of Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd.  Mortensen and his wife, Fayme, own one of about 100 homes that now stand on the  disputed land.  </P> <P> "I read about the people pounding the table and saying, 'I want my 96 acres  back. . . .' " Mortensen said. "I'm just afraid people will forget about the  people who live here."  </P> <P> Mortensen and his wife managed to save enough to "squeak in" to their first  home in April. They paid $300,000 for their "dream house": a two-story,  red-tile-roofed home that sits on a corner lot, a bike ride from the ocean,  with three bedrooms and fourth room that will "hopefully" become a nursery.  </P> <P> "You can really see the stars at night and it's crisp and clear," the  29-year-old computer consultant said. "We lived in an area in L.A. that was  near a sewage plant and a petroleum plant. You wouldn't even want to go out at  night."  </P> <P> The land dispute now hangs over them like the smog they left behind in the  city.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago Laguna Niguel officials announced plans to sue Taylor Woodrow  over the property and to try to take back the land not yet built upon. The  council also imposed a moratorium on new building permits for the property.  Council officials have assured homeowners like Mortensen that they will take no  action against them and that the controversy will in no way cloud the title to  their homes.  </P> <P> Executives from Taylor Woodrow and the title insurance company that backed the  purchase of their homes gave similar assurances at a meeting last week with the  homeowners.  </P> <P> Still, Mortensen is uneasy. "I just hope that things work out, that we get to  keep title to our house, that the powers that be recognize there's a bunch of  little people that could get hurt by all this."  </P> <P> At issue is 96 acres lying just north of the Salt Creek Corridor Regional Park.  It was set aside as open space in a 1985 deed to the county from AVCO-Bredero  Niguel, then the major developer in the area. The county later passed its  rights to the land to the Laguna Niguel Community Services District.  </P> <P> In February, 1988, Laguna Niguel Councilman James F. Krembas, then the district  vice president, signed a deed to Taylor Woodrow relinquishing the public's  right to the land. Krembas has said he signed the deed under the mistaken  belief that it was part of another transaction.  </P> <P> For their part, company executives have maintained that the transaction was  approved by other members of the district board as well as county officials.  The land transfer has become the focus of a criminal inquiry, in part because  Krembas' wife was hired by Taylor Woodrow three months after Krembas signed the  deed.  </P> <P> Last week, the company requested a rehearing before the City Council in an  attempt to stave off the threatened suit and to rescind the moratorium.  </P> <P> Caught in the cross-fire are the homeowners who live on the property in  question.  </P> <P> "It's a little shocking to read about it and then look at a map and realize  your house is in the area they're talking about," said Eric Moore, a  32-year-old fire battalion chief who moved into his Calella Street home in May.  "Here you are in a house you think is your dream house and all of a sudden  you're in a controversial thing."  </P> <P> When Eric Moore hears other citizens demand a return of their parkland, he  worries. "I just hope other people know we are victims," Moore said.  </P> <P> But Sandy and Mike Brown, who moved in two months ago, said they were reassured  by the meeting last week with Taylor Woodrow President Gordon Tippell and a  representative of the title insurance firm.  </P> <P> "I love the development," Mike Brown said. "I just think there was a  miscommunication."  </P> <P> Brown said some of his neighbors worry about a "worst-case scenario" in which  the city would take back the land, despite its assurances to the contrary, and  the residents would lose their homes.  </P> <P> Homeowners were disturbed to learn at the meeting last week that, should the  city seize the land, the title insurance company would reimburse them only for  the price they paid for the home, and not for any appreciation or money spent  on home improvements, he said.  </P> <P> "That made everybody a little uneasy," Brown said, but he added, "I just don't  think the city would do anything like that."  </P> <P> Across the street from the Browns live Amy and Ronald Zitka and their three  children. Had he known of the land controversy earlier, Ronald Zitka said, he  would have reconsidered the move.  </P> <P> "I don't want to be caught up in any controversy," Zitka said, and then  wondered aloud what effect the dispute might have on resale value: "Will that  have a negative impact on the sale here if they're continuing to fight it out?"  </P> <P> Standing amid a garage full of boxes, Gerrie Glossip, whose home backs up to  Salt Creek, said the parkland behind her home is her main concern.  </P> <P> "The only reason we bought this is because that was supposed to be park and we  want it to stay that way," said Glossip. "I don't want to pay extra for this  home because it looks out over a park and it not be a park."  </P> <P> Times staff writer George Frank contributed to this story.  </P></p>

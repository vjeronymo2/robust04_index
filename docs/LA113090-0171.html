			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH MEETS WITH CHINA ENVOY; MAY SIGNAL THAW  </P> <P> President Bush met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today in a move  that seemed designed to end Beijing's international isolation since its 1989  military crackdown on a pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> The meeting followed a day of confusion in which the State Department first  announced that the meeting would take place and then denied it, saying only  that Secretary of State James A. Baker III would meet Qian.  </P> <P> A senior official said Bush decided on the meeting this morning, despite  Washington's disappointment that China had abstained on a U.N. Security Council  resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq if it does not withdraw  from Kuwait by Jan. 15.  </P> <P> The United States was hoping for Chinese support for the resolution, which was  adopted 12 to 2. But China did withhold its veto, allowing the resolution to  pass.  </P> <P> Western nations suspended senior official contacts with Beijing and shut off  government loans and military cooperation after the army's bloody crackdown  around Tian An Men Square in the Chinese capital last year, when hundreds,  perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed.  </P> <P> But Beijing has slowly been edging back into the international community. At  last July's Houston economic summit, Japan said it intended to resume loans to  China.  </P> <P> Only a month after the 1989 crackdown, Bush signaled his intention of  maintaining a high-level dialogue with China by dispatching National Security  Adviser Brent Scowcroft on a secret mission to Beijing.  </P> <P> When Scowcroft went there again in December, 1989, the news caused a storm of  criticism, with many in Congress accusing Bush of disregarding China's human  rights violations.  </P> <P> He also courted criticism by maintaining China's most-favored-nation trading  status last summer.  </P> <P> But the decision to meet Qian will be seen as the most powerful signal yet that  the United States is ready to welcome China back as a full member of the  international community.  </P> <P> A high-level Chinese official, Vice Trade Minister Gu Yongjiang, has also been  invited to hold trade talks in the United States on Dec. 10-11 with Commerce  Undersecretary J. Michael Farren.  </P></p>

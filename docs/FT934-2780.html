			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Markets: Spot the anomaly, then spot the risk - Serious Money The launch of Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Higher Income Plan was, in retrospect, perfectly timed. Savers were just starting to wake up to the impact of falling interest rates on their investment income; a 10 per cent yield looked too good to miss. Some highly enthusiastic mailshots from independent financial advisers helped make it an enormous marketing success. The product was undeniably new (Morgan Grenfell has since launched a similar plan) and clever. The fund was able to offer such a high income, even after deducting its charges, by using options. If you sell (or 'write') an option, you receive a premium. By writing a large number of options, the fund could generate a high premium income which, through a complex process, was passed back to investors. For those of us who were cautious about the fund, this week's developments have been particularly interesting. First, Save &amp; Prosper abandoned plans to launch a fund on similar lines; second, the regulators issued 'guidance notes' on the marketing of high income products. Save &amp; Prosper was all set to brief journalists on how its computer model showed that the technique led to capital erosion. Suddenly, on Wednesday morning, the briefing was cancelled (as was a planned F &amp; C meeting in response); the following day, both sides issued statements agreeing to differ. S &amp; P said: 'There are a number of different approaches to derivatives investment and it will not comment on the validity or efficiency of any existing unit trust or offshore fund.' Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell said: 'The two companies are confident of their funds' abilities to meet their stated objectives.' What should investors think of all this? One can become so distracted by the detail of computer models and option premiums, that one fails to see the broader picture. There is a risk-free return in any market, which represents the return on short term government debt. At the moment, short-term UK government debt (Treasury bills) yields around 5 per cent. Investors can earn more (around 7 per cent) from long dated gilts, but they do involve some risk. The credit risk that the government will fail to repay the debt is fairly minimal. But in the short term, there is the risk that gilts will fall in price; and in the long term, there is the risk that inflation will erode their real value. So in current market conditions, a fund yielding 10 per cent, after expenses, must surely involve some risk to capital. If it did not, why would all the pension funds bother to hold gilts and Treasury bills? Now, you may say, I am missing the point. These chaps at Foreign &amp; Colonial and Morgan Grenfell are much cleverer than you and I, and they have spotted an anomaly in the market. Indeed, the two companies' statement this week hinted as much, when it said: 'Based on the discussions with Save &amp; Prosper, we believe that there are significant features of the two companies' funds which have not been explored by the models used by Save &amp; Prosper.' It is perfectly true that market anomalies (what academics call inefficiencies) can appear. But they do not last for long. Once spotted, money floods in to exploit the anomaly. The involvement of more investors makes the market more efficient and the anomaly disappears. Perhaps Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell are exploiting a temporary anomaly, but I think that investors should concentrate on the risk factor. The funds are writing call options, giving other investors the right to buy their shares. If the stock market goes down, then the shares in the funds' portfolios will fall, and the options will not be exercised. In a long, steady bear market, the attractiveness of call options would reduce, and the funds' incomes from premiums would probably fall. In short, there is a risk that capital and income will not be maintained. To be fair to Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell, they have made this quite clear. In this week's statement, they say: 'These funds should not be confused with guaranteed funds; the two funds are actively managed according to market conditions. Neither capital, nor the level of income, are guaranteed.' Whether investors who have bought these funds via intermediaries are aware of these factors is another matter. The whole issue of high income products is obviously of great concern to the regulators. In some instances, rather more probably than in the case of the Hypo F &amp; C/Morgan Grenfell bonds, the 'income' received by investors is quite likely to represent merely the return of their capital. In Lautro's guidance note, the regulator states: 'Members must fairly describe the nature of the investment and the degree of risk it involves. In the context of high income products, this will generally include a reflection of the fact that higher-than-average returns are unlikely to be achieved without higher-than-average risk.' In other words, there is no such thing as a free lunch, however cleverly it is dressed up. Investors may indeed do very well out of the Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell plans, but they should understand that there is some risk of loss involved.</p>

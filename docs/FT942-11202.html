			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ford of Britain cuts deficit to Pounds 92m  -After three years of successive losses UK carmaker looks set to return to the black Ford of Britain, the leader of the UK new car market, suffered a third successive year of heavy losses in 1993 (excluding Jaguar) and reported the worst financial performance of any of the leading carmakers in the UK. It reduced its pre-tax loss to Pounds 92m, however, from a deficit of Pounds 353m in 1992 and a loss of Pounds 430m in 1991 (excluding Jaguar). Ford claimed yesterday that it was on the road to recovery and had performed better than expected so far this year, helped by the growing strength of the UK new car market. It is understood that Ford of Britain returned to profit in the first quarter this year, and it is expected to achieve a significant profit for the whole of 1994. The UK arm's pre-tax losses, which have totalled Pounds 875m in the past three years - excluding Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, which is owned directly by the Ford parent company in the US - contrast sharply with the robust profits earned throughout the recession by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors and Ford's chief rival in the UK. Vauxhall's pre-tax profits fell by only 17 per cent last year to Pounds 185.1m, and it has earned total pre-tax profits of Pounds 780.5m in the past four years. Among the other volume carmakers in the UK, Rover Group, which was taken over by BMW of Germany in March, suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9m last year, but it achieved a considerable turnround at the operating level with a profit before interest and tax of Pounds 56m, compared with a deficit of Pounds 49m a year earlier. Peugeot Talbot, the UK subsidiary of the PSA Peugeot Citroen group of France, has suffered a continuous decline in profitability for the past four years and fell into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.7m last year, from a profit of Pounds 10.2m in 1992 and a peak profit of Pounds 123m in 1989. The reduction of Ford of Britain's pre-tax loss last year was helped by one-off gains from the disposal of Ford Credit and Aston Martin to the Ford US parent com-pany. Without these moves the pre-tax loss would have been Pounds 136m. Ford of Britain's automotive operations had an operating loss last year of Pounds 114m compared with a loss of Pounds 237m in 1992. Turnover declined slightly to Pounds 5.33bn (Pounds 5.38bn). Ford of Britain, traditionally one of the most profitable parts of the Ford group worldwide before it plunged deep into loss during the UK recession, has been forced into a drastic restructuring with heavy cuts in its workforce and a big reduction in the manned capacity of its British plants. The workforce of the core Ford of Britain automotive operations had been cut to 30,400 by the end of 1993, from 34,200 a year earlier and 39,000 at the end of 1991. Its share of the UK new car market has been under heavy attack, not least from Vauxhall. Ford's new car sales in the UK rose by 8 per cent last year to 381,671, but it under-performed the market in which overall new car sales increased by 11.6 per cent. Its UK new car market share fell to 21.5 per cent, its lowest level for more than 20 years. Its share has been gradually eroded from a peak of just over 30 per cent in the early 1980s. By contrast Vauxhall has doubled its market share since the beginning of the 1980s, from 8.6 per cent in 1981 to 17.1 per cent last year, while the PSA Peugeot Citroen group has also made big inroads, increasing its UK market share to 12.6 per cent last year from only 5.4 per cent 10 years ago. Ford's problems in the UK were compounded last year by the collapse of its car exports to continental Europe, which fell to only 11,600 from 74,900 a year earlier, as west European new car sales suffered their steepest fall of the post-war period. Its overall vehicle exports, including commercial vehicles, dropped to 82,000 from 162,000 in 1992 and 214,000 in 1991. The total output from its three vehicle assembly plants at Dagenham, Halewood and Southampton fell by 13 per cent to 391,100 (449,600). Engine production at Dagenham fell to 399,713 (567,424), while engine output at Bridgend dropped to 472,231 (510,052). The assembly plants worked at only 63 per cent of installed capacity last year compared with 71 per cent in 1992. As production was cut back to keep pace with falling exports, Ford had to cut a total of 145 shifts at the vehicle assembly plants - 61 at the Transit van plant at Southampton, 54 at the Fiesta small car plant at Dagenham, and 30 at the Escort plant at Halewood. The decline in exports of cars and components cut the value of Ford of Britain's total exports to Pounds 1.7bn from Pounds 2.2bn a year earlier. It has had a balance of trade deficit for the past 13 years, and the deficit increased substantially last year, although Ford refused to disclose details.</p>

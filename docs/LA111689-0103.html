			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH COUNCIL TAKES TOUGH STANCE IN VOLATILE CONTRACT TALKS WITH POLICE  UNION  </P> <P> City officials have again extended bargaining talks with the police union,  while warning that they will carry out their threat of imposing a new contract  if a settlement is not reached soon in the labor dispute.  </P> <P> The City Council first indicated two weeks ago that it was on the verge of  declaring an impasse and adopting its version of a new contract with the  610-member police union, a move that would propel the contract fight into court  and underscore the mounting animosity between the two sides.  </P> <P> But at the advice of city staff, the council Tuesday gave negotiators another  week to reach a settlement.  </P> <P> "If something doesn't happen within the next week, we are going to have to deal  with the issue," Mayor Ernie Kell said to a packed council chamber overflowing  with police officers in and out of uniform.  </P> <P> Declared Vice Mayor Wallace Edgerton: "We're getting close to the end of the  line and that's a fact."  </P> <P> The council has adopted an unusually hard line in the negotiations, siding with  management's demands for major changes in the Police Department's personnel  policies. Three bargaining sessions in the last two weeks yielded little  movement on those key negotiating points, according to city officials.  </P> <P> Police union President Mike Tracy welcomed the week's extension, saying it  would help keep the "lid on potentially a very volatile situation in this  city."  </P> <P> He also insisted that if management imposes a new contract on his union, the  city would be violating its labor agreement. "We would consider it the terms  and conditions of imprisonment."  </P> <P> Tracy later dismissed the council's comments as "posturing for negotiations,"  and said management was unrealistically expecting the union to abandon  personnel policies it had won over the span of many years and many labor  contracts.  </P> <P> "It's unreasonable for them to expect we are going to give back in one  negotiating (season) everything we negotiated for in the past 20 years."  </P> <P> While the city says it is offering handsome raises in return for the  take-aways, Tracy said the city was not offering enough.  </P> <P> Management claims it needs a number of changes in the contract to efficiently  run the department: The police chief wants unlimited authority to transfer  officers from one assignment to another, the ability to send out one-officer,  rather than two-officer cars on night shifts, and the right to assign officers  to a five-day rather than a four-day week.  </P> <P> The labor standoff and the city's threat of imposing a new contract have bred  enormous discontent within the department, Tracy said. "(Officers) are  extremely hostile. There is an anger and frustration level I have never seen in  this department."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Tracy said, the union's board of directors continues to oppose a  walkout or other job action.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN OHIO ROBBERY ARRESTED  </P> <P> An Ohio man suspected of armed robbery and kidnaping has been arrested after  more than 10 months as a fugitive, federal authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gregory Waller III, 23, of Niles, Ohio, was taken into custody without incident  Monday at a home in Garden Grove, FBI spokesman Wylie B. Cox said.  </P> <P> Waller has been accused of holding up an Ohio jewelry store at gunpoint on Oct.  27, 1989, Cox said. Waller, who police say was shot by the store's owner, was  charged with kidnaping because he allegedly held the store's customers hostage,  Cox said. He was arrested shortly after the robbery.  </P> <P> Waller failed to appear for a court hearing in February, Cox said. A few months  later, federal authorities obtained a warrant charging him with unlawful flight  to avoid prosecution, he said.  </P> <P> Cox said Waller was arrested Monday after "information was developed that he  was in Orange County." He declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Waller, who had been working in Orange County as a painter and was staying at a  rented room at 14161 Grand Meadows, is expected to be extradited to Ohio, Cox  said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan </F> Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), by SHUKAN  DAIYAMONDO chief editor Yutaka Iwasa; place and date not given]    [Text] [Iwasa] As we are ringing out the old year, I want  you to speak first about the current economic situation.    [Hayami] Vowing to achieve political reform, the coalition  formed a new government following the collapse of one-party rule  by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Since then, we have been  confronted by a series of unexpected matters on the economic  front. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his predecessor,  Kiichi Miyazawa have implemented several packages of economic  stimulus measures worth some 30 trillion yen in total. However,  they have so far had no noticeable effect. The official  discount rate has dropped from 6 percent to 1.75 percent in a  period of just over two years. This is the lowest rate in  history. The implementation of these several measures still did  not bring forth a driving force to stimulate the economy.    [Iwasa] What are the causes?    [Hayami] Economic stimulus measures have not worked properly  because of a political vacuum. This is the principal cause. In  August 1992, the government announced a pump-priming package  worth 10 trillion yen. However, the Diet passed the  supplementary budget to finance the measures only in December.  Then, at the beginning of the 1993 fiscal year, the government  unveiled another economic stimulus package emphasizing public  investment. It was worth 13 trillion yen. However, although  there were many public works projects afoot, it was very  difficult for local governments to actually sign contracts  because of the sudden appreciation of the yen against the  dollar, and because of a series of bribery scandals related to  public works. Moreover, Japan suffered a crop loss because of  the unusually cool summer. For all these reasons, business  confidence has been depressed considerably. In September 1993,  the government approved another package worth 6 trillion yen.  The emergency economic stimulus program compiled by the Hosokawa  government aims to create new domestic demand by promoting  deregulation and market liberalization. Although it might not  have an immediate impact on the economy, I think the program is  extremely reasonable. The only problem is that we cannot  foresee how soon it will be implemented, because the  government's steering of Diet affairs is currently unsuccessful.  As for political reform, the public also wants the Diet to pass  a package of political reform bills promptly. The public wants  the government to promote an economic stimulus program and to  work out a tax reform plan, without creating any political  vacuum.  <H3>  Each Company Should Steer Its Own Course in Line With  Structural Change, Since a Return to the Boom Period Is Only an  Illusion </H3>   [Iwasa] Counting on the government is not sufficient. Don't  you think that companies also need to change themselves?    [Hayami] The Japanese economy is now undergoing a structural  change. Until now, as the whole market kept on growing, each  company was content to maintain its market share. However, we  can no longer expect growth of this kind. The potential growth  rate will reach only 2 to 3 percent at the most from now on.  Under such circumstances, people just keep saying, "Times are  still bad and there is no way out of it." This attitude is not  good. Recently, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives  made several proposals in a report entitled "What We Expect From  the Economic Reform Research Council." At the beginning of the  report, we wrote as follows: "Business is slow, and that is the  truth. However, to think that the national economy will go back  to its previous state is only an illusion."    "What are we going to do in the future?" Each company should  ask itself this question and make its own way by keeping future  structural change in view. To steer its own course, each  company should be able to decide and act at its own risk. I  think the business climate will not improve as long as companies  do not make efforts to toe their own line.    [Iwasa] Do you think business leaders of today are able to  do this?    [Hayami] Business leaders are now being asked to accept such  a challenge. For instance, Keizai Doyukai is an organization  independent of any business circle or any specific company. It  also pays regard to individual freedom. So, compared with other  economic organizations, our association can rather organize free  discussions. Our members often meet to exchange views on common  issues. These meetings prove useful because free discussions  help members to change their minds, and the new business  thinking brings on reform in management.    [Iwasa] Some other countries say the Japanese economy is not  sluggish. What do you think of that?    [Hayami] I also think that Japan is not being hit by the  recession. For example, Peter F. Drucker said that when he came  to Japan, he could not understand why Japanese people were  talking about the recession. This was because, when he went to  a Chinese restaurant in a hotel, he saw a queue of people,  including even youngsters, awaiting their turn, although the  restaurant was really expensive. Practically speaking, Japanese  business leaders should consider that they are now in a period  of change rather than a period of depression. As a matter of  course, the government should take necessary economic measures  to meet the change. First of all, the government should revise  the proportion of direct and indirect taxes. Direct taxes  currently account for 72 percent of total tax revenue, while  indirect taxes amount to 28 percent. In the near future, the  number of Japanese capable of paying direct taxes will decrease  as the ratio of aged people grows.    If the government does not take any measure, it will become  unable to finance new spending needed in such fields as welfare  and environmental protection. This is why the government has to  implement a drastic tax reform. We propose an immediate  reduction of the income tax, which would also help stimulate the  economy. An increase in the consumption tax is necessary to  cover the tax revenue shortfall. However, the consumption tax  hike should be implemented after a lapse of two to three years.  I think this is quite natural and that there is no other  solution. However, the government is unable to materialize a  tax reform plan because, as I just said, Prime Minister Hosokawa  is having a hard time handling Diet affairs.    [Iwasa] Are companies suffering from the corporate tax?    [Hayami] In Japan, the corporate tax rate is about 50  percent, while in other advanced countries it is around 20 to 40  percent. Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that our  competitive ability is declining. Companies distribute  dividends after paying a 50 percent corporate tax. Therefore,  if they want to pay a dividend of 10 percent, they will need to  make twice as much money as the amount of the dividend. As the  break-even point is becoming higher, the corporate tax rate  should be reduced so that business executives can have a larger  scope in running their companies.    There are two lines of measures that have to be implemented  immediately to stimulate the economy.  <H3>  Reducing the Gap Between Domestic and Global Prices 10 to 20  Percent by Improving Productivity in Nontradable Goods </H3>   [Hayami] Prime Minister Hosokawa has vowed to work out  measures to create a more consumer-oriented economy, with the  emphasis on improving living standards, as well as measures to  turn Japanese society into one in harmony with the international  community. For that, he should first try to correct the gap  between domestic and global prices caused by the rapid  appreciation of the yen against the dollar. Japan's trade  surplus of some 130 billion dollars is behind the yen's exchange  rate of 108 yen to the dollar. However, when we make a  comparison between Japan and the United States, or between Tokyo  and New York, we realize that the purchasing power parity of the  yen against the dollar is around 170 yen to 180 yen. The gap  between Japanese and U.S. prices has reached nearly 50 percent  over the past few years.    In brief, the purchasing power of the yen is weak at home,  while it is very strong abroad. Both exports and imports are  the cause of this gap. This problem is especially serious in  the sector of nontradable goods. This low-productivity sector  is protected, thanks to the granting of subsidies and price  regulation. Consumers are the sole sufferers from these  measures, since they have to buy the goods despite the high  prices. The productivity of this sector, which does not need to  compete with foreign rivals, is extremely low, compared with the  similar sector in the United States. As long as the government  does not gradually dismantle regulations and protectionist  measures in this sector, the yen's purchasing power will never  rise at home.    [Iwasa] What do you propose as a concrete measure to narrow  the existing gap?    [Hayami] First of all, if we find a foreign product of good  quality that is less expensive than the domestic product, we  should import it, period. Meanwhile, there are some sectors  that are still obliged to maintain their work force, even though  it is unprofitable. We should create a new high-productivity  sector so that surplus workers of the inefficient sectors can be  transferred. The creation of a new sector and the transfer of  surplus workers will temporarily cause friction. However, we  should make efforts and manage to find a good solution without  victimizing consumers. The government should promote economic  measures in this direction by aiming at reducing the gap between  domestic and global prices some 10 to 20 percent. For instance,  Japanese travelers usually say that everything was really  inexpensive, as they return to Narita Airport carrying a pile of  foreign goods in their arms. This is definitely strange. If we  create a sort of offshore market or free market in which  products will be sold at a price based on the real exchange rate  of the yen against the dollar, for example 108 yen or 109 yen,  consumers will immediately become aware that something is really  wrong with the current purchasing power of the yen.    [Iwasa] This is an interesting idea.    [Hayami] Unfortunately, we need to clear several regulations  which exist under the Customs Act, the Large-Scale Retail Stores  Act, and so on in order to create an offshore market. If the  government makes an exception to the rule to enable us to  surmount the obstacle to the establishment of an offshore  market, I think we will get an interesting result.    [Iwasa] Could you please explain the second line of  economic measures?    [Hayami] In Japan, personal savings or personal monetary  assets now total some 1 quadrillion yen, thanks to the  consistent policy to encourage savings which has been promoted  since the end of the war, and thanks to the laudable Japanese  custom of thrift and saving. (laughter) When I was in the  service of the Bank of Japan, I also participated in a savings  campaign. There is no doubt that Japan's postwar rehabilitation  and Japan's postwar growth were supported by the savings  movement. However, we are now suffering from insufficient  consumption and investment due to oversaving. It is not easy to  make consumers buy expensive products under the existing  situation, because they have already bought more or less  everything they want, and because they are anxious about the  employment situation. The household economy does not involve  only consumption. There is also investment, and we can  encourage consumers to invest more.    We should particularly encourage housing investment aimed at  improving living standards. For instance, in the United States  or Britain, a preferential treatment is applied to taxpayers who  have a house built. Not only those who build their own house  for the first time, but those who sell a house to build a new  one, or those who get a cottage, are also subject to the  preferential treatment. The government might defend itself,  saying the Housing Loan Corporation is extending loans at a low  interest rate. However, preferably, the government should  encourage housing investment also by adopting a preferential  treatment to lighten the interest payment burden of those who  have a house built by borrowing money from a private financial  institution. The government used to emphasize the promotion of  personal savings, while nothing has been done so far to  encourage investment.  <H5>  What People Need Now Is a Japanese Dream </H5>   [Iwasa] Before building a house, you first have to get a  lot. However, you cannot buy a piece of land so easily.    [Hayami] In Japan, a huge portion of farmland remains idle.  It now involves an area of 700,000 to 800,000 hectares, which is  equivalent to 80 percent of the total housing area. The  government should take necessary steps to facilitate the  development of uncultivated farmland for housing. Do you not  think it would be great, if you could live in a big house where  each member of your family would have enough space to do  whatever they like. The acquisition of a big house is essential  if you want to experience good living. The social climate is  gloomy because people see no hope for the future. This is why  we need a Japanese dream, which is to live comfortably in a big  house. Moreover, the acquisition of a house helps create new  demand for various products, such as household electric  appliances. Therefore, it will have a tremendous effect as a  medium- and long-term economic stimulus measure. An affluent  society in the true sense is a society in which you can easily  afford a big house and experience good living. It is the  measure to facilitate the acquisition of a house that will help  people to live comfortably.    [Iwasa] I agree with you. My last question is "How do you  foresee 1994?"    [Hayami] People will do their best to change their thinking  in order to cope with the unfolding changes. Japanese companies  will try to change, based on the view that consumers will  achieve self-reformation. In other words, Japanese companies  will go through a process similar to that of U.S. companies a  few years ago. Some people say the transfer of production  centers to overseas is nonsense. However, I do not think so.  If the product can be manufactured outside Japan at low cost,  we should automatically switch to overseas production. At the  same time, we should promote the production of high-value-added  products inside Japan. It is not premature at all to carry out  this kind of production transfer. In the United States, the  development of new business has been supported by talented  people who joined minor companies after they were forced to  leave big companies because of rationalization. New businesses  helped increase U.S. exports, promoting the recovery of the U.S.  economy. It will not be so easy to bring on change without  completely dismantling our laudable customs, such as the  lifetime employment system, because it will cause friction.  However, if we know that we can never go back to the previous  period of prosperity, I am sure we will be able to accomplish  reform. The year 1994 will be one of self-reformation and  structural reform. I am not so pessimistic about the future  (laughter). [as published]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- A draft Budget Law of  the People's Republic of China was submitted here today to the  second session of the eighth National People's Congress [NPC]  for deliberation.    Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, entrusted by the State  Council,  delivered an explanation on the draft law.    "Budget is a major means for the state to administer social  and economic affairs and strengthen macro-economic control and  its plays an important role in the state political and economic  affairs," he said.    Formulation, examination and approval, implementation,  readjustment and supervision of budget have had a lot of  loopholes for a long time because China has lacked the law  governing budgetary management, he said.    The draft budget law consists of 78 articles in 11 chapters.  It clearly stipulates that after approval by the People's  Congress at the same level, a budget has a binding force and  must be implemented. No one shall change the budget without  legal procedures and authorization.    The stipulation is aimed at turning round the situation in  which arbitrary change of budget and softening the binding force  of budget often occur.    The draft law has also legalized formulation, approval,  implementation and readjustment of budget and formulation and  approval of final state accounts.    According to the draft law, the National People's Congress  approves the budget of the central government only and the  people's congresses above the county level approve budgets of  the local governments at the same level only.    The regulations will help solve contradictions and problems  in the existing budgetary examination and approval procedures  and increase the responsibility of people's congresses and  governments at different levels, Liu said.    Article 27 and 28 in the draft read: the budget of the  central government shall not include deficit; the budgets of  local governments shall follow the principle of keeping  expenditures within limits of revenues and shall not list  deficit.    The draft also stipulates that budgets of governments at  various levels shall set aside reserves according to a certain  ratio of the expenditures of the governments, which will be used  to tide over natural catastrophes and other extraordinary  special expenditures.    Financial experts here said that it is imperative to enact  the budget law to realize administration of financial affairs  according to law.    The first draft was submitted for deliberation to the fourth  meeting of the eighth October Standing Committee last October  and revised according to opinions of the Standing Committee  members afterward.</p>

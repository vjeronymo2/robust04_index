			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 25 Apr (AFP) -- Fernando Naranjo, the  Costa Rican foreign minister-designate, said this Monday he  looks forward to the appointment of a U.S. ambassador to Costa  Rica as a sign of improvement in both countries' relations,  which have been marred by frequent diplomatic incidents during  the past years.    "The absence of an ambassador (from Washington in San Jose)  troubles us," but "we are going to work very closely (with the  Clinton administration)" to solve the problems that have  developed in the relations between both countries, Naranjo said  during a news conference, which President-elect Jose Maria  Figueres also attended.    Naranjo, who will take charge of the Foreign Ministry on 8  May when the new government assumes control, admitted a number  of conflicts "unnecessarily" cooled relations between both  countries during the administration of Social Christian  President Rafael Angel Calderon, which is about to conclude.    Washington recently threatened to block several loans to  Costa Rica, because the Costa Rican Government has not  compensated a group of U.S. citizens whose lands were  expropriated, and this triggered a harsh confrontation between  U.S. and Costa Rican authorities.    The United States had also previously threatened to suspend  Costa Rica's preferential custom tariffs, because the  influential U.S. union AFL-CIO presented charges of union  persecution against the Costa Rican Government.    Naranjo said the next administration will frankly broach the  issues that have tarnished relations with the United States and  expect the vacant position at Washington's embassy in San Jose,  vacant for more than a year, to be filled in the coming months.    The designated foreign minister accompanied Figueres on a  tour to Mexico, the United States, and Canada last week. During  their trip, the Costa Rican officials met with top officials of  those governments and with the hierarchy of international  financial organizations.</p>

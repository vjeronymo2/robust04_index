			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / MoD pays in pregnancy test case: Claims may run into millions A FORMER medical assistant, dismissed from the Royal Air Force in 1985 after she became pregnant, accepted Pounds 22,000 in damages from the Ministry of Defence in an out-of-court settlement yesterday. The claim was brought by Miss Jacqui Thornber, a 33-year-old single mother from Leicester. It is seen as a test case for up to 4,000 servicewomen dismissed after they became pregnant. The MoD could now face claims running into millions of pounds. Settlement was reached at an industrial tribunal hearing in Croydon, south London, to set the level of damages. The MoD had admitted unlawful sex discrimination but disputed the level of compensation to which she was entitled. MoD policy in 1985 was to discharge servicewomen who became pregnant, but it had accepted that this policy was unlawful in an earlier test case in the High Court in 1990. Miss Thornber's fight for compensation was aided by a recent decision of the European Court of Justice that Britain's statutory Pounds 11,000 ceiling on tribunal awards was unlawful. The Luxembourg court ruled in August that people who have suffered sex discrimination must be compensated in full for loss and damage actually suffered even if that meant exceeding the ceiling. Miss Thornber is now on income support and in the final year of a science degree course in information and library studies. She told the tribunal she was a medical assistant at RAF Bruggen in Germany when she learned she was pregnant, and that she was faced with the stark choice of having an abortion or leaving the forces. She said she did not attempt to re-enlist after her son was born because she did not think she could. A second case involving a former aerospace systems operator from Humberside is due to be heard on October 8. Mrs Deborah Miller, 28, is claiming Pounds 54,000 plus interest after rejecting an MoD offer of Pounds 3,688.</p>

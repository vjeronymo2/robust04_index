			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, reiterating  that diplomacy is the only way to resolve the North Korean  nuclear row, has urged the United States to offer detailed plans  on normalization of relations with Pyongyang.    In an interview with the ASAHI SHIMBUN in the United States,  the chairman of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the  Asia-Pacific Region said Washington will never allow North Korea  to acquire nuclear weapons.    Kim voiced optimism on resolution of the nuclear dispute  because Pyongyang's overriding goal is not to possess nuclear  weapons but to establish diplomatic relations with Washington.    Therefore, the United States should tell China that it  intends to normalize relations with North Korea in order to  secure Chinese cooperation, Kim said. The former South Korean  opposition leader has been visiting the United States.    Since China does not want to see a Japan armed with nuclear  weapons, the United States would be able to obtain Chinese  cooperation, Kim added.    As long as Washington does not provide clear assurances to  North Korea through diplomatic channels, it will be difficult to  resolve the nuclear row, he said.    North Korea is suspicious about U.S. intentions because  Washington has failed to offer any detailed plans, Kim said,  adding that Pyongyang is worried that when the nuclear row is  cleared up, the United States will take issue with North Korean  human rights absues, chemical weapons, terrorism and arms  exports to the Middle East.    North Korea refuses to accept complete inspections of its  nuclear facilities because if it did, it would lose "the card"  for a third round of high-level negotiations with the United  States, Kim said.    Once Pyongyang's nuclear card is used, the attention of the  United States and the international community will shift to  human rights and other issues, he said.</p>

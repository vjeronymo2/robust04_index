			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Nation unto nation: Europe The negotiations between Denmark and the other 11 member states, over a document which could enable the Danes to hold a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty, have caused a lot of bother and barney. Scandalised sticklers for juridical integrity have protested that it must be quite improper to offer a deal which lets the Danes opt out of the main provisions of the treaty, even before it has begun. World-weary cynics retort that the treaty is an infinitely elastic document which can be stretched in any direction; the only important thing is to ratify it, because we can always adjust the fine print later. There is one issue, however, over which there surely could be no serious argument, and that is the question of European citizenship. One of the reasons a narrow majority of the Danish electorate voted against Maastricht last June, we are told, was that they were afraid the new Treaty of European Union would take away their Danish citizenship. This may seem strange, even incredible. But it can be no great sacrifice of European Community principle for the other member states to reassure the Danish people that their fears are groundless. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the text batted back and forth between the 12 included an article which solemnly declared that the European 'citizenship' referred to in the new treaty did not replace national citizenship. It would confer additional rights and protections, but nationality as such would continue to be the sole prerogative of the national member states. Such a declaration may seem unnecessary, it may even seem childish, but at least it could do no harm to tell the truth. At first blush, the moral of this minor aspect of the Danish dilemma is that those Danish politicians who were campaigning for ratification did a peculiarly incompetent job of explaining the treaty to the people. It makes one wonder if they know what they are talking about now. At another level, however, Danish anxieties undoubtedly touch indirectly on a nexus of politically sensitive questions which are likely to become of intense relevance in the future. The Maastricht treaty could not affect the essentially national character of the attribution of citizenship, because it would not displace the leading role of the nation state as the primary paradigm of political legitimacy. The locus of political authority must be the locus of nationality. On the other hand, there is a raft of associated issues that are almost as sensitive, which will force their way on to the European agenda not mainly through the Maastricht treaty, but through the combined effect of outside pressures and the opening-up of the single European market. Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the war in ex-Yugoslavia, the Community has already started to recognise that the refugee problem is so large and so serious that it needs the beginnings of a common European response. The Maastricht treaty would take the Community into the field of normal travel regulation, in the realm of visa policy. Given the potential migratory pressures which exist to the east of the Community and to the south, the member states may be forced sooner or later to consider whether they must move in the direction of a common immigration policy. In principle, this might not be an issue of serious contention, since they all try to bolt the door tight shut; but in practice they all suffer more or less from illegal immigration, so there could be matter for co-operation in policing and detection. At that point, they may then be only a small step away from talking about the implications for immigration of their different asylum and nationality policies. In fact, in the context of the Single European Act, with completely free movement for Community 'citizens' and no border controls (on the Continent), it is difficult to see how they can avoid talking about their different nationality policies. This issue is particularly acute in the case of Germany, which has acquired a large number of new citizens as a result of unification, and which regularly acquires large numbers of other ethnic Germans previously settled in eastern Europe or the ex-Soviet Union. These changes in the German population are causing serious social stress inside the country; the unknown question is whether free movement in the Community could lead to stress in other countries. Insofar as there is a single problem, it is that Germany has an exclusively ethnic basis for the attribution of nationality: a German is someone with German parents. This policy, crystallised in the nationality law of 1913, originated in the 18th and 19th centuries, when frontiers were shifting between the German lands and the Slav lands of Poland, Lithuania and the Ukraine; Germans felt their nation existed before their state had been created. France has a different history and therefore a different nationality policy. Its essential frontiers were fixed relatively early by a strong central state; indeed, while the German nation created the German state, the French state created the French nation. Partly for this reason, and partly because of a historically low birth rate, France has long had a law of nationality conferred by birth in France as well as by birth to French parents. As a result, about one-fifth of its population has a parent or grandparent who was an immigrant. These national characteristics have historic roots which go far too deep to be swept away in the name of European uniformity. Neither the Germans nor the French can deny the facts of their differences; but nor can they deny that these differences may have policy consequences for their neighbours in the Community.</p>

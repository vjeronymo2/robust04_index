			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Conservatives divided over EU budget forecast Tory MPs were deeply split last night over an analysis of forecast UK contributions to the European Union budget released by the Treasury. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, took the extraordinary step of releasing figures from the Budget Red Book, expected on Tuesday, to provide a sound statistical argument for a crucial parliamentary debate on Monday. Mr Clarke said the figures proved 'incontrovertibly' that the increase in UK contributions caused by the European communities finance bill would be limited to Pounds 75m next year and Pounds 250m a year by 1999. But Eurosceptic backbenchers seized on an admission that this year's net contribution would be Pounds 720m higher than forecast, and said the analysis justified claims that UK payments would rise by up to Pounds 1bn by the end of the century. Mr Edward Leigh, a rightwing former minister, said the analysis 'justifies everything that we have been saying'. He added: 'We are not talking about small amounts of money, we are talking about a serious issue of principle.' Mr Clarke said he was 'quite confident' that the government would win the second reading vote on the bill following the government's announcement that it would call a general election in the event of a rebel victory. The Treasury figures, released in a Commons written answer, update last year's Red Book forecasts for net UK contributions from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 2.4bn for the current year, an increase of Pounds 720m. The figures also show that the forecast payment for next year has been reduced by Pounds 64m to just under Pounds 3.4bn, and the forecast payment for 1996-97 has fallen by Pounds 179m to Pounds 3.3bn. Overall, Britain's net contributions are now forecast to be Pounds 963m higher over the three years to 1996-97 than was expected, partly because of the effect of faster UK growth on the complex formula that determines payments. However, none of the forecast rise is attributable to the provisions of the bill, which implements a deal reached by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, at the Edinburgh EU summit in 1992. In separate figures stripping out irregularities in payments caused by technical factors, the Treasury forecasts that underlying net contributions will rise from Pounds 2.5bn this year to Pounds 3.5bn in 1999. It says that Pounds 600m of the Pounds 850m rise between next year - the first affected by the bill - and 1999 is due to growth and inflation. Only Pounds 250m is attributable to the Edinburgh deal.</p>

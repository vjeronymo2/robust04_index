			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Is my AVC still secure?  -Briefcase Two years ago, I arranged to make additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to my employer's pension scheme. Since then, my company has been acquired by another group and I am concerned regarding two matters: 1. The security of my AVC. Are AVCs less secure from possible raiding than FSAVCs? 2. Future changes in employment (the owner has been reducing staff recently). Are AVCs less portable than FSAVCs? There is no reason why an AVC scheme should be any less secure than an FSAVC. Neither scheme would be portable in the true sense of the word, although you would have a greater degree of control, particularly on investment questions, with the FSAVC. (Reply by Andrew White of Gordon Leighton &amp; Co.). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

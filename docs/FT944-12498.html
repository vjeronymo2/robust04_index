			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Interpublic to acquire media buyer Interpublic, the US advertising group, said it would acquire Western International Media, the country's largest independent media-buying company, in a deal which appeared to signal a consolidation of the US media-buying industry. The deal could also indicate a push by the US group into the media-buying business in Europe, which is currently dominated by locally-based groups. Mr Dennis Holt, Western's president, said the link with Interpublic would give his customers access to European markets through the adver-tising group's offices there. Media buyers purchase advertising space in bulk and sell it on to advertisers, either directly or through other agencies. The greater bargaining power available to big buyers has prompted a consolidation in the European industry. The acquisition of Western, which claims to buy Dollars 1.6bn of air time and other advertising space a year, could indicate an acceleration of the same trend in the US. It represents the first big acquisition by Interpublic, which has annual billings of Dollars 15bn and whose agencies include McCann-Erickson, Lintas and the Lowe group. These agencies each currently buy their own media space. The planned deal prompted other advertising industry executives to suggest that Interpublic was preparing to merge all its activities in this area into one company, creating a giant in the US media-buying industry. However, a spokesman for Interpublic denied that the Western acquisition would lead to a merging of the media-buying operations: 'We have no intention of combining them. It's a free-standing acquisition.' This was seen in part as an attempt to ease concerns among the many smaller US advertising agencies which currently use Western to buy their media space. European-based advertisers have also been exploring ways to expand their US media-buying muscle. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which in 1989 combined its European media buying activities in a single company, Zenith, is currently studying whether to adopt the same course in the US. Together with the acquisition of an independent media-buyer, Saatchi estimates the consolidation of its activities in Zenith has given it about a sixth of the total European market. The terms of yesterday's deal were not disclosed.</p>

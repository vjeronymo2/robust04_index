			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The perpetrator of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis'  horrible murder was a professional hit man acting according to a  careful plan for which he needed much accurate information.  This is the result of the Criminal Investigation Department's  investigations so far and it reinforces the belief that Turkey's  secret agencies planned the murder some time ago.    The culprit used a semi-automatic gun or a small automatic  gun using special technology. The Criminal Investigation  Department is convinced that if the culprit has not escaped to  the occupied areas, he could be located and arrested. But the  hit man could have crossed the buffer zone five minutes after  the murder. According to the same reports, the culprits could  have escaped to the occupied areas even with a car. This  afternoon, the police are expected to release the sketches of  two people who were seen moving in a suspicious manner while  riding in a yellow Mercedes a few hours before the murder. The  description of one of the men matches eyewitness descriptions of  the man they saw approach and shoot Theofilos from a Vespa  motorcycle. [passage omitted]    In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation,  Former  National Guard Chief Dhimitrios Matafias confirmed that several  Turkish press reports list him as a target of Turkey's secret  services. Matafias reportedly met the Kurdish movement's  leadership eight years ago and since then has supported the  Kurds both financially and in other ways.    Commenting on information that he will be the next Turkish  target, Matafias said he believes the Turks use these methods to  intimidate or make an impression and thus strangle every voice  in support of the Kurds. He added that he must take some  additional protection measures.</p>

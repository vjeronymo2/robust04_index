			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / International Company News: Consortium to cover Comptoir's urgent cash needs A CONSORTIUM of financial institutions has agreed to cover the immediate cash needs of Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, a French 145-year-old property bank crippled by bad loans on commercial property, pending a FFr1bn (Dollars 176m) recapitalisation. The Banque de France, the French central bank, said the main credit institutions in Paris had agreed to refinance CDE's treasury needs, but did not reveal their names or the amount. The move is the latest example of the French financial authorities' strategy of trying to defuse the worst financial impact of the Paris commercial property crisis, and as such is likely to be welcomed by the market. CDE made a consolidated loss of just over FFr1bn last year after heavy property write-downs. CDE's shareholders, led by AGF, the state-owned insurer, are putting the finishing touches to a FFr800m issue of fresh equity and FFr200m of perpetual subordinated securities, to be presented at the next board meeting on Wednesday. Other leading shareholders include Depfa, a German mortgage bank, and UAP, the largest French state insurer. The group was founded in 1848 to provide state-subsidised loans for cheap housing but expanded into normal commercial and private property lending after that role was wound down in 1984. It now has FFr10bn of risky loans to property industry professionals, on which it has made FFr2bn of provisions. CDE's management is urging the government to guarantee more of the group's own borrowings, which it says is essential to restoring its credit rating. Because of CDE's financial problems, the S&amp;P Adef French credit rating agency recently lowered its ratings on CDE. Currently, the state guarantees FFr34bn of CDE's debts, left over from its old role as a financer of cheap housing, on top of which the group has another FFr42bn of debt, including FFr28bn of property bonds. The government has so far been cautious over extending this kind of support.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MACLEAN-WILSON LATEST PAIR TO PUMP UP THE VOLUME AT PAULEY;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: UCLA FANS ARE USED TO TALENTED FORWARDS, BUT THE CURRENT DUO IS  EVEN STIRRING MEMORIES OF SIDNEY WICKS AND CURTIS ROWE.  </P> <P> As he embarked upon the task of restoring glory to the UCLA basketball program  1 1/2 years ago, Coach Jim Harrick faced doubts about the players who would  provide the cornerstones in the rebuilding process.  </P> <P> He wondered if Trevor Wilson, after two stormy years under former Coach Walt  Hazzard, would be able to curb his temper. Would Wilson be able to blend his  splendid individual skills into a team concept? Would Wilson react positively  to a one-week suspension from preseason practice?  </P> <P> He wondered how Don MacLean, only a few months removed from Simi Valley High,  would adjust to the more rigorous demands of college basketball. Would MacLean  score as well as he had in high school? Would MacLean have the stamina to  rebound, defend and run?  </P> <P> Harrick has since watched Wilson, a 6-foot-8 senior, and MacLean, a 6-10  sophomore, develop into one of the most proficient forward tandems in college  basketball. The two have proved to be worthy heirs to a long line of exemplary  Bruin forwards that includes Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe and eight other NBA  first-round draft choices since 1971.  </P> <P> Wilson is averaging 19.1 points and 8.6 rebounds. His teammates call him Rock,  in reference to his physique and not his abysmal free-throw shooting.  </P> <P> MacLean is averaging 19.8 points and 8.4 rebounds. His teammates call him Air  because his on-court demeanor is the opposite of Michael (Air) Jordan's.  </P> <P> Between them, that's 38.9 points and 17 rebounds a game.  </P> <P> As seniors in 1971, Wicks and Rowe combined to average 38.9 points and 22.8  rebounds.  </P> <P> Five years later, Marques Johnson and Richard Washington averaged 34.7 points  and 18 rebounds. The next season, Johnson and David Greenwood averaged 36.6  points and 20 rebounds.  </P> <P> The latest tandem has led UCLA to a 15-4 record, within a game of the Pacific  10 Conference lead entering tonight's game at Arizona State.  </P> <P> MacLean is the No. 3 scorer and rebounder in the Pac-10, and Wilson ranks fifth  in scoring and second in rebounding.  </P> <P> Said John Wooden, who has either coached or observed all who have manned the  corners for UCLA in the last four decades: "If we were to compare them to the  other pairs, I'd say they're not nearly as stable. They're a great pair of  forwards, perhaps as fine a pair as there is in the country from an offensive  point of view, but each tends to get out of control every now and then because  of their temperament.  </P> <P> "Wilson is more outgoing, has been less disciplined in the past than MacLean.  But MacLean, in his desire to excel, gets himself riled up at times and loses a  bit of control. And when he does that, he loses a bit of his effectiveness.  </P> <P> "MacLean appears to be a more placid individual, but he really isn't. Rowe  wasn't (placid), either, but he appeared that way. He was very competitive."  </P> <P> While Wicks and Rowe never backed down from a challenge, Wooden said, they were  "spirited without being temperamental."  </P> <P> Physically, however, MacLean and Wilson might be their equal.  </P> <P> "MacLean is as fine around the board as any 6-10 man you'll see," Wooden said.  "He has a great touch.  </P> <P> "Just taking the physical qualifications to play forward, I'd say Sidney  (Wicks) had about as many as you could find in an individual, and so does  Wilson," Wooden said.  </P> <P> College basketball coaches across America breathed a sigh of relief in 1969  when the former Lew Alcindor finally graduated after leading UCLA to three  consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships.  </P> <P> But in the two seasons before Bill Walton joined the Bruin varsity in 1971 and  started another reign of terror in Westwood, Wicks and Rowe kept the dynasty  alive.  </P> <P> The Bruins won 57 of 60 games and consecutive NCAA championships in the 1969-70  and '70-71 seasons.  </P> <P> In 1970-71, UCLA outrebounded its foes by an average of 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> "We were extremely confident of our ability to get the ball inside and score,"  said Steve Patterson, who was the Bruins' center. "And if we didn't score on  the first shot, then we'd score on the second or the third or the fourth. I  remember that we used to really take control of games on the inside."  </P> <P> Rowe provided consistency.  </P> <P> "As a starter for me for three years, Curtis Rowe never had a bad game," Wooden  said. "He didn't have the great games like Sidney might have, but he never had  a bad game."  </P> <P> Wicks was brash -- outgoing and talkative. Like Wilson, he wore his emotions on  his sleeve. And, like Wilson, he clashed with his coach.  </P> <P> And so, as a sophomore, Wicks was used as a reserve behind Rowe and Lynn  Shackelford, neither of whom was as talented.  </P> <P> "That used to trouble him," Wooden said. "He'd say to me, 'You know I'm better  than them.' And I'd say, 'I know you are. They probably do too. It's too bad  that you let them beat you out.' Eventually, he came to understand what I was  talking about, and in his last two years he was the best college forward in the  country."  </P> <P> As a senior, Wicks averaged 21.3 points and 12.8 rebounds.  </P> <P> Rowe averaged 17.6 points and 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> "Wicks was like Wilson, and Rowe was like MacLean," Wooden said. "Though not as  good a scorer as MacLean, (Rowe) was steadier than MacLean has been. Maybe I  won't say that next year, or in (MacLean's) senior year."  </P> <P> Like MacLean, Rowe was quietly intense.  </P> <P> "He had a good sense of humor -- he loved to laugh -- and he was very  easygoing," Patterson said. "Yet, on the court he had a demeanor that was  fearsome. He really could be scary at times on the floor. He just had a look of  a guy you wouldn't want to mess with. I think he really scared people at  times."  </P> <P> Today, Rowe is a community service worker in Detroit. He averaged 11.6 points  in an eight-year NBA career with the Detroit Pistons and the Boston Celtics.  </P> <P> Wicks, a UCLA assistant coach under Hazzard, is a real estate investor in Los  Angeles. He averaged 16.8 points in a 10-year NBA career with the Portland  Trail Blazers, the Celtics and the San Diego Clippers.  </P> <P> Among Harrick's first priorities as UCLA coach were to persuade MacLean to sign  with the Bruins and to persuade point guard Darrick Martin, who had signed  several months earlier, to honor his commitment. Accomplishing both, he has  said, laid the foundation for his program.  </P> <P> Equally important, it seems, was bringing Wilson into line.  </P> <P> "We had a time, Trevor and I, when I needed to think about him being on our  team," Harrick said. "I felt that I needed to get Trevor's attention and let  him know that there was only one crazy guy on the team, and that was me. And  that, most of the time, things would be done my way."  </P> <P> Harrick didn't like Wilson riding his teammates in practice. He wanted Wilson  to encourage, not chastise and discourage.  </P> <P> Finally, before last season, he suspended Wilson for a week.  </P> <P> "I thought he was an individualist, and there was no place for that on our  team," Harrick said. "That was just his style, but it was contrary to the way I  thought.  </P> <P> "I told him, 'Trevor, I can't put up with this for two years. I'd be a  fruitcake, so we might as well part, unless . . .  </P> <P>  " 'We do this, this, this and this.' I had about four pages of things I wanted  him to do."  </P> <P> Among the requirements was a weekly meeting with a sports psychologist, Dr.  William Parham, who works regularly with several UCLA athletes.  </P> <P> Working with Parham helped him control his emotions, Wilson said. And except  for an occasional flare-up, such as last month's technical foul incident at  Stanford, Wilson's behavior has steadied.  </P> <P> He joined Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), Walton, Greenwood and Johnson  this season as the only Bruins who have both scored more than 1,500 points and  grabbed more than 800 rebounds.  </P> <P> Through it all, Wilson never considered leaving UCLA.  </P> <P> "No way," he said.  </P> <P> Transferring would have meant not playing with his boyhood friend, MacLean,  whom he met in the summer before the eighth grade.  </P> <P> "I remember seeing this huge guy," MacLean said. "He'd miss three layups in a  row and then finally make it. We used to joke that that was the only way he led  the league in rebounding."  </P> <P> Wilson and MacLean talked of playing together, but Wilson stayed close to home  at Cleveland High in Reseda and MacLean stayed in Simi Valley.  </P> <P> So, before hooking up in Westwood, they were teammates only in pickup games.  </P> <P> "We've been playing together for so long that we kind of have a feel for each  other," Wilson said. "We know each other's strengths and weaknesses so well,  and we kind of play off them. It's become instinctive. It's not something we  talk about, but I just know where he's going to be sometimes."  </P> <P> Last season, when Wilson averaged 18.4 points and 8.7 rebounds, and MacLean  averaged 18.6 points and 7.5 rebounds, it was the first time two Bruin forwards  had each averaged more than 18 points in the same season. And while Wilson led  the Pac-10 in rebounding for the second consecutive season, MacLean set a  freshman conference scoring record.  </P> <P> This season, MacLean has accounted for 537 points and rebounds, only 12 more  than Wilson. And in the last four weeks, the two have experienced a role  reversal. Wilson has been the more accurate shooter in UCLA's last eight games,  making 59.6% of his shots, while MacLean has been the more consistent  rebounder, pulling down an average of 10.6 rebounds to Wilson's 7.8.  </P> <P> "Trevor is about as quick a forward as I've ever known," Harrick said. "And not  many teams have a 6-10 player who can stay with MacLean. He shoots over most of  the people who guard him, he's got good moves around the basket and he's got a  soft touch."  </P> <P> Only two former Bruins, Alcindor and Walton, averaged more points a game as  sophomores than MacLean.  </P> <P> "I never thought he'd be quite this good," Harrick said. "But I thought after  last season that by January, he'd be one of the top players in the country."  </P> <P> Both are expected to be first-round NBA draft choices, although some have  questioned Wilson's shooting touch from the perimeter and the foul line. He has  made only 52.9% of his free throws this season. But Newell said: "I like  (Wilson's) fire. I like the fact that he wants to win. He'll give up his body  to help his team win."  </P> <P> MacLean is already being mentioned as an eventual NBA lottery pick. His unusual  shot, released on the way up, is difficult to defend, Newell said. "His shot  reminds me of Bernard King's. He shoots so quickly that he doesn't get a lot of  shots blocked."  </P> <P> Together, Wilson and MacLean form a combination that's difficult to beat,  MacLean said.  </P> <P> "Coach Harrick said there are better tandems in the country," he said, "but I  don't think -- as far as playing together and being so complementary (goes) --  that there are."  </P> <P> Wilson, however, defers to Bruins past.  </P> <P> "I've seen some tapes of Wicks, and he's far superior to either one of us,"  Wilson said. "The stats are comparable, but we have to win a championship to be  truly compared to those guys."  </P></p>

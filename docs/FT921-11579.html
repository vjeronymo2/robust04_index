			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Stronger security role urged for CSCE CZECHOSLOVAKIA and Germany yesterday urged foreign ministers at the Prague meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) to strengthen the forum's institutions and allow it to play a more active political mediation and military peace-keeping role in member states. The Conference, which groups 36 European states, the US, Canada, the Baltic states, and 10 former Soviet republics, has no legal or political powers to enforce agreements. However, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister, said it was time to expand its role among member states in the field of security, as well as to change the rules of consensus. 'The CSCE should provide for the possibility of creating CSCE 'blue helmets' and CSCE 'green helmet' missions to safeguard peace and the environment,' he said. Officials also discussed the possibility of changing the decision-making process to a consensus minus one. Such a mechanism would also allow members to condemn one member state. Under the unanimity principle, Yugoslavia has refused the admission as members of Slovenia and Croatia, which were recognised as independent states by the European Community countries, among others, on January 15. Slovenia and Croatia were instead granted temporary observer status. Officials said that membership would be considered at the Helsinki meeting which is due to take place in mid-July. Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovak president, had earlier suggested the creation in the CSCE of a body similar to the Security Council of the United Nations. This new council would be vested with certain executive powers from members states in the security sphere. 'If the CSCE is to be a guarantor of the inviolability of frontiers, the security of its member states and the protection of their democratic constitutional systems, it must have instruments enabling it to perform this function,' he said. The US however, reacted against such proposals. 'The most dangerous thing for the CSCE is to launch a series of ideas to which members are not ready to subscribe and which will therefore prove unworkable,' a senior US official said. The extent of the CSCE's role in monitoring peace settlements has been a topic of discussion all summer as senior officials met regularly to issue declarations on the Yugoslav crisis. A possible new role for the CSCE was further highlighted yesterday after 10 former Soviet republics were admitted as full members. Some of these republics, such as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have waged a virtual war over the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh. Mr Raffi Hovannisian, Armenia's foreign minister, said he would welcome CSCE peacekeeping missions in his republic. The 10 republics were granted admission yesterday after Russia took over the seat allocated previously to the Soviet Union. Only Georgia, at the grip of a civil war, did not apply for membership. Admission of the former Soviet republics brings to 48 the number of member states. Concern was voiced that such a large body would become ineffective under the CSCE's unanimity rule.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Storms hit French vineyards STORMS swept across France at the weekend, killing a tourist, overturning caravans, blowing off roofs and battering vineyards, Reuter reports from Bordeaux. In the worst-hit southwest region, lightning started some 30 fires in the Landes forest and several people suffered head injuries as hailstones the size of eggs fell on Bayonne, smashing glass and punching holes through roofs. High winds blew off the roofs of several hundred homes and felled trees, wrecking cars, caravans and tents in camping grounds. Farmers said a hailstorm rolled through several kilometres of Bordeaux's Medoc vineyards, only a few weeks before the harvest. They estimated some farms around Margaux could lose up to 40 per cent of the crop. But the area's best-known vineyard, Chateau-Margaux, was spared.</p>

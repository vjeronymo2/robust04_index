			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling bonds The bandwagon theory that interest rates are heading lower is gaining momentum. Yesterday's spate of reverse floating rate notes in the Eurobond market is an outright bet on easier money to come. If short rates actually rise the value of the bonds will be quickly eroded. A week is a long time in the bond market; only a few days ago investment bankers were touting collared FRNs. These offered protection against falling interest rates and some gain if the government is forced to tighten the monetary belt. Whatever the protestations of the prime minister, the bond market now senses a determination to move rates lower. Even so, overseas investors who bought yesterday's offerings were taking an optimistic view of both interest rates and the exchange rate. Sterling stabilised yesterday. However, without some help from Germany, it is still unclear whether Mr Major can engineer a further large cut in base rates without precipitating a full-blooded sterling crisis. Buyers of reverse FRNs could eventually find themselves looking at a currency gain, only at the expense of higher interest rates.</p>

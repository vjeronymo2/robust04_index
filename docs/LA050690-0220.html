			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A;  </P> <P> TAKING ISSUE WITH THE ISSUES;  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATORS TACKLE THE PROBLEMS FACING PREP SPORTS;  </P> <P> STAN THOMAS, TOM TRIGGS AND MARGARET DAVIS  </P> <P> There is more to high school athletics than game-winning touchdowns,  last-second baskets and state championships. As the California Interscholastic  Federation (CIF) and the Southern Section continue to grow, so does the number  of issues facing high school administrators.  </P> <P> Sportsmanship, violence, drug testing, open enrollment, growth and summer  participation are among the many issues school administrators are currently  dealing with. How are administrators dealing with crowd control? How effective  is voluntary drug testing? Is summer participation contributing to athletic  burnout? How realistic is open enrollment? What are the consequences of it?  </P> <P> The Times Orange County prep staff posed these and other questions to Stan  Thomas, Southern Section commissioner of athletics; Tom Triggs, La Habra High  School principal and Orange County representative to the Southern Section, and  Margaret Davis, CIF associate commissioner of athletics.  </P> <P> Thomas, the Southern Section commissioner since 1986, has held teaching and  administrative positions at a variety of levels. He was a teacher, football  coach, principal and assistant principal at Neff, Excelsior and Foothill high  schools. Thomas has a bachelor of arts degree and a masters of education degree  from Whittier College.  </P> <P> Triggs has spent 28 years as a teacher, coach and administrator in Orange  County schools. He is in his 10th year as principal at La Habra, where he also  taught and coached tennis in the early 1960s. He is in his second year as  Orange County area representative to the Southern Section. He earned his  bachelor's degree in mathematics and masters' degree in education from Whittier  College.  </P> <P> Davis has worked for the state and Southern Section for 16 years and was  largely responsible for organizing the girls' sports programs in the Southern  Section in the early 1970s. She began her teaching and coaching career in 1970  at Poway High School, where she was a physical education teacher, assistant  athletic director, department chairwoman and girls' basketball and softball  coach. She has a bachelor of arts degree in physical education from San Diego  State and a masters' degree in educational administration from Cal State  Fullerton.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. The Southern Section has taken some steps to solve the problem of violence  in prep sports. What is the present plan to re-educate players, parents and  coaches regarding sportsmanship and officials?  </P> <P> A. Tom Triggs, who designed a package of rules to deter violence in the Freeway  League: When you sit on the hearing panels, especially the ones that deal with  violence, afterwards you always say, "That could happen at La Habra High  School." Each of those registered in a very dramatic fashion in terms of my  views of high school athletics. And I'm not alone in that. Principals I deal  with in the Orange County section share the same concerns I have in terms of  the escalation.  </P> <P> Most of the communication I've received (about the Freeway League violence  package) has been from other leagues in Orange County. I would say many of them  are considering implementing similar rules that we have now in the Freeway  League. I think you'll see similar rules come forth in the (Southern) Section.  </P> <P> Margaret Davis: It's statewide and nationwide (problem). Our general council  has undertaken to write some language that is before the May council meeting  (this weekend). Basically it says that any student who perpetrates, instigates,  etc., a physical assault upon a person in a game or event official shall be  banned from interscholastic activity for the remainder of the students'  eligibility.  </P> <P> Q. Do you have any reaction to this issue on a personal level?  </P> <P> A. Triggs: I really didn't enjoy basketball games at the high school level this  year. A lot of it has to do with that level of anxiety about what can happen in  a gymnasium. They are very emotional young people, parents and players. I'm a  fan of basketball, that's my favorite sport. But for me to sit in the  gymnasium, and all I'm doing is watching the crowd and looking for signals of  something that could happen, has distracted me from watching the game.  </P> <P> I really had concerns about opening the sports section Saturday morning and  reading about the next incident. I didn't look forward to that, but it was sort  of on a regular basis. These things were popping up on Friday nights. That just  has no place in high school athletics. One of the primary functions for school  administrators, athletic directors and staff now is to look for possible  violence that could take place. And that takes away from the enjoyment of the  game.  </P> <P> Q. Is there anything the CIF can do to attack the violence at the source? Do  you know what the source is? What's causing the difference in attitude and  behavior?  </P> <P> A. Triggs: There are a number of reasons why this has come about. One has to do  with the interest. There's heightened interest on behalf of parents and  students in athletics. Then, our young people see things happening in the  college and professional ranks and think it's OK to do that at the high school  level.  </P> <P> Thirdly, there are fewer teachers in the officials pool of candidates. We went  through a declining mode in our school district; we went a number of years  where we hired no coaches or teachers. That has had a bearing on this. When you  bring in the walk-on (coaches), they're not trained in terms of working with  kids and that has contributed to this.  </P> <P> Davis: The (state) CIF would like to target the coaches. We have a proposed  certification program being discussed. It will help all people employed as  coaches to be prepared in working with youngsters in a healthy way -- in a  safe, caring environment. Part of the curriculum will be in crowd control,  youth psychology and teaching techniques that could assist the walk-ons in  particular.  </P> <P> Stan Thomas: The overriding response to the question rides with the role model  of the coaches. When you see coaches who are completely under control in the  most stressful and adverse conditions, so is their team. When you see coaches  who are yelling and screaming and challenging the officials, so is their team  and so is the crowd. . . . It all begins with the coach on the field and the  behavior that coach demonstrates to the players as well as the crowd. Any time  you have a riot, at least the ones we've dealt with this year, and we've had a  whole bunch of them, it generally became an issue where the coach lost control.  </P> <P> There lies the problem in my opinion.  </P> <P> . . . We need to have more instruction because we have fewer staff coaches and  more walk-on coaches than we ever (had). That trend isn't going to change, it's  going to get greater.  </P> <P> We are training coaches, and the training is outstanding. The best people are  being brought together through the auspices of the Amateur Athletic Foundation.  We are currently (partners) with them in a program that will include Los  Angeles City, San Diego, and the Southern Section in boys' and girls' soccer,  more than 700 schools. We've just completed a soccer program with more than 100  schools. We're entering a complete training program with boys' and girls' track  with more than 100 schools.  </P> <P> Q. Numerous incidents this year involved crowds. Is there anything you can do  to stop a crowd from getting out of hand before it happens, instead of reacting  to it?  </P> <P> A. Triggs: We'll (the Freeway League schools) have sessions in September  involving parents, students, activity directors in terms of better defining the  role that they play. The yell leaders have pretty much become performers. I  think they can play a very important part in crowd control along with our  campus supervisors and administrators and working with booster groups. It's a  perfect topic to have with them.  </P> <P> Q. What can be done about the declining number of officials? Does this pose a  significant problem?  </P> <P> A. Thomas: I can assure you without a question that the next major issue we're  going to deal with will be the officials. An official today is no longer the  school person who works all day and then goes out and does a game. It's the  other way around. Ninety percent of them used to be school people. Today, only  10% of them are school people. Ninety percent of our officials today are  firemen, lawyers, stockbrokers and salesmen.  </P> <P> They're (from) every walk of life, and they're starting to count on the money  that they earn as income in order to live. They're becoming a more militant  group of people within the Southern Section. I've already had two major escapes  with officials saying they were going to withhold services. When our next  negotiating contract comes up (this is the first of three years) our schools  have reached the level of payment that I think is fair, it's stretching their  (Associated Student Body) accounts.  </P> <P> Today we spend, in the Southern Section alone, $2.5 million a year just for the  services of officials. We're talking boys' and girls' (events). If you continue  to pay the officials the way we are now, you're going to have a lot of  officials. We have some shortages in some sports, we just need to separate the  days of the week for contests so we can maximize them. The hardest time to get  an official is in the afternoon.  </P> <P> Q. There are currently two measures in the state senate calling for wholesale  open enrollment throughout California. How would you see open enrollment  affecting sports?  </P> <P> A. Davis: I have a response from my boss (Tom Byrnes). He said the job of the  CIF is to adjust our program to what is best educationally. If open enrollment  is best, the CIF will adjust. He says, however, our legislative advocate has  made it clear to the authors of those two bills that the CIF's basic transfer  rule would be preserved. And should be preserved. And that nothing should  preclude the CIF from exercising its transfer rule.  </P> <P> Thomas: I would not perceive this to be something whereby a youngster would  play football at (school) A, move over and play basketball at B, then baseball  at C, then start that all over again.  </P> <P> Q. The public school vs. private school issue heated up again (April 26) at the  general council meeting. Is it inevitable that we will have a merger of the  public and private schools in 1992, in the next releaguing cycle, and do you  anticipate an outcry on the part of the public schools?  </P> <P> A. Triggs: The Orange County principals are pretty much in place in opposition  to that. And I don't see that changing in terms to their views.  </P> <P> Thomas: Throughout the Southern Section, we have every type of cross-section of  leaguing you can think of. We have public and Catholic. Catholic and public.  Private and public. We have every opportunity within the section to share what  is best.  </P> <P> Q. But we don't have that in Orange County. Why?  </P> <P> A. Triggs: There have been schools that have been in public leagues in Orange  County for a sport or two. So we have had relationships. It comes down to  football and basketball mainly -- that's what's at issue.  </P> <P> Davis: I just want to add that the trend in the state is to mix the schools.  </P> <P> Q. Do you think that's healthy?  </P> <P> A. Davis: Yes, I do, personally. Recently, the (North Coast Section) broke up  an all-Catholic league and mixed them up (with Public).  </P> <P> Q. We have a hard time seeing the public schools (in Orange County) welcoming  these schools with open arms. Aren't there going to be some lukewarm feelings?  </P> <P> A. Davis: Well, change does come hard. I think it will be worked out. It has  (been worked out) in other areas. The merger occurred. It seems to be working  now.  </P> <P> Q. Do you see the use of anabolic steroids as a major concern heading into the  '90s? Is there a chance drug testing will become a part of high school sports  the way it is with the NCAA and pro leagues?  </P> <P> A. Triggs: I think we'll see an increase in drug testing. Part of the problem  is the financing of it, especially the steroid test. You're talking about $85  per test. In our school district, the Fullerton district, we're considering  testing for next year. One of the things we're groping with is the financing of  it.  </P> <P> But there's an interest. Every school that's involved with it now sees it as a  deterrent. It's giving students an opportunity to say to their peers, "There's  a possibility I will be tested."  </P> <P> Q. Are you worried about the legal ramifications of drug testing?  </P> <P> A. Triggs: Yes. In fact, the testing companies have that same concern. The  schools that have become involved in voluntary testing have had little  involvement. It's voluntary, first of all. And secondly, the results are given  to the parent. The school has no involvement other than providing a program.  </P> <P> A. Thomas: Currently, we have schools testing on a voluntary basis. Fontana was  the exception, starting out on a mandatory program. A lawyer from the (American  Civil Liberties Union) came over and did a number on them.  </P> <P> I would predict, in the very near future, as soon as we get over this rights of  privacy, as soon as we can get past that, then I would think a legislator would  have some pretty good success mandating drug testing within high schools for  all activities.  </P> <P> It's done everywhere. It's done in college, pros, the federal government.  Almost everywhere we go today we see drug testing.  </P> <P> So we're getting to the point where rights of privacy are being set aside.  (High school athletics) is voluntary. You don't have to do it. If you want to  participate, you're going to be tested. It's a wonderful thing to have. It  could be a real deterrent to the drug problem.  </P> <P> (Drug abuse) is an issue, an issue we need not to turn our heads away from. An  issue we need to face squarely and deal with to try to correct it.  </P> <P> A. Davis: Our state executive council has targeted steroids as an issue of  major concern. Our medical adviser has already addressed the council at its  last meeting. He is currently studying an action plan. I would anticipate some  plan would come out (in the fall).  </P> <P> Q. Drug testing, where it exists, is voluntary and schools do not learn the  results but the parents do. What effect does this have?  </P> <P> A. Thomas: The key thing is, what I've been told -- and Edison is the primary  leader in this whole voluntary drug testing process -- the kids are so proud of  being clean they put it (their test results) right on the (Edison athletic  department) bulletin board. They take that thing when it comes back and says  "No Trace" and put it right on that bulletin board. And that puts a lot of  pressure on everybody else.  </P> <P> (They can say) "Where's yours? I want to see yours." Peer pressure is a  tremendous thing. It gives the kids a chance to say, "I might be tested." It  gives them an out. It's great.  </P> <P> Q. With congestion on the freeways, growth in the desert areas in Riverside and  San Bernardino counties, is the Southern Section too big? Isn't it time for a  change? Isn't it time to split it into smaller sections?  </P> <P> A. Thomas: Six or seven years ago, there was a consideration on the part of the  state to re-section. And a committee did an exhaustive study. And the vote was  close, but it was to maintain the status quo. That was probably the closest  we've come to it.  </P> <P> Q. Tom, why don't you explain what happened with a study undertaken by an  Orange County group? Tell us the positives and negatives of being part of a big  section.  </P> <P> A. Triggs: George Allen, the principal at Esperanza, chaired the group. We  brought the principals of Orange County together. There wasn't the support to  continue the study. The satisfaction with the current operation is there. I  would say the strong financial base of the Southern Section has a lot to do  with it. There are a lot of question marks if we had an Orange County Section  as far as the costs.  </P> <P> On the other side, and these are not necessarily my views, but they were  expressed, the concept of local control (is an issue). Another issue would be  the nature of Orange County and there is corporate sponsorship that would  assist. And the obvious one about congestion and transportation.  </P> <P> Q. It seems like a lot of problems are coming from summer sports competition  and the lack of control over same. There doesn't seem to be anyone who wants to  step forward and monitor it.  </P> <P> A. Thomas: Recently, a survey of all California superintendents was taken  requesting data on summer sports and one of the most interesting suggestions  was establishing a fourth season of sport. The CIF should take a hard look at a  fourth season. I know the state office is against that.  </P> <P> A. Triggs: I would like to cut the string for the summer. And that we have no  contact with the students and coaches. That would be my preference. I don't  think we need another season of sport. We see our young people being taxed now  in terms of what they're doing. Some youngsters participate in three sports and  their nights are tied up. And they're hitting the weights and I think that's an  overemphasis. There has to be a time for the family. I believe that so much.  There has to be a time for parents and children to have some time together. But  when they are driving their young person each night of the week to some type of  event dealing with athletics, we're a little off base.  </P> <P> Q. Don't you think coaches should say to parents, "Yes, you can take a summer  vacation and your kid will still have a chance to play on the team next  season"?  </P> <P> A. Triggs: I think we have coaches that are saying that. I would say most  coaches are saying that. The problem we have is when we have a three-sport  athlete, who is having to make decisions, which is hard. I have a lot of  trouble with the summer situation because I've seen what has happened to  families. When a young person enters high school, many parents strongly feel  their son (or daughter) is going to get an athletic scholarship. And that (the  earning of the scholarship) is going to be the solution to all the problems in  this family.  </P> <P> Q. Isn't there something wrong when summer basketball people are paid high  amounts of money from athletic shoe companies at the cost to a lot of families'  time?  </P> <P> A. Thomas: We have, in Orange County right now, several schools who will  compete, say, in the sport of basketball in the summer in excess of 40  contests. Our rule of (regular) season contests is 20. They will more than  double the number of contests because there are no limitations. I think of all  the sports, basketball is the biggest abuser. There are so many tournaments and  so many games. And, it's not a casual pickup game where you have fun. Winning  is important. Losing is not accepted.  </P> <P> The same with some people who get into these crazy (football) passing leagues.  It becomes almost like a league contest. And I know some of the best football  coaches in our section -- Dick Bruich out at Fontana, Ted Mullen, who used to  be here in Orange County -- their summer activity in football was laid-back.  Dick Bruich won't go to a passing league. Ted Mullen won't go to a passing  league. These people are as good coaches as the Southern Section has ever  produced. We have others that are going two and three times a week. And the  kids are getting hurt.  </P> <P> Somewhere we have to say enough is enough and bring it back to a position where  it's best for our kids.  </P> <P> Q. But you understand the rationale of coach A, who says if I'm not doing it  and coach B is, then he has a competitive edge?  </P> <P> A. Thomas: But Bruich disproves that theory. Bruich's idea of a summer program  is to lift (weights) and to get to know everyone. If he gets through the summer  on that basis, he's achieved his goal. Then he goes out and kicks everyone's  butt.  </P> <P> It's a craziness. I don't subscribe to that philosophy that we have to compete  during the summer in order to be the best in the fall. There's more to life  than first and 10. You do have to put it into perspective. It's up to us to  give that direction, I think.  </P></p>

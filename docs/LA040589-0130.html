			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DISPUTED HOMER GIVES EDISON 1-0 VICTORY  </P> <P> Ocean View High School pitcher Mike Karpel gave up only one hit Tuesday, but  the hit -- Jason Serafin's disputed home run -- was all Edison needed to score  a 1-0 Sunset League baseball victory at Edison.  </P> <P> With two outs in the bottom of the fourth inning, Serafin lined a pitch off a  tree branch that hangs over the left-center field fence near the 375-foot sign.  After first deciding that Serafin's hit was a ground-rule double (the ball  bounced back onto the field), the umpire changed his mind and ruled the hit a  homer.  </P> <P> The umpire's reversal angered Ocean View Coach Steve Barrett, who was ejected  from the game for disputing the call.  </P> <P> "The ball hit a tree branch that hangs 15 feet over the fence, and that  prevented my center fielder (John Arnold) from being able to play the ball,"  Barrett said. "(Edison Coach Paul Harrell) didn't bring up what happens when  balls hit that tree during the pregame meeting, and the umpire was going to  rule that hit a double before (Harrell) pressured him into giving (Serafin) a  home run.  </P> <P> "It was a mistake for Paul Harrell not to bring up the tree before the game,  and you would have thought that they were going to bring it up during the  pregame discussions because of it hanging over the field."  </P> <P> Said Harrell: "I didn't bring up the tree before the game, but still, there was  no way anyone was going to catch that ball because it was a line shot that was  going over the fence when it hit the tree."  </P> <P> Serafin's hit supported the four-hit pitching of J.J. Thobe (2-1), who survived  a sixth-inning scare to record the victory.  </P> <P> With the bases loaded and two outs, Edison left fielder Brian Higgins made a  lunging, backhanded catch of Mike Burns' sinking line drive to deny Ocean View  (11-4, 3-1) a chance to take the lead.  </P> <P> Before Serafin's homer, Edison (5-6-2, 2-2) could get only one baserunner off  Karpel (1-2) -- when Higgins reached second on shortstop Daniel Hernandez's  throwing error in the first. After the homer, Karpel retired the last seven  batters.  </P> <P> "J.J. didn't have his best stuff today, but he was able to get the ball in good  positions, and the kids made some good defensive plays to back him up," Harrell  said.  </P> <P> "(Higgins' catch) was the play of the game," Barrett said. "Without that catch,  we would have won the game. We had other situations when we had guys in scoring  positions, but we couldn't cash them in, and you can't win games unless you  cash in on your opportunities."  </P> <P> In other Sunset League games:  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 7, Marina 5 -- Fountain Valley trailed, 5-1, but scored six  runs in the top of the sixth for the victory. Steve Grack had a two-run single  in the inning, but Fountain Valley (8-4, 3-1) also benefited from three Marina  errors. Grack had two hits and three RBIs. Don Cossett (2-0) pitched one inning  in relief for the victory. Mark Newfield had a two-run homer in the fourth for  Marina (2-2 in league play).  </P> <P> Westminster 7, Huntington Beach 3 -- The Lions took advantage of nine walks and  five Huntington Beach errors for the victory at Huntington Beach. Ryan Klesko  had a two-run homer for Westminster. He also walked three times, stole two  bases and scored three runs. Brent Heredia went two for three with an RBI for  the Lions.  </P> <P> In the Century League:  </P> <P> El Modena 4, Santa Ana 2 -- The Vanguards broke a 2-2 tie in the bottom of the  fifth. Consecutive singles by Matt Newbrand and Jason Wakefield and a walk to  Marcus Esposito loaded the bases. Graham Brown then grounded out, scoring  Newbrand to give El Modena (5-6, 3-1) a 3-2 lead. Mike Vermillion hit a solo  home run in the sixth to give the Vanguards a 4-2 lead. Bobby Reimers had three  hits and two RBIs for Santa Ana (7-7, 2-2).  </P> <P> Villa Park 4, Foothill 3 -- Gary Stephens walked with the bases loaded in the  bottom of the seventh to force in the winning run for Villa Park (7-7, 2-2).  Villa Park took a 1-0 lead in the second on an RBI single by Gary Bladow.  Foothill (9-5, 3-1) scored three runs in the third, two on a double by Kent  Donnelly. Stephens hit a solo home run in the third to pull the Spartans within  one run, 3-2. Villa Park tied the score in the fifth on an error.

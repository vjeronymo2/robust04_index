			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry said Tuesday [17 May] it has  formulated a set of bills to ease government regulatory controls.    The nine bills, likely to be approved by the cabinet Friday,  are in line with the government's emergency economic stimulus  packages announced in September last year and February this  year, MITI said.    Among other things, the bills are aimed at the scrapping of  obligatory reporting by companies of the formation of export  associations, the removal of mandatory antidecay treatment for  lumber to allow for more efficient lumber use, and freer  creation of chambers of commerce and industry.    The bills will be submitted to the current Diet sitting  along  with 31 other deregulation bills drawn up by other ministries,  MITI said.    In a related move, MITI said Tuesday it will set up next  Monday offices to receive public complaints, requests and  opinions on MITI's deregulation steps.    The offices, to be created in MITI's Tokyo headquarters and  its local units in Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya and six other major  cities, will be open from Monday through Friday each week, MITI  said.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Unions call for Birt to resign BBC UNIONS yesterday called for the resignation of Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, and Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the corporation. The demands were made at a meeting with BBC management and follow the revelation that from 1987 until this week Mr Birt had been paid as a freelance consultant through his private company, John Birt Productions. At the meeting with Mrs Margaret Salmon, the BBC's director of personnel, Mr Roger Bolton, the chief negotiator of Bectu, the broadcasting union, said staff had been outraged by the damage caused to the corporation's reputation by the revelation. 'The corporation has lost the moral authority it needs to report on news and current affairs and deserves no respect from either press or politicians,' Mr Bolton said. The representatives from Bectu, the National Union and Journalists and the AEEU electricians' union also asked the BBC to confirm that the corporation provides Mr Birt with two cars, one chauffeur-driven and another for private use, and that it also reimburses costs incurred when he attends public functions. The unions said Mrs Salmon had replied that she needed time to consider the question. The BBC had no comment to make on the views of the unions last night. Tax vehicles, Weekend VI</p>

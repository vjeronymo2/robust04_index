			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): 'An entire organisation focused on the market' - Independent Insurance / The winner of a CIM award Four years ago, Allstate Insurance, the US group, sold its general insurance business in the UK for Pounds 6m to a group of investors called New Scotland Insurance. Allstate's business in the UK had never got off the ground. It had been making losses since 1982 and required regular capital injections amounting to more than Pounds 21m to maintain solvency margins. In 1986 it made a Pounds 1.6m loss on premium income of Pounds 27m. This week, the business, renamed Independent Insurance, reported 1990 profits of Pounds 8.5m on premium income of Pounds 80.1m, its fourth successive year of increased profit amid a generally grim industry performance. The company's transformation has been achieved - according to the Chartered Institute of Marketing when it was presented yesterday with a 1991 national marketing award* - because of its 'ability to focus its entire organisation towards the marketplace'. When Michael Bright, deputy chairman and managing director of Independent, arrived from Lombard Continental in 1987 to establish a senior management team, he found confusion among staff about corporate objectives. There was no marketing department and only a limited product range; no formal staff appraisal, training or development programmes. Staff morale was low and turnover high. Bright immediately brought in Robert McCracken, a Lombard colleague and marketing professional, to establish a marketing department. A detailed corporate plan was set out - backed with research carried out by the marketing department as well as outside agencies. The prime objective was to establish the company within five years as a distinctive and professional organisation in the highly competitive general insurance sector: 'A long-term player with a consistent approach and something special to offer,' says Bright. Two ways of gaining competitive advantage were identified. Research confirmed that the overall service provided to brokers - the intermediaries through which Independent intended to channel its business - was generally poor. So high quality service was to be an essential part of the strategy. Cost advantages were to be achieved by improving underwriting practice to reduce the ratio of claims to policies; and by cutting administrative expenses through extensive and efficient automation. With the company's objectives and strategy laid down, the first priority was to communicate them to its staff. Morale had to be rebuilt, motivation renewed, and the business focus switched to the market. Initial presentations to all staff, backed up with a booklet, set out the changes being made and where the company was going. They were given detailed information on the company's structure, underwriting philosophy, marketing approach and personnel policies. Regular briefings by management and the establishment of a staff magazine followed. Employees were invited to join in a competition to find a new name for the company. Independent Insurance was launched, with the logo of a high-flying kite. A formal personnel policy was adopted. Recruitment procedures were tightened. The emphasis of pay policy was switched to rewards for results. A staff appraisal system was introduced, mainly to identify training requirements. A training department was set up and formal courses begun in management development, supervisory skills, communication, and customer care. Alongside these internal efforts to give the company a new sense of purpose and direction, work also began on implementing the external marketing strategy. Independent had inherited a panel of almost 10,000 agents. It rapidly became clear that this was a costly and inefficient set-up. Many agents produced little business and dismal levels of profitability. 'The company looked to deal only with those that were highly professional, whose business ideas were similar to our own, and who had good relations with their own clients,' says Kevin Pallett, marketing manager. Unprofitable accounts were closed immediately. Further weeding has now reduced the agency base to 3,200 - classified according to the type and quality of the business they handle, and their potential growth. Independent sought to establish closer relationships with about 150 brokers within this total. They were identified as having the best potential for profitable development of commercial business. 'These brokers are the most professional in the way they present risks to us,' says Pallett. 'Fire risks are obviously great in plastics manufacturing, for instance. But the risks are much lower in a company whose management has adopted a proper safety policy. These brokers provide us with that sort of information.' Independent Club was formed to provide the brokers with a range of benefits and incentives in return. They are given a higher commission and participate in profit-sharing schemes. They are given round-the-clock access to Independent's staff; their mail and computer records are coded to identify them as priority customers. In some of Independent's regional offices, special units were established dealing exclusively with club brokers. Independent offers free training for brokers' staff on its courses; and its marketing department supports them in direct mail campaigns, advertising, exhibitions and the production of sales brochures. Assured of the brokers' expertise, Independent was able to launch new products exclusively through them - policies to cover high risk businesses such as jewellers and demolition contractors. Independent claims brokers had never before been offered such a comprehensive package. Since its launch, the club partnership has been reinforced through a regular newsletter, weekend entertainments, and senior management get-togethers. The marketing initiative has paid off. Premiums from club brokers increased from Pounds 2m in 1988 to Pounds 11.2m in 1989. Two-thirds of all new commercial business, and a quarter of all premium income, now comes from club members; and it results in relatively fewer claims. The claims ratio on club business is 37.8 per cent against a company average of 47.9 per cent. The success of this initiative led Independent to launch another scheme, Merit, for the best of its brokers dealing with home and motor insurance. Some 500 initially joined. They were offered exclusive products - such as policies targeted on low-risk and high-risk drivers  - and given greater authority to quote premiums and speed the settlement of claims. Backed by Independent's general marketing support, these brokers found themselves better equipped to face the intense competition in their sector. Independent was repaid with a doubling of new business proposals between 1989 and 1990; and with an increase in retained business from 70 per cent to 80 per cent. Costs also fell as more business came from the more professional brokers. In 1988, almost half of proposal forms had to be returned to brokers because of inadequate information. The proportion has now fallen to 25 per cent. Independent has backed the marketing thrust through the brokers with a wide range of other promotional activity. It has designed simpler proposal forms, and introduced its products through wittily-illustrated brochures. Its salesforce has been increased fourfold and is supported by telemarketing. Advertising and public relations are focused on raising the company's image within the industry. Sponsorship - of school sports and other activities in its Cheshire base - is used almost solely as an aid to recruitment. Independent's overall approach had resulted in 'an impressive study of profitable growth and customer satisfaction,' Sir Patrick Meaney, president of the CIM, concluded yesterday. *CIM national marketing awards: Category 1 (turnover over Pounds 50m) Independent Insurance Co; Category 2 (turnover Pounds 10m-Pounds 50m) Astracast; Category 3 (turnover up to Pounds 10m) Edinburgh Bicycle Co-operative.</p>

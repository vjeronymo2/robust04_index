			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The governing coalition on  Tuesday [12 April] took a step toward averting a split over the  picking of a successor to departing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, top coalition officials said.    "I'm pretty sure we can solve our problems to maintain and  develop our coalition government," Social Democratic Party (SDP)  Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference.    Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa, a top coalition strategist, also told reporters,  "everything is going in the right direction," in a reference to  the bickering among coalition partners over procedures to choose  a replacement for Hosokawa.    At a session of their caucus on Tuesday evening, coalition  executives concurred on the need to work out differences between  them and coalition party leaders on the succession procedures,  Kubo said. The top coalition officials will meet again on  Wednesday morning to discuss the matter further, he said, adding  he believes they can get down to the nitty-gritty of picking a  candidate for the premiership from Wednesday.    While new party Sakigake (Harbinger), the Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP) and the SDP favor the selection of a new  premier at a forum of coalition chiefs, Shinseito, Komeito and  Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) contend the secretary  general-level caucus should first discuss the matter.    Hosokawa, who remains in office until his successor is  picked, had asked the coalition executives' forum to take charge  of the selection business.    Earlier Tuesday, leaders of four coalition components met  for  a second time since Monday and shared the view that coalition  chiefs should first discuss how to choose a candidate for the  next premiership.    The four were Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura of  Sakigake, Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi of the DSP,  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Eiichi Nakamura of the  Democratic Reform Party, a small parliamentary group in the  House of Councillors.    Murayama twice proposed holding a meeting of coalition  chiefs, once on Monday and again on Tuesday, to break the  gridlock over the choice of a new premier, which poses a threat  to the unity within the eight-month-old coalition. But leaders  of four coalition partners -- Shinseito, Komeito, the JNP and  the United Social Democratic Party -- rejected the bid and  boycotted the two sessions.    The row over the procedures to find Hosokawa's replacement  clearly revealed the deep gulf between the moderate-to-leftist  Sakigake-DSP-SDP bloc and the more conservative  Shinseito-Komeito camp over political philosophies and some  fundamental national policies.    The known personal rivalry between Shinseito's Ozawa and  Sakigake chief Takemura has also fueled the coalition's  polarization into two blocs.    While hoping to install Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who  heads Shinseito, as the new premier, the latter alliance has  also been considering fielding former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as a  candidate to succeed Hosokawa.    Watanabe, whose close personal relationship with Ozawa is no  secret, has signaled his readiness to run for the highest  government office.    The Shinseito-Komeito bloc would give the boot to the SDP,  the largest coalition contingent whose basic policies are still  far apart from those of other coalition partners, should  Watanabe decide to quit the LDP with a large number of his  followers and join a part of the coalition, political sources  said.    The ex-foreign minister said Tuesday he wishes to run for  the  premiership, "with an irreversible determination," even by  launching a new party, said Seiichi Ota, a close associate of  Watanabe.    While Watanabe's supporters are waging a campaign to have  their boss selected as the LDP's candidate for the premiership,  LDP President Yohei Kono himself vowed Tuesday to run in the  parliamentary election to pick Hosokawa's successor.    The two men will meet Wednesday to exchange views on the  selection of a replacement for Hosokawa, party officials said.    Sakigake, for its part, also showed interest in forming a  tie-up with pro-reformers within the LDP, which was ousted from  power last August for the first time in 38 years. Sakigake is  an LDP breakaway party.    As the possibility increased of neither of the two plans  bearing fruit, however, the squabbling coalition parties began  moving to mend fences and maintain the current framework of  their alliance.    "We faced a problem concerning the basis of the coalition  this time," Kubo said. "I believe the coalition will grow  solidified by overcoming problems like this."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a swift and urgent retaliation to the brutal  operations carried out by the forces of tyrant Saddam in the  marshes of southern Iraq, the Islamic resistance forces launched  a series of heroic attacks against the regime's forces and  oppressive establishments in al-Nasiriyah Governorate late last  month. The resistance operations followed a brutal attack  launched by the regime.    Our sources in the governorate said an Islamic resistance  group directed a destructive blow to the al-Nasiriyah Security  Directorate. Mortar shells were used in the attack, which  damaged [words indistinct] near the governorate office. Four  members of the governorate office, including two officers, were  killed. At the same time, the Islamic resistance directed a  painful blow to one of the offices of the ruling party in  al-Nasiriyah, known as the al- Muthanna branch. Three criminals  were killed and a number of others were injured. Another  Islamic resistance group delivered a devastating blow to a  security center in the city of al-Bakr, north of al-Nasiriyah.  Six regime members were injured and massive material damage was  inflicted on the center.    Our sources noted panic among the regime agents. The  authorities almost completely closed off the entrances to  al-Nasiriyah, isolating the governorate from the other southern  and central governorates. Searches, raids, and arrests of  citizens were launched and the regime forces were put on maximum  alert.</p>

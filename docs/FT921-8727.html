			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / How to see the future with an uncommon touch: Dominic Lawson reveals that unlike most political pundits his omniscience is limited by his lifestyle I WAS greatly relieved to read a few days ago in Peter Jenkins' column in The Independent that 'John Major is intending to announce the dissolution of Parliament the very day after the March 10 Budget. Polling day, as widely predicted, would be 9 April.' Over the past few weeks people have kept coming up to me asking me when Major will dissolve Parliament and declare an election date, and what that date will be, and for some reason I have not always found it easy to give the honest answer, 'I don't know.' For some reason the Prime Minister has seen fit not to entrust me with his greatest secret and if he had, I would not reveal it exclusively to you. But now all that is unnecessary. Jenkins has spoken, and so sure of this intelligence are his employers that they placed his revelatory column right across the front page, with a photograph of the famous columnist looking believable. Unfortunately my relief, now that Jenkins has lifted the burden off my, and John Major's shoulders, has been short lived. For over the following two days I have been assailed by a new and different question. It is 'Who is going to win the General Election?' I suppose I could say to these inquisitive people: 'Wait until Mr Jenkins has given his forecast. Peter, I assure you, has his finger on the popular pulse,' but for some reason I do not think this passing of the buck will impress my interlocutors. The trouble is that, unlike almost all of the political commentators of our great quality national newspapers, I am not in touch with the people. I know that Peter Riddell of The Times is a keen and well-travelled pub darts player, and thus encounters all walks of life in our nation of beer drinkers. I know that the FT's own Joe Rogaly is to be found every Saturday in the stands behind the goal at the Den, Millwall's charming football ground, where he enthusiastically acquaints himself with the moods and prejudices of the proletariat, who, after all, make up the bulk of the electorate. The Guardian's Hugo Young gains his invaluable insight into the mind of the people thanks to his 20-year long enthusiasm for the sport of all-in wrestling. He is there at all the big bouts, tapping in to the urban subculture. And of course Peter Jenkins' long involvement in 'hot rod' stock car racing in Essex means he is never far removed from the people so snootily described by advertisers as C2s, Ds and Es. But I am afraid that I cannot boast of any such intimate acquaintance with the popular mind. Unlike these people, I am cosseted by company cars and so rarely mix with ordinary folk on buses and underground trains. And my lunches are not spent in pubs rubbing shoulders with the heart of England. Unlike the leading political pundits I seem to spend most of my time, and expense account, talking with other journalists or men from Whitehall. There was a time when I thought that, despite all this, I was well qualified to express opinions on 'what people think' or 'what the average person is saying.' But one day I made some such remark to a friend of mine, a general practitioner who works in one of the biggest and least lovely of our inner city hospitals. He laughed derisively. 'Dominic,' he said, 'people like you have never even made the acquaintance of anyone of average intelligence, let alone found out what he thinks.' When I want to know which party is likely to win the General Election - whenever it happens - I shall consult my friend the general practitioner. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY BOYS' TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> MAGNOLIA'S SINGBANDITH SETS MEET RECORD IN LONG JUMP  </P> <P> Phouphot Singbandith of Magnolia High School broke the meet record in the long  jump with a leap of 22 feet 10 inches Saturday in the Orange County Boys' Track  and Field Championships at Rancho Santiago College.  </P> <P> "I thought it was maybe a 48 (in the triple jump)," said Singbandith, who was  given the field athlete of the meet award for his performances. "My previous  best was 47."  </P> <P> So he was off by a couple of feet. The next best triple jump mark of 46-10 1/2  was recorded by Esperanza's Clayton Tharrington.  </P> <P> He also came within a half-inch of tying the county record in the triple jump  with a leap of 50-3. Ken Williams of Troy set the record in 1982.  </P> <P> The meet team championship was decided by just one point as Capistrano Valley  staved off a late charge by Woodbridge, 63-62. Edison finished third with 40  points and Esperanza was fourth with 35.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley led by as much as 20 points early in the meet as it won the  400-meter relay with a time of 42.4 seconds and the 1600 with Neal Stevenson's  4 minutes, 23.07 second effort.  </P> <P> But Woodbridge pulled to 47-45 after Chad McHenry won the 300-meter hurdles  with a time of 39.16. Capistrano Valley expected to gain a better advantage in  the 200-meters, where the Eagles' Joe White was favored to win, but Canyon's  Jerrard Bryant won it with a time of 21.98. White finished second in 22.30.  </P> <P> Bryant also defeated White in the 400-meters by one-one hundredth of a second  -- 49.52 to White's 49.53.  </P> <P> Woodbridge won the 3,200 relay (3:24.18) and Capistrano Valley finished second  (3:27.81) to put the Eagles in front, 63-56, with the triple jump and pole  vault left.  </P> <P> Scott Capulong finished fifth (two points) in the triple jump to pull  Woodbridge to 63-58.  </P> <P> That meant a third by Woodbridge in the pole vault would give it the  championship if Capistrano Valley didn't place.  </P> <P> The Eagles didn't place, but Graham Heppensdall finished fourth (13-6),  allowing Capistrano Valley to win by the one-point margin.  </P> <P> "Well, it was certainly interesting," said Capistrano Valley coach Tom White.  "But a championship is a championship and we'll be proud to to take this one."  </P> <P> "We have some team depth and we were pleased with the whole team's  performance."  </P> <P> Woodbridge did have the track athlete of the meet in Louie Muniz.  </P> <P> Muniz won the 110 hurdles with a time of 15.09 and the 300 hurdles with a time  of 39.16.  </P></p>

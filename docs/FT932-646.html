			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Transatlantic prices are an ocean apart / A look at why many items cost less in the US even after sterling's devaluation last autumn - so many things cost less over there than at home. Late last year McKinsey, the international management consultancy, set out to answer the question by analysing the main factors which determine retail prices on either side of the Atlantic. Armed with a shopping list of 268 similar products, McKinsey compared prices at outlets in the London and Chicago areas. It found that on average prices were 31.7 per cent higher after tax in Britain than in the US. The difference was calculated when the pound was worth Dollars 1.60, and would be nearer 22 per cent at today's exchange rate. Even so, some individual examples remain striking. Frozen chickens cost four times more per pound in Britain than in the US, while some DIY items were three times dearer. About 50 products were cheaper in the UK. Many of these were British or other European brands, such as Laura Ashley, Body Shop, Benetton and Jaeger. But Heinz baked beans, of which Britain is traditionally world champion consumer, also cost 35 per cent less than in the US, where Heinz has its headquarters. An analysis of retailers' cost structures identified four main reasons why prices were often higher in Britain than in the US - although their relative importance varied widely between products. The four factors are tax, property costs, productivity and trade prices. Britain's 17.5 per cent value added tax, charged on most products except food, baby clothes and a few other items, is more than double the 7.25 per cent sales tax in the Chicago area. The study found tax accounted for half of the 24 per cent difference in the price of a pair of cotton briefs and for more than a third of the 29 per cent difference in the price of a Walkman compact disc player. However, tax was responsible for as little as one sixth of the price differentials for doughnuts, ice-cream and hamburgers sold in fast-food outlets. Yet these were found to cost between 48 per cent and 112 per cent more in Britain than in the US. Prime retail selling space cost only a third as much in the US as in Britain. That was one of the main reasons for the higher UK prices of fast food and clothing and was particularly important for department stores. However, it accounted for a smaller proportion of the price differentials on electrical and DIY goods. Dearer space costs explained only a quarter of the 63 per cent difference in the retail price of a standard 16ft ladder. On average, retailers' productivity was 23 per cent higher in the US than in Britain, reflecting lower wage costs and higher sales per employee. US stores generally were more advanced in their use of automation, although in many sectors sales per square foot of store space were comparable with the UK. Profitability varied widely across sectors, but was often higher at the level of the individual store in the US than in Britain. The main exception was grocery retailing, where UK supermarkets had higher returns on sales and capital than US chains, as well as bigger sales per square foot and per employee. However, the study says these advantages would not be large enough to safeguard UK supermarkets' profitability if their prices fell to US levels. If that happened, they would show an average 20 per cent negative return on capital, compared with a recent average 27 per cent positive return. The prices at which US retailers purchased many products were found to be lower than in Britain. The study found particularly big differences in DIY products, electrical goods and food. The Common Agricultural Policy helps to hold up the price of food in the UK. The ingredients for one mass-market line of grocery products cost 37 per cent more in Britain than in the US, where manufacturing costs were also lower. Together, these two factors contributed to a UK trade price 23 per cent higher than in the US. McKinsey also believes that the prices of some products, such as camcorders, home computers and software for video games, are higher in Britain because a less mature market has enabled manufacturers to earn fatter profit margins. Other reasons for transatlantic price differentials are American consumers' traditionally greater emphasis on price and comparative shopping, and the greater diversity of retail outlets in the US, where the industry is less concentrated than in Britain. The study found prices of the same products varied much more widely around Chicago than London but McKinsey says that when comparing UK and US prices it was careful to ensure that the types of store surveyed in each country were similar. Some reasons for transatlantic price differentials, such as tax levels and the cost of prime retail space, are deep-rooted and unlikely to change quickly. However, the study argues that Britain will be increasingly influenced by competitive trends from across the Atlantic, notably the growth of discount stores and greater price sensitivity among consumers. That could require big adjustments by established chains. The study says: 'UK retailers will have to bring their costs and productivity more into line with those of their US counterparts to avoid a sharp decline in profitability.'

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Arts: The Elephant - Theatre In Hampstead, the young Wave Theatre Company have inaugurated what they hope will be a continuing series of modern Japanese plays in translation. Their first choice is Betsuyaku Minoru's The Elephant, a piece written 30 years ago about people who survived the Hiroshima blast, only to succumb long afterward to radiation sickness. Most of it is set in a hospital, which makes the little theatre in the New End Hospital a specially suitable venue. On the face of it, the English version by David G. Goodman sounds plausible enough - but the manners of the play remain desperately obscure. Perhaps the English is too plausible, for the cast treat their roles as familiar British types: Jonathan Coyne plays the dying uncle, the 'Invalid', like a broad Jewish comic, and one bizarre scene of casual murder comes out of undergraduate revue. It becomes impossible to guess which of Minoru's fancies are intended to be surrealist, and which other puzzles are the results of severe cultural dislocation. Nothing in the play seems to explain its title - unless the 'elephant' is the uncle himself, weirdly proud of the 'keloid' on his back, a carapace of scar tissue. The dialogue is full of sub-Ionesco repetitions: is that a device, or just Japanese naturalism? The theme of The Elephant is plain enough, a confrontation between the indomitable (and indomitably foolish) Invalid and his nephew 'Man' (Alex Harland), who prefers to suffer quietly and passively. Until the last half-hour or so, at least: then, an endlessly recycled screaming-match between them becomes actively unpleasant. Tim Keenan's production looks smooth enough, and the young actors playing older roles do their best; but this is a case of East meeting West with a dull thud.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, April 12 (AFP) -- European Union [EU]  fisheries ministers agreed here Tuesday [12 April] to apply  stricter controls on fish imports, mainly from Russian,  Ukrainian and Polish ships, in a bid to combat a glut of cheap  foreign fish.    A majority of countries overruled objections from Britain,  Denmark and the Netherlands that tighter controls were  protectionist and unnecessary.    The new regulations, due to come into effect on May 15,  provide that the fish from foreign boats can be off-loaded only  at designated ports where they can be subjected to EU health and  veterinary controls.    The imported fish will also have to be sold at prices which  do not under-cut minimum levels set each year by the EU or by  producer organisations at the port of entry. The new rules do  not apply to fish imports for processing plants.</p>

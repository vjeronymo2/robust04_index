			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (7): Record inflows - Foreign investment has revitalised Setubal FOREIGN investment has helped to transform the port of Setubal, 40 kilometres south of Lisbon, from a depressed shipbuilding town to the bustling heart of a new industrial region. American golfers from local car companies are a familiar sight, where less than a decade ago unemployed workers were queueing outside soup kitchens. Officials are trying to bring a similar transformation to the crisis-hit region of Vale do Ave, in northern Portugal, where the government estimates that as many as 45,000 jobs could be lost by 2000, as textile, clothing and footwear companies succumb to increased competition. 'Our aim is to attract foreign and domestic investment to the Vale do Ave, so that the industrial and social map of the region can be changed in the same way that investment helped bring new hope and a future to the Setubal area,' says Miguel Athayde Marques, president of the Portuguese Foreign Trade Institute (ICEP), which is also responsible for foreign investment. Attracted mainly by low costs, a competitive labour force and high incentives, foreign investment has flooded into the Setubal region over the past six years. Workers shed by the shipbuilding and heavy-engineering industries can now find jobs at high-technology plants such Ford Electronics, Delco Remy ignition systems and Valmet tractors. But the impact of foreign investment on the Setubal area will not reach its peak for another three years, when an Es450bn (Dollars 3.2bn) Ford-Volkswagen plant, the biggest foreign investment ever made in Portugal, will begin production of a five-door, seven-seat multipurpose vehicle. The coveted Ford-VW project helped to bring total foreign investment in Portugal up to a record Es799bn last year, a 67 per cent increase on 1990. This includes only shareholders' capital; overall investment in a total of 3,000 projects was above Es1,000bn. The annual rate of foreign investment has grown a remarkable 37-fold since Portugal joined the EC in 1986. 'Investments like the Ford-VM project don't come along every day,' says Mr Athayde Marques, 'but we will be happy if we can maintain foreign investment in 1992 at the 1990 level of Es479bn.' Lisbon newspapers are already reporting two big potential foreign investment projects for the Vale do Ave area: a Samsung semi-conductor plant, involving an investment of Es60bn and 600 jobs; and a Nokia project to produce televisions and computer monitors, involving an investment of Es10bn. Officials prefer not to comment on such reports, but they are confident that the region will prove attractive. 'Companies will find ready-trained workforces that can be easily adapted to new skills through vocational training,' says Mr Athayde Marques. 'There are also industrial plants ready for adaptation, as well as green-field sites and good infrastructures that are constantly being improved.' Special EC-financed incentives will be available for investment in the area, under a programme known as Sindave. Grants will cover 75 per cent of viable projects. Tax incentives and venture-capital funds will also be on offer. These incentives are additional to Portugal's intrinsic attractions to investors. Mr Athayde Marques sees the country as a low-cost centre offering competitive productivity and direct access to the EC's affluent consumers. 'It's a question of good value for money, rather than being cheap or expensive,' he says. 'On top of this, Portugal enjoys political stability and labour peace, with less than half the EC average for days lost through strikes.' Given Portugal's low unemployment rate and the need to diversify and modernise industry, concern is being shown about the quality, rather than the size, of foreign investment projects. Broadly speaking, for projects of less than Es10bn, incentives are awarded automatically according to a points system, regardless of whether the project is foreign or Portuguese. Above that level, a contractual system applies, under which the authorities take into account: The extent to which the project introduces new technology and upgrades the labour-force through vocational training; The export content of the project, and the extent to which it will help reduce the trade deficit; and The extent to which the project will be anchored in the community, in terms of up-stream and downstream links. Stand-alone projects that could facilitate future disinvestment will be at a disadvantage. In assessing potential investment, the authorities first look at an investment banker's business plan for the financial and strategic aspects of the project. They want to know the forecast internal rate of return, the risks involved, and how those risks can be hedged. They also consider how the project fits in with the company's global strategy. A crucial condition will be that projects must be profitable in themselves, and not depend on the award of incentives for their viability. A further examination will be made of the impact of the project in regional and national terms. It should also have a positive effect on trade and foreign-exchange balances.</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN AND THE HOUR MEET IN BENNETT;  </P> <P> HIP MAVERICK TAKES OVER IN NATION'S WAR ON DRUGS  </P> <P> Back in 1967, as the waves of student unrest and the counterculture broke over  the campus of the University of Texas, a graduate student named William J.  Bennett cut a memorable figure at philosophy department parties.  </P> <P> He would down a few Lone Star beers, squash his cigarette and pick up a guitar.  The music was the Animals' classic, "House of the Rising Sun," but the words  were the opening lines of "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" -- the seminal  discourse by Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.  </P> <P> "The world is all that is the case," Bennett would warble, parroting the  abstruse propositions all philosophy students were required to read. " . . .  The world of facts, not things."  </P> <P> Elsewhere on campus, the smell of marijuana and strains of acid rock served  notice that the times were changing. Long hair was hip. So were sandals and  psychedelic drugs.  </P> <P> Austin was the wintering place for San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury. And nowhere  was that influence so evident as in Nueces House, a "pre-hippie" student co-op  whose 23-year-old graduate supervisor would one day be tapped as the nation's  first drug czar.  </P> <P> Yet where his peers saw creative, mind-expanding possibilities in drugs, or at  least harmless fun, Bennett saw something disturbing. Following the lead of a  moralistic faculty mentor, he clung conspicuously to the earlier symbols of  rebellion -- beer and cigarettes, motorcycles and rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> Two decades before Nancy Reagan's campaign, say those who knew him then, Bill  Bennett shunned drugs and what they stood for. Today, with national attitudes  swinging sharply away from the permissiveness of the 1970s and President Bush  vowing to lift the scourge of narcotics, the man and the hour seem to have met  in Bennett.  </P> <P> Selected over candidates with extensive law enforcement experience, he embodies  what is expected to be the central theme of the new Administration: the  argument that strength of character and individual willpower may be more potent  than police work in the war against drugs.  </P> <P> From today's vantage point, Bennett's record -- the party-loving "regular guy"  whose regard for moral conduct and abiding ambition caused him to avoid even  marijuana while a student -- provides a fitting biography for an anti-drug  chieftain.  </P> <P> In the Cabinet-level post, created by a frustrated Congress to make one person  accountable, Bennett is to knit together the federal government's fragmented  anti-drug efforts and coordinate the work of more than a dozen departments and  agencies. He will deal with everything from military interdiction and  intelligence to drug testing of air traffic controllers and admonishing  children in federal schools on the dangers of drugs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exhort, Command  </P> <P> He is expected to exhort as well as command -- providing inspiration that might  curb the nation's demand for narcotics.  </P> <P> In that regard, those who remember Bennett less than fondly call attention to  another side to his credentials.  </P> <P> Resident for more than a decade on campuses that were the laboratories of  change, Bennett came ultimately to regard himself as an embodiment of the "true  counterculture," his friends say -- a lone voice against a misguided chorus.  </P> <P> As such, he was resented by some for what they saw as his intolerance.  </P> <P> Moreover, drug abuse is most prevalent among many whose lives are more troubled  than Bennett's has been and who do not have the profound self-confidence he has  always evinced. In this context, Bennett may find it hard to reach out  successfully to those whose attitudes he now seeks to sway.  </P> <P> "People have always been put off by him," said Timothy Lowe, a longtime friend.  Said Steve Craddock, who knew Bennett while he was attending law school at  Harvard: "Bill never had a penchant for tolerating divergence from the norm."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, his stand in the '60s has in part won him the first opportunity  to show whether he has an answer for the '80s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eye to Future  </P> <P> The recollections of more than two dozen former Bennett friends and associates  interviewed for this story read like highlights of a resume compiled with  prescience for the role he would later assume.  </P> <P>  -- His near-fanatical love for rock music was "severely tested" in the  mid-'60s by the British invasion of pop music and by "lyrics that glorified  drug use," according to Ken Watson, his roommate first at Williams College in  New England and later at Texas.  </P> <P>  -- When marijuana smoke first began to seep into the Nueces House hallways in  the fall of 1966, Bennett spoke out, warning residents that drug use could be  harmful to them and to the co-op's status. Unable to stop the trend, he grew  uncomfortable and was regarded as an outcast, though friends say he did not  become a crusader on the issue.  </P> <P>  -- When he was a teaching fellow at Southern Mississippi University in  1967-68, he "took delight in the straight-arrow ethos," according to Lowe. "How  refreshing it was that drugs had not become a widely used feature of life,"  Lowe remembers Bennett observing.  </P> <P>  -- Later, while teaching at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in the  early 1970s, Bennett became infuriated at seeing "spaced-out students, all of  them high on drugs and wasting their lives," crowding pristine streets named  after signers of the Constitution, said John Burkett, another friend.  </P> <P> "He has the analytic abilities to get ahold of the problem, and he has the  right principles to direct him toward the right solution," said John Silber,  philosophy department chairman during Bennett's time at Texas and now president  of Boston University. "I think he's one of the few people alive who has the  courage to do the job."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Military Force  </P> <P> In the past, Bennett has advocated the use of increased military force against  drug producers and traffickers. But in comments the day of his nomination,  Bennett said he expects in his new job to conduct "a conversation with the  American people. . . .  </P> <P> "In the war against drugs," he said, "you don't, I guess, expect me to be  walking a beat or patroling in people's houses."  </P> <P> Born in 1943 to a middle-class family in Brooklyn, Bennett spent most his young  adulthood as student, teacher and administrator in universities. He left  campuses behind in 1976, when he became executive director and later president  of the National Humanities Center in North Carolina.  </P> <P> A big man with a lumbering gait, Bennett still looks like the college football  lineman he was at Williams, the elite New England liberal arts institution  where he received a scholarship after attending a Jesuit high school in  Washington.  </P> <P> As an outspoken education secretary under former President Ronald Reagan from  1985 until last summer, Bennett maintained that rough-hewn image. He stubbornly  remained a bachelor until age 39 (he married Mary Glover in 1982 and they have  a 4-year-old son) and even played quarterback on the department's team in  Sunday morning games on the Mall.  </P> <P> With his bearish appearance and his relish for the rough-and-tumble approach to  intellectual combat, Bennett was the model of the self-made scholar. He was a  package of classical allusions and beer and cigarettes who disdained effete  intellectuals.  </P> <P> That also had been his image when neoconservatives persuaded Reagan to appoint  him to head the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1981, and earlier, as  the young student and teacher in the '60s and '70s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Making Statement'  </P> <P> "He was making a statement," said a close Bennett friend. "He was saying: 'Look  at me, I'm drinking beer, I'm dressing like a bum, I love rock 'n' roll music,  I love football, and yet I'm a philosopher too."  </P> <P> A back injury at Williams helped philosophy supplant football as Bennett's  principal preoccupation. But his new commitment to Kant and Socrates did not  otherwise separate him from the mainstream of student life in the days before  the drug culture dawned.  </P> <P> Along with most of his classmates, Bennett turned out enthusiastically for  fraternity rush despite a college decision to phase out the fraternity system  altogether. While illicit drugs were hardly to be found at Kappa Alpha, the  house of his choice -- or indeed anywhere else at Williams in 1961-65 -- beer  was still plentiful, even for the underaged. Bennett, friends say, drank his  share.  </P> <P> Yet he seemed precociously aware of long-term consequences. In a Shakespeare  class, Bennett identified closely with Prince Hal -- the fun-loving rapscallion  who distanced himself from his roistering friends as he came to realize that he  would become King Henry V.  </P> <P> "The lesson was that responsibility set limits to the kind of fun you can  have," said Lowe, who took the course with Bennett. "That was a hard message at  Williams, and it was one that we spent a lot of time talking about . . . I  think public service loomed for Bill early on."  </P> <P> Mirroring the liberal drift of their generation, Bennett and his friends  regularly attended the meetings of the campus chapter of Students for a  Democratic Society. But while others decided to join the radical group, Bennett  stalled. Ultimately, he heeded the advice of his older brother, Robert, who  warned that association with a "fringe group" might later prove troublesome.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regarded as Leftist  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Bennett who arrived at the University of Texas as a  first-year graduate student in the fall of 1965 was regarded by his classmates  as a leftist -- a disciple of William Sloane Coffin Jr., the nationally  prominent anti-war leader and popular motorcycle-riding chaplain from Yale, and  earlier Williams.  </P> <P> Indeed, once Bennett saved enough money, he bought a motorcycle of his own, and  took delight in roaring around Austin on his fast new machine.  </P> <P> But Silber, the philosophy department chairman and moral preacher whose  influence over Bennett would be difficult to exaggerate, put a quick end to  such nonsense.  </P> <P> Declaring motorcycles unfit for rational men, Silber issued a "no motorcycles"  ultimatum for his graduate students. An intimidated Bennett obeyed. He even  bought Silber's '52 Chevrolet.  </P> <P> "Silber was kind of a puritan," then-graduate student David Solomon said. "He  hated long hair, couldn't stand bell-bottoms, and was hard on drugs." He even  lectured about "the impossibility of a philosopher doing his job if he had a  wet soul," according to Larry Hickman, a Bennett classmate.  </P> <P> Still, Silber did like to invite students to his home for darts and beer. And  Bennett was far from a teetotaler.  </P> <P> "We consumed massive quantities of alcohol," said classmate John Hardwig of  these graduate-school get-togethers. Indeed, Bennett's appetites for smoking  and drinking were such that Hardwig said he would have been "shocked" 20 years  ago if told that Bennett one day would hold a position of authority over social  behavior.  </P> <P> By the standards set by Silber and emulated by Bennett, vices such as drinking  and smoking were permissible if they did not interfere with one's work. Thus  Bennett remained a smoker until he was nominated to the drug czar post. Asked  then how he could display an addiction of his own while condemning others for  not abandoning theirs, he agreed to kick the habit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Life of Principle  </P> <P> Drugs, illegal and mind altering, have never met the Silber test. "You had to  lead a life of principle," said David Gerber, a former Silber student. "You  couldn't just drift hither and yon."  </P> <P> In Bennett's periodic public pronouncements about drugs, those who knew him at  Texas have heard a distinct Silber echo. Silber suggests that should not be  surprising. "Civilized people," he said in a recent interview, "have never been  confused about whether intoxicants diminish public performance."  </P> <P> It was Silber, ironically, who helped bring Bennett to Nueces House in the  autumn of 1966. It was  </P> <P> one of two "College Houses" established through foundation grants to stimulate  academic debate in a residential setting. Silber encouraged Bennett to take up  residence.  </P> <P> For all its high ideals, Nueces House was no pristine ivory tower.  </P> <P> In the fall of 1966, the emphasis on intellectual curiosity attracted certain  collateral effects. "In College House," said a Bennett friend, "would be the  kids doing drugs, the kids strongly opposed to the war, the first long-hairs in  Texas."  </P> <P> "Peyote was wild," said another friend, John Burkett. "There was LSD, speed . .  . you just had a lot of crazy stuff."  </P> <P> "In College House . . . " said former resident Dean Rindy, "Bill Bennett was in  an atmosphere in which most people around him were doing things he's condemning  now as hell's power."  </P> <P> No one interviewed offered any indication that Bennett might have used illegal  drugs, and the nominee declined a request for an interview. Asked previously  whether he had used drugs, Bennett has answered enigmatically. But friends in  touch with Bennett while this article was being prepared insisted that Bennett  had never even smoked marijuana.  </P> <P> When marijuana first became apparent at Nueces House, "we tried to keep the  place drug free," said Watson, his roommate at the time.  </P> <P> Watson said Bennett pushed successfully for a house policy banning public drug  use, telling residents at a house meeting that "this stuff was a foolish risk,  and one that could not be afforded individually or as an organization."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a Vigilante  </P> <P> But other former residents do not recall Bennett as an anti-drug champion. "I  never remember him leading a gang of anti-drug vigilantes or speaking out  against the virtues of pot," Rindy said.  </P> <P> No one disputes that Bennett -- not known then or now for a tolerant demeanor  -- grew progressively more uncomfortable at Nueces as the year progressed. At  exam time he moved out to stay with a fellow graduate student, and looked  forward to leaving Austin for a teaching post at Southern Mississippi  University in Hattiesburg.  </P> <P> The social isolation of that small Southern town occasionally sent Bennett  fleeing to New Orleans for a weekend respite of restaurants and bars. But he  nevertheless found Mississippi exhilarating at the height of the civil rights  movement, and friends say his time there redoubled his commitment to that  cause.  </P> <P> When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot in Memphis, Tenn., Bennett was one of  a small group of whites to attend a memorial service in Hattiesburg.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, the year in Mississippi served also to "jell  (Bennett's) own conservative view of things," said Lowe. "Here were people who  might be wrong about racial matters, but without drugs, could work and study  without distraction."  </P> <P> Amid what came later, Lowe and others said, Bennett would yearn out loud for  the values of Hattiesburg. Moving on to Harvard Law School, Bennett  increasingly found himself to be the odd man out. He stood as a stubborn symbol  of stability in the Harvard freshman dormitory he supervised as proctor.  </P> <P> To John Curlutte, a newly arriving freshman from rural Illinois, Bennett seemed  "the only clean-shaven guy in Harvard Yard" amid a sea of "guitars, long hair,  drugs." Under Bennett's wing that year, conservative students mounted the first  panty raid on Radcliffe that anyone could remember and once tried to block an  SDS demonstration.  </P> <P> That was hardly the Cambridge norm. "Pot smoking was quite prevalent,"  remembers David Lhow, another member of that class. And when Bennett learned  that two freshmen in his dormitory were peddling heroin, he persuaded reluctant  Harvard administrators to suspend them, according to an account provided by his  friends.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loved to Party  </P> <P> While his attitude on drugs was hardening, his stand on parties was  unthreatened. Dormitory students recall vividly the Saturday night beer blasts  that Bennett regularly hosted, spending university funds to supply underage  freshmen. By morning, Lhow said, hallways were "ankle-deep in beer cans."  </P> <P> In an era of Woodstock, they also remembered Bennett for his collection of  classic rock 'n' roll -- his emblem since the mid-'60s, when revolutions in  rock left him mourning "the day the music died," a friend said.  </P> <P> Indeed, while Matthews Hall stereos blared tapes of Woodstock performances by  Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin for months after the concert, Bennett would voice  displeasure, and could muster enthusiasm only for the Woodstock performance of  Sha Na Na -- a '50s revival group.  </P> <P> For Bennett, that music served as a symbol of a purer past, of beers and onion  rings at Split Rail in Austin while listening to the Hootenanny Hoots.  </P> <P> Now, after more than 20 years, the values that once rendered Bennett an  exception in his generation have emerged dominant again, elevating him to a  status in which he is well-placed to promote them.  </P> <P> It is a sign of how drastically the tide has turned, however, that even  Bennett's staunch record does not lift him beyond question. The mere fact of  having associated with drug users now makes his friends defensive.  </P> <P> For example, there is the future drug czar's most infamous assignation: a  "blind date" with Janis Joplin that he has told friends about for years. The  woman who arranged it said Joplin and Bennett spent less than an hour drinking  and talking during a summertime gathering at a "party barn" outside Austin.  </P> <P> A few months later, Joplin died of a heroin overdose.  </P> <P> Asked about such elements in Bennett's past, one of his friends, Richard  Sorenson, drafted and read out a formal statement:  </P> <P> "Bill was a big fan of Elvis Presley," it said. "But in those days, we didn't  know about Elvis' drug habits."  </P></p>

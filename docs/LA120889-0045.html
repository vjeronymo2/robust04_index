			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIANS PRAY FOR QUAKE VICTIMS  </P> <P> Armenians in Los Angeles County gathered in their churches Thursday to  commemorate the devastating earthquake that struck their homeland a year ago,  immediately killing 26,000. Thousands more died later from injuries or disease  and more than 520,000 were left homeless, leaders of the local Armenian  community said.  </P> <P> "There is a need to recognize this tragedy that has befallen us," said Garen  Yegparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee's Western  Region. "There is also this sense of the series of tragedies that has befallen  the Armenian people in this century."  </P> <P> Yegparian said those tragedies include what they refer to as the 1915-1923  genocide when 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Turks, atrocities against  Armenians during the Stalin era and the more recent suppression of dissent in  Soviet Armenia.  </P> <P> "Armenians have a tremendous will to overcome, survive and re-establish  ourselves," Yegparian said.  </P> <P> His Holiness Vasken I, Catholicos of All Armenians, directed Armenian churches  to ring their bells at 11:43 a.m. Thursday to observe the anniversary. Armenian  churches in Los Angeles County held morning and evening services to remember  the tragedy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 12 MORE RESEDA, NORTHRIDGE FIRES RAISE TOTAL TO 75  </P> <P> Twelve more fires in the Reseda-Northridge area bring to at least 75 the number  of fires set by arsonists in the area since late October, the Los Angeles Fire  Department said Thursday.  </P> <P> One admitted arsonist is in custody, but investigators are looking for one or  more others.  </P> <P> The latest fires broke out in the general vicinity of Reseda Boulevard north of  Saticoy Street between 6:30 p.m. and midnight Wednesday, Fire Inspector Ed Reed  said.  </P> <P> In each instance, either a palm tree or a pile of rubbish was deliberately set  afire, Reed said. One of the palm fires spread to the roof of a nearby home but  caused only minor damage, he said. Another was set on the grounds of the  Northridge Hospital Medical Center.  </P> <P> "The fires all appear to be linked," said Reed, who declined to describe how  the fires were started.  </P> <P> The latest fires appear to be linked to a rash of similar fires that have been  breaking out in the same general vicinity since at least Halloween night, Reed  added. A review of fire calls in the area shows at least 75 fires in the  general Reseda Boulevard corridor that fit the pattern, he said.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, arson investigators arrested a 16-year-old Reseda boy who  admitted that he started six of the fires, Reed said. But the boy denied  responsibility for any others and was in custody in Sylmar Juvenile Hall when  the last 16 fires were reported.  </P> <P> The boy, who had a history of minor vandalism and theft in the area, was  arrested after he was identified by a witness at one of the fires. Officials  described him as a good student who is emotionally unstable.  </P> <P> There was no clear motive for setting the fires. "These fires were part of his  disturbance," Reed said.  </P> <P> Reed said investigators may be looking for several arsonists, who may or may  not know each other. "We have had two or more people doing it," and because of  similarities in the fires, at least one may be a copy-cat arsonist, he said.  </P> <P> The Fire Department asked residents to be alert for arsonists after nightfall.  </P> <P> "We need the help of the public to catch this guy," Reed said. "We need people  to keep their eyes open."  </P></p>

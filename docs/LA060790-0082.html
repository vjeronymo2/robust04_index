			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 1 DEAD, 1 WOUNDED IN TROLLEY STOP SHOOTING  </P> <P> A Texas woman allegedly shot and wounded her boyfriend and then killed herself  at an El Cajon trolley center Wednesday evening, El Cajon police said.  </P> <P> The woman took a .25-caliber pistol from her purse after arguing with Rodolfo  Chavana Jr., 26, according to Lt. Bob Lein of the El Cajon Police Department.  </P> <P> Lein said Chavana apparently wanted to break up with the woman and took her to  the train station so she would return to San Antonio. Lein said the woman  allegedly fired several shots, two of which struck Chavana, who lives in the  200 block of Cottonwood Drive in Santee.  </P> <P> Police are not releasing the name of the woman until her family is notified.  </P> <P> Chavana was shot twice once in the back of the neck and the other shot entered  his cheek, Lein said. Chavana was apparently escorting Ramos to the trolley  center but was not planning to board the trolley, Lein said.  </P> <P> After shooting at Chavana, the woman placed the gun in her mouth and pulled the  trigger. She was pronounced dead at the scene.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred at 250 S. Marshall Avenue at about 6:50 p.m. There were  seven witnesses to the shooting, police said.  </P> <P> "There were people waiting for the trolley and cars in the street. Shots were  being fired as Chavana was on the run and traffic was driving by," Lein said.  "It was very fortunate that no one else was hurt."  </P> <P> Chavana was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where he was listed in serious  but stable condition, nursing supervisor Melanie Bruce said.  </P></p>

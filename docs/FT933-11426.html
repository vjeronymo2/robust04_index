			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Merck acquires Medco drug group in Dollars 6bn deal MERCK, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday announced the Dollars 6bn acquisition of Medco Containment Services, one of the US's largest distributors of drugs. The acquisition, the first vertical integration between a large manufacturer and distributor in the US, will give Merck greater control over its sales, just as pressure on healthcare costs has squeezed drugs companies' margins. Medco, based in Montvale, New Jersey, is a fast-growing mail-order company. It supplies the employees of many of the largest US corporations, including General Motors and General Electric, with drugs under their company healthcare plans. Mr Martin Wygod, chairman and founder, said 33m people were covered by Medco schemes, and estimated that the company would account for 12 per cent of drug sales in the US this year. Mr Roy Vagelos, Merck chairman, said the acquisition marked a revolutionary step for the group, and could change the drugs industry. 'The current system of pharmaceutical care is largely unco-ordinated and unmanaged', resulting in over-prescription and waste, he said. The integration of manufacturing and distribution would lead to more efficient use of resources, and was consistent with the goals of the Clinton administration to reduce US healthcare costs, he added. US companies have turned to intermediaries, such as Medco, to help bring down their healthcare costs. Medco, as a bulk buyer of drugs, can negotiate large discounts. Medco reviews the drugs that doctors have prescribed to patients covered by its schemes and, where suitable, recommends cheaper products that achieve the same results. In an attempt to protect Medco's extensive customer base, Merck said that Medco would continue to provide drugs produced by other manufacturers. Medco would retain its name and operational independence, while Mr Wygod would join the Merck board. Medco buys Dollars 250m of Merck drugs a year, just under 10 per cent of its purchases. That proportion was likely to go up as Merck created products or cut prices to suit Medco customers, the companies said. Medco shareholders are being offered Dollars 39 in cash or 1.214 Merck shares for each Medco share. Allocations will be adjusted so that, in total, 60 per cent of the transaction is paid for with Merck paper and the rest in cash. Merck said the acquisition would be financed by issuing equity and borrowing through commercial paper and medium-term note markets. Merck shares closed Dollars 1 3/8 down at Dollars 30 3/4 , while Medco jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 34 1/8.</p>

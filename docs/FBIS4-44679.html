Consequently, on  Saturday 7 May, Claude Terrazzoni, Aerospatiale Aircraft  Division's director, said that in the coming weeks Airbus  Industrie will begin the second phase of studies on the project  named A3XX, without interrupting the feasibility study it is  engaged in jointly with Boeing. Three of the world's great  manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas) work on this  program: in no way will one be caught napping by the competition.    At the moment, the project is in the very preliminary  feasibility study phase. According to Aerospatiale, the market,  mainly in the Asia-Pacific region, could accommodate a 60-craft  annual production by 2010 and support this pace to 2020. The  French aircraft builder--according to Mr. Terrazzoni--is afraid  that cooperation with Boeing could be just a "deceptive ploy."  Two months ago, this cooperation has been received with some  skepticism by the European manufacturer, which is worried about  losing its full liberty of action.    Today, the French fear that the Americans will launch their  own craft based on the 747-400. They feel that Boeing's recent  announcement to build an extended-range 777 two-jet version, has  confirmed their suspicions. According to Mr. Terrazzoni, this  aircraft "would compete directly with the existing B747-400  four-jet craft, which will force Boeing to modify the B747-400  and begin studies on a new larger aircraft." The French have  clearly decided not to let this market pegged at $220 million  (1.25 billion French francs [Fr]) escape them. But, for the  moment, only two companies (British Airways and Singapore  Airlines) have shown interest for an aircraft larger than 500  seats.</p>

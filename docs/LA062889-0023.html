			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACCIDENT CLAIMS REJECTED BY AVALON  </P> <P> The Avalon City Council has refused claims filed against the city stemming from  a boating accident off the Santa Catalina Island coast that killed two Orange  County men and injured three others in December.  </P> <P> The claims allege that a harbor patrol officer observed the pilot of a 19-foot  fishing boat drunk and cruising at high speeds, but failed to take preventive  action before the boat crashed on rocks.  </P> <P> One of the claims was filed by Newport Beach resident Mary Glose, whose  husband, William Glose, 33, and son, Sean Caudillo, 22, were killed. Both men  were passengers on the Impulse, which crashed on the rocks off Lovers Cove on  the island's east coast. The claim sought an unspecified amount for wrongful  death and various expenses.  </P> <P> A separate claim seeking $275,000 was filed by David Wilken of Costa Mesa, a  passenger on the boat.  </P> <P> The men were among four passengers aboard the boat, which was piloted and owned  by Alfred Gausewitz. The claim alleges that a harbor patrol officer should have  issued a warning or stopped the boat before it left Avalon Harbor. Gausewitz  and another passenger survived the crash.  </P></p>

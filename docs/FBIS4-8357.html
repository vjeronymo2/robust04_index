			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] During today's session of the Romanian Senate,  Senator Ioan Alexandru of the PNTCD [National Peasant  Christian-Democratic Party] read out a declaration regarding the  recent vote in the Chisinau parliament that endorsed the  Republic of Moldova's joining the CIS and regarding, quote, the  ambiguous reaction of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  to that adherence, unquote.    The declaration states that the vote of the Chisinau  parliament reconfirms the criminal pact by which Bessarabia was  torn away from Romania in 1941 and it annuls the indefeasible  right of the Romanian nation to a part of its territory.  Alexandru presented the declaration as one issued by the  Romanian Parliament, but the chairman of today's session, Senate  Deputy Speaker Valer Suian, stated that to be properly endorsed  by the law-making body the declaration ought to be debated and  passed by the two chambers. As a result of this, Senator Ioan  Alexandru's declaration was considered a personal one that  merely represents a possible suggestion made to the Romanian  Parliament. [passage omitted]    During today's plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies  the  representatives also discussed issues that were not included in  today's agenda, the principal one being the situation in Moldova  after the Chisinau parliament's vote in favor of joining the  CIS. In that context PNTCD Deputy Petre Dugulescu suggested that  the Chamber of Deputies adopt a declaration by which the  Romanian Parliament would declare in front of the whole world  that the Romanian nation's right to a part of its territory is  an indefeasible and inalienable one, and that no act  contradicting that right can be valid as an international  regulation.    The declaration is to be adopted if it is approved of by the  Foreign Policy Commission. [passage omitted]</p>

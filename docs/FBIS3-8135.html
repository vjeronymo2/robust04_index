In order to guarantee its security, Slovakia relies  especially on NATO, the West European Union, the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations, says  the document which must be approved by the parliament. Active  participation in the North Atlantic Council for Cooperation and  in the Partnership for Peace project is an important starting  point for NATO membership.    Internal security could be jeopardised by escalated  nationalism and irredentism by a part of the population with  possible tendencies to violate the integrity of the state  territory, appearance and anti-constitutional activities of  extremist political organisations, criminal activity committed  in connection with privatisation and corruption in state bodies,  the document says.</p>

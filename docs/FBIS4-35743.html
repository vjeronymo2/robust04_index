			<p>BFN     [Text] Asad Mubarak, the general prosecutor of the local  judicial system in Judaea and Samaria, has said that ever since  the autonomy was established in Jericho, there has been no  contact between his judicial system and that of Jericho. He  noted that the Palestinian Authority had appointed a new  judicial system in Jericho consisting of a prosecutor, a judge,  and administrative staffers.    Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that Justice Minister  David Liba'i heard Mubarak's remarks during a tour of the court  system in Ramallah. In the course of the visit, Minister Liba'i  rejected 'Arafat's demand to terminate the application of  Israeli military laws in the territories. The justice minister  said that the Palestinian Authority has jurisdiction in Gaza and  Jericho only. He pointed out that according to the Israeli-PLO  agreement, the Palestinian Authority does not have to extradite  murderers and terrorists to Israel.</p>

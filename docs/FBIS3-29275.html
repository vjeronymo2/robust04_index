"Whoever said or recommended that should review the  One-China  policy," Press Secretary Jesus Sison said when asked by  reporters whether Ramos should offer an apology. [sentence as  received]    "President Ramos and the Philippine government have not done  anything to violate the provision of the One-China policy. The  president of Taiwan came here only for four hours and it was all  about trade and investment. We see nothing wrong there," he  added.    The Chinese foreign ministry and the local embassy here have  strongly protested Li's low-profile visit on Wednesday at Subic  Bay Freeport en route to Indonesia and Thailand, saying it was a  breach of the policy.    Ramos, whose late father was a longtime ambassador to  Taipei,  secretly slipped out of Manila to welcome Li in Subic. He also  hosted a luncheon for him and his 40-member delegation of senior  officials and business leaders. The Philippines has recognized  the mainland as the ruler of all China since establishing  diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1975, but has recently  increased trade contacts with Taipei for economic reasons.    Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo on Monday also defended  Li's  visit and his meeting with Ramos, saying Beijing should  understand that the Philippines needs investments from Taiwan at  a crucial stage when it's economy is taking off.    Opposition Senator Francisco Tatad on Monday, however, said  that even though only economic issues were discussed, Ramos's  meeting with Li was a "political act" and a violation of the  One-China policy.    Federico Pascual, a columnist with the mass circulation  Philippine Daily Inquirer, described the visit as a "deliberate  assault on cordial relations between Manila and Beijing" and  suggested the two leaders could have discussed economic issues  without meeting personally.    "The two presidents cannot rendezvous in that scandalous  manner and, when caught in flagrante delicto, insist that they  do not recognize each other," he wrote. But the TODAY newspaper  defended Ramos, pointing out in an editorial that the  Philippines did not give full planeside honors to Li as it  accords to other visiting foreign leaders.    "The surreptitiousness (of the meeting) belies a sovereign  intent to accord Taiwan a wider diplomatic recognition beyond  the bare essentials of an economic relationship, that, surely,  Beijing will not deny us since it enjoys far more of it in  southern China," the editorial said. "If anyone should feel  offended, it is Taiwan -- for a meeting that went more like a  liaison than anything else."</p>

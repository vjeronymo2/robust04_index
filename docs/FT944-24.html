			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: A Loire chef in Paris - Eating out in France Two independent reports alerted me to the good value and creative cooking Thierry Coue offers at Les Amognes - so independent that the sources of these reports live 6,000 miles apart. The first came from Mel Knox, a San Franciscan who makes his living selling French oak barrels to American winemakers, the second from Robert Vifian, chef and part-owner of Tan Dinh, a Parisian restaurant which combines excellent Vietnamese cooking with a stunning wine list, particularly of Pomerols (60 rue Verneuil, 7th, 45 44 04 84). What had aroused Knox and Vifian's interest in this restaurant had been its name, Les Amognes. This is Coues birthplace, a little village close to Nevers, in central France, a city known wherever wine or brandy is produced for the quality of the oak that comes from the forests nearby. As anyone in the wine world will tell you, whenever an area is associated with the making of good wine, good food is not far away. I was glad that I went with such strong recommendations, however. Although Les Amognes is only 100 metres from the Faidherbe-Chaligny Metro and near a stop for the 86 bus which took me back to Boulevard St Germain, it is not easy to find - particularly when scaffolding encases its entire front window. As I wandered along in search of lunch, I began to appreciate some of the commercial problems Coue faces, which he was to explain when we talked after lunch. The 11th arrondissement is not a business area, so there are few people eating on expense accounts and there is a plethora of cheap competition  - Italian, Chinese and other French restaurants - seeking the custom of the quartier. 'I opened here 4 1/2 years ago,' Coue explained, 'which means that I have never really known anything other than difficult trading conditions. I have one FFr170 (Pounds 20) menu which includes four courses, an ameuse-geule and petits fours, service and tax. This is my price for lunch and dinner and I know I cannot raise it even by FFr5. 'The restaurant can seat over 40 but I work with five staff. A maitre d', who doubles as cashier, a commis who takes the coats, myself, a second chef and a plongeur. I change the menu with the seasons but I cannot change the price. The great challenge for me is to rework those ingredients which fit this price and which the customers like into slightly different dishes on the menu.' To sit in Les Amognes is not particularly exciting. It is a long, dark room with natural light only from the front window. The left-hand wall is exposed brick and the bar to the right and the ceiling are of dark wood. Attention and money is devoted to the food. As you sit down, a dish of salmon rillette and thinly sliced baguette is placed on the table together with the menu. Reading the menu I made the mental resolution not to eat more than half the rillette but as my first course arrived I had finished it. Coue's menu contained two of my favourite ingredients so I knew immediately what I would order but I saw several other dishes that I would return for: beignets of salt cod with fried sage leaves, black pudding wrapped in filo pastry, a terrine of wild rabbit and rosemary, a skate wing with aubergine caviar, cep stuffed with oxtail and noisettes of venison, red cabbage and chestnuts. Since I like to eat what I cannot prepare easily at home, I ordered a dish comprising eight small pieces of toast, with cubes of warm beef marrow topped in turn with thin slices of radish and chives. Slivers of mustard gave this comforting dish an extra length of flavour. This was followed by five, plump scallops around a mound of sauteed salsify on a truffle sauce. Then came a plate of three cheeses and roast figs stuffed with red fruits. With the coffee came an intense almond tuile. There is a good list of Loire wines but as Coue explained: 'We French believe that a wine list has to begin with Champagne, then Bordeaux and Burgundy. My Loires have to come after that.' Persevere. There are lovely wines from Huet, several red Loires, Chinon and Bourgeuil, with bottle age and three different cuvees of white wine in halves from Didier Dageneau, the region's most dynamic wine maker. I enjoyed Coue's cooking, and admired his style, modesty and diligence. I left, too, with admiration for two of his female customers whom the maitre d' told me were frequent visitors even though they were in their 80s. Les Amognes, 243 rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75011 Paris, 43 72 73 05. Closed Sunday and Monday.</p>

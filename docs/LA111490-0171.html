			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LIVERPUDLIAN'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE  </P> <P> Paul McCartney's birth certificate is for sale and could fetch $20,000, the  auctioneer says.  </P> <P> Auction house owner Ray Simpson said Tuesday he examined the paper, stamps and  certification language and concluded it's the real thing. The birth certificate  was sold to an American investor by the former Beatle's stepmother, he said.  </P> <P> "I have no doubt about it at all. It is absolutely unconditionally guaranteed,"  he said.  </P> <P> The certificate shows that on June 18, 1942, at 107 Rice Lane, James Paul  McCartney was born to James McCartney, a "centre lathe turner (aircraft  factory)," and Mary Patricia McCartney of 10 Sunbury Road, Liverpool.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS 'PROBLEM CHILD' A PROBLEM FOR PETS?  </P> <P> Standing in a theater lobby recently, I was appalled by a poster for "Problem  Child": To depict an animal helpless in a dryer is despicable.  </P> <P> Did anyone stop to think how many impressionable children would attempt to  emulate such an act because it appeared to be funny on film, and how many  helpless animals will suffer as a result?  </P> <P> ANDREA R. HERMAN  </P> <P> Encino  </P> <P>  Although the cat is the target of rough stuff, the clothes-dryer scene is not  in the movie.  </P></p>

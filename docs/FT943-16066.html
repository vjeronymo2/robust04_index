			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Receivers warn British Land on Broadgate sale: Oldfield claims strong support from Rosehaugh's bankers Receivers to one of the partners in Broadgate, London's biggest property joint venture, have said they will fight attempts by British Land to acquire its developments on the cheap. Mr Roger Oldfield, joint administrative receiver at Rosehaugh, one of two Broadgate partners, said yesterday: 'We have a strong position and I am not going to allow British Land's chairman, or anybody else, to get their hands on some of London's most valuable assets at less than a full price.' His warning follows the acquisition by British Land in February of a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope Properties, which owns 50 per cent of Broadgate Properties, developer of two of the capital's largest ever office schemes valued in excess of Pounds 1bn. Rosehaugh, which owns the other 50 per cent of Broadgate, went into receivership in December 1992. British Land has transferred its Stanhope stake to the Pounds 500m British Land Quantum Property Investment fund, formed last year with Mr George Soros, the US investor. British Land would not comment on the state of negotiations. But it has made no secret of its intention to implement a restructuring which would give the fund 100 per cent of the Broadgate Centre and the Ludgate office developments, and leave Stanhope's existing management with a less indebted, but substantially scaled down business. Many of the banks which are still owed about Pounds 280m by Rosehaugh also lent large sums to Stanhope and Broadgate. Mr Oldfield said that he had received strong support from Rosehaugh's bankers when he met them last month to outline the receiver's position on the recent events at Stanhope. 'With the commercial property market rising, we told them they could afford to wait for the right deal and should not be bounced into a hasty sale because a non-controlling interest had been acquired in one of the partners. If British Land or Mr Soros want control they are going to have to pay a proper price for for it,' said Mr Oldfield. Stanhope had a negative net worth of Pounds 15m at the end of last year after making losses of more than Pounds 270m in the previous two financial years. The purchase by British Land, however, was unsuccessfully opposed by Mr Stuart Lipton, Stanhope's chief executive. The issue is complicated as both Stanhope and Rosehaugh have pre-emption rights should either partner decide to sell their stakes in Broadgate Properties. A key factor in the negotiations will be Jones Lang Wootton's June 30 valuation of Broadgate, which is currently being undertaken for Stanhope's accounts, and will provide a basis for any competing bids.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Fashion: Undercover guide on what to buy her - Avril Groom gives a brief guide to the type of lingerie women would really like to find in their festive stockings WHAT should a man give to show his love and win a smile of intimate complicity? A slip of silk, trimmed coquettishly with lace, or a wisp of bedtime chiffon that only he should see? Maybe, gentlemen. But romantic fantasies aside, what she would chose herself is often far less adventurous. The large volume of unwanted lingerie which is returned to the shops in January shows that seduction is often far from a woman's mind when she choses items for herself. The nightdress she buys must withstand the washing machine and be decent enough for the milkman to see. And underwear? What she really wants is something crisp, comfortable and practical - like her man's Y-fronts. New York designer Calvin Klein recognised this plain truth years ago and promptly converted his range of austere, white or grey interlock men's underwear to a womanly form, raising a retailing storm. Now that even top couture houses such as Chanel are putting women's Y-fronts on the catwalk, this is obviously not a trend to be trifled with. The original makers of the men's version, Jockey, have just introduced a women's range and see their brand name, emblazoned on the outside, as a positive selling point to women. It suggests, they reason, those qualities of comfort and support which have long made the brand popular with men and which are exactly the reasons why women would choose them, too. The women's Jockey briefs and top (not a bra, but with a supporting under-bust elastic trim) look more like exercise wear, in the tradition of the sports bra pioneered by Berlei and Triumph. They may fulfil the female wish for underwear so supremely comfortable that the wearer is barely conscious of it, but it would take a brave man to buy them as a Christmas present. But rather than risk misinterpretation by today's super-sensitive males and discord under the Christmas tree, women would probably prefer to be given something equally practical but prettier, not to say romantic. Here it is a matter of a little gentle education for the chaps, for whom the words 'pretty and romantic' have somewhat different connotations. It may be wise for present-buyers to steer away from the red, black, transparent and lacy which the words may conjure up in the minds of menfolk. A woman's choice would invariably be fine silk or fresh cotton with trimmings and lace soft enough not to appear knubbly under close-fitting clothes, and in white or pastels. In recent years, many stores have introduced lingerie evenings for male customers, where chaps who were once reduced to vaguely cupping their hands in the air and muttering 'she's about this big' get a sympathetic hearing from helpful assistants in less embarrassing conditions. Apart from upping sales, the main aim of such evenings has been education and it seems to be paying off. 'We don't get as many returns these days because the style is wrong,' say Fenwick in London's Bond Street, 'but they do sometimes mistake the size.' Triumph's chief consultant, Yvonne Snell, agrees. 'Men are much more clued up now. They ask their wife her size and often come in with a picture from a magazine of something they think she will like.' She believes women's attitudes are also softening in these post feminist days. 'There is so much advice these days on how to keep a relationship alive that they will wear glamorous but tasteful lingerie occasionally to add a little spice. And they might not admit it, but most women are flattered by being given something flippant and sexy.' The only problem, she says, is stockings. 'All men like them but only younger women, who see them as something new, do.' A survey carried out by Gallup for lingerie company, Ballet International, showed this was right. After interviewing 546 women and 505 men aged between 19 and 24 across the country, only nine per cent said they were going to buy stockings or would like to receive them. Out of the one in three men buying their wives or girlfriends lingerie this Christmas, only three per cent said they would be shopping for a basque - and only two per cent of women said they would like to receive one. The most popular lingerie gift mentioned in the survey was French knickers and matching camisole, with 18 per cent of women saying they would like to receive them and 10 per cent of men planning to buy a set. Cotton lingerie is second in popularity, with figure-hugging body suits the third choice. The survey also revealed that two in three men claim to know their partner's statistics - although only a quarter of the women said the last lingerie they received from their man was a perfect fit. But with today's less austere styles, sizing is not the problem it once was. Harrods buyer Louise Garner says: 'We gently try and steer men uncertain about size towards something where it's not crucial, such as a camisole, teddy or nightie. As long as they have a fair idea of the right dress size, there is usually no problem.' There are, says Garner, two distinct types of male customer. 'Some consult the recipient or may even bring her in to look around and then come back and buy. Others come in pre-Christmas for a surprise present and they really haven't a clue. We try and guide them, by asking questions about the woman to discover what she might like. 'But some are determined to choose what they want to see her in, which is usually bright or dark colours and invariably involves a suspender belt. We gently try and discourage that because neither we nor the customer wants the inconvenience of bringing it back later.' In a less rarefied sector of the market, at Knickerbox with its 57 high street shops, managing director Stephen Schaffer also admits that returns are a problem. 'Our male customers appear to have a very definite view of what their partner should wear - whether she likes it or not,' he says. 'They tend to choose stereotyped items such as French knickers or suspender belts, though if they consult our staff they discover that what women want and select for themselves are comfortable, practical, cotton and Lycra mixes that are attractive but not too fussy. 'Usually, our returns run at about nine per cent; after Christmas this shoots up to 15 per cent, invariably brought back by the female recipients.' Any men wanting last-minute guidance on buying lingerie could do worse than follow Knickerbox's advice. Ignore scratchy red lace and bumpy black suspenders. Look instead for pure cotton or silk, plus Lycra for close-fitting stretch and Tactel for soft comfort. Check that lace trims are soft to the touch (cotton-mix laces are best) and that details such as bows will not make awkward bumps under sweaters or clingy skirts. Men could earn maximum Brownie points by choosing just about anything from La Perla, the Rolls-Royce of lingerie which has a big new department in Harrods and can manage to make long-line, control panties look sexy, in silky stretch plus lots of lace, although they do cost Pounds 115. You could also earn points with a pretty, lace-trimmed, all-in-one body - by far the best thing for keeping out the winter chill. For nightwear, the same principles apply. Women are generally happier with cosy pyjamas, soft flower-prints or nostalgic embroidered white cotton such as Damask's pretty range, than bright satin, split thigh-high. In winter, styles with sleeves are welcome, though low necks and fine shoulder straps are flattering. But if all this sounds too worthy and unexciting, there is one area where male fantasies can be indulged with full female approval, and it is engineering rather than lingerie. Every woman wants a Wonderbra, Gossard's best-selling design that remains unchanged since 1968 and is constructed to give even the smallest chest a cleavage. It is the one design that women buy for themselves in black, which outsells white two to one. The reason is that these days the Wonderbra is worn to be seen, Madonna-style, at clubs and parties throughout Europe. It goes fearlessly under low-buttoned jackets or see-through chiffon blouses because, though it produces a lacy cleavage, it is sturdily constructed and perfectly decent. So popular has the Wonderbra become that it has inspired even Marks and Spencer, whose Christmas best-sellers include a lacy black bra and a black net body with built-in bra.

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2ND-HALF THUNDER AGAIN CARRIES QUARTZ HILL, 24-14  </P> <P> A familiar trend continued in Quartz Hill High's 24-14 win over Rubidoux in a  Southern Section Division I quarterfinal Friday night at Rubidoux.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill (10-2) scored 24 consecutive points in overcoming a 14-0  second-quarter deficit to advance to the semifinals for the first time in the  school's history.  </P> <P> Rubidoux, the Citrus Belt League's third-place finisher, led, 14-6, at the  half, but Quartz Hill rallied for three fourth-quarter touchdowns and will meet  Mater Dei next Friday. Mater Dei defeated Eisenhower on Friday, 34-20.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill has outscored opponents 102-0 in the second half the past four  games.  </P> <P> Rubidoux (5-8), which failed to complete a pass, rolled up 155 yards of offense  in the first half, but was limited to 33 thereafter. Quartz Hill posted 181 of  its 304 yards in the second half.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill running back Selves Smith rushed for 60 yards in seven carries,  including 59 after intermission and scored a touchdown midway through the  fourth quarter that gave Quartz Hill its first lead of the game. Teammate Erik  Thomas added 48 yards in 10 carries.  </P> <P> "It was pretty rough in the first half," Smith said. "We had trouble with their  misdirection plays. We came out fired up in the second half and showed people  the team that could do the job."  </P> <P> Quarterback Jake Haro connected with Robert Keller on a 59-yard pass play to  close to 14-6 with 2:24 remaining in the second quarter. Keller, however, was  wide left on the point-after attempt.  </P> <P> After a scoreless third quarter, Keller reeled in a 30-yard touchdown pass from  Haro for the pair's second touchdown of the game to cut the deficit to 14-12  with 11 minutes, 52 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Haro completed five of 10 for 135 yards .  </P> <P> Quartz Hill stopped Rubidoux on downs and marched 62 yards in nine plays with  Thomas dashing in from five yards to give the Rebels their first lead of the  game, 18-14, with 5:45 left.  </P> <P> Hansen delivered a crushing hit on Sammy Knight to force a fumble on the  ensuing kickoff. Thomas recovered at the Rubidoux 40 and five plays later,  Smith scored on a 19-yard run with 1:27 left to seal the victory.  </P> <P> "It seems like every game we come on in the second half," Haro said. "They  surprised us, but we got up after that first touchdown pass and everybody came  together."  </P></p>

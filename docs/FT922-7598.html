			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Resdidential Property (1): It's a long haul back to normal - In spite of the Conservative election victory, the UK housing market is still under a cloud ACCORDING TO anecdotal evidence, estate agents are seeing more potential housebuyers crossing their threshold. 'After the election there was a little flurry, but Easter, which is historically a good period, was dead,' says Nigel Conradi, marketing director of Nationwide Anglia's estate agency chain. Nevertheless, the mood in Nationwide's 400-odd branches is more positive: 'One of our managers reported that sightseers are back.' In addition, the Building Societies' Association reports that net new commitments in March were 28 per cent up on February. But this only brings the figure back to the level of late summer, 1991. However, most forecasters and estate agents predict that it will be a long haul out of the current trough. No one now expects to see any growth in real terms in house prices over 1992. Lloyds Bank, which has one of the more optimistic outlooks, thinks there will be a 3.25 per cent nominal increase over the year; with inflation at 4 per cent; this translates into a real fall. Others, such as the Woolwich building society and Dr John Wrigglesworth of stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, forecast that prices will remain static at best or fall further, by up to 2 per cent in nominal terms. Even estate agents, often accused of talking the market up, are braced for a slow recovery. 'It's going to take a long time for house prices to get back to where they were two years ago,' says Paul Taylor, of Savills, who deals in the higher-priced London properties. 'Nobody is better off; people's ability to pay is no more than it was before the election.' But affordability is not the problem. Over the last two years, the combination of falling house prices, lower interest rates and rising incomes has brought the cost of buying a house back within sight of the all-important first time buyer. There are two measures of affordability: house prices as a proportion of earnings, and mortgage payments as a proportion of earnings. Long-term, the average house price has been 3.5 times average earnings; during booms the ratio accelerates up past 4, while in the troughs it has fallen back to about 3. Nationwide's calculations put it at 3.11  - the lowest since 1971. At Woolwich building society, Martin Ellis has concentrated on measuring the costs for first-time buyers. His figures show that mortgage payments as a proportion of earnings shot up to an unprecedented 31.8 per cent in 1988 as interest rates were raised. Since then the proportion has fallen to equal the longer-term average of 21 per cent in the last quarter of 1991; further mortgage rate cuts and house price falls during early 1992 will have reduced it further. Moreover, the position for first-time buyers is particularly favourable. At the present Pounds 42,389 the average price is 13 per cent lower than the 1989 peak, while special discounts offered by mortgage lenders have taken their initial interest rate below 10 per cent. All these numbers suggest that a recovery should be already under way. Normally, at this point in the housing cycle, activity  - though not prices  - would be picking up. But buyers have stubbornly refused to re-enter the market. In 1991, there were only 1.3m transactions, 40 per cent off the 1988 peak and 6 per cent down on 1990. The first quarter of 1992 was even worse for volume and according to Nationwide's index, average house prices declined a further 2.7 per cent, making a total fall of 16 per cent since the peak in 1989. Part of the 1992 slump is being blamed on pre-election jitters. The Labour party's proposals for a higher tax rate on incomes over Pounds 40,000 and higher National Insurance contributions for those earning more than Pounds 22,000 inhibited prospective purchasers, as did the possibility that a Labour victory might imply higher interest rates. 'By the end of March we were seeing a lot of cancellations of offers  - as high as 40 per cent in some offices,' notes Nigel Conradi. In other cases, buyers were hedging their bets. 'People who were ready to exchange contracts were postponing until after the election, and in one or two cases making exchange conditional on a Conservative victory,' says Yolanda Barnes, of Savills' research department. Now that the election is over, buyers appear to be waiting to be convinced that the economy is reviving. 'The only ingredient missing in the market place is confidence; the difficulty is trying to predict when it will return,' says John May, joint chief executive of Hambro Countrywide. 'Confidence' is shorthand for a mixture of economic facts and feelings that will give potential buyers the courage to complete on a property. The first of these concerns is unemployment, or the fear of it. As the jobless total has risen, people's ability  - and willingness  - to take on a new or larger mortgage has evaporated. However, the trend here is positive; although the absolute number of jobless is still rising, the rate of the unemployment increase is slowing. Second, because of recession, those still in employment are lowering their sights. Although earnings are still rising in real terms, expectations of future growth are softening. At the higher end of the income scale, there are additional considerations. According to Yolanda Barnes, losses incurred by Lloyd's of London members have dealt a big blow to the more expensive end of the housing market. Third, the recent falls in house prices have shaken people's faith in bricks and mortar as an investment. Unlike most other goods, demand for owner-occupied housing tends to drop as prices fall and increase when they rise; economists describe this behaviour as 'perverse.' During the latest slump, this effect has been amplified because, unlike in previous downturns, house prices have dropped in nominal as well as real terms. Until they stabilise, potential buyers  - especially first-time ones  - will hold back. However, according to estate agents, many vendors are still having difficulties in accepting lower prices. 'The problem is, there is a wodge of sellers where the prices are lower than the equity in the house  - they cannot be realistic. Then there are those who want to move but don't have to. They don't need to be realistic,' says Conradi. A plea for realism cuts across the price range. At Savills, Justin Marking finds himself trying to persuade sellers of up-market country houses to knock 10 to 20 per cent off their price expectations. 'The key in this market is to set a competitive guide price. If it is too high it puts people off even viewing the premises,' he says. Savills has just produced a list of guide prices for three types of country residences. Then, too, there are the figures for mortgage arrears and repossessions. Their effect is harder to gauge. Although at record levels, repossessions represent only some 1 per cent of mortgages outstanding. However, repossessed houses do occupy an important position in the market, at the bottom of the housing chain. Until they are taken up, prices will languish. Moreover, arrears combined with price falls have clearly pushed some homeowners into a valuation trap: their mortgage is now higher than the value of their property. According to the Council of Mortgage lenders, there could be 580,000 of these, mostly first-time buyers. Wrigglesworth puts the figure at 1m. These are the 'can't sell' group, members of which will have to wait until prices rise. At present, the experts' consensus is that it will be mid- to late 1993 before there is any real growth in house prices. Lloyds is forecasting a nominal price rise of 8 per cent; the Woolwich puts it at 4.3 per cent. By then, buyers will have gathered enough courage to re-enter the market and the backlog of unsold houses should be cleared. After that, house prices should respond to more 'normal' market forces of growth in incomes, inflation, and new supply: long-term, the rises in the UK have averaged at 3.5 per cent per annum. However, two new factors will tend to dampen growth in house prices. The first is Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. In the past the UK's relatively high inflation rate during booms has contributed to housing's appeal as an investment. This is because inflation simultaneously erodes the real value of mortgage debt while pushing up nominal incomes and house prices. Membership of the ERM is expected to bring lower inflation rates and, in due course, more stable and lower interest rates. 'We will still see housing cycles, but with inflation being less rapid it will not fuel such rapid prices rises so the peaks won't be quite as high,' says Martin Ellis. The second dampening factor involves demographic trends: specifically, the UK's ageing population structure. The 'baby boomers' of the 1950s and early 1960s provided a bulge of first-time purchasers in the 1980s. They are now on the downturn, although the rate of household formation is not likely to slacken until the second half of the decade. In addition, the number of elderly people who are owner-occupiers is also set to rise sharply, and with them, the number of houses inherited. About two-thirds of these properties will be sold almost immediately, increasing the supply of houses available. However, it is estimated that only 20 per cent of the beneficiaries will spend most of the proceeds on property. Taken together, all these factors point to a pattern of steady, unspectacular growth in house prices: lower peaks and less painful lows.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELER'S DIARY: INTRIGUING RUINS AT COBA AND TULUM  </P> <P> Today we breached the jungle at the "Queen City of the Yucatan," hub of a  civilization that lasted for centuries.  </P> <P> First explorations of the area were made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, but  this once-vast city, most of whose estimated 6,500 structures remain hidden  beneath a tangle of rain forest, did not really begin to be uncovered until  1972.  </P> <P> Maryknoll sisters arranged medicine and food drops until a landing strip was  peeled away. Now, there is a road, and travelers who want a break from Cancun,  roughly 100 miles away, can rumble in by bus.  </P> <P> Among the other discoveries they will make at the end of a longish tramp along  jungle trails is the Nohoch Mul pyramid, more than 120 feet tall.  </P> <P> It takes 120 aching steps to reach the top. But from that lofty perch one can  survey pyramid mounds that rise above the plain and are especially visible when  sunrise or sunset casts shadows over the endless carpet of green.  </P> <P> Just to the left of Nohoch Mul is a 400-foot square leveled terrace bearing  evidence of houses that once stood on what the archeologists call "The Great  Platform."  </P> <P> Near the plaza in front of the pyramid is a stele, or tablet, depicting a Mayan  ruler standing atop two kneeling slaves, with two other slaves kneeling nearby.  </P> <P> The Mayan culture endures, and candlesticks, money and flowers are often placed  at the foot of monuments. Some of the stelae, covered now by straw canopies,  are 10 to 15 feet tall.  </P> <P> Conveniently -- albeit almost incongruously -- a Club Med has risen at Coba.  </P> <P> A two-story inn encircles a swimming pool and overlooks a thatched-roof  pavilion. It offers air-conditioned rooms at $42 a night double occupancy, with  breakfast an additional $5.  </P> <P> Coba lies at the hub of several dozen ancient roads, one of them stretching  almost 60 miles. These highways, both ceremonial and utilitarian, once formed  the largest network in North America.  </P> <P> A new 30-mile stretch from the inland jungle leads to the walled seaside city  of Tulum.  </P> <P> Our guide, Raul, insisted that Tulum does not mean "wall" as some believe, but  rather "evil-smelling ground," a sobriquet it earned because of its location  above and around mangrove swamps.  </P> <P> He said the city was also called Zama, meaning dawn, and that, too, makes sense  because from Tulum's clifftop perch one can see the sun rising out of the  Caribbean.  </P> <P> Tulum, open and visible, with no hint of jungle to impair the view of its  ruins, belongs to a period, perhaps AD 700 to 1000, when the Mayan civilization  was already in decline. The earliest-known stela here is said to date from AD  564, but there is some argument on this point; some insist that the tablet was  carved elsewhere and transported here.  </P> <P> There is little argument that the city-fort was constructed three centuries  before the Spaniards first came ashore in 1518. The Spanish, viewing the city,  called its most imposing structure El Castillo, the castle.  </P> <P> Buses and rental cars are available daily in Cancun for the visit to Tulum with  its myriad souvenir shacks.  </P> <P> Now, with the 30-mile spur road to Coba and the promise of its little inn,  Tulum and Coba make for an unforgettable if somewhat exhausting trip.  </P> <P> For more Club Med information, call toll-free (800) 258-2633.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Mexico, contact the Mexican Government  Tourism Office, 10100 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 224, Los Angeles 90067, (213)  203-8191.  </P></p>

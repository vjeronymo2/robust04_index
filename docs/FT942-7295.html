			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Accountancy Column: Auditors hedge their bets on derivatives  -The accounting treatment of financial instruments in the US is in flux The reported profits of US companies that use complex financial instruments to manage their risks look set to become much more volatile, leading many companies to stop using all but the simplest derivative instruments. There is a new unease (some might say, panic) among accountants and auditors in the US about the way many companies use - and account for - these financial instruments. The interest being shown by regulators and legislators has also sharpened the accounting profession's attention. Recently announced losses from miscued corporate hedging strategies have set the tone. The Dollars 102m after-tax loss (Dollars 157m pre-tax) taken by Procter &amp; Gamble on two leveraged interest rate swaps last month has reverberated through the corporate and accounting worlds. Of particular concern to the bean-counters is the fact that P&amp;G had been treating these instruments as straightforward hedges - even though, it now says, they were highly risky bets that US and German interest rates would rise. US accounting rules give companies considerable leeway in their treatment of financial instruments. If P&amp;G had been exploiting the weaknesses in the system, how many others? A restatement of its figures last week by Caterpillar Financial Services, after a review by auditors Price Waterhouse, could become the norm as companies scrutinise their derivatives holdings more closely, and auditors (fearing shareholder lawsuits) become more cautious. Companies can pick either of two ways to account for derivatives. One, known as hedge accounting, involves matching gains or losses on a financial instrument against the asset or liability it is intended to hedge. Any profits or losses on the instrument are deferred. Provided the hedge works, these can be set off later against corresponding losses or gains in the underlying asset. Under the second method, all derivatives are shown at market value at the end of each period, and any gains or losses are taken through the profit and loss account immediately. Mark-to-market accounting produces volatile quarterly earnings. It fails to reflect the economic reality of an effective hedging strategy, critics say. Companies, naturally, prefer hedge accounting. Under lax accounting rules, many may have shovelled instruments into this category which more realistically should have been marked to market. Auditors are clearly getting more wary. Caterpillar's financial services arm says it uses a variety of instruments to protect its net interest income, including interest rate swaps, forward-rate agreements, caps and swaptions. The last two, Price Waterhouse now says, should be marked to market (previously, Caterpillar had hedge-accounted the whole book.) Caterpillar Financial Services was forced to restate its first quarter figures to record a Dollars 5.4m after-tax charge, cutting its profits for the period to Dollars 6.4m. In future, its quarterly earnings will depend on the market value of those instruments at the end of each period. If writing caps and swaptions was part of an overall risk-management strategy, as Caterpillar claims, then such an accounting treatment is nonsense - the figures do not reflect the economic reality. Caterpillar said it won't write caps and swaptions in future, but will stick to instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. The problem for companies and their auditors is, how do you decide what is a hedge and what isn't? There is little guidance. Rules have been developed for foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps, which have been applied by extension to other situations. To justify using hedge accounting, companies normally have to meet fairly strict criteria. General practice is to apply three tests. A company's managers must identify the exposure they want to hedge; establish that the instrument will actually reduce this exposure; and designate which risks each instrument is intended to hedge. Applying these principles in practice is not easy. 'Modern risk management doesn't work that way,' says Mr Bob Herz of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Companies pool their various exposures and manage risk on a portfolio basis. Some common uses of derivatives are uncontroversial. If companies borrow variable-rate money and use an interest rate swap to convert it to fixed-rate, the practice is to account for this as synthetic fixed-rate debt (rather than treating the two parts of the transaction separately). Others situations are less clear-cut. What about the use of forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposures on sales which have not yet been completed? Most big exporters hedge their expected future sales to some degree (on the assumption that their on-going business will continue to involve foreign currency receivables). But under the strictest accounting interpretation, entering a forward exchange rate agreement under such circumstances amounts to speculation. The General Accounting Office - the investigative arm of Congress - waded into the debate last week, urging the accounting profession to consider scrapping hedge accounting altogether. It said it isn't clear how direct the correlation must be between a hedge and the underlying asset or liability, or how often the effectiveness of the hedge needs to be reassessed. 'Determining whether a hedge is operating effectively and thus qualifies for hedge accounting is difficult in reality,' the GAO said. The Financial Accounting Standards Board may also be leaning towards full mark-to-market accounting. Last June, it put forward some tentative conclusions about how to apply hedge accounting to all types of derivatives. In December, though, it went back to the drawing board. It is now considering two possible approaches - to develop the hedge accounting approach, or to require all instruments to be marked to market. Under the second, trading profits and losses would be taken into the income statement, whereas gains or losses on derivatives which are used for risk-management purposes would be shown as an adjustment to equity. There is another interesting accounting twist to the P&amp;G saga. According to Bankers Trust, the consumer products company has bought other leveraged swaps from the bank in the past and made a profit on the deals. Why hasn't P&amp;G reported these as trading profits?</p>

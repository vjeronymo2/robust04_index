			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> INFANT MORTALITY AT RECORD LOW  </P> <P> The 1989 infant mortality rate, at 9.7 per 1,000 live births, was the lowest  ever recorded in the United States, while deaths due to AIDS rose to become the  11th-leading killer, the government said today.  </P> <P> The 1989 data, released by the National Center for Health Statistics, also  showed life expectancy reaching a record high of 75.2 years and a continuing  decline in death rates for various diseases.  </P> <P> Infant mortality rates reflect deaths of children before their first birthday.  The 1989 infant mortality rate was 2% lower than the 1988 rate of 9.9 per 1,000  live births.  </P> <P> However, the decline in infant mortality has slowed in the last several years,  particularly for black infants, for whom the rate is more than twice that for  whites, the report said.  </P></p>

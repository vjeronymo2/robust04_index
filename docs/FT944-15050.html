			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Whitehall checks pensions reform The Department of Trade and Industry has no immediate plans to introduce personal pensions for civil servants, a spokesman said yesterday after a leaked letter had sparked fears of a reform. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, wrote to Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, saying that the DTI would 'look at the issue of personal/portable personal pension schemes, given the changes in civil service careers, post the white paper.' The letter, dated September 9, was leaked by the First Division Association which represents senior civil servants, including those at the DTI. But it is understood that the review of pensions stems from a white paper which considered whether employment terms created barriers for movement between the public and private sectors. 'The question was whether we should be doing anything to remove the barriers,' a DTI spokesman said. An internal review concluded that the form of pension provision was rarely a bar to civil servants who wish to leave for a job in the private sector, nor has it greatly deterred private sector employees from joining the civil service. The ability to calculate transfer values and changes to rules covering so-called deferred pensions have made the transferability of pension benefits less of a problem than had been thought. But it is understood that, more broadly, Mr Heseltine has concerns about the expense of civil service pensions which are administered by the Treasury via the Public Civil Service Pension Scheme. The scheme allows retirement for members of both sexes at age 60, early retirement in many instances with no actuarial reduction in benefits. It is also fully index-linked to the retail price index and is non-contributory.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Cost-cutting urged to save European fighter jet project THE NEW defence ministers of Britain and Germany, Mr Malcolm Rifkind and Mr Volker Ruhe, yesterday called for substantial cost savings in the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), to ensure that the multi-national project goes ahead. Speaking side-by-side after their first meeting, the two agreed that the aircraft manufacturers in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain must identify areas where significant savings can be made. Mr Ruhe, who took over the office of German defence minister last month after the sudden resignation of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, was much the more outspoken in his statement, reflecting the widespread opposition in Germany to the EFA project. He said the price - DM135m (Pounds 45.9m) per aircraft in Germany - was 'far too high, and there is an agreement between us that we should try to make clear that these price projections must be brought right down'. Only thus would it be possible to ensure 'there is an opportunity within a limited budget to come to a positive decision' on the aircraft. 'It would be difficult to make a clear decision on such prices." A working group from the three parties in the German coalition government is currently considering the EFA project, as well as other alternatives such as the ex-Soviet MiG-29, the French Rafale, Swedish Gripen and the US F-15, F-16 and F-22 aircraft. They are supposed to report back by mid-year. Mr Rifkind made it clear he believed the EFA was both 'operationally necessary' and appropriate to the changing defence challenges in Europe. But, he added, 'I share the concern about the cost. We have a common desire to see the cost reduced and we should jointly approach industry to impress on them the necessity of identifying areas where costs can be reduced.' The principal manufacturers are British Aerospace, Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, Casa of Spain and Alenia of Italy.</p>

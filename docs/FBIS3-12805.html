			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Black Friday--A Harbinger of More To Come"] </F>   [Text] The racist, usurper Zionist regime allowed the  massacre of more than 60 fasting Palestinian worshippers at the  al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque and on the streets of Hebron last  Friday. This is neither the first of such Zionist atrocities  nor will it be the last to be committed by the hated and  anti-Islamic savages in Tel Aviv.    In nearly 50 years of occupation of Muslim Palestine,  international organizations, charged with safeguarding the  security and territorial integrity of smaller countries, have  turned a deaf ear to this injustice.    The illegal Jewish settlements populated by recent Russian  and East European immigrants are ripe for physical violence  because of social, religious, and cultural incompatibility of  the Zionists with the indigenous Palestinian population. It was  this incompatibility that lead to the Black Friday massacre of  February 25.    Israel's refusal to abide by UN resolutions 242 and 338, and  its subsequent settling of Russian and East European Jews in  Arab lands created a common belief among the Zionist population  that they can get away not only with stealing Palestine but also  with the mass murder of Palestinian Muslims.    The selective and totally biased way in which the UN  implements its own resolutions regarding Palestine is weighing  heavily on the world's conscience, while the United States, as  Israel's military supplier and financial supporter, bears the  major share of guilt for Palestine's miseries as well as for  this latest Zionist savagery.    The United States has been trying to create for itself the  image of an honest broker in the Arab-Israeli conflict. America  has been trying to convey to the Muslim world that its interest  in brokering peace in the Middle East is based purely on  humanitarian motives and is free of any political and financial  considerations. But, the recent history of U.S. and Western  European mediation in this conflict has proven that the West  only acts when it is assured that the consequences of its  actions are not against Israel or Western interests.    Transplanting a mostly Eastern European Jewish community to  the heart of Muslim Middle East in 1948 was done by the UN under  orders from the United States without any regard for the rights  of the indigenous people of Palestine.    Considering the continued indifference of the West to the  plight of the Palestinians, the time has come for the world's  Muslims to take the initiative and begin implementing  independent measures to resolve this historical injustice.    The world Muslims, particularly the Palestinians, can use  their own potentials and capabilities derived from Islam and its  traditions to reject those leaders who still believe in making  peace with the butchers of Tel Aviv, and remove the Israeli  cancer from the body of Islamic Middle East.</p>

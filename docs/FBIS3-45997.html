			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Fraud Seen in Joint Ventures"] </F>   [Text] State auditors are calling for tightened scrutiny  of Sino-foreign joint ventures to curb financial malpractices.    A recent investigation of 572 joint ventures in 14  provinces,  conducted by the State Auditing Administration, disclosed the  increasing illegal practices in foreign funding, such as:    --A big part of promised foreign investment is not channeled  into the joint ventures. Of the 572 enterprises' 2.609 billion  yuan ($300 million) in registered capital that should have been  provided by foreign investors, only 43 percent was actually  handed over.    --Many investors provided outdated machinery and technology  to fulfill their contractual investment. What's worse is that  such investments also can entitle the investor to dividends,  which will result in long-term harm to the Chinese partners.    --Some investors use various means to withdraw their  investment after the joint ventures have been establisted. Many  borrow money from the enterprises and some sell raw materials  and equipment to the joint ventures at prices higher than on the  international market.    --Some joint ventures were set up with loans from Chinese  banks or money borrowed from Chinese partners. Such  enterprises, which are actually solely Chinese funded, are  created to take advantage of the country's preferential policies  for foreign-funded ventures.    "All these problems call for closer attention from high  levels," said Xu Yudi, director of the State Auditing  Administration's foreign funds application audit department.    "It's time for action," Xu said.    He said joint ventures are no doubt playing an ever big role  in introducting foreign capital and advanced technologies.    However, if these illegal practices cannot be rooted out,  not  only will joint ventures be unable to introduce foreign capital  and advanced equipment and technology to China, but they also  will bring about long-term losses to Chinese interests.    "We can't just sit by and see these problems become more and  more severe," Xu said.    He said the State should organize an examination of the  nation's joint ventures that would involve the departments of  foreign trade, administration of industry and commerce, customs  and administration of State properties.    Foreign equipment and technology should also be evaluated  more closely to stop such subterfuge, he said.    Xu said the intensified monitoring of joint ventures would  not affect foreign investors' interests since an improved  investment environment and management will help protect their  legal rights.    With some joint ventures, a major problem is tax evasion.  For example, an audit last year of 109 large joint ventures  showed they owed the State 27.82 million yuan ($3.2 million) in  back taxes and other overdue charges.</p>

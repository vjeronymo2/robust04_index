			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (2): The focus changes - Exports lift the economy's performance The Thai economy continues to defy the pessimists who predict that after three decades of rapid growth it must surely stumble. Despite fears that Thailand may be losing its competitive edge to lower cost manufacturers in China, Vietnam or Indonesia, economists at the Bank of Thailand, the central bank, have confidently predicted economic growth in excess of eight per cent for the next three years. The lack of a comprehensive industrial strategy, the inadequacy of Bangkok's transport and communications infrastructure and rising labour costs have all been cited as reasons for economic turbulence. But these problems are offset by the Bank of Thailand's steady hand on the monetary tiller, the entrepreneurial spirit of the country's Sino-Thai business families, substantial natural resources and a sizeable population in a strategic location. This became famously apparent in 1988 when the economy was first lifted into very high growth by the wave of Japanese manufacturing investment that flooded into Thailand; a three-year leap in the value of the yen - from Y252 to Y125 per dollar - had made Japan-based exports increasingly uncompetitive. By 1990 the Thai economy was overheating but Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait dampened the speculative fever. The February 1991 military coup d'etat damaged confidence as well, and many investment decisions were put on hold during the military's failed but bloody attempt to suppress pro-democracy protests in the summer of 1992. But protesters' shouts had hardly died down when it became clear - with political stability promised by prime minister Mr Chuan Leekpai's new, reformist government - that pent-up spending pressure was pushing the economy into a higher gear again. In 1993, driven by accelerating domestic demand, especially 'feel-good' consumer spending, the economy expanded by 7.9 per cent compared with 7.6 per cent in 1992. This year, while domestic demand remains strong, there has been a change of focus: the global economy's expansion has prompted a surge in exports which should see the economy grow by more than eight per cent in 1994 and 1995, according to Bank of Thailand estimates. The value of exports grew by 20.3 per cent in the January-September period this year; particularly noticeable have been a sharp increase in sales of high value-added items - exports of computers and computer parts rose 44.1 per cent. Traditional commodity sales also recovered. Rice exports rose 17.6 per cent after contracting 9 per cent in 1993. These exceptional figures are partly explained by low exports in the first half of 1993, and there would be no alarm if export growth slowed in the final months of this year. For the year as a whole, exports are expected to expand by between 16 and 20 per cent. It is a sign of the Thai economy's increasing sophistication that capacity constraints are a cause of concern. The issue was hardly debated at all before this decade. Official capacity utilisation figures are still being developed and may not be very accurate, but economists believe there is still sufficient slack in most sectors of the economy - cement and semiconductors are exceptions - to contain inflation; it needs watching but is not currently considered a serious threat. One reason why economists are so confident that the growth rate can be maintained is a new wave of Japanese investment. This latest surge of capital injection has, like previous ones, been driven by a rising yen, although there are important differences. Much of the new investment is in the form of expansion by companies already well-established in Thailand, such as Toyota. Mitsui, the conglomerate whose Thai operations are its largest outside Japan and the US, intends to invest another Dollars 3bn in the region - mostly in Thailand - in the next five years. Component suppliers are also sweeping into Thailand behind the big Japanese multinationals. 'We are handling 200 medium-sized companies who are here chasing the big brothers,' says Mr Mitsutoshi Koyama, general manager of The Sakura Bank. This latest investment wave will be shorter than the first; but it will also do less damage to the current account and feed into higher output more quickly than the first time around. The Board of Investment - which vets projects for tax breaks - has reported that investments are currently coming in at about the same level as the peak year of 1988. Mr Koyama warns against underestimating Japanese investment because much of it is now raised in Bangkok and reckons that Japanese companies have invested a total of Y400bn in the last two years. Many of the investments now being made should turn productive during the course of 1995; hence the predictions that economic growth will accelerate to nine per cent or more in 1996 before slowing somewhat for the remainder of the decade. The once worrying current account deficit is currently at its smallest level for five years at five per cent of GDP. It will inevitably rise again but for the right reasons - to perhaps a new peak of over six per cent in 1996 - before easing off quite sharply by the year 2000. In spite of the favourable medium-term outlook the pessimists can still point to the failure of the education system - only a third of the population has more than six years of schooling - which threatens the much heralded climb into higher value-added growth. New figures compiled by the Thailand Development Research Institute show that for the first time this year exports of high-tech or sunrise industries have outpaced those from low-tech, or sunset, industries. Mr Chalongphob Sussangkarn, head of the TDRI's macroeconomics programme, says it has taken only eight years for capital intensive production in Thailand to overtake labour intensive products in value, whereas in the past other east Asian economies have taken more than a decade. 'By the end of the century the high-value products could account for 70 per cent of exports - yet we have left it two decades too late to develop our own technological expertise,' Mr Chalongphob said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 16 (AFP) -- Three pieces of heavy  weaponry have been sighted by UN military observers in a  Serb-controlled neighborhood in Sarajevo, UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) officials said here Monday. The location of the  weapons -- two mortar guns and an anti-aircraft canon -- is in  violation of the UN-imposed 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion  zone around Sarajevo. UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said the  two mortar guns were sighted Sunday in Grbavica, a neighborhood  overlooking the capital. Another UN military source who  requested anonymity said the anti-aircraft gun was also found in  the same neighborhood which is under the control of Bosnian  Serbs. The Serbs earlier this month managed to sneak a tank  into the region. The tank, a T-34, disappeared while being  transported on a truck from Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale in  violation of the exclusion zone barring heavy weaponry around  Sarajevo.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Storing public records KYLE STEWART has won a Pounds 34m contract for the new Public Record Office at Ruskin Avenue, Kew. The contract comprises four works sections; the construction of the new building which will provide 12 self-contained repositories of 15,000 sq metres containing 90 kilometres of mobile shelving, as well as offices, conference and training facilities, conservation laboratories and the refurbishment of the existing building including enlarged public restaurant document search room and the relocation of the reference library. The new Public Record Office will reinforce and improve Kew's reputation with continued emphasis on the preservation of documents and their availability to the public. Work has started and the 174 week contract is scheduled for completion in June 1996. The four-storey building will have a total floor area of 27,000 sq metres and will be constructed of an in situ reinforced concrete frame clad in buff coloured precast stone panels. The pitched roof will be finished in Welsh slate. The building will be fully air-conditioned and the repositories, which have stringent environmental requirements, will be separated from other areas by atria. A computer controlled car and track system will also be installed for document transfer between the repository and the search rooms. Extensive landscaping will assist in the integration of the existing building with the extension and provide an appropriate civic setting at the Thamesside location.</p>

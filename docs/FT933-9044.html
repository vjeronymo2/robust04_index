			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Going potty - Leading nappy makers are battling for supremacy with a product aimed at toddlers It is not a pair of underpants. It is not a nappy. The disposable trainer pant is a crafty cross between the two. It is also very big business. In the past few weeks the world's foremost nappy makers have converged on the UK in a battle for supremacy in this new market. Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Peaudouce are spending several million pounds apiece in an effort to become number one with the 800,000 British toddlers who are potty trained each year. The disposable trainer pant is the result of years of research by teams of potty training experts. The parent is assured that there will be no messy accidents as the pants are as absorbent as nappies. The child can enjoy the independence of being able to pull the pants up and down. And the manufacturer can look forward to higher sales: the pants cost more than nappies, so that if they are used as substitutes sales increase, and if they are used instead of ordinary pants, sales go up further still. Parents in the US have been been buying these nappy hybrids for four years and now spend about Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) a year on them. While there is little further growth in the US market, the potty training market in the UK has great potential. On some industry estimates it could be more than 10 per cent of the disposable nappy market, which last year was worth Pounds 420m. The new product comes at a critical time for makers of disposable nappies. Sales have grown faster than almost any other consumer product in the past decade, but with about 9m nappies sold in Britain every day, the market is now saturated. Last year volumes grew by only 3 per cent and may soon start to decline as ecology minded parents reconsider whether terry nappies might not be better after all. The disposable pant is the manufacturers latest attempt to fight back. For years they concentrated on making the product increasingly sophisticated, with different kinds for boys and girls, new slim-line versions and a proliferation of different sizes. With the trainer pant they are attempting to increase the total size of the market. The hope is that parents and children will like the pants so much that they will be in less of a hurry to move into real underpants. To capture the market, each of the three players has produced a similar product, selling for a similar price, launched with a remarkably similar marketing campaign. Yet the position each starts from is markedly different. Proctor and Gamble starts from a position of strength as its Pampers brand has about 70 per cent of the British disposable nappy market, giving the new Pampers Trainers a head start. Kimberly-Clark sells no nappies in the UK, although its Huggies Pull-Ups dominate the US market. Peaudouce, which is marketing under the Up and Go brand name, has neither advantage, but it is hoping to rely on a unique selling point of its product - an elasticated waistband. All three companies are concentrating on television advertising and on direct mail. Each has a database of parents with children of potty training age and has started bombarding them with potty training advice, samples and vouchers. Over the past few weeks the offerings from Pampers and Kimberly-Clark have gone out: both containing free samples and literature that makes one wonder how anyone ever managed to get their children out of nappies without the help of the disposable training pant. Both come in different models for boys and girls: dinosaurs for boys and teddies for girls on Pampers Trainers and engines for boys and animals for girls on Huggies. The Pampers publicity pack includes a set of potty-training accessories: a sticker for the potty, a cute wall chart to mark achievements such as 'I can poo in my potty', and little medals to be awarded for potty triumphs. It also includes a pamphlet written by a specialist giving advice on how best to potty train children. Not to be outdone, Huggies promises a free potty training book with the first purchase. Peaudouce, which has been a little late off the mark, is planning a Pounds 3m campaign to launch Up and Go this autumn. This will concentrate on the fact that its nappies have an elasticated waistband, which apparently make them less likely to sag when full. All products are roughly the same price (Pounds 7 for 25 pants, compared with Pounds 7 for about 40 nappies); Huggies and Up and Go come in various sizes, whereas Pampers Trainers are in just one size. The battle is particularly intense as all three players know that there is unlikely to be room in the market for all of them. In the US the success of Kimberly-Clark has left no space for anyone else. The sheer bulk of the product means that supermarkets will not want to stock more than one of the brands. Retailers already have enough trouble displaying Pampers and own-brand nappies, as each comes in at least four different sizes and two sexes. Other nappy manufacturers are looking on in amazement as the big three pour millions of pounds into the new market. Dave Hall, marketing manger at Swaddlers, which makes nappies under the Togs brand name, is sceptical about their chances of success. 'Our market research suggests people perceive trainer pants as having a limited use. Parents who are potty training may just go for it and take nappies off totally,' he says. Careful trial marketing by Pampers and Peaudouce in the Netherlands and Ireland over the past few months suggests that parents in Europe will pay the extra for nappies that pull up and down. But whether they actually help potty train is a moot point. The Japanese, who potty train their children earlier than their European and US counterparts, would not be too impressed by the new offerings. They have been selling disposable training pants for years, but theirs are specially designed so that the child is uncomfortable when wet, and is trained faster. Children wearing the western version may be in them for years. But perhaps that is the general idea.</p>

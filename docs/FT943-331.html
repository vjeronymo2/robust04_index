			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Firm gold price aids S African recovery Johannesburg bounced back after two days of hefty decline as a firmer gold price pulled buyers back into the oversold market. Gold bullion's rally, as well as gains for leading world markets, eased nerves after the negative inflation data, a bank rate rise, and weaker world markets that drove shares lower on Monday and Tuesday. The overall index recouped 56 at 5,639, after losing 172 points in the first two days of the week. Golds picked up 41 to 2,464 and industrials advanced 78 to 6,249. De Beers collected a further 50 cents at R100, Anglos added R2 at R237 and Gencor put on 50 cents at R14.50. Amic recovered R5 to R190 after losing R13 on Tuesday.</p>

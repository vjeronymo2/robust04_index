			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AVERAGE RESALE PRICE FOR HOUSES REACHES $308,100  </P> <P> The average resale price of a single-family house in the San Fernando Valley in  June climbed 7% from the previous month to a record high $308,100, the San  Fernando Valley Board of Realtors said Monday.  </P> <P> The latest average -- which marked the first time it surpassed $300,000 --  eclipsed the $287,400 average price in May. It was up 24% from the $248,800  price recorded in June, 1988, the board said.  </P> <P> The higher prices in June came despite a 10% drop in sales of single-family  houses last month, to 1,209 units from 1,338 in May. Sales also fell 21% from a  year earlier, when 1,525 units were sold.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Condominium Resales  </P> <P> Condominium resales, meanwhile, totaled 369 in the Valley in June, down 23%  from the 481 sold in May and down 7% from the 395 sold in June, 1988, the board  said.  </P> <P> The average resale price of condominiums last month fell 7% to $143,400 from a  record high $153,400 in May but was up 12% from the $128,100 average a year  ago.  </P> <P> The board suggested that average prices overall remained strong amid lower  sales last month because a greater percentage of the sales that did occur  involved relatively expensive properties. Sales of single-family houses and  condominiums priced between $200,000 and $400,000 accounted for 41% of all  sales last month; a year earlier, they accounted for 30% of all sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rise in Interest Rate  </P> <P> Regardless, the lower overall sales last month also reflected the rise in  mortgage interest rates that occurred in the spring, which helped reduce  housing demand throughout much of the nation. Mortgage rates have since fallen  sharply again -- with fixed rates on conventional 30-year-loans dropping below  10% in some cases -- but housing analysts don't expect to see the impact of the  lower rates on sales until this month's results are known.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the continued lofty prices for Valley housing spurred a record  number of homeowners to put their properties on the market last month, the  board said. But the rush of new listings is giving house buyers more to choose  from and therefore could slow the escalation of prices, the board said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'They Now Are Competing'  </P> <P> "Because of the volume of listings on the market, sellers who priced their  property hoping to get top dollar may have to reconsider and realize they now  are competing for buyers," board President Buddy Bernard said in a statement.  </P> <P> A record 3,750 owners listed their houses on the Multiple Listing Service in  June, up 10% from 3,401 in May and up 36% from 2,750 a year ago. Overall, there  were 9,673 active listings available last month, the board said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JUNE VALLEY HOUSE SALES  </P> <P> NORTH WEST  </P> <P> Avg.

"The continued embargo prevents the port of al-'Aqabah from  developing and resuming the activity level it had in 1989,"  according to Sufyan al-Muhaysin, director of the Jordanian  shipping agents association.    "Trade should have recorded an annual growth of five to 10  percent in the last four years," he said.    In 1993, 1,498 ships docked in Aqaba, compared to 1,552 in  1989. The port handled a total of 11.55 million tonnes of goods  last year, down from the 18.5 million tonnes in 1989.    The 38 percent drop in activity from 1989 "in fact conceals  a  decrease of more than 50 percent compared to what should have  been recorded in 1993 if there had not been an embargo on Iraq  and a blockade of the port," he said.    Instead of 11.55 million tonnes, the port should have  handled  24.2 million tonnes, he said. The resulting loss in revenue for  1993 was 440 million dollars.    Since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, ships heading to al-'Aqabah  have had to submit to strict inspections by US, French and  Australian warships in the Straits of Tiran.    Because of these measures designed to stop banned goods from  reaching Iraq through Jordan, only 19 of the 40 shipping  companies that used to serve Aqaba before the Gulf crisis  continue to sail to the port.    A shipping source told AFP that Jordanian officials were in  contact with international organizations to consider a plan to  put inspectors in the port rather than at sea.    The London-based firm Lloyds has agreed to provide  inspections but a final decision was awaited from the UN  Security Council, the source said on condition of anonymity.    The Security Council imposed the embargo on Iraq days after  the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.</p>

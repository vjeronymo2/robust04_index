			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HOT-SHOOTING EDISON STOPS FOUNTAIN VALLEY'S WINNING STREAK  </P> <P> Some accurate shooting in the second quarter was enough to cool off the hottest  team in the Sunset League Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Edison High School made eight of 11 shots in the second quarter and rolled to a  61-36 victory over Fountain Valley, ending the Barons' winning streak at four  games.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley (10-11, 4-3) was coming off victories against league-leading  Marina and second-place Ocean View. The comeback victory over Ocean View came  after Fountain Valley had fallen behind by 21 points in the second quarter.  </P> <P> But Coach Gordon Billingsley suited up only seven players against Edison and  the results were predictable. Edison's physical frontline wore down Fountain  Valley and turned the game into a mismatch.  </P> <P> Edison (16-6, 5-2) utilized the inside scoring of center Bill Martineau and the  all-around play of sixth man Todd Smyser to gain control early. Edison opened a  21-10 lead with 6:19 remaining in the second quarter when guard Tom Tyler made  two free throws and Fountain Valley never recovered.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley was playing without starting forward Eric Zellmer and Vince  Nguyen, a key reserve. Zellmer was injured in an automobile accident last  weekend and didn't suit up. He was wearing a neck brace, and Billingsley said  the senior is out indefinitely.  </P> <P> "He's lucky he wasn't seriously injured," Billingsley said.  </P> <P> Nguyen was declared academically ineligible for the rest of the season.  Earlier, Fountain Valley lost a key returning starter, Doug Weaver, when he had  knee surgery after the football season.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley's depth problems were compounded when starting guard Doug  Corcoran, the team's best outside shooter, fouled out with 5:21 remaining in  the third quarter and his team trailing, 45-24.  </P> <P> "When we lost Corcoran, that sealed our fate," Billingsley said.  </P> <P> Martineau led all scorers with 22 points and had eight rebounds before retiring  to the bench with 2:20 remaining and his team leading, 56-36. Smyser added 12  points, including a pair of three-point shots, and had nine rebounds.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of up-and-down play out there, and I don't exactly know why,"  said Jon Borchert, the Edison coach. "Those were the same seven guys who were  down by 21 points and beat Ocean View Saturday night. I still can't believe  that."  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Marina 74, Huntington Beach 57 -- Cherokee Parks, who had 16 rebounds, scored  13 of his game-high 34 points in the fourth quarter for visiting Marina (14-8,  6-1). Brant Shelor had eight points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the  Vikings. Mustapha Abdi had 15 points for Huntington Beach (8-13, 1-6).  </P> <P> Ocean View 69, Westminster 56 -- Ryan Martin had 16 points and Jim Gwaltney had  15 to lead Ocean View (13-8, 5-2) over visiting Westminster (5-14, 0-7). Jim  Harris had 11 points and seven assists for Ocean View. Jessie Gomez had 21  points.  </P></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Birmingham Midshires acquisition BIRMINGHAM Midshires building society, the 13th largest in the UK, has acquired the bulk of the UK residential mortgage portfolio of Canada's Royal Trust Bank. The purchase price of Pounds 160m is close to the level at which the mortgages are carried on the books of Gentra, RT Bank's Toronto-based parent. Most of the mortgages cover properties in southern England. Gentra, formerly known as Royal Trustco, is selling its operations to Royal Bank of Canada. The proceeds from the UK sale are required to make up a shortfall in the value of loans sold to Royal Bank. Gentra said it was negotiating the sale of the rest of its UK residential mortgages and another deal was expected to be finalised next month. The assets sold to Birmingham Midshires make up about 40 per cent of RT Bank's real estate exposure. The bank is also trying to sell parts of its UK commercial and retail property loans. RT Bank, which has had a presence in London for more than 60 years, is unlikely to survive for long as a separate entity. Royal Bank is taking over its treasury operations and liabilities, while Gentra is shrinking its asset base.</p>

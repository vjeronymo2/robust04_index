			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] (Sonia Ciambatti), former magistrate of the Supreme  Court of Justice, said that the Executive Branch, through the  Central Bank of Venezuela, will begin operating a data base that  will allow the detection and neutralization of money transfers  linked to drug-trafficking activities that are coming into the  country from overseas. (Ciambatti) made the announcement within  the framework of a conference in Caracas on U.S. experiences in  fighting money laundering in the United States.    If money laundering is not eradicated, it is capable of  spilling over and harming the financial system of a nation,  because people involved in money laundering take advantage of  the system for their own benefit. According to (Ciambatti),  Venezuela has acquired international tools, such as the Vienna  Convention and the standard regulations on the legitimization of  capital, that enable a country to fight the crime. Establishing  the proposed data base, therefore, will be a smooth process.    [Begin (Ciambatti) recording, in progress] ... so there is a  check to allow only banking transfers and economic situations  that are entirely legal and which benefit the country and to  keep Venezuela from becoming a center of operations for  international drug-trafficking activities.

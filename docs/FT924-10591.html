			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Aerospace staff march to save jobs MORE THAN 2,000 UK aerospace workers, led by a Scottish piper and a jazz band, marched to the Houses of Parliament yesterday to lobby for government intervention to save jobs in the hard-pressed aerospace industry. Union leaders warned that the whole industry, Britain's biggest exporter of manufactured goods, was at risk. The unions said that even after losing 40,000 jobs during the last two years, a further 70,000 jobs might disappear unless the government acted urgently to support the industry. Mr John Weakley, an executive member of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, told a rally in a London hotel before the protest march: 'The effects of the closure of aerospace sites such as Hatfield and Kingston are just as devastating as the closure of pits at Grimethorpe and Markham Main.' Yesterday's protest followed extensive restructuring at British Aerospace, which announced last month the closure of its historic Hatfield plant and an additional 3,000 job cuts. Other leading UK aerospace companies such as Rolls-Royce, Westland, Smiths Industries, Dowty, and Lucas, have been forced to make substantial job cuts because of a decline in defence spending and the deep recession in the civil aviation business. The UK aerospace industry at present employs 150,000 people. The unions believe the biggest danger to future jobs in the industry is posed by the threatened European Fighter Aircraft project. They say that 20,000 UK jobs depend directly on this project and 20,000 indirectly. A union leader said that although it was not as emotional an issue as the future of the UK coal mining industry, it was a much bigger one because it involved the whole future of UK manufacturing. With the slogan 'Keep aerospace flying', the unions urged the government to proceed as fast as possible with the EFA even if Britain's partners - Germany, Italy and Spain - pull out. The unions are also asking the government to launch a plan to help the defence sector to diversify into civil activities.</p>

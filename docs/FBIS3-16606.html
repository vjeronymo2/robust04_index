The court ruled the published data was false and the owner  of  the paper, AS Myyt, must in ten days apologize in the weekly  "Eesti Aeg"( Estonian time) before the seven plaintiffs and play  damages in the amount of 70,000 kroons ($5,000).    "Eesti Aeg" in its five issues last spring published the  list  of alleged KGB informers claiming the list had been found in a  notebook of a KGB officer.    The list was quite lengthy, but only seven people decided to  take legal action.</p>

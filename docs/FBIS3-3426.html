			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa leaves here Saturday [19 March] for Beijing on  a three-day official visit to China where he hopes to emphasize  the development of future bilateral ties between the two  neighboring countries.    During his first official China trip since taking office  last  August, Hosokawa will hold talks with President Jiang Zemin and  Premier Li Peng on bilateral and international issues, Chinese  and Japanese officials said.    He will also fly to Shanghai on Monday to visit the Pudong  Development Zone, the officials said.    The prime minister told a group of Chinese journalists today  that he hopes to reaffirm the consensus arrived at by Japanese  and Chinese leaders that the bilateral relationship should be  future-oriented and contribute to the world.    "I hope that the two sides will hold very meaningful talks  and exchange views frankly with each other," he said.    Hosokawa's visit comes at a time when there are no major  pending issues between Japan and China, a Japanese Foreign  Ministry official said.    Both countries feel satisfied over the smooth development of  bilateral ties and hope to further develop them toward the 21st  century, the officials said.    They said recent exchanges between Chinese and Japanese  leaders have brought the mature relationship into "a new era of  development."    Jiang visited Japan in April 1992, while Emperor Akihito and  Empress Michiko toured China in October of that year in  celebration of the 20th anniversary of the normalization of  diplomatic ties.    Under Hosokawa's government, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  met his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen in September, and  Hosokawa held talks with Jiang in Seattle in November when they  met at an unofficial summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation Forum.    In January this year, Hata visited Beijing and Chinese Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji came to Japan last month.    The bilateral trade volume reached 39 billion U.S. dollars  last year, when Japan took over Hong Kong to become China's  largest trading partner while China became Japan's second  largest trading partner after the United States.    The officials said Hosokawa will express Japan's continued  support for China's reform to shift to a market economy and  backing for Beijing's bid to become a full member of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Hosokawa will also supervise the signing of an environment  cooperation treaty during his visit, they said.    Under the accord to be signed, Japan will provide China with  technology to combat acid rain, and air and water pollution in  the wake of China's rapid industrialization, according to the  officials.</p>

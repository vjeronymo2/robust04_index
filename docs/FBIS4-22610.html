			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Konovalov, director of </F> the United States and Canada Institute (ISKAN) Center for  Military Policy and Systems Analysis, and Sergey Konstantinovich  Oznobishchev, director of the ISKAN Center for Problems of  International Security: "Partnership for Peace: The Road for  Which Russia Has To Opt"]    [Text] "Many serious politicians in the West still  believe that NATO should even now admit the countries of East  and Central Europe to guard them against the instabilities and  uncertainties of the development of the domestic political  situation in Russia and possible relapses into imperial policy  of the totalitarian state."    Various departments of the executive, primarily the Foreign  Ministry, Ministry of Defense, and the Security Council, have  reached full agreement, it would seem, concerning the expediency  for Russia of affiliation to the "Partnership for Peace" program  proposed in January at the meeting of NATO heads of state in  Brussels. This was shown clearly by the visit to Moscow of U.S.  Defense Secretary William Perry. Pavel Grachev, minister of  defense of the Russian Federation, expressed the assumption  following the meeting with his American colleague that the  corresponding document could be signed before the end of March.  And although Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev was more guarded in his  assessment of the timeframe necessary for preparation for this  event, there is every reason to believe that it will happen  quite soon.    At the same time, on the other hand, the decision on  Russia's  affiliation to the NATO initiative aroused increased interest on  the part of the legislature, and special hearings were held in  the State Duma on the ascertainment and evaluation of the  consequences of affiliation to the Partnership for Peace, which  showed that a number of the people's elect do not share the  optimism of representatives of the departments concerning the  fact that Russia's inclusion in this program would correspond to  its interests. The debate in the press shows that opinions in  this connection differ among independent experts also. Fears  that affiliation to the program would reduce Russia's space for  foreign policy maneuver and even lead to its dangerous political  dependence on NATO are being expressed. Theorists from the ranks  of the neo-state absolutists are emphasizing that affiliation to  the program would signify the creation of a "monocentric Europe  and Russia's loss of the role of power center." But before  attempting to take issue with sketches whose connection with the  diversity of the political landscape would in itself seem  arguable and to evaluate the consequences of such a step for  Russia, we should clearly formulate what, in fact, is being  offered our country and that with which, by all accounts, we  have decided to associate.    Let us begin by saying that the mere fact of affiliation to  the program of the Partnership for Peace (or PFP, as it is  called for short in some analytical documents) by no means  signifies a "deprivation of rights" and will not entail  limitations of Russia's sovereignty or some strict financial  obligations. The very adoption of this program was not so much a  strategic initiative of NATO as a response to at least two  outside factors.    On the one hand it is a question of concentrated pressure on  the part of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which  were endeavoring by might and main to join NATO and obtain  guarantees of security against uncertainties of the political  course and the possibility of a return of a totalitarian  expansionist regime in Russia. On the other, a part was played  by the active and cogent foreign policy course of Russia, which  is endeavoring to prevent an expansion of the alliance and a new  division of Europe. It was here, perhaps, that quite convincing  arguments were found in support of the fact that an expansion of  NATO would be contrary to its own long-term interests and would  have negative consequences both for European security and for  the prospects of democratic development and internal political  stability in Russia itself.    Thus had there been no Partnership for Peace program, it  would have to have been invented. For the West this program was  largely a forced measure. It appeared as a compromise  demonstrating on the one hand that the Western countries are  prepared to take account of the reasonably formulated  national-state interests of Russia and are not in the least  interested in a destabilization of its already none-too-stable  domestic political situation; on the other, the countries  wishing to join NATO were offered the possibility of  military-political cooperation, which puts off the question of  their full membership of this organization indefinitely,  although does not exclude it in principle. That is, in the  difficult situation in January 1994 Russian diplomacy was able  to score a pronounced success. This success should not now be  lost in fruitless political debate but should be rapidly  switched to the plane of real cooperation, it having been made  undoubtedly attractive and beneficial for Russia.    The NATO initiative was formulated such as to permit quite a  broad interpretation and the possibility of influence on its  practical filling. Having approved the Partnership for Peace  program, the leaders of the NATO countries expounded it in  Brussels in two documents. One is a framework document and  formulates the general principles and tasks of the program, the  second is an invitation sent to potential partners wishing to  associate with this initiative. It would seem that, following  familiarization, the first document should not give rise to  protest even among the toughest opponents of the one-sided  Atlantic "pro-West" orientation of Russian foreign policy  inasmuch as it contains goals that are common and positive for  each normal democratic state. These are assurance of civilian  political control over the military sphere, an expansion of  transparency and openness in the process of the discussion and  adoption of military budgets, cooperation in the peacekeeping  sphere, and so forth.    It is extremely important to emphasize that it is in fact  anticipated that each signatory state will develop with NATO its  own, individual partnership program, as it were. It has at the  same time to be noted that the so-called "invitation" to  participate in the Partnership for Peace program contains  statements to the effect that the NATO states "would welcome its  expansion thanks to democratic neighbors in the East" and that  the program itself should perform an important role "in the  process of the evolutionary expansion of NATO." So Russia, which  has already adopted a decision on its affiliation to the  Partnership for Peace program, will have to determine which  versions of its practical realization are acceptable for it and,  having made this decision, use its influence to ensure that  participation in it correspond as much as possible to our  long-term national interests. But it is essential for this to  have a clear idea of what these interests consist. There is no  such clarity as yet. The few documents on this score, "Basic  Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation"  included, do not provide an answer to this question, although  they do mention our country's "vitally important interests."  True, the authors of the "Basic Provisions" allude to the fact  that this document is merely a component of the overall concept  of security, which has yet to be devised. But any military  doctrine becomes a workable document only when it has support in  the form of consensus among the main institutions of power. We  are still a along way off from this here, it would seem. Thus  any appeal to Russia's national interests with reference to  "partnership for peace" cannot contain axioms and should be  viewed on the basis of the sum total of evidence in support of  this proposition or the other.    The question of whether it will not be too late after Russia  has aligned itself with the initiative to think about its  practical filling could arise. It would seem not inasmuch as  formal affiliation to the PFP, that is, the signing of the  framework document, is only the first procedural step--a kind of  demonstration of intent. It should be followed by the  elaboration of a "Presentation Document," which should formulate  how Russia sees its participation in the program and the goals  to whose achievement it aspires. Of course, it will be necessary  here to do what Russia has traditionally disliked doing--display  initiative, think, and act. It would be possible to opt for  another approach which was proposed by an independent expert and  which he formulated in a question which is almost Hamlet-like,  but with a nuance of our national philosophy--"why join if it is  possible not to join?"    This approach to foreign policy may be defined as  entropic--minimizing the consumption of energy--but it is far  removed from the task of assurance of Russia's vital interests.  Underlying it is a fear as to whether Russia, having affiliated  with the program, could somehow influence it from within. Those  who harbor such misgivings could be reminded (granted all the  conditionality of historical analogies) how the Socialist  Republic of Romania formerly displayed an independence, enviable  and dangerous for those times, within the Warsaw Pact and  influenced the policy of this bloc in its own interests. There  is even reason to believe that Romania made its contribution to  the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, operating from within. So are  Russia's possibilities to be doubted?    So which most important priorities of Russia's national  security policy should be reflected in the "Presentation  Document"? Russia categorically would not be suited by an  expansion of NATO in the event of it remaining outside of this  alliance. And it is not a question of the admittance of new  members representing a direct military threat to it now or in  the foreseeable future. Such an expansion would be perceived as  Russia's military-political isolation and would predetermine the  inevitability of a new division of Europe. Such a policy would  be tantamount to the start of the building of a new version of  the Berlin Wall, which would have moved considerably closer to  Smolensk and Moscow, but would not for this reason have become a  more positive factor of European security.    Many serious politicians in the West still believe that NATO  should even now admit the countries of East and Central Europe  to guard them against the instabilities and uncertainties of the  development of the domestic political situation in Russia and  possible relapses into imperial policy of the totalitarian state.    Unfortunately, Russian political reality affords grounds for  such apprehensions. We are increasingly becoming a country not  only with an "unpredictable past" but also an "unpredictable  future." A number of objections to this could be found, but it  is hard to dispute the fact that a resolution of a  constitutional crisis with the engagement of a "limited  contingent" of tanks and combat operations in the center of the  capital did not serve to strengthen the conviction in Europe or  throughout the world as to the irreversibility of the policy of  reforms and democracy. And the results of the December elections  by no means induced anyone to finally cast aside all doubts  concerning the prospects of civilian democratic rule in Russia.  Strobe Talbott, first deputy U.S. secretary of state, recently  declared that he was worried about the fate of the democratic  reforms in Russia and believes that, in the event of their  failure and a recoil to totalitarianism in Russia, the  Partnership for Peace initiative could serve also as a  protective barrier against its expansion.    At the same time any serious expert is well aware that  neither now nor in the foreseeable future will Russia, while  remaining a strong military power, be in a position, for all  that, to "project" this might outside of its national territory,  even less outside of the territory of the former USSR. So what  is the point of building a system of protection against a threat  which does not exist and which cannot appear in the near future,  provoking internal political shifts in Russia that could, even  though not rapidly, make this threat real.    This conclusion also testifies in support of the need for  Russian affiliation to the Partnership for Peace program  inasmuch as without it this initiative would become a NATO  "preparatory class," and the entry into the alliance of new  members would only be a matter of time. That is, it should be  stated clearly that Russia will subscribe to the program,  considering it essential to counterpose to the expansion of NATO  a positive alternative--the creation within the framework of  this program of the foundation of a future system of European  security, in which Russia and the countries of East and Central  Europe are subsequently integrated as NATO's equal partners.    At the same time, on the other hand, Russia's affiliation to  the program with the aim of its speediest membership of NATO,  before its former allies even, perhaps, would be, it would seem,  a serious strategic mistake. It is the Eurasian aspect of  Russia's interests that is important here. We would recall how  the report prepared by the Foreign Intelligence Service of the  Russian Federation argued the unacceptability of an expansion of  NATO for Russia. It pointed out as a most important reason that  the very approach, without hostile intentions even, to the  borders of Russia of a military grouping with such offensive  potential as NATO would fundamentally change the  military-strategic situation and compel it to adopt the  appropriate countermeasures in the approaches to military  organizational development, the disposition and number of force  groupings deployed, and so forth.    We can imagine quite unambiguously the negative reaction of  China or other Asian neighbors of Russia when it transpires that  they border a new military-political alliance whose offensive  potential is composed of the potentials of NATO, at least 16  other European countries, and Russia. It would certainly have to  be recognized that the Asian states bordering Russia, primarily  China, would in this case be entitled to take adequate steps,  which would unequivocally have a negative effect on security and  stability in the region and in the world as a whole.  Consequently, it is essential even now to display concern to  ensure that the building of a system of European security with  Russia's participation not be perceived as a threat to the  Muslim countries or China. It is essential that Russia display  particular punctiliousness on this issue inasmuch as it is far  more vulnerable than the European countries to possible  retaliatory measures on the part of its Asian neighbors.    Another important argument expressed by opponents of the  program in Russia consists of fears of a loss of the traditional  markets for the sale of Russian arms in the European countries  that formerly belonged to the Warsaw Pact. Mr. Zatulin, chairman  of the State Duma Committee for Relations with the CIS and  Compatriots' Affairs, even indicates that Russia's affiliation  to the Partnership for Peace would signify "the death of  Russia's military-industrial complex." It would seem that such  misgivings fail to take account of at least two factors. First,  the NATO program itself by no means implies a transition to some  common standard weapons systems. As far as its further  development is concerned, much here should depend on our own  position.    Second, the talk about the death of Russia's  military-industrial complex because of the loss of the East  European markets would seem somewhat exaggerated for purely  economic reasons. According to the figures of a most  authoritative source in this sphere--the Stockholm International  Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)--total arms exports from Russia  in 1992 constituted $2.043 billion, of which arms totaling $139  million were sold to developed countries, to which our East  European customers pertain, that is, less than 7 percent of the  total. And whereas, what is more, our arms exports in the period  1990 through 1992 to the developing countries declined by a  factor of 3.5, to the developed countries, by a factor of 22.4.  So events on the arms markets in the East European countries  undesirable for us were taking place even before the appearance  of the Partnership for Peace program. What has been said by no  means signifies that Russia should not fight for the possibility  of sales of its arms to the East European countries. But the  Partnership for Peace creates no obstacles to this. On the  contrary, new opportunities, which, however, may be realized  only in keen competitive struggle, could, possibly, emerge for  Russia's military-industrial complex within the framework of  this program.    One further fear voiced by the opponents of affiliation to  the Partnership for Peace is connected with the fact that other  states of the CIS would fasten onto this program also (some have  already done so, others are about to) and that this would  undermine the fragile prospects of military-political  integration within the CIS that have begun to emerge. We should  probably agree that the formulation of a coordinated approach to  the NATO initiative on the part of the states of the CIS, the  members of the Tashkent Collective Security Treaty at least,  would be advisable. But what has prevented or is preventing us  doing this and discussing it within the CIS?    So the numerous declarations concerning the end of the cold  war and our calls concerning the need for transition from  confrontation to strategic partnership are beginning to move  into the sphere of practical action. Russia should undoubtedly  take this step. It would be incomprehensible, to say the least,  why we, who have said so much about our aspiration to partner  relations, would suddenly attempt to distance ourselves from  them, condemning ourselves to self-isolation. Participation in  them would by no means signify a disregard for Russia's national  interests. But what would undoubtedly have to be renounced would  be cliches of confrontational thinking and bipolar, trench logic.    It should be regretfully acknowledged that the transition to  partner relations with the West has occurred largely in words,  at the declarative level, and has affected to a considerably  lesser extent the sphere of actual policy. The presence, as  before, of the inordinately military component of our superpower  status, nuclear weapons included, and the extreme internal  political instability demand particular attention and dictate  the need for Russia's affiliation to the Partnership for Peace  program on special terms (the nature thereof could be agreed  preliminarily and formalized in an individual partnership  program). Nonetheless, it is impossible to confine ourselves to  these considerations. Russia has performed and will continue to  perform an outstanding role in Europe and the world not only in  the military-political respect. No serious analyst even today  could dispute the presence in our country of enormous potential  in literally all spheres.    The normal workmanlike process not only of Russia's  affiliation to this program but also of our country's entry into  partner relations is being hampered by the evolved nature of the  discussion of most important foreign policy questions, which can  often only be called discussion by stretching the point. The  actual path of the formulation of decisions and the role and  place therein of the newly elected parliament, which for some  reason or other joined in the discussion of "partnership" when  the executive had in practice already determined the timeframe  of Russia's entry into this program, would seem chaotic, as  before. Discussion of any important matter, the Partnership for  Peace included, is frequently regarded not from the viewpoint of  Russia's actual interests but through the prism of the  opportunist interests of politicians' extension of the time of  their stay in the upper echelons of power (particularly with the  prospect of new elections for everyone within two years).    It is clear that performing purposeful work on the  elaboration of policy and on the assurance of Russia's national  interests, within the framework of "partnership" included, is  far more complex than "not joining." After all, it is in this  key sphere for future security that there have been more words  than deeds. It is a long time since we heard our own proposals  in this field, not simply belated "responses" to the development  of events. Nor, finally, would it do any harm to determine our  position as regards the basic postulates of the foundation of  all partner relations--Russia's national interests and their  priorities.    It was recently learned, incidentally, that Switzerland,  which is proud of its long neutrality, has decided to affiliate  with the Partnership for Peace in the near future. It does not  intend to renounce its neutral status, is not planning to join  NATO, and is not even about to take part in joint military  maneuvers. At the same time, on the other hand, Switzerland is  unwilling to remain aloof from the process of military-political  integration in Europe. But if such a small state is not afraid  to align itself with the program, should Russia be guided by  baseless fears?</p>

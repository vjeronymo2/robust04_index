Aslam, president of  the Pakistan Socialist Party; Ghulam Nadikalr, chairman of the  Workers and Peasants Party of Pakistan; Miraj Khalid, chairman  of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organisation of Pakistan;  Mazari Ali Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Peace Council; and 7  other leading officials of political parties and organisations  of Pakistan made public a joint appeal on April 14 on the  occasion of the first anniversary of the publication of  "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for  the Reunification of the Country" advanced by the great leader  President Kim Il-song.    Noting that the great leader President Kim Il-song is making  consistent efforts to achieve the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country, the appeal called upon the  government, the people and all political party leaders of  Pakistan to positively support the 10-point programme.    The appeal called upon the South Korean people to put  pressure upon the South Korean authorities to discard the idea  of submitting to outside forces, get the U.S. troops and nuclear  weapons withdrawn from South Korea and pull down the concrete  wall.    The appeal called upon the people of the United States to  urge the U.S. administration to immediately stop the military  provocations in the Korean peninsula and withdraw the U.S.  troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea and upon all member  nations of the United Nations to bar the United States from  using international organisations in threatening and  blackmailing the sovereignty of the DPRK.</p>

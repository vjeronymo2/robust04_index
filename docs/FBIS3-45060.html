Top government cadres have admitted that  a lack of investment was partly responsible for the  water-shortage crisis that was afflicting two-thirds of Chinese  cities as of last year, according to official statistics. The  water ministry officials told the GUANGMING DAILY that the  resulting economic losses were causing serious concern at all  government levels and they called on people to save water  wherever possible.    The newspaper also quoted the mayor of the free-wheeling  southern special economic zone of Shenzhen as saying water  shortfalls were making it impossible to implement reforms and  maintain rapid economic development. The lack of attention  given to the water crisis is the most serious mistake China has  made in the past 10 years, the mayor said. Shenzhen's daily  water shortfall is currently estimated at 100,000 cubic metres  (3.5 million cubic feet).    The newspaper also quoted officials in Beijing as saying  that, by 2000, the capital will have no quality drinking water  unless steps are taken immediately.</p>

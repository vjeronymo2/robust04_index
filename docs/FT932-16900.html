			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Interest rate cut as Belgium emerges from political crisis THE BELGIAN central bank yesterday marked the end of the country's short-lived government crisis by cutting its central interest rate from 8.2 per cent to the pre-crisis level of 8 per cent. The centre-left coalition had won a vote of confidence from parliament in the early hours of yesterday morning. On Tuesday, the King of Belgium formally turned down the government's week-old resignation offer after Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, had persuaded the four coalition parties to agree a package of budget measures. These should help bring Belgium's budget deficit in line with the Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary union by 1996. Mr Alfons Verplaetse, central bank governor, dismissed the crisis yesterday as a hiccough in the country's programme for economic convergence with other EC members. The deficit stood at 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product last year, compared with a target of 3 per cent by 1996, but BFr113bn (Pounds 2.26bn) of austerity measures should help bring it down to 4.7 per cent by the end of next year. Mr Verplaetse said currency speculators who concentrated on the country's public-sector finances had ignored the fact that Belgium's current account had shown a healthy surplus since 1986, unlike those of many of its 11 partners in the EC. During the crisis, Belgium's central rate was raised from 8 per cent to 8.5 per cent to help protect the Belgian franc. It was cut to 8.2 per cent on Wednesday. The end-of-day rate was also cut yesterday - from 9.2 per cent to 9 per cent.</p>

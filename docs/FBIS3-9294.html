			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zvonko Maric] </F>   [Text] The past 20 days on the free territory of the  Hadzici commune have passed in the spirit of the cease-fire,  albeit burdened by numerous gatherings of the families of 189  missing persons, Bosniak Muslims from Hadzici. This prompted  the commune authorities and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to  intensify negotiations on the exchange of prisoners. Late last  night a meeting took place between our negotiating team -- Edo  Godinjak, a representative of the republican Interior Ministry,  Nedir Hadzic, the commander of the 9th Hill Brigade, and  Brigadier Ajnadzic, who heads the team -- and representatives of  the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] headed by Commander Santana.    At the very beginning of the meeting, Brigadier Ajnadzic  made  a goodwill gesture by offering several concessions to the  aggressor side in order finally to deblock the process of  exchanging prisoners from Silos for the 189 missing Hadzici  citizens, which has generally been the toughest issue in the  negotiations between [Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina  Haris] Silajdzic and [Bosnian Serb official Momcilo] Krajisnik.  It was agreed that today three prisoners from Silos prison  would be exchanged for three prisoners from Kula. Four captured  aggressor soldiers, which the prisoners in Silos elected  themselves, were permitted to attend last night's meeting.  Brigadier Ajnadzic proposed that a meeting be arranged on the  free territory of the Hadzici commune between the  representatives of four families of the captured aggressor  soldiers with the families of the missing Hadzici citizens.  Moreover, all the Serbian representatives will be allowed to  visit the prisoners in Silos. It was also decided that from  today [23 March], the prisoners from Silos would be allowed to  establish telephone contact with [words indistinct] with  families in Hadzici.    Mr. Santana expressed his gratitude for our delegation's  concessions, and did not hide his dissatisfaction with the  uncooperative attitude of the aggressor side, saying that he had  the impression that it was not interested in the exchange,  something that cannot be said for the family members of the  Silos prisoners. Edo Godinjak, representative of the republican  Interior Ministry, promised the UNPROFOR representatives that,  in the course of the day, he would submit to them substantial  documented video material that the republican Interior Ministry  had obtained, which documents the ways, places, and those  responsible for capturing the 189 Bosniak Muslim citizens of  Hadzici. This material will help Captain Mason, who heads  UNPROFOR's investigative team, locate the missing persons.  According to Mr. Godinjak, Ratko Radic, Zoran Gasevic, Rade  Veselinovic, Kiro Glagas, and Mladen Tolj participated in the  capture of the missing persons. Commander of the 9th Hill  Brigade Nedir Hadzic expressed his readiness to go ahead with an  immediate exchange, but he stressed that the local authorities  would not agree to any of the types of blackmail that the  aggressor side has been using in prisoner exchange negotiations  since the beginning of the war. The agreement will be  implemented today, provided that the aggressor side decides to  cooperate, of course.</p>

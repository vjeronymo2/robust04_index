			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Botnar begins court case MR OCTAV BOTNAR, chairman of Nissan UK, the former importer of Nissan cars, yesterday began a High Court action to recover Pounds 6m from the Japanese carmaker. Nissan UK claims that the Japanese company has defaulted on an agreement to pay for sales and marketing support in connection with sales of its Bluebird range. Nissan denies such an agreement ever existed. The case is expected to last almost two weeks. Mr Botnar lives in Switzerland and has refused to return to Britain since police issued a warrant for his arrest concerning the tax affairs of Nissan UK. The trial of Mr Michael Hunt, a Nissan UK director charged with defrauding the Inland Revenue, will start next month.</p>

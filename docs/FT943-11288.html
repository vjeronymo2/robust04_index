			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Arts: Codes of honour put to the test - 'Le Cid' at the Cottesloe Sculptural horses frozen in mid-gallop hover above the stage; two huge gilded frames turn the action into a picture - one empty, the other containing a transparent mirror where characters can see themselves and through which others can loom. Is someone recalling the famous, or infamous, ENO Masked Ball? Designer Peter J. Davidson is certainly an old opera hand. But, despite these visual echoes, Jonathan Kent's production of Corneille's Le Cid at the National Theatre's Cottesloe comes up with nothing so revolutionary. The French Classical theatre is notoriously hard to bring off in English. 'Le style, c'est tout,' and that's the trouble. Even replacing the six-beat alexandrine with the traditional English pentameter leaves us with the problem of rhyme. We associate rhyming couplets with pantomime, with facetiousness, the intentionally frivolous and unintentionally bathetic. Of course, there are some successful translations, notably in Moliere and versions of Corneille by Ranjit Bolt. Bolt provides the translation for this Cid, much of it good, no-nonsense rhyming pentameters, getting over the nitty-gritty of the love-versus-duty plot. Some rhymes have a period flexibility ('pursuit/driven to't'), some are more strained ('by it/right'). Some have the fatal ring of a McGonagal: 'Two kings were captured on a single day/Nothing could stand in the young hero's way.' But surely not on the banks of the silvery Tay. More interestingly, and perhaps disturbingly, Bolt has compromised with the English sense of the ridiculous. Where the French grand siecle postures, preens and poses, English theatre cultivates the pragmatic. Le Cid portrays the anguished application of a code of honour unstoppably unleashed when the father of our hero is mortally insulted by the father of the hero's betrothed. A blood feud results. Rodrigo (the Cid) kills his future father-in-law which miffs his fiancee Ximena no end. She in turn demands vengeance though she still adores him. English couplets certainly deflate the pomposity but reduce the nobly eloquent protagonists to the level of garrulous mafiosi caught up in a mindlessly murderous tit-for-tat to be terminated when nanny bangs their heads together. Bolt seeks to suspend our disbelief, perhaps simply to keep our interest, by introducing a sardonic element of - could it be? - mockery in the figure of the Castilian king, whom Bernard Lloyd plays disastrously well. Urbane, witty, dry, fatally gifted with common sense, he gently ends the giddy vortex of honour-bound vengefulness that the ranting Ximena and the sorrowful Cid are caught up in, even using the word 'pointless' of the characters' guiding principles. The trouble is that once you think about it in these terms it undermines the whole previous 100 minutes . . . Kent's production, on the other hand, initially takes the piece seriously, inspiring some stately tableaux in Mark Henderson's dramatically dimming lighting and good romantic playing from the cast. In the title-role Duncan Bell looks every inch and sounds every diphthong the young gallant torn between love and a code of behaviour that makes political correctness look like Liberty Hall. Susan Lynch is a promising if coarse-grained Ximena: strong, rather tough, featured, she tends to yell at moments of stress. Crudeness of attack, far from adding to the very real intensity she generates, merely leaves one wishing for tighter control and discipline. Translation and possibly production seem to resign themselves to audience laughter at Ximena's bull-in-a-china-shop love-and-death emotionalism. The nice indication of her hysteria, when she refers to the sword of the Cid's opponent as 'still bloody' gets overlooked in the general conviction that she is almost off her rocker. It may be one way to express Corneille's dramatic vibrancy to a sceptical British audience, but I wonder whether it is the right one. Costumed as for Spain's Golden Age (Philip II going on Cervantes), the company do their best with actresses as distinguished as Faith Brook and June Watson looking concerned as confidantes. As the squabbling fathers who trigger the tragedy, Edward de Souza and Alan MacNaughtan are snarling, toothless old curs, not too stiff in the joints that they cannot destroy their children's happiness for their own pride, capable of the bland vanity of such lines as 'Prove yourself to be/A worthy son to such a man as me'. The real heroine emerges from the shadows of a sub-plot, that phenomenon detested by French classicism. Samantha Bond brings tragic dignity to the figure of the Infanta, the king's daughter who loves Rodrigo but, knowing marriage to be impossible for reasons of rank, does all she can to throw him together with Ximena. She is left at the play's guardedly happy ending rocking silently in pain, an indication of how the piece might still move if all parties shared the same attitude towards it. If you see Cid, tell him.</p>

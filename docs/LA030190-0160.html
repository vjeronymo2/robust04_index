			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Newman for the Defense: Paul Newman's legal rematch begins with jury selection  Wednesday in Bridgeport, Conn.  </P> <P> Newman is being sued by a Westport deli owner who wants a share of Newman's  food business because he claims he helped develop it. The first trial, which  featured testimony from Newman himself, ended in a mistrial in 1988 after  jurors were inadvertently given documents that had been ruled inadmissible.  Newman denies that the deli owner helped develop his salad dressing and that he  promised him a cut of his company's profits. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

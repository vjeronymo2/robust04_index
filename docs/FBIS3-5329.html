			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The government will likely suffer a  budget deficit this fiscal year due to the fall in oil prices  and higher-than-expected spending. "It is almost certain that  the state revenues will fall short of the initial estimate,  while spending for routine activities will be higher than  originally projected," Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad said  here yesterday.    The state budget for the 1993-1994 fiscal year, to end next  month, should, by law, balance at Rp [Rupiah] 62.32 trillion  (US$29.6 billion). Receipts from the oil and gas sectors are  expected to account for 28.7 percent of the total revenue  projection.    Mar'ie told reporters following a hearing with the Budgetary  Commission of the House of Representatives (DPR) yesterday that  the fall in oil prices will significantly reduce the  government's income from oil and gas taxes, which are projected  to reach Rp 15.12 trillion ($7.2 billion) in the current fiscal  year. The estimate of the state receipts from oil and gas taxes  is based on an average oil price of $18 per barrel, far higher  than the realized average price of $16.50 in the first 10 months  of this fiscal year.    Oil prices on the world market are now hovering at around  $13  per barrel.    Mar'ie said the higher-than-expected increase in routine  spending, especially for the salaries of civil servants and  armed forces members, will widen the deficit. The minister  refused to explain the amount of the deficit in the 1993-1994  fiscal year but said that the fall in the state revenues will  not cause a major blow to the government's coffers. "The  government will partly use its development fund reserves to  cover the expected deficit," he said. The government has  allocated around Rp 3.5 trillion ($1.6 billion) as reserves to  finance the shortfall in the state revenues.    The minister pledged during yesterday's hearing, which  deliberated the state budget for 1994-1995, that the government  will not introduce any drastic measures to manage the country's  economy next fiscal year despite the continued fall in oil  prices.    Yesterday's session was the third day of deliberation which  will end today, on the 1994-1995 state budget. The budget plan  will be further deliberated in the House's plenary session on  Saturday before being passed into law.    The state revenues and expenditures for the 1994-1995 fiscal  year are estimated to balance at Rp 69.74 trillion ($33.2  billion). The receipts from oil and gas sectors, which are  projected to reach Rp 12.85 trillion ($6.11 billion), are based  on the oil price reference of $16 per barrel. The minister  acknowledged that the cut in oil price reference to $16 per  barrel from the current $18 per barrel reflects the government's  concern over the falling oil prices. However, House members said  the $16 price reference is still too high as oil prices on the  international markets have now declined to below $13 a barrel.    The receipt projection from the oil and gas sectors will  account for 21.5 percent of the total state revenues in the next  fiscal year.    The 1994-1995 state budget will come into effect in April.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UN holds out hope for Iraqi weapons backdown A SENIOR United Nations diplomat arrived in Baghdad for talks with Iraqi officials yesterday, holding out the prospect of lifting crippling economic sanctions if Iraq accepts long-term monitoring of its weapons programmes. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN special commission into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, went into a two-hour meeting at the foreign ministry and later said talks would continue today. He is expected to spend four days in Baghdad trying to resolve the stand-off between the UN and Iraq over installation of monitoring cameras at two missile test sites. Two teams of UN inspectors have failed to persuade Iraq to mount cameras at the sites, or seal monitoring equipment there as an interim measure. Failure to defuse the crisis would re-open the possibility of a UN-backed military strike against the sites. But Mr Ekeus' visit comes amid signs that Iraq is anxious to win an easing of economic sanctions, which have prevented Iraqi export sales, particularly of oil, for almost four years. Mr Ekeus and fellow diplomats at the UN believe Iraq's pressing economic needs could force authorities in Baghdad to back down in the present confrontation. 'The major carrot (for Iraqi compliance) is the ongoing sanctions and the oil embargo,' Mr Ekeus said before arriving in Baghdad. Parallel talks in New York between Iraqi Oil Ministry officials and UN legal experts on a special six-month sale of oil worth Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn) were suspended on Wednesday as Iraqi officials considered a possible draft agreement on the sale. Confidentiality surrounding the market-sensitive talks has made it difficult to assess their success, but UN diplomats said agreement might be close. About 60 per cent of the revenues from the oil sale, which would add about 500,000 barrels of crude a day to the market, would be set aside for food and medicines in Iraq, distributed and monitored by the UN. The rest would help pay for UN activities in Iraq. Deborah Hargreaves adds: Oil prices dropped to a three-year low in London and New York as traders fear the resumption of even limited Iraqi oil exports could add to the surplus on world markets, leading to a collapse in prices.

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Auditors seek to limit legal actions THE LARGEST eight UK accounting firms are planning to launch a campaign to protect themselves from increasing litigation against auditors. They have hired consultants and are considering a range of options including legal reform to limit court damages which can be awarded against them. They are likely to call for changes to Section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act, which forbids accountants from being able to contractually limit their liability. Their concern follows a rise in the number and value of law suits brought particularly in the US by investors and other users of audited accounts. Many firms say litigation is rising to levels where it will either drive them into insolvency or force them to cease acting as auditors. The campaign follows lobbying in the US by a pressure group of accounting groups. The informal gathering last week of the heads of the 'Big Eight' accounting firms received a report commissioned from a political lobbying group. It is believed to have suggested that many lawyers, politicians, academics and accountants were sympathetic to reform. Mr Roy Chapman, senior partner of Arthur Andersen in London, is co-ordinating the Big Eight's campaign in the UK. The other firms are Coopers &amp; Lybrand, KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst &amp; Young, Price Waterhouse, Touche Ross, Grant Thornton and BDO Binder Hamlyn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Signs at Moncloa: Gonzalez </F> Resignation May Be in Pipeline"]    [Excerpts] Several government and Socialist leaders held  talks yesterday with [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez, both in  person and over the phone, to discuss the serious crisis  engulfing the executive over the corruption cases and the  disappearance of Luis Roldan. In official circles clear signs  are beginning to emerge that preparations are under way for the  head of government's resignation, despite his refusal to leave  office. [Deputy Prime Minister] Narcis Serra is tipped as the  most likely candidate to succeed Gonzalez, although there also  is talk of a certain autonomous region president.    Apart from the current deputy prime minister, rumors in  Socialist circles maintain that the current president of the  Valencia Generalidad also aspires to lead the government if  Gonzalez steps down.    Gonzalez insists on continuing to lead the executive,  despite  all the scandals, but murmurs from within his own party  suggesting he resign are gathering force. Guerristas [followers  of Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) Deputy Secretary  Alfonso Guerra] like La Coruna Mayor Francisco Vazques have  begun to speculate that only resignations can defuse the present  situation and that the resignation of the PSOE secretary general  cannot be ruled out because the institutions and his own party  are above him.    The government crisis could cost Felipe Gonzalez his job if  [Convergence and Union (CiU) leader] Jordi Pujol carries out the  threat he made yesterday when he warned that his 17 deputies  could withdraw their support from the Socialist leader if he  does not clean up his cabinet and his party. The executive has  decided to postpone the appearance of [outgoing Interior  Minister] Antonio [as published] Asuncion before parliament  until Tuesday, and the possibility that Gonzalez himself will  face the Chamber of Deputies, as the People's Party has  demanded, depends on how far the CiU supports the initiative,  since the IU [United Left] has already demanded the same thing.    The CiU has called for the resignation from their current  posts of former Interior Ministers Jose Barrionuevo and Jose  Luis Corcuera, and of Socialist floor leader Carlos Solchaga, as  well as a sweeping government reshuffle, all essential  preconditions if it is to continue to support the executive.    Jose Duran Lleida, chairman of the CiU's government  committee, announced this decision on behalf of the Nationalist  coalition, which supports the PSOE-led government. He stressed  that, if these measures are not implemented immediately, it will  be Felipe Gonzalez himself who has to resign. Although he was  speaking in his own party's name, the speech had received the  approval of Generalidad President Jordi Pujol only moments  earlier.    Duran Lleida confirmed that the CiU no longer has "any  commitment" toward the government, since the governability to  which the Catalan Nationalists aspired to contribute has been  destroyed by the PSOE itself, the party solely responsible for  the present state of affairs. He repeated that the CiU has no  desire for early elections, but he warned that the instability  it has sought to avoid with fresh elections was already a  reality right now, so that all paths are open as we wait to see  whether Felipe Gonzalez can show that he is able to bring the  situation back under control. In that sense, he said, if  Gonzalez does not firmly establish political responsibility for  the Roldan and Rubio cases within 15 days, he himself will have  to resign. [passage omitted]    The government yesterday decided to postpone for 24 hours  Asuncion's planned appearance before parliament's Internal  Affairs Commission. He was originally summoned to appear today,  to explain Roldan's flight and the reasons behind his  resignation. Although opposition circles suspect that this is  simply a move to gain time, as the security forces are thought  to have come up with some clues as to the fugitive's  whereabouts, government circles blame the People's Party for the  postponement.    Assistant People's Party spokesman Loyola de Palacio denied  that his party was obstructing Asuncion's appearance before the  committee and insisted that Felipe Gonzalez appear before the  Chamber of Deputies to explain the situation.</p>

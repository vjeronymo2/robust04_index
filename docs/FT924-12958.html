			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: Cabbages fit for kings - Cookery RED, white and green. In the beginning, that was how I thought of cabbages: typical of the dismissive British attitude to vegetables, I suppose. When I escaped the boarding school habit of serving vegetables killed by drowning, I began to appreciate the differences between various varieties; the seasons for each, their different textures and tastes - Savoy, Primo, Christmas Drumhead, January King, Spring Greens, Curly Kale and so on. Later still, I rejoiced in the arrival of Chinese Leaves in our shops. Pale, crisp and mild, this most unaggressive member of the brassica tribe is equally at home in stir fries and salads. It is excellent for stuffing and a joy for lazy shoppers because it keeps so well. In Portugal, my brassica tastings were extended to include Couve Galegas, a national favourite which is more popular there than the leek in Wales. Every Portuguese market sells this long-legged, loose-leafed vegetable (often ready shredded for instant cooking), most gardens grow it, and no cook worth her salt would dream of letting more than a day or two pass without putting it on the menu. Another lovely discovery is Cavolo Nero, which I found in Rosemary Verey's gardens at Barnsley House*. This is a spectacular plant. Tall and upstanding, the long leaves arch from the stems on thick, white ribs. They are dark green and dimpled as deeply as a Savoy. The effect is most elegant. Verey told me that she strips the ribs from the leaves, boils the greenery, adds butter and eats it like spinach. Indeed, she sometimes refers to the plant as Italian spinach. Anna Del Conte - the expert to whom I turn with all Italianate queries  - describes Cavolo Nero as having a pronounced but agreeable brassica flavour  -slightly more bitter than many other varieties but lacking their intrusive, cabbagey smell. She adds that, in its native Tuscany, Cavolo Nero sometimes is just sliced across very thinly, boiled (it might take 15-20 minutes to become tender) and served with a good drizzle of fruity olive oil, plus a squeeze of lemon juice if liked. More often, it is cooked with pork in rich and nourishing stews or used in soups, of which la ribollita, the bean soup of Tuscany, is the best known. Here is Del Conte's recipe for la ribollita as taught at her Taste of Tuscany cookery school and adapted for cooks who cannot lay hands on Cavolo Nero. LA RIBOLLITA (serves 6-8) Whether you finish the soup with onions or not, la ribollita should always be made a day ahead and reheated for serving, as its name implies. Ingredients: For the beans -  1/2 lb dried cannellini beans, soaked overnight; 1 onion, cut into quarters; 1 small celery stalk; 3 garlic cloves; sprigs of sage, rosemary and parsley. For the soup: 3 1/2 fl oz extra virgin olive oil; 1 sweet (red or Spanish) onion; 1-2 dried chillis, seeded and chopped; 2 ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped; 1 tablespoon tomato puree; 3 potatoes and 2 carrots, cubed; 1 leek and 3 celery stalks, cut into small pieces; the dark green outside leaves only of 1 small savoy cabbage, cut into thin strips; about  1/2 lb spring greens, cut into thin strips; 2 garlic cloves; 3-4 sprigs of thyme. For reheating to serve: 1-2 sweet, red or Spanish onions (optional); 8 slices of bread; 2 garlic cloves. Method: First cook the beans gently with their flavouring ingredients in a heavy pot with enough cold water to cover them by two inches, and 2 teaspoons of salt. When tender, separate the beans from the liquid. Reserve 3-4 tablespoons of the whole beans and puree the rest using the coarse blade of a food mill. To make the soup, put into a heavy pot most of the oil, the onion, chillis, and a pinch of salt. Saute for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and tomato puree and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the bean puree and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes more. Add the remaining vegetables and herbs. Pour on the bean liquid plus water as necessary to make 2 pints in all. Cover and cook over the lowest possible heat for about 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper and leave overnight. Next day, slice very finely enough onions to lay over the surface of the soup; put the pot into the oven and cook at 350''F/180'C (gas mark 4) until the onion is tender, about 1 hour. (This step is optional; Del Conte suggests omitting it if you cannot find really sweet onions). Rub the bread with the cut garlic cloves and grill it. Put the toast into soup bowls, ladle the reheated soup over it and dribble on the remaining olive oil. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature. *Barnsley House Gardens, Barnsley, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire, are open from 10-6 on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.</p>

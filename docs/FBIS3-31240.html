After he had  held talks with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency,  Churkin met and held talks with Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic.  Summing up today's talks, Churkin told journalists the  following.    [Begin Churkin recording, in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] First of all, I am very glad to  have had the opportunity to meet Prime Minister Silajdzic and  President Izetbegovic. This time I came here mainly because I  wanted to see that the military disengagement that has started  around Sarajevo is being carried out without a problem. You may  recall that shortly after the tragedy in this town on 5  February, Russia demanded that the siege around Sarajevo be  lifted, (?immediately).    We are following this process very carefully and are trying  to do what we can to make sure that this process continues. If  this process turns out to be successful, we will have a new  opportunity to find a political solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina  as a whole. I am very encouraged by what I heard today from  President Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Silajdzic.    Naturally, I stressed that we hope that the forces of the  Bosnian Government will show restraint in the days and weeks  ahead. This will be demanded from all sides. I was also  encouraged by the fact that the hosts spoke not only about the  current crisis in and around Sarajevo, but also about the  prospects for a political solution, and even more than that,  about what can be accomplished between us in the time of peace  that will hopefully come soon. [end recording]    Briefly addressing journalists, Prime Minister Silajdzic  stressed two aspects of today's talks.    [Begin Silajdzic recording, in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] The first is that we asked Mr.  Churkin to influence as much as possible the situation in  Sandzak, which is not in line with rapprochement and the peace  talks. People are being arrested in Sandzak. The situation in  Sandzak is very grave. We fear that the conflict could  escalate, that stronger, more repressive measures could be  taken. We know that 200 people have been arrested. We asked  Mr. Churkin to work in this direction with the people in  Belgrade as much as he can.    This was one issue. The other issue concerned the  possibilities for developing Bosnian-Russian relations in the  future. We think that these relations do not have to be at the  present level, and that they could be developed in the direction  of global rapprochement. We are all slowly beginning to live in  this global village. [sentence as heard] These are the two  issues. Mr. Churkin spoke about other aspects of the talks.  [end recording]    Vitaliy Churkin then commented on his statement for Belgrade  Radio that Russia will put a stop to the prospect of air strikes  on Serbian positions.    [Begin Churkin recording, in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] I do not recall saying anything  like that. The media also reported that a joint statement was  issued after my meeting with Milosevic. This is not correct.  There was no joint statement, neither a formal nor an informal  statement. What I stressed, and I can repeat it, is that we  believe that everything must be done to achieve this encouraging  process of peaceful military disengagement in and around  Sarajevo. I think that continuing the fighting and  confrontations is in noone's interest. In this sense, yes, we  are trying everything to prevent the escalation of the conflict  here.    However, I am also saying personally and publicly that if  the  process of demilitarization in and around Sarajevo fails, worst  things will happen. I have made this point again and again.  [end recording]    The journalists were than again addressed by Prime Minister  Silajdzic.    [Begin Silajdzic recording, in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] This must be the first step toward  peace. NATO's ultimatum should be the first step toward peace,  because, as I have stressed in the past, there used to be a  military imbalance. This ultimatum is now restoring this balance  to a certain degree. I believe that the balance of power  maintained peace in Europe for 50 years. This principle was  abandoned with everything else in Bosnia, but is now coming  back. This will not be easy. However, goodwill must exist on  all sides. Regarding our side, this will exists. We will meet  all our obligations and we are striving for peace. [end  recording]</p>

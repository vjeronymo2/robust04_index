			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN'S FIRING DUE TO IGNORANCE  </P> <P> I am often enraged by articles written in daily newspapers, but never have felt  the need to express my anger with written comment.  </P> <P> The story on Diane De Vries ("Disabled Worker Claims Job Bias," Times, Aug. 23)  is not to be believed.  </P> <P> This courageous lady is a victim of an ignorance that even in these unsettled  times is hard to comprehend.  </P> <P> We can only have admiration for this fine woman, who earned her degree under  what must have been the most difficult of circumstances, choosing then to enter  the work force and live a life independent of unearned subsidies. I'm willing  to bet that Ms. De Vries enjoyed the struggle toward her goal and the eventual  freedom it brought her.  </P> <P> GARY BOUDREAU  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

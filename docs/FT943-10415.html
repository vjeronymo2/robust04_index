			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Mexican growth expected Mexico's economy will probably expand by between 2 and 3 per cent this year, without any additional government measures to stimulate growth, according to Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister. 'The economy is moving,' said Mr Aspe in an interview on Wednesday. 'It really wants to grow despite the worst possible supply shocks, the worst political events.' He said figures showing industrial output rose 3.1 per cent in May indicated recovery was well under way, boosted by rapid expansion in construction and electricity sectors. Mexico's economy grew just 0.5 per cent in the first quarter, after contracting in the second half of last year. Mr Aspe blamed low growth last year on uncertainty over passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and this year on the political instability that culminated in the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the ruling party. He welcomed recent falls in interest rates, saying market sentiment had turned in favour of the country. On Wednesday interest rates fell for the second consecutive week, with investors apparently confident that the governing party will comfortably win the August 21 presidential election. The sharp fall in interest rates and strengthening of the peso has led to a surge in the stock market. The minister said further reductions in interest rates would be driven by market conditions, and promised no modification in economic policy until December, when the new administration takes over. Exchange rate, price and wage policy would, he indicated, remain unaltered at least until the end of the year. 'We have an economic policy which is set for good times or bad times,' said Mr Aspe. 'For this year we will not change.' He appeared to be ruling out a devaluation of the currency soon after the election, which some have urged as a way of boosting growth. Mr Aspe said economic activity was being driven by foreign direct investment, which was 'growing tremendously', and public investment, which was higher than in any other year of this government. Despite rising public spending, he said, the government would meet its target of a balanced budget this year, and might run a small surplus as a result of higher oil prices. The Finance Ministry expects to give approval to foreign financial institutions which applied to open up subsidiaries in Mexico in September or October, Mr Aspe said.</p>

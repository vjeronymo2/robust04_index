			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil demand growth forecast The International Energy Agency yesterday predicted that world demand for oil will grow steadily over the next nine months as the pace of economic activity quickens in Europe and Japan. In its monthly oil market report the IEA estimated that world demand for oil next year would rise to 69.3m barrels a day, from an expected average of 68.1m b/d this year. The Paris-based agency said oil demand by members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development would rise by 500,000 b/d in the first quarter of 1995, with Europe accounting for the largest increase. It predicted that Asian demand in the period would grow by a similar amount and that the decline in demand in the former Soviet Union would slow. Global demand in the first quarter would therefore be 900,000 b/d higher than in the same period last year. But the agency suggested that oil supplies from outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries would be 700,000 b/d higher in the first quarter, mainly reflecting rising production in the North Sea as new fields which were brought onstream last year moved towards peak production. The report noted that Nigeria had replaced Yemen as a source of international concern about supply disruptions. But it said that the Nigerian supply disruptions in July, which have unsettled international oil markets, were offset by increased out-put by several other Opec producers.</p>

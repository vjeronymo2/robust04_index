			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Axa fall reflects French insurers' gloom AXA, one of the largest French insurers which last year invested Dollars 1bn in Equitable Life Assurance of the US, suffered a 34 per cent fall in first-half net profits due to a reduction in exceptional gains and forecast a further fall in profits for the full year. The decline in profits, from FFr1.48bn in the first six months of 1991 to FFr979m (Dollars 190.09m) in the same period this year, is the latest gloomy announcement from the big French insurance companies in the current interim reporting season. Earlier this week, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) reported lower first-half profits, as did Assurances Generales de France late last month. The insurers have been hit by intense competition in their domestic market over the past year, particularly in the commercial and motor sectors. The insurance industry has also been affected by the problems of the property market and the general malaise in the corporate sector, which have depressed the value of their investment portfolios. However, Axa, which is chaired by Mr Claude Bebear, managed to make progress in its insurance activities despite the general pressures on the French market. Axa said that net profits from its insurance and reinsurance businesses rose by 119 per cent in the interim period. Sales increased by 16 per cent from FFr25.05bn to FFr30.34bn in the first six months of this year. This reflected growth in insurance sales both inside and outside France, together with strong sales increases from its reinsurance and financial services interests. However, Axa experienced a sharp fall in the contribution from sales of peripheral interests, which contributed FFr875m to its 1991 first-half figures. A further reduction in exceptional gains is expected during the second half, which should produce a 'significant decrease' in net profits for the full financial year. However, Axa anticipates a 'small positive' contribution from Equitable Life.</p>

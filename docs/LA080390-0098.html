			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TRADE EMBARGO EXPECTED TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON IRAQ;  </P> <P> ECONOMICS: ANALYSTS SAY WASHINGTON CANNOT PUSH FOR WORLDWIDE SANCTIONS WITHOUT  RISKING A RECESSION AT HOME.  </P> <P> The broad trade embargo that President Bush imposed on Iraq is not expected to  have a major impact on that country's economy, analysts said Thursday, and  Washington cannot push for worldwide sanctions without risking a recession at  home.  </P> <P> In theory, analysts said that Iraq's heavy economic dependence on selling oil  abroad should make it highly vulnerable to the kind of economic sanctions that  Bush -- and other American Presidents -- historically have relied upon to  achieve their foreign policy goals.  </P> <P> But in reality, economists said, Bush would find it practically impossible to  push through economic sanctions severe enough to hurt Iraq without risking  serious damage to the American economy -- perhaps even pushing it into a deep  slump.  </P> <P> Although broadening the economic embargo to involve other Western nations as  well might hurt Iraq significantly, it also could easily backfire on the United  States and any other industrial powers that might take part in such an effort.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid the U.S. is trapped between a rock and a hard place," said Alan  Stoga, international economist for Kissinger Associates, the New York  consulting firm run by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.  </P> <P> "Unilateral sanctions won't have very much impact at all, but the risk of a  multilateral response to Iraq is that the potential effect on oil prices would  be so severe as to do more harm than good," Stoga said.  </P> <P> Even if it were effective in cutting off Iraq's oil exports, a worldwide  boycott of petroleum from Iraq and Kuwait would risk driving the price of oil  up to as much as $40 to $45 a barrel and quickly tipping the already-sluggish  U.S. economy into a recession.  </P> <P> The two countries together export more than 4 million barrels of oil each day.  </P> <P> The only way out of this dilemma, Stoga suggested, would be for the United  States to provide Saudi Arabia with military protection against Iraq, if the  Saudis agreed to pump enough additional oil to make up for the embargoed  petroleum from Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> Such a deal, Stoga and other experts conceded, is highly unlikely any time  soon.  </P> <P> As a result, many analysts believe that Iraq may well get away with its sudden  invasion of Kuwait, taking over one of the richest countries in the world and  gaining effective control of almost 100 billion barrels of additional oil  reserves.  </P> <P> "Iraq has moved to correct its own strategic position in the gulf in what  amounts to a militarily imposed business takeover," said Patrick Connolly, a  senior consultant at Cambridge Energy Associates in Cambridge, Mass.  </P> <P> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "has almost doubled his reserves and productive  capacity overnight, wiped out as much as $35 billion in financial obligations  overnight and essentially solved his revenue problems," Connolly said. He  added:  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody is in any position to do anything about it."  </P> <P> In imposing U.S. economic sanctions against Iraq, the Bush Administration froze  all Iraqi and Kuwaiti government assets in the United States and in overseas  branches of U.S. firms. The White House also banned virtually all trade with  Iraq.  </P> <P> But independent analysts dismissed the U.S. actions -- which are similar to  those that the United States imposed on Libya several years ago for that  country's terrorist activities -- as relatively ineffective by themselves.  </P> <P> Iraq has almost no direct investments in the United States and relatively  little trade with this country. The United States exported only about $1.2  billion worth of goods to Iraq last year, the vast bulk of it farm commodities.  </P> <P> Analysts said that the sanctions could have a significant effect on U.S. rice  growers, however. Iraq is the largest export market for American rice,  accounting for more than $116 million in sales -- or roughly 23% of all U.S.  rice shipments abroad.  </P> <P> The United States imports about $2.4 billion in goods from Iraq, almost all of  it petroleum and oil products -- making Iraq the sixth-largest oil supplier to  America. In the absence of a worldwide embargo, however, the U.S. sanctions are  expected to make little difference.  </P> <P> Iraq is likely to find another market elsewhere for its goods. At the same  time, analysts said that American oil companies should have little trouble  replacing the supplies from Iraq that the embargo is cutting off.  </P> <P> Iraq lost no time in retaliating against the American sanctions, halting its  debt payments to the United States, the Qatari news agency reported.  </P> <P> According to the Institute for International Finance, Iraq owes about $22  billion to Western banks and governments and roughly $6 billion to the Soviet  Union and East European nations.  </P> <P> But only about $1.6 billion of this total is actually owed to U.S. banks, and  most of that is due the Atlanta branch of BNL, an Italian bank that extended an  unauthorized loan to Iraq that was not discovered until late last year.  </P> <P> The BNL branch secretly agreed to lend Iraq $1.5 billion, but it only disbursed  about $1 billion of that money, leaving another $500 million that was subject  to Thursday's freeze.  </P> <P> The U.S. effort to protect Kuwaiti assets abroad from takeover by Iraq may  prove more successful, but is expected to set off a prolonged legal struggle  between the new puppet government and Kuwait's royal family.  </P> <P> Kuwait has an estimated $100 billion in overseas investments, analysts said --  about one-third in U.S. stocks, bonds, real estate and holdings in energy  firms.  </P> <P> Britain and France took similar steps Thursday to freeze Kuwaiti assets, in a  move that British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said was designed "to prevent  a puppet regime in Kuwait from transferring" them elsewhere.  </P> <P> In hopes that Kuwait can eventually escape from under Iraq's thumb, McDonnell  Douglas Corp. said Thursday that it would continue production on a $1.8-billion  Kuwaiti order for 40 fighter jets despite the uncertainties stemming from  Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Lee Whitney, a spokesman at McDonnell's St. Louis headquarters, said that the  F/A-18 jets, scheduled for delivery starting in January, 1992, are in the early  stages of production.  </P> <P> McDonnell and its major F/A-18 suppliers, including the Los Angeles-based  Northrop Corp., will continue to work on the jets as if nothing had changed, he  said.  </P> <P> Whitney said that the U.S. government, which controls all sales of military  hardware to foreign governments, has not sought to stop continued sales to  Kuwait.  </P> <P> But analyst Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities told Reuters news agency  that the sale ultimately could be in jeopardy if the new Kuwaiti government  that emerges from the conflict is pro-Iraqi or otherwise proves unfriendly to  the United States.  </P> <P> "The U.S. wouldn't want (the jets) to fall into the hands of Iraq," Nisbet  said. "The assumption is that by 1992, the government of Kuwait will be  independent again."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury officials were swamped Thursday by hundreds of  telephone calls from business executives seeking to learn more about the impact  of the new sanctions against Iraq. It was not immediately clear how the trade  ban would affect goods already in transit.  </P> <P> "We have crisis teams set up to deal with that," one official said. "That's a  policy question, and I think what we need to do is weigh the practicalities. It  is a fairly full and complete economic and trade embargo."  </P></p>

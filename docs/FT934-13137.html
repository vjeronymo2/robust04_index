			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): A time to play safe - Going early, Investing the lump sum / Anxiety may follow the thrill of commuting part of your pension for tax-free cash. Three professional advisers suggest ways to regain peace of mind ANYONE WHO takes a proportion of their pension scheme benefits as a lump sum faces a hard choice: how best to invest it for retirement? writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. We asked three independent financial advisers what their prescription would be for a couple, Mr &amp; Mrs FT, aged 60 and 56, who had Pounds 100,000 to invest as a result of Mr FT's having commuted part of his pension for tax-free cash. They have few other assets, apart from capital in the building society. In retirement, Mr FT will remain a higher-rate taxpayer, but Mrs FT has no sources of income. John Edwards, consultant at Berry Birch &amp; Noble says: 'There are no hard and fast rules about the best way of investing the lump sum when taking a pension. It all depends on individual circumstances. 'For some people, the best bet is a 'negative' investment. By reducing expensive borrowings, particularly credit-card debts, and reducing a mortgage to at least the Pounds 30,000 level, you are taking full advantage of the tax-free lump sum, because you pay tax on most investments. 'The amount of income which has to be generated will obviously be a key consideration. But this has to be balanced with long-term protection against inflation. You should also take into account the terms of the pension you are receiving. How well are you protected against inflation? Most final-salary company pension schemes these days have some form of index-linking, but the annual increases awarded by the trustees is seldom sufficient to cover 'real' inflation. 'Taxation also has to be taken into account. Your investment strategy should recognise that there is no way round paying tax on pensionable income. 'Finally, there is the level of risk. You have to bear in mind that your life savings are at stake, so spreading risk is a key ingredient. You always need an emergency short-term cash reserve, which these days is best provided by a building society postal account. Other risk-free investments include National Savings products, and possibly guaranteed income bonds, as well as tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas). 'Gilts and permanent interest-bearing shares (PIBs) can provide a high level of income, but they are taxable and there is a real danger of a fall in capital value. Index-linked gilts, and also National Savings certificates, provide good protection against inflation. However, they might be left behind if interest rates rise sharply in the years ahead. 'Single-premium investment bonds can be flexible in providing income and/or capital growth, because of the freedom to withdraw 5 per cent of the original investment 'tax free' over a period of 20 years. However, the current low interest rates make the traditional annuity-backed income or capital growth plans less attractive at present. 'At the top end of the risk scale, personal equity plans have the great advantage of being tax free. Investment or unit trusts help spread risk, as do managed portfolios.' Richard G Boyton, managing director of Boyton Financial Services, says: 'I continually stress to clients that it is total return that counts; that is, both income and capital gain. Mr and Mrs FT are not in a position to take unnecessary risks. 'The majority of the portfolio would be Mrs FT's name, producing income of Pounds 2,742 which is still within her single person's tax allowance, and the income in her hands will remain tax free. I suggest Pounds 20,000 in GT's Dublin-based International Bond Fund; and Pounds 12,000 in each of four large well-known solid investment trusts, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Alliance, Electric &amp; General and Murray International. All have impeccable pedigrees and currently stand at a discount to their net asset values. 'Another Pounds 7,000 should be invested in Henderson Strata, which is a smaller companies trust, and a further Pounds 7,500 in the ECU investment trust. 'I would invest Pounds 17,500 in Mr FT's name, by placing Pounds 7,500 in zero-dividend preference shares, through the Exeter Zero Dividend Preference Fund, which is a unit trust of zero-dividend preference shares, and Pounds 4,000 in the capital shares of the Fulcrum split-level investment trust, which could prove to be particularly beneficial as the UK market continues to move ahead, due to the underlying gearing. 'The balance of the portfolio is invested in a Killik self-select Pep, using Morgan Grenfell's Equity Income investment trust, giving Mr FT income on a tax-free basis, since he is a higher-rate taxpayer, but I can see no point in recommending one for Mrs FT, as her single person's tax allowance remains under-utilised. 'With this strategy, 73 per cent of their assets would be invested in equities, and 28 per cent in gilts, bonds or zero dividends. There would also be a good geographical spread: 50 per cent in the UK, 21 per cent in the US and North America, 7 per cent in Japan, 16 per cent in Europe, and the balance (6 per cent) elsewhere. 'The total overall gross income, including the Pep, amounts to Pounds 2,904, being a gross yield of 2.9 per cent. If they want more 'income', they should be aware of what I call 'vertical segregation'. If, for instance, a client has purchased 10,000 Pounds 1 shares and saw them grow to Pounds 1.20, the growth would amount to 20p per share. Spending of capital is therefore not necessarily detrimental.' Mark Bolland, of London-based Chamberlain de Broe, fee-based independent financial advisers, says: 'The first question is: what is their target income, taking into account the income provided by the annuity which they will have had to take out if they had a personal pension? An escalating joint life annuity will offer protection against inflation, so we can look for an increase to the overall income throughout the lives of the FTs. 'At some stage, independent taxation has to be brought into the frame. There is no problem with age allowances at the moment, but when the couple reach 65 they will need to be careful not to lose allowances unnecessarily. 'It would be sensible, at this stage, to have part (or all) of the tax-free cash invested in Mrs FT's name, to make use of her personal allowances and maximise the net income. While the pension itself (during Mr FT's life) can only be taxed in his hands  - he cannot appoint any of the income to his wife  - he can, if he wishes, have all of the tax-free cash invested in her name. 'Since annuity rates are low at the moment, we would be looking to generate an income with as much capital protection as possible. The 'generator' concept of improving the yield from a portfolio is the most pragmatic way forward. 'Basically, the idea is to split a fund into two parts, one of which would be responsible for income; the other, growth. The income part would normally use ordinary deposits or temporary annuities, depending on the interest rates available. It is a 'sinking' fund being fully depleted by the end of the term. The growth part is then given the job of growing and providing long-term capital protection. 'The reason for working like this is that there are a number of vehicles and investments that cannot really be used for income because of their structure; for instance, National Savings, the BES and indeed anything that requires a particular term of investment. These vehicles, though, are often ideal for a 'portfolio', because of the returns offered and tax-efficiency  -but they are five-year investments. Therefore, to make the most of these, it is necessary to gear up the income being generated elsewhere.'</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Strong emerging markets business lifts Nelson Hurst A strong showing from its emerging market operations boosted half-year pre-tax profits at Nelson Hurst, the insurance broker which came to the market late last year, by 68 per cent from Pounds 2.61m to Pounds 4.38m. Turnover for the six months to June 30 increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 18.4m), with the best performance - a 25 per cent increase - coming from the group's middle and far eastern division. Total revenue was ahead at Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 19.8m). Mr David Woodward, chairman and chief executive, said: 'we have a presence in all the big Asian business centres and have developed good relationships with prominent local brokers.' The group's link with Hopewell, the Hong Kong insurance group, was beginning to show good returns and the recently opened Philippines office had good potential, he said. Offices in Shanghai and Vietnam are planned for early next year. Turnover at the financial and reinsurance operations grew 15 per cent to Pounds 8.69m (Pounds 7.57m), with a particularly strong showing from the North American casualty insurance business. London Overseas operations, which includes reinsurance of large construction projects such as power stations, saw turnover grow 15 per cent to Pounds 7m (Pounds 6.1m). However, aviation and marine insurance were difficult markets. The UK-based retail business was boosted by the joint venture with Price Forbes Group, one of South Africa's leading insurance groups. Turnover advanced 20 per cent to Pounds 1.94m. Mr Woodward was confident on second half trading. 'We are seeing continued revenue growth, both from our existing business and from new ventures. I am quite bullish over our prospects.' Earnings per share advanced from 5.1p to 6.4p. There is an interim dividend of 2.2p.</p>

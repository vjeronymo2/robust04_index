			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ming Man] </F>   [Text] Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs, Lu  Ping, is backing the creation of a group to improve  communications between civil servants and China during the  transitional period of power.    Mr. Lu and Preliminary Working Committee members met  representatives of seven local civil servants' unions yesterday  for two-and-a-half hours. Unions included the Hong Kong Chinese  Civil Servants Association and the Senior Non-Expatriate  Officers Association. The Association for Expatriate Civil  Servants was excluded from the meeting.    Last year the government issued a directive asking civil  servants to turn down invitations from the Preliminary Working  Committee to discuss transitional matters. Leader of the  Government Employees Association Cheng Chung-wai proposed that  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) members and civil servant  unions form a group despite the government directive.    Senior Non-Expatriate Officers Association deputy chairman  Alex Au said his union would welcome the move as it would  improve the transparency of the group which advises China on  transitional matters, but it depended on the composition. "We  would know what's happening about transitional matters relating  to the civil service," he said.    Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association chairman Peter  Wong said he hoped the PWC would consult the unions before  announcing or disclosing its proposals. "It would make their  recommendations more credible," Mr. Wong said.    A government spokesman, however, reiterated the  administration's stance, saying there were enough channels of  communication to deal with transition matters. They should only  be dealt with by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group.    Local unions also secured assurances from Mr. Lu that  China's  policy towards Hong Kong would not be affected by the continuing  row between Britain and China.    Mr. Lu told the unions he hoped all civil servants could  remain in their posts, apart from those in the directorate,  which would be appointed by the Chief Executive of the Special  Administrative Region.    He also backed calls by the unions for more cash to be put  into the pension reserve fund, but refused to disclose how much.  Governor Chris Patten announced in his policy speech last  October that $7 billion would be injected into the fund over a  two-year period.    The Association of Expatriate Civil Servants vice-chairman  Allan Roger said his group met Mr. Lu in 1986 and had been  assured China was happy to have expatriates in the civil service  after 1997.    "We basically wanted China's public reassurance that they  still want expats in government. At that time the expat  population was 3.2 per cent of the civil service, and Mr. Lu  said that was fine. Now it is down to 1.2 per cent and it is  clear what the government here is trying to do. Frankly, we  don't place a great deal of store in what they (China) are going  to say one way or the other, because we are convinced it is not  a Beijing driven scheme anyway. It is definitely a local  government move."</p>

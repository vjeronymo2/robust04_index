			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'DARK CLOUDS' FOR ECONOMY;  </P> <P> INDEX TAKES BIGGEST FALL IN 3 YEARS  </P> <P> The government's main economic forecasting gauge plunged 1.2% in August, its  steepest fall in three years and an indication, one economist said, of "nothing  but dark clouds" ahead.  </P> <P> Seven of the 11 components of the Commerce Department's Index of Leading  Indicators were off, including stock prices and an index measuring consumer  confidence.  </P> <P> Orders for new plants and equipment dropped. Unfilled orders to U.S.  manufacturers fell, as did building permits and the money supply. Weekly  unemployment claims were up.  </P> <P> The report was the first government look into the economic future since Iraq  occupied Kuwait Aug. 2.  </P> <P> The only positive contributors were slower business delivery times, an increase  in orders for consumer goods, an increase in the price of raw materials and a  longer workweek.  </P> <P> But economist Kermit Baker of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., said even the  longer workweek might be misleading.  </P> <P> "Perhaps it's an indication that industry is trying to get by with its current  work force rather than hire new people," he said.  </P> <P> Other economists were similarly gloomy.  </P> <P> "The decline in the leading indicators provides further proof that the  recession began in August," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National  Assn. of Manufacturers.  </P> <P> "If we're not in a recession, we're skating close to it," said John Silvia, a  financial economist with Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  </P> <P> Baker was even more blunt.  </P> <P> "There's nothing but dark clouds," he said, noting that preliminary economic  indicators released this month "indicate that the August number was not a  one-month phenomenon . . . the picture I'm getting is that this is a long-term  trend."  </P> <P> The drop in the index, designed to forecast activity six to nine months ahead,  was the sharpest since a 1.4% decline in the month after the Oct. 19, 1987,  stock market crash, when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks  plummeted 508 points in one day.  </P> <P> Many economists believe Wall Street has now turned bearish again and is in for  a prolonged period of falling prices.  </P> <P> "Since the stock market is a forward-looking indicator, the precipitous decline  in stock prices is more tied to expectations of recession than to the  deterioration in corporate earnings witnessed so far," Jasinowski said.  </P> <P> The general definition of a recession is two consecutive declines in the gross  national product.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEADING INDICATOR INDEX  </P> <P> Seasonally adjusted index, 1982=100  </P> <P> Aug. '89: 144.8  </P> <P> July '90: 146.0  </P> <P> Aug. '90: 144.2  </P> <P> Source: U.S. Dept. of Commerce  </P></p>

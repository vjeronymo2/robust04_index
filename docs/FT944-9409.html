			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Leaders committed to further liberalisation - Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation The leaders of the 17-member Apec countries agreed to build on the Uruguay Round world trade deal and take the lead in strengthening the open multilateral trading system, saying the 'full and active participation in and support for the WTO (World Trade Organisation) of all Apec economies' was vital to this objective. They would accelerate implementation of their Uruguay Round commitments and aimed to deepen and broaden its results. 'We also agree to commit ourselves to our continuing process of unilateral trade and investment liberalisation. As evidence of our commitment to the open multilateral trading system, we further agree to endeavour to refrain from using measures which would have the effect of increasing levels of protection', they said. They pledged promptly to reduce further trade and investment barriers 'in a Gatt-consistent manner' and believed this would stimulate further multilateral liberalisation. 'We wish to emphasise our strong opposition to the creation of an inward-looking trade bloc that would divert from the pursuit of global free trade. . . The outcome of trade and investment liberalisation in Asia-Pacific will not only be the actual reduction of barriers among Apec economies but also between Apec economies and non-Apec economies.' The leaders urged the successful launching of the WTO. 'Full and active participation in and support of the WTO by all Apec economies is key to our ability to lead the way in strengthening the multilateral trading system. We call on all non-Apec members of the WTO to work together with Apec economies toward further multilateral liberalisation.' The statement outlined the vision for Asia-Pacific economies as 'based on a recognition of the growing interdependence of our economically diverse region, which comprises developed, newly industrialising and developing economies. 'The Asia-Pacific industrialised economies will provide opportunities for developing economies to increase further their economic growth and level of development.' Free and open trade and investment in Asia-Pacific would be achieved by developing countries by the year 2020 and by industrialised economies by 2010, it continued. However, in another part of the statement, the leaders said: 'In order to facilitate our co-operation, we agree the Apec economies that are ready to initiate a co-operative arrangement may proceed to do so while those that are not yet ready to participate may join at a later date. 'We direct our ministers and officials immediately to begin preparing detailed proposals for implementing our present decisions. The proposals are to be submitted soon to Apec economic leaders for their consideration and subsequent decisions. Such proposals should also address all impediments to achieving our goal.' The leaders also agreed to examine the possibility of a voluntary consultative dispute mediation service, while stressing that the WTO should be the primary channel for resolving trade disputes.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / VAT spreads as central Europe reforms taxes CENTRAL Europe's determined effort to prepare for full membership of the European Community by the turn of the century moved a step further at the weekend as the new Czech Republic and Slovakia combined the achievement of separate statehood with introduction of value added tax. Harmonisation of tax systems among EC members was one requirement for creating the European single market, whose present boundaries do not extend beyond the eastern borders of Germany. But tax reform has posed special problems for the former communist countries of east and central Europe which had neither graduated personal income taxes, nor corporation taxes, nor VAT-type consumption taxes. Over the last two years task forces of western tax experts have been working in central Europe under the auspices of the Centre for Co-operation with European Economies in Transition, the main conduit for technical assistance to the former communist states set up by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Paris-based economic think-tank. Hungary has been the pace-setter in tax as in other key institutional reforms, having introduced VAT and other tax reforms gradually over the last few years. On January 1 the government introduced a modified three-tier VAT system with zero rating only for drugs and household electricity, 6 per cent on foodstuffs and a top 25 per cent rate on most other items. The Czech and Slovak rates are 5 per cent for services and a few essential items and 23 per cent on other goods. Poland is due to introduce VAT on July 1 and has decided on a zero rating for a restricted list of essential items, 7 per cent on some food and other items and a top rate of 22 per cent. The collapse of the communist system and the drive to privatise the economy and introduce market principles has simultaneously reduced tax revenues, due to the collapse of many state industries, and raised demands for higher spending, especially in new areas such as unemployment and retraining. The result has been soaring budget deficits which made it difficult to conform with International Monetary Fund-imposed performance criteria linked to IMF loan agreements. The introduction of VAT and other taxes is designed to widen the tax revenue base and adequately tax higher incomes resulting from the emergence of new players in the rapidly growing private sector. More controversially, VAT revenue is also designed to offset the cost of tax concessions designed to attract foreign investment. As the recent IMF agreement with Poland shows, the Fund has recently increased its temporary tolerance of high budget deficits pending the introduction of VAT and other reforms. These are intended to ensure that the new democratic states generate the revenues required to balance budgets over a longer period and finance the social safety net needed to keep unemployment associated with the transition to a market economy politically manageable. Poland is expected to cut its budget deficit from nearly 8 per cent last year to around 5.5 per cent this year while the Hungarian budget plans to reduce the deficit to 5.9 per cent from 7.5 per cent in 1992. In all cases, however, higher VAT and other taxes are expected to boost inflation by at least 5 per cent this year against the background of what promises to be higher real incomes and export-led increases in output after three years of steep recession.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / The Property Market: A time for transparency - Efforts to improve the sector's accounting practices If property companies are waiting anxiously for signs of an upturn in demand for space, readers of their accounts are just as eager for indications of improvement in the state of their financial reporting. While the accounts of businesses in many sectors leave much to be desired, practices followed by property companies - and property-related items in all companies' accounts - certainly come near the top of the list of those in need of reform. The huge increase in rents and property values, and the great expansion of development during the late 1980s, led to the emergence of many new and different types of property companies. Accounting standards were hard pressed to keep pace then. But the subsequent property slump has made reliance on accounting figures more important than ever, given the growing need to assess the financial health of the sector's many strugglers. 'Accounting Matters', a weight document on the impact of new accounting standards recently issued by James Capel, the securities house, puts the current situation bluntly: 'The scope for improving the quality and usefulness of property company accounts is considerable. Much work still needs to be done if (they) are going to show a more accurate statement of a company's financial position.' Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm, has chosen to accentuate the positive, encouraging improvements in financial reporting by sponsoring an annual property accounts award for the last three years. This year's winner is to be announced next week. The aim is to ensure that all property companies accounts are examined with an eye toward improving current practice. The scoring system for selecting finalists (see side-bar) is ambitious by any measure. Yet it is discouraging that few companies achieved more than about half of the total available marks. Mr Derek Purdy, from the Department of Economics at Reading University, who helped analyse companies for the judging panel, says one thing that surprised him this year was that 'some of the accounts of the bigger companies were not as bad as I thought'. The smaller companies were more disappointing. As Mr Peter Darnell, a partner in Stoy who sits on the panel, says: 'There has been only very marginal improvement in the last two years. It is still very disappointing.' There now appears to be some prospect for real improvement. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, for example, recently issued a paper calling for the reform of SSAP 19, the accounting standard on investment properties. More practically, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the newly-formed policing arm of UK accounting standards, has this year made its presence felt with at least three rulings on property-related matters. Its judgment in February that Forte, the UK hotel group, was in compliance with accounting standards even though the company did not depreciate its properties seemed to endorse existing widespread practice among many businesses with property assets. But that ruling was followed last month by a reprimand against SEP Industrial Holdings which seems to have restored the balance by reiterating that SSAP 12, the accounting standard on depreciation, is still in force. Both companies argued that the value of their properties had been maintained. The difference was that properties can only escape depreciation if they are regularly revalued, which Forte had done. Perhaps the most significant sign of reform is the review panel's recent action against Trafalgar House, which is being forced to reduce last year's pre-tax profits by Pounds 83m and shareholders' funds by Pounds 20m. This reflects the panel's ruling that the company's practice of switching a series of development properties held as current assets in the balance sheet to fixed assets was unacceptable. That principle has already been made mandatory for other companies through one of the guidelines recently approved by the urgent issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB). Despite this recent activity, the James Capel document argues that the ASB's agenda has yet to touch on the most important issues affecting property company accounts. Issues such as off-balance sheet finance and capitalisation of interest, for example, have yet to receive adequate attention. In the meantime, Capel says that last week's financing reporting standard from the ASB on the structure of the profit and loss account - which virtually abolishes extraordinary items - will actually add to confusion over the disposal of investment property. The process may have started, but it will probably be long after the next property recovery before the sector's accounts show marked improvement.</p>

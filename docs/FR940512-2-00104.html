			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. One of the Advisers is Moody, Nation and Smith (Moody), a financial consulting firm located in San Diego, which was retained by the Trustee to make determinations as a fiduciary on behalf of the Original Plan with respect to the proposed transactions. Moody, which represents that it is independent of and unrelated to the Employers, represents that it undertook a complete analysis of the real estate market in which the Property is situated as part of its evaluation of the Property and the New Leases as an investment for the Original Plan. In a written report to the Trustee, Moody concluded that the Original Plan's 43 percent interest in the Property, and its lease to the Employers under the New Leases, will constitute a prudent investment which features adequate protections and safeguards for the participants and beneficiaries of the Original Plan. Moody states that it has determined that the Property provides a favorable and secure rate of return and will remain a stable real estate investment well into the future. Moody represents that its research reveals that the Property is located in a stable and well-established market area which fared better than other areas in San Diego during the protracted city-wide real estate market declines between 1980 and 1990. Moody represents that other factors involved in and supporting its recommendation included the following findings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The Original Plan's assets will remain adequately diversified, in that its interest in the Property constitutes approximately 10.6 percent of all assets of the Original Plan's participants as of February 1994; (B) The Original Plan's return on its investment in the Property, the rental under the New Leases, is net of real estate taxes and all expenses related to repair, maintenance and insurance of the Property; (C) Any extension of the New Leases after the expiration of the initial term on April 30, 2004 will require the approval of the Trustee and will be limited to no more than two terms of five years each; (D) Rental under the New Leases will always be at least the fair market value of the Property, due to provisions requiring periodic rental review, and rent is adjustable only upward, never reduced, in the event of changes in the Property's fair market value as the New Leases proceed. Moody states that it determined that the fair market rental for comparable land leases in the same market as the Property is a 10 percent annual return on the fair market value of the subject land, and the current rental under the Original Lease, which can not be reduced under the New Lease, provides an annual return of approximately 15 percent; (E) The provisions of the New Leases further protect the Original Plan's investment in the Property by requiring the Employers to indemnify and hold harmless the Plans, including costs and attorneys fees, with respect to all claims, demands, liens, losses and liabilities arising from the lessees' use and occupancy of the Property; and (F) The interests of the Original Plan under the New Leases will continue to be represented and protected by the Trustee, an independent fiduciary which will monitor and enforce the Employers' performance of obligations under the New Leases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moody also represents that it has analyzed the proposed transactions in the context of other alternatives available to the Original Plan with respect to its interest in the Property. Moody states that alternative investments returning a comparable rate are not available to the Original Plan in the marketplace without a material attendant risk or large losses of principal. Moody represents that market conditions are unfavorable for any attempt to sell the Property, and additionally, that it would be disadvantageous for the Original Plan to accept cash in lieu of its undivided 43 percent ownership interest in the Property, because the alternative investments available will provide significantly lower returns than those provided by the Property and the New Leases. Moody states that its market research demonstrates that the area in which the Property is situated will continue to experience stability and attractiveness to both tenants and owners, due to the proximity to major medical and commercial centers and the lack of vacant land for new developments. Moody contends that these conditions present a realistic potential for increases in the rent under the New Leases over the next ten years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Merchant Retail drops to Pounds 1.72m Merchant Retail Group, the food retailer, returned profits of Pounds 1.72m pre-tax for the 12 months ended March 28, a 49 per cent downturn on the previous year's Pounds 3.37m. Earnings fell from 3.06p to 1.24p and the final dividend is being omitted, leaving shareholders with 1.1p for the year (2.29p). The shares dipped 2p yesterday to 16p. Directors blamed most of the profits setback on Normans Superwarehouses, where net margins fell from 3.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent and trading profits from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 2.8m. They said the 'significant sales increase' anticipated at Normans in the Christmas period failed to materialise - Normans trades from 19 stores in the south-west of England. Group sales improved from Pounds 149.97m to Pounds 155.04m.</p>

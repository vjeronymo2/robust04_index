			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On the occasion of the celebration of the 19th  aniversary of national independence, President of the Republic  Joaquim Chissano said that the issue of an eventual government  of national unity has not been definitely put aside. [passage  omitted]    The president of the Republic also said he was not worried  about his fate or that of his party in the forthcoming  elections. Chissano said: I would only be very worried if there  was another war in Mozambique. I am not worried about whether I  will continue as the country's president. The president added  that he would be worried if we failed to create a better future,  which is our challenge for the future. He said the forthcoming  elections should bring the results wished for by the Mozambican  people.</p>

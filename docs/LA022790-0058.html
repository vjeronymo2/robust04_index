			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRMS ACCUSED OF DUMPING TAINTED SOIL  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn on Monday accused three companies of  involvement in illegal dumping of gasoline-soaked soil at the Bradley Landfill  in Sun Valley.  </P> <P> Hahn's office brought a criminal complaint against Unocal Corp. and two  Paramount-based companies, L. Blain Co. and Hawkeye Equipment Co.  </P> <P> Unocal hired the other two firms to remove a leaking gasoline storage tank from  one of its service stations in Pacoima and to excavate the contaminated soil  around it.  </P> <P> On June 6, a driver for Hawkeye was caught at the privately owned Bradley  Landfill, seeking to unload a truckload of gasoline-soaked dirt from the  service station site, according to Hahn's office.  </P> <P> Hawkeye and L. Blain Co. were accused of one count each of knowingly  transporting hazardous waste to a landfill not licensed to accept such material  and of attempting to dispose of such waste at an improper site. Each count is  punishable by a fine of up to $100,000.  </P> <P> Unocal also was accused of failing to determine whether the waste was hazardous  and of failing to prepare a hazardous-waste manifest before transporting the  material, Hahn's office said. Arraignment is set for April 23 in Los Angeles  Municipal Court.  </P></p>

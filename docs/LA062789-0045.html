			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BUOYED BY RECENT REVERSAL, CANADIAN BUYS 6% OF PERFECTDATA  </P> <P> Last week a Canadian investor announced that he had bought 6% of PerfectData, a  Simi Valley office and computer products firm that has lost $6.8 million since  1984.  </P> <P> In a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, Sidney S.  Deuitch of Ontario revealed that he paid $125,000 to buy 192,307 shares in  PerfectData.  </P> <P> Despite PerfectData's long stretch of financial problems, Deuitch said, "I know  the computer industry, and I know PerfectData is in a hot area." Deuitch, who  is the chief executive officer of Data Accessories Corp., a Toronto-based firm  that does business with PerfectData, said: "In my mind there's no question  they've turned around."  </P> <P> Deuitch is encouraged because in the third quarter that ended Dec. 31, 1988,  PerfectData reported its first profitable quarter since 1985, as it earned  $25,000 on sales of $966,000.  </P> <P> Even that slight profit is a positive step because PerfectData has been on a  long uphill climb. In the fiscal year that ended March 31, 1986, the company  lost $4.5 million on sales of $5.5 million. In the next two fiscal years, it  lost $946,000 on sales of $4.1 million and $287,000 on sales of $4 million.  </P> <P> But the company has broadened its products line recently, and Lee Mannheimer,  PerfectData's chief executive officer, believes that its cleaners for fax  machines and laser printers could turn into a profitable line.  </P> <P> Despite PerfectData's troubles, when Mannheimer became PerfectData's CEO in  November, 1986, he was brimming with confidence. "My thinking was that I was  Superman, and we could turn this thing around in a year," he said. "What I came  to realize was that I had inherited a brain-dead company." In fact, the maker  of cleaning devices for computer disk drives, which are data storage devices,  hadn't even computerized its own record-keeping. The biggest problem at  PerfectData, Mannheimer said, was that PerfectData lacked a long-term game plan  -- and it made at least two big mistakes.  </P> <P> First, it had staked much of its business in the early 1980s on a line of  sophisticated cleaning machines for removable hard disks, another computer data  storage device. But by 1986, such hard disks largely had been replaced by disks  that did not have to be cleaned. In 1987, PerfectData bailed out, selling the  rights to the cleaning machine to a former employee.  </P> <P> Worse, within a matter of months in 1985, the company had bought in and sold  out of the floppy disk business at a time when the world markets were flooded  with floppies. Floppy disks are flexible plates that store computer data.  PerfectData ended up with 1.5 million disks and had to write off about $2.5  million in investments associated with that product line.  </P> <P> Mannheimer's main accomplishment so far has been to cut costs while maintaining  sales, so that PerfectData's losses have slowly narrowed. In addition to  selling off its original line of business, the firm moved in 1987 from  Chatsworth to Simi Valley, saving $63,600 a year in rent alone.  </P> <P> And since late 1986, PerfectData also has laid off about 15 of its original 45  employees. The savings reduced PerfectData's cost of sales -- the money devoted  to purchasing raw materials and converting them into finished products -- from  96% of sales in the year that ended March 31, 1986 to 53% of sales two years  later.  </P></p>

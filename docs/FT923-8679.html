Its differential against the Italian lira, the next weakest currency, has widened to 3.2 percentage points after the pound closed against the D-Mark at DM2.8250 on Friday night. The pound's differential against the strongest currency, the Portuguese escudo, has also widened and is still outside the permitted differential of 6.18 percentage points.

Up to now, 103 enterprises have been set up in the zone,  with  investment funds of 23.1 million U.S. dollars, 58 million Hong  Kong dollars and 666 million yuan.    The bonded zone was opened for operation last April, ready  to  function in international trade with processing for the export  and receiving of goods in its bonded warehouses.    Hainan Province formulated a series of regulations on  management, registration of enterprises and industrial policies  in the bonded zone.    The administration of the zone also invested 123 million  yuan  in infrastructural construction in the zone.    Construction of the administrative office building and the  customs office in the zone is expected to be completed in the  first half of this year.    About 42,000 square meters in standard workshops, which were  jointly constructed with an American company, will be available  in April.    Of the 103 enterprises, 17 are overseas solely-funded  companies, seven are joint ventures and 79 are domestic  enterprises.</p>

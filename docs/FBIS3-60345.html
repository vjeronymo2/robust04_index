A low-cost  desulphurization facility will be constructed beginning in FY94.  The project is intended to provide environmental technologies to  China and for Japan to accumulate technologies for using coal  with high levels of sulfur content.    The testing will be conducted at Unit No 12, Taiyuan Power  Plant No 1, with an output of 300,000 kilowatts, located in  Taiyuan, Shanxi. The demonstration testing, commissioned by the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry, will be  implemented by Electric Power Development.

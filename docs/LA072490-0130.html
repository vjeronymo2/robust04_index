			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER STADIUM PROJECT  </P> <P> The Stadium Business Park, an 18-acre office and retail center, will be the  latest addition to the growing business community around Anaheim Stadium if the  City Council approves the project tonight.  </P> <P> The project will include four high-rise office towers (two with 20 stories and  two with 16 stories), a 400-room hotel, a health club, an eight-story parking  structure and various restaurants and retail shops.  </P> <P> Though the $500-million development deal is nearly complete, planners have not  yet disclosed possible tenants for the project, said Steven Dietrich, a  consultant for the proposal.  </P> <P> Stadium Business Park is planned for a rectangular plot across the street from  the main entrance of Anaheim Stadium on State College Boulevard just south of  Katella Avenue.  </P> <P> Dietrich said developers were attracted to the area because of its freeway  access, its proximity to the forthcoming Anaheim Arena and the expanding  Anaheim Convention Center.  </P> <P> If approved tonight, groundbreaking for the project is scheduled to begin in  three to five years but could start sooner depending on the progress of the  arena and other nearby projects, he said.

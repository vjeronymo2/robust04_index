			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Technology: CD-I ushers in new era of training - Paul Taylor outlines the advantages and prospects of multimedia packages In the UK it is hardly possible to pass a poster site without noticing Philips touting its new CD-I (Compact Disc-Interactive) technology. By plugging a CD-I player into an ordinary television set, customers gain access to a world of multimedia programmes which can entertain, teach and train. Using five inch diameter optical discs to store sound, video images, text and graphics, CD-I technology promises to reshape corporate training methods, providing savings and improving effectiveness. CD-I is a new form of the interactive video (IV) technology which has become popular for company training programmes. IV training packages or 'courseware' need a separate desktop computer, but CD-I's digital discs can be played back on an inexpensive, compact and portable CD-I player and a TV set. Trainees can control the pace of lessons, make choices by mouse pointer, and get feedback. Interactive video software is a proven training medium. Advocates claim its advantages include higher levels of learning success, more flexible learning, and a sharp reduction in training time. Bigger savings are claimed for the CD-I technology of Philips, Sony and Matsushita. Player prices start at about Pounds 600 in the UK and are expected to fall. Peter Copeland, founder and chairman of Sussex-based Futuremedia, a multimedia software pioneer, says CD-I discs may cut training costs. Software suppliers like Futuremedia are racing to deliver the first CD-I training packages. Copeland's 10-year-old company, with 60 employees and a turnover of more than Pounds 5m, built its business producing, publishing, and distributing interactive video discs and conventional computer-based training (CBT) titles. With 46 interactive discs, including 11 CD-I titles, in production, Futuremedia claims a pivotal position in the multimedia training software industry. Titles include a three-disc programme with Thames Valley TEC and the National Retail Training Consortium. Lloyds Bank, British Gas, the Post Office, Glaxo, IBM and Ford saw interactive video as a way to cut training costs and improve effectiveness. The first Ford interactive video programme, to pass training in statistical process control (SPC) to shopfloor level, has involved more than 400,000 people so far. Interactive video courseware will remain the backbone of Futuremedia's business for the present. The company has more than 100 IV titles in its catalogue of which it has produced about 20 per cent. Copeland hopes however that CD-I software sales will help attain a target of Pounds 7.5m in sales this year and Pounds 100m by the end of the decade. The UK market for multimedia training is estimated at about Pounds 250m, from a total professional training market, including hardware, of about Pounds 20bn. Having proved the concept of interactive computer-based training with optical videodisc, and with CD-I about to burst on the market, Copeland believes that multimedia will swiftly replace traditional corporate training methods and 'industrial-age classroom training.'</p>

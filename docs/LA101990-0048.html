			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: COME TO THE MUSIC FAIR, WHERE EVERY TASTE WILL BE SATISFIED.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra is usually seen in formal attire, giving  concerts on the stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But on Sunday, the musicians and conductor David Alan Miller will exchange  black ties for sport shirts and sweaters and fill the Chadwick School campus  with music during the daylong Peninsula Music Fair.  </P> <P> "We have a great audience from the South Bay, and this is both a way of  reaching new people down there and a kind of thank-you to the community," said  Ann Giesler, volunteer activities coordinator for the orchestra.  </P> <P> Although the philharmonic will be Sunday's star attraction, it's only one item  on a rich musical bill of fare that will be served continuously between 10:30  a.m. and 5 p.m. There will be marches, jazz, singing and chamber music, plus  ethnic dancing, puppetry, country-Western sounds, and an appearance by popular  jazz pianist and composer David Benoit.  </P> <P> Children will have a "Musicland" all their own, where they will be able not  only to enjoy performances but also to make musical instruments and play along  with some of the entertainers.  </P> <P> Local restaurants and markets will have food booths featuring all-American  hamburgers and hot dogs as well as Chinese beef and broccoli and Southwestern  gourmet plates.  </P> <P> "This is a wonderful day to enjoy music, a family day of festivities with  absolutely everything to satisfy all tastes," fair chairwoman Mary Diels said.  The event has been staged for 18 years by the philharmonic's Peninsula  Committee, a support group for the orchestra.  </P> <P> Last year's fair raised $45,000 for the orchestra, and $6,000 for music  education programs the committee sponsors for schoolchildren.  </P> <P> The fair will spread across the large, sloping Chadwick campus with its lawns  and shade trees. Visitors can stretch out on blankets, taking in the music as  they sample the food and drink on sale or picnics brought from home.  </P> <P> Performers will be seen on two outdoor stages and in the school amphitheater,  where Benoit will appear at 2 p.m. and the philharmonic at 3:30. Chamber groups  will play indoors in Seeley Mudd Hall.  </P> <P> "It's relaxed and there's music everywhere. What is so fun about it is that it  is so casual," said Pattee Schlatter, publicity chairman for the fair.  </P> <P> The day will get off to a rousing start with music by a unit of the USC  Marching Band. Later, the 12 dancers and musicians of the Aman Folk Ensemble  will demonstrate dances from Yugoslavia, Morocco, Turkey's Black Sea coast and  American Appalachia. From Russia, instrumentalist Emanuil Sheynkman will  perform on the balalaika.  </P> <P> A variety of chamber groups with flute, guitar, cello and strings will perform  the classics, and Smokewood will offer a blend of bluegrass and country.  </P> <P> "Musicland" will give youngsters their own entertainment lineup, including the  Jim Gamble Puppets, folk singer and storyteller Sam Hinton and the Le Tigre  Steel Drum Band.  </P> <P> Another attraction will be the Music Mobile, a van filled with musical  instruments that the Peninsula Committee takes to South Bay schools. Youngsters  -- even those smaller than a cello -- will be able to see and touch a variety  of instruments and learn about symphonic music.  </P> <P> Children will also be able to turn cans and cardboard into drums, flutes and  maracas. They'll then join Hinton and the Le Tigre band to play on stage.  </P> <P> With nearly 4,000 people expected during the day, free parking will be  available at the Palos Verdes Landfill on Crenshaw Boulevard just north of  Palos Verdes Drive North. There will be continuous free shuttle service to the  Chadwick campus.  </P> <P> Planning and staging the fair is a labor of love for the 120 active members of  the support committee, Diels said. And fair day also has become one that many  people mark on their calendars year after year.  </P> <P> Said Diels: "Some fair-goers have never missed a fair. Our view is that once  someone comes to the fair, we capture them for life. Even if they're not a  terrific music lover, just the ambience, the festivity, the lovely campus and  the rolling hills keep them coming back." GERALD FARIS  </P></p>

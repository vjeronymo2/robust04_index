			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Sharp decline in earnings at Amoco FOURTH-QUARTER earnings of Amoco, the US oil and natural gas group with large interests in chemicals, fell to Dollars 200m, or 40 cents a share, from Dollars 538m, or Dollars 1.07, in the corresponding quarter of 1990, Reuter reports from Chicago. The group attributed the fall in earnings to lower crude oil prices and higher exploration expenses. Crude oil prices averaged Dollars 20 a barrel, or more than Dollars 10 a barrel below the 1990 fourth-quarter level. Exploration expenses were up Dollars 85m. Amoco added that its chemical operations incurred loss in the quarter, reflecting a soft economy and industry overcapacity. Amoco's 1991 full-year profits declined to Dollars 1.53bn, or Dollars 3.07 a share, from Dollars 1.91bn, or Dollars 3.77, in 1990. The 1991 net includes a Dollars 311m, or 62 cents-a-share gain. Worldwide capital and exploration expenditures in 1991 amounted to Dollars 3.9bn, compared with Dollars 3.7bn in 1990. Amoco recently announced a capital and exploration expenditure budget of Dollars 3.7bn for 1992. Domestic exploration and production operations earned Dollars 107m in the fourth quarter, while foreign exploration and production earnings amounted to Dollars 46m. Refining, marketing and transportation activities reported a profit of Dollars 109m. Chemical operations incurred a Dollars 31m loss reflecting lower margins and volumes for most product lines, and charges and writedowns from streamlining operations. Full-year 1991 worldwide net liquids production averaged 744,000 barrels a day, down from 782,000 barrels in 1990. 'Lower crude oil and natural gas prices were in sharp contrast to the 1990 fourth quarter when the Kuwaiti crisis and uncertainty over supplies led to significantly higher prices,' said Amoco's chairman, Mr H. Laurance Fuller.</p>

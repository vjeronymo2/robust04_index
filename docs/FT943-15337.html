			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: Where to spot top talents of the future - Commercial products and works of art from the latest crop of bright young British designers You can tell it is July by the flurry of activity in art schools up and down the country. Invitations to student shows from Aberdeen to Penzance arrive daily. For those with time and leisure nothing could be more rewarding than doing the rounds and seeing just what the most creative youngsters are up to. For most of us, however, taking in anything more than a couple of student shows is hardly practicable. This is where the New Designers exhibition at the Business Design Centre, Islington, London N1 comes in. Under one roof you can find a broad range of the most interesting work from colleges all over the UK. The exhibition has come to serve as a marketplace, bringing together the talents of the bright young things emerging from the colleges and industrialists and manufacturers in need of new ideas and new designers. As the exhibition has grown it has become more unwieldy so, this year, it has been divided into two. The first week (hurry, just today and tomorrow left) is devoted to commercial design and should be of particular interest to any industrialist or small businessman looking for new products or new talent. Here is a selection of what is on offer: Hamish Pitt, a student at Brunel, has developed a dual-drive system which allows cars to be driven on the left or the right. Alison Swabey, also from Brunel, has come up with an alcohol tester so that those having one too many in the pub can see for themselves just what their alcohol rating is. Her design takes the form of a booth which could be installed in restaurants and pubs making it a simple matter for people to see just how much they have been affected by drink. Mark Cornwall, of De Montfort University, has designed a fly-tying device for night-fishermen. A Sheffield Hallam University student has come up with a heart defibrillator which can be carried by mountain rescue teams. All these new ideas - and many more - can be seen today and tomorrow at Islington's Business Design Centre (Saturday from 10am to 6pm, Sunday from 10am to 4pm). The exhibition then closes until Thursday when it reopens to focus on one-off, limited-edition designs - you will find ceramics, glass, accessories, textiles such as rugs and wall-hangings, and one-off pieces of furniture and lighting as well as avant-garde jewellery. Most things in the second exhibition will be for sale, with prices ranging from about Pounds 5 to Pounds 5,000, and it is a great opportunity to look for idiosyncratic presents as well as for designers who could carry out a special commission. Also at the Business Centre is a One Year On exhibition for designers who have graduated to the workplace. This year there are several youngsters I wrote about two years ago, all blossoming, several with companies of their own, others departed to exciting jobs abroad. Jonathan Hoad, who made a stunning clothes unit-cum-silent valet, has his own shop, Lime Design in Archway. Marianne Buus, whose hand-blown and studio-blown glass is colourfully memorable, is working in Sweden. Adrian Reynolds, a metalworker, has taken private commissions and works from a converted chapel in Ironbridge Gorge, in Coalbrookdale, (tel: 0952-433222) while Eleanor Kearney is designing cutlery and tableware in Sheffield. The exhibition is opens on Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 10am to 6pm, and on Sunday (July 17) from 10am to 4pm. Entrance fee, Pounds 5 for adults, Pounds 3.50 for students.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rik Coolsaet, deputy chief of cabinet to </F> Foreign Minister Claes, by Jorgen Oosterwaal; place and date not  given: "The Eye of Moscow"--first two paragaphs are KNACK  introduction]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Rik Coolsaet is deputy chief  of cabinet to Foreign Minister Willy Claes, of the Socialist  Party [SP]. He has long been the SP's defense expert and was  appointed recently lecturer in international relations at Ghent  University. [passage omitted]    Coolsaet fully understands why the West is being cautious  and  why NATO, for the time being, is not offering East Europe more  than the Partnership for Peace. A surprising view for a man who  for more than a decade has been encouraging the Belgian  Government to adopt a more active and daring Ostpolitik.  [passage omitted]    [Oosterwaal] East and West seem ready to tie the bond, but  because Yeltsin is holding back, it seems we will first have to  cohabit for a while yet?    [Coolsaet] Why should NATO be enlarged? Because we like the  company of the East European countries? Because we share the  same values and they belong with us? Or in order to ensure the  stability of Central and East Europe? NATO is not a cultural  organization, which means that only the latter reason is valid.  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott assumes that  stability in Europe will de determined by developments in  Russia. I believe he is right in his assumption. We must take  full account of Moscow. We must know what the Russians are  thinking. Why is Russia so against the enlargement of NATO?  Because it sees it as a move toward a dangerous isolation.  Since 1917 that has been a permanent fear for the Russians. We  must not fuel this paranoia.    We can draw a parallel with the Ostpolitik of the former  German Chancellor Willy Brandt. He could only begin his detente  efforts after he had assured the Russians of the status quo in  Europe, and thus by acknowledging Russia's place in Europe.  Another example is the Cuban crisis. U.S. President John  Kennedy was able to resolve it successfully because he did not  start bombing immediately but tried instead to understand how  Nikita Khruschev saw the conflict.    [Oosterwaal] The West hopes to keep Yeltsin in place because  it is horrified by his rival, Zhirinovskiy. But the West has  little or no influence on Russia's domestic affairs.    [Coolsaet] The best guarantee for stability in Europe is a  democratic Russia. Whatever it takes, we must not allow an  authoritarian, despotic system to develop in the former Soviet  Union which would be opposed to the West. But how? By  supporting the forces for democracy. I also know that our  impact is very limited. But however limited this influence may  be, we must at least try. If we believe that Russia is  automatically embarking on a new imperialist adventure, then we  cannot hesitate. Then we must enlarge the alliance as quickly  as possible. But I do not believe that this scenario is  unavoidable.    Russian society consists of a Slavic, nationalist component  and a Western-oriented component. It has been that way since  Peter the Great. It is one of the keys to an understanding of  Russia. Zhirinovskiy is the crystallization of a frustrated  nation which is feeding off anti-Western Slavic sentiments. His  success is not surprising. There is great unease in Russia. By  immediately allowing NATO to extend right up to the borders of  the former Soviet Union we would be lending force to this  Slavophile and xenophobic nationalism. As long as the power  play between the Slavophiles and those who look to the West has  not been decided, we are right not to enlarge NATO. Because by  doing so we would be undermining the stability of the continent  and also of Central Europe.    [Oosterwaal] But in the recent past the West already counted  for too long on a single Soviet leader.    [Coolsaet] It is not a question of a single leader, Mikhail  Gorbachev, Yeltsin, or anyone else. Do not forget that Russia  has no democratic tradition. Russia has always known autocratic  government. This has usually been accompanied by a radical  opposition. This is the second key which we need in order to  understand anything about Russia. The opposition between  Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy is a part of this tradition. The only  real alternative comes from political parties which are born out  of a pluralist democracy.  <H5>  Economy </H5>   Coolsaet believes in the need for stability not just in  Central Europe but throughout the continent. This was evident  from his lecture at a recent colloquium at Ghent university. "A  new world order is growing up gradually, leading to more  pronounced economic regionalism around three major industrial  poles : NAFTA in America, Tokyo and Peking in Southeast Asia,  and Europe. West Europe is not in the best of positions at the  moment. It is surrounded by turbulent regions which are running  their economies badly. If Europe still wants to count for  anything in the 21st century then we cannot remain blind to  developments outside the borders of the Union. I am not only  thinking of East Europe. In the long term, the stability of  Africa is certainly equally important," he stated.    The situation is thus very clear to Coolsaet: The military  alone provides for no stability. George Kennan, the father of  the postwar policy of containment toward the Soviet Union, knew  this. Stability has much more to do with economic factors and  the functioning of institutions. The present power vacuum in  Central Europe is in some ways comparable to the situation after  the Second World War. The sense of insecurity was relieved by  linking the economies, via the European Coal and Steel Community  and later the European Community. This unification brought  harmony, peace and prosperity. The European Union could thus  serve East Europe far better than NATO.</p>

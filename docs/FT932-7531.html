			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): Chance for a prize composition - As English gardeners gear up for one of the highlights of their year, the Chelsea flower show, the Weekend FT, in conjunction with Oxford College of Garden Design, offers all-comers a garden challenge A FREE PLACE at the Oxford College of Garden Design's summer course is being offered to the winner of our Composer's Courtyard Garden competition. Valued at Pounds 1692 (Pounds 1440 plus VAT), the garden design course takes place from July 19 to August 12 at Wolfson College in Oxford. Numbers are limited to 16 to ensure that all students receive plenty of individual attention from principal Duncan Heather, one of Britain's foremost garden designers, and his team of lecturers. This and a one-year part-time course which starts in September are being offered for the first time by the Oxford College of Garden Design. The theme of the competition is a Composer's Courtyard Garden. The garden should reflect a well-known composer's personality or a particular piece of music. For example, a water garden might be a celebration of Handel's Water Music, while a theatrical garden could be inspired by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Entrants are asked to design a south facing courtyard garden measuring 15m x 5m with a fertile clay soil. The garden is surrounded by a 6 ft brick wall and is entirely laid to lawn. The plan should be submitted on a sheet of paper no larger than A3 and drawn to a scale of 1:50 (2cm = 1m). It should show the two dimensional layout of the garden to include features such as paving, ponds, pergolas, tree positions, planting beds, seats etc. The plan should be accompanied by a 200-word description of the garden. A detailed planting plan is not required. Applications should be received by June 18 this year.

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Observer: Ridickulous Out of sight out of mind, so to speak. Four months after the passing of Richard Nixon, the 20th anniversary of his Watergate-induced resignation merited not one line in the Washington Post, the newspaper whose reporting, more than any other, contributed to his dramatic downfall. Careful scrutiny even of the classified advertisements revealed not a single job opening for plumbers at the White House or the Watergate complex. In fact the only anniversary recognised by the Post at all was a helpful article on who did not go to the Woodstock rock festival, which took place 25 years ago this weekend - and it failed to include Nixon in the list of those who were otherwise engaged.</p>

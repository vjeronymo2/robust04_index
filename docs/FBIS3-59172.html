			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "All Right: `Yes' or `No'"] </F>   [Text] The working group charged with organizing the EU  [European Union] plebiscite has finally decided against the  pitfall of having three choices on the ballot and has announced  its support for a clear "yes" or "no" for membership. These will  be Finland's only alternatives after negotiations are concluded.  It would therefore be wrong to offer voters a "don't know"  choice. Obviously none of the three choices would get a  majority, so that the government and parliament would have been  able to interpret the results of an advisory vote any way they  saw fit.    The working group had floundered about in the law regarding  conducting plebiscites, which provides for the possibility of  vote choices that are neither for or against. Fortunately, clear  heads won out in this dispute over legalities, and the working  group decided the issue unconditionally: that the procedural  legislation was not applicable here. And in reality, there are  no other choices than yes or no regarding EU membership. Nor  should there be more than two choices provided in other  plebiscites.    According to the most recent HELSINGIN SANOMAT-Gallup poll,  the percentage of those favoring EU membership has remained  steady at 41 percent. The figure for those against, however, has  gone down precipitously: for January 27 percent, while as late  as November it was 41 percent, and in December 43 percent.  Correspondingly, the figure for the "don't know" group has grown  steeply to 32 percent.    A third of voters are thusly confused about membership or  have not made up their mind. The outcome of negotiations and the  subsequent assessment of it will affect their final position. If  the negotiations are completed more rapidly than scheduled, at  the latest by the end of March, the plebiscite could be held in  September or October.</p>

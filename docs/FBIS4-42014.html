			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Chikalin: "The Telephone of </F> Confidence Will Soon Connect Ministers of Ukraine and the United  States"]    [Text] So far, the hot-line telephone has been installed  in the office of U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry.  Specialists from the United States are expected in Kiev soon to  establish a direct connection between our defense minister and  his U.S. colleague. During an official visit to the United  States by a delegation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Ukrainian  Army General [and Defense Minister] Vitaliy Radetskyy spent  three days in the company of William Perry. The atmosphere of  confidence can be confirmed by the following fact: Our minister  observed the dismantlement of a strategic missile launcher. ( By  the way, he also had an opportunity to touch the tumbler that  destroyed it.) He showed us the device used to do that, which  he kept as a souvenir. He also told us that the explosion at the  silo was observed by a farmer and his family, on whose land the  launcher had been located. His wife held their two-month-old  son, who did not even wake up from the sound of the explosion.  This fact confirms the security of works connected with the  dismantling of silos, and those that are still in operation,  which had previously been aimed at Ukraine but were retargeted  on 30 May. We did the same thing as early as December of 1993.    Most likely, relations of confidence, which have been  established between the chiefs of military departments, will  soon be expanded to include officers and soldiers.    An agreement on training Ukrainian officers at U.S. military  education centers has been reached. Meanwhile, our soldiers are  preparing for joint military exercise with Polish and Dutch  servicemen. Similar exercises with U.S. Army units have been  scheduled for 1995.    According to Vitaliy Radetskyy, there are plenty of things  to  be implemented, based on the experience of our U.S. colleagues.  In particular, this relates to the organization of education  centers and use of simulators. An agreement has already been  signed, which envisions that 12 Ukrainian officers will be sent  to military centers to study the U.S. experience firsthand. At  the same time, however, we cannot copy everything; which must  take into account our own capabilities and conditions, which are  quite unique. For example, let us look at living standards.  The Army driver who was driving Vitaliy Radetskyy during his  visit to the United States, is a contract serviceman. He  receives $1,600 [per month], has his own apartment and car, as  does his wife. Our country, however, currently does not have  funds to introduce a contract service that would meet  servicemen's demands. Therefore, the mixed system of staffing  the Army is being preserved. As of today, 72.3 percent of young  reinforcements have been drafted, and 35,000 people are already  serving on contracts. Nevertheless, in general, these  conditions do not satisfy people. This relates, in particular,  to wages. A lieutenant receives so little money that he is not  able to invite his girlfriend to a cafe. Therefore, the defense  minister has recently addressed the issue of increasing  financial provisions for servicemen to the president and the  Supreme Council.</p>

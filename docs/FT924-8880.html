			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Management: Honda reaches accord in UK - Demarcation lines are out and teamwork is in at a new car plant in Swindon The receptionist at Honda's manufacturing complex has not yet had to leave her desk to help screw widgets together on the engine assembly line. But, if asked, she is perfectly prepared to do so. Indeed, it would be expected in the unlikely event of a sudden shop-floor crisis at the Japanese car-maker's Pounds 370m plant at Swindon, 80 miles west of London. The receptionist would even be appropriately dressed. As a matter of daily routine she wears overalls similar to those of Shojiro Miyake, managing director of Honda manufacturing in the UK and president of Honda Motor Europe. They are the same overalls that are worn by the remaining 844 employees and directors currently working at the 360-acre site. She could find herself swapping spanners on the assembly line with Andrew Jones, the plant manager who was last week made a director Honda of the UK Manufacturing. A former BT personnel director, with experience in the mining industry, he has operational control of a complex that already inspects and tests some 40,000 Honda Concertos built for it by its Rover Group partner. The plant also makes more than 100,000 engines a year and has just started producing the first of what, by the mid-1990s, will be 100,000 Honda cars a year. Jones makes clear that, if the need is sufficiently urgent, no one in the plant is too senior, or exempt for any other reason, from helping out on even the most humble tasks. He has no office or secretary. But then neither do any other of the plant's most senior employees, including Miyake. There are other cultural aspects of Honda's Swindon operation which, like the status-shrouding overalls, have already acquired a familiar ring to western ears through Japanese companies which have long preceded Honda into Europe. Everyone at Swindon is on the same pension scheme, sick pay conditions and holiday entitlement. There is no reserved parking. Everyone uses the same changing rooms and canteen. There are no formal job descriptions and there are no workers or directors, only 'associates'. Nothing better illustrates the attitudes being promoted by Honda than the company's move to a shorter working week. During 1990, following a concerted campaign by engineering unions, indigenous companies horse-traded with their employees over the terms for moving from 40 hours to 39. At the same time, Honda's Swindon employees were told they could move from a 40 to a 37-hour week - without preconditions. 'What we said was, 'look, effectively we're giving you 5.1 per cent time at the same rate of pay. Will you please make up the difference?'' recalls Jones. 'And it came - in the form of hundreds of small ideas which improved the way we work and our overall levels of efficiency.' It was not just the shorter hours but the way in which they were organised which has helped to foster good relations within a plant which has no union representation or recognition - and no plans for any. Says Jones: 'We have a young work force with an average age of 29. They're a social lot. They mostly like a drink and the opposite sex and we quite understood that on Friday nights they'd really like to leave early. 'Ordinarily, the second of the two shifts within the engine and vehicle inspection plants finishes at midnight. But by making both morning and evening shifts shorter by two hours, and cutting the normal gap between first and second shifts from the usual one hour and 10 minutes to 10 minutes, everyone gets to go home on Friday by 6.30 at latest.' Currently, only a handful of Accords are coming off the line each day - a function of what Jones acknowledges to be an 'obsession' with quality, and of the small teams grouped on the assembly line learning for themselves how best to organise their work. Jones says it will be 12 to 18 months before the Swindon plant is producing at its single-shift capacity of 50,000 cars a year, so anxious is Honda to set high quality standards from the start. Nevertheless, the build-up is under way, and employment at the plant will pass the 1,000 mark in early January, en route to 1,500 jobs by the end of next year as single-shift capacity nears, and an eventual 2,000 in the mid-1990s. 'Teamwork' crops up in almost every sentence uttered by Jones: 'It is critical. So many people talk of good teamwork as if it's some kind of philosopher's stone. In our case it translates as an overriding objective to develop together. If you were to go out on the line, you would find no work study or industrial engineers timing everything - we expect our people to develop their own jobs and functions.' The car plant work force is being 'grown' organically from a core of about 100 people who were among the first employees at the pre-delivery inspection (PDI) centre - operational since 1986 - and the engine plant which has been on stream since 1989. 'The advantage is that the PDI people came with an understanding of all aspects of the car, and people from the engine centre came with an awareness of the importance of meeting production targets.' Working in teams of four, they are said by Jones to have gained great breadth of understanding and knowledge from each other. Initial teams were formed by one Japanese training one 'Brit'. Both would then train two more Britons. All four would train another four - and so the process continues today. 'Teamwork means that we reject class differentiation and job demarcation. We don't accept anyone as being more important than anyone else. If we are recruiting at a senior level, that recruit spends at least one month on the shop floor. So if you want high status, a secretary and an expensive desk to keep everyone at a distance - don't come and work here,' says Jones. The majority of the current work force has been recruited locally, many during a period when unemployment in the Swindon region was under 3 per cent. Now it is 9 per cent but the recruitment programme continues almost invisibly, with initial recommendations spreading by word of mouth. Each candidate has to pass two interviews and, more recently, an aptitude test. All staff are involved in daily start-of-shift briefings and are fully briefed from weekly management meetings. At the start of each month all staff review with Jones and his closest associates the company's current position and operating activities as well as welcoming new 'associates'. There are also monthly 'birthday party' get-togethers in which all staff with a birthday that month meet socially and to swap ideas with Miyake, Jones and other senior colleagues. There are also regular 'Y-Gaya' meetings involving all groups of employees. The phrase stands for 'free, frank interchance of views'. The idea, says Jones, is continually to widen understanding and spread knowledge. There are now 52 'new Honda circles' - teams of six people looking for continuous improvement within defined areas that the team itself selects. They include new ideas, training, environment and safety. As an example, one 'associate' was burned while deep in the foundry area, undertaking maintenance. His circle devised a new system which now means that no one needs to enter the hazard area. The sometimes roguishly self-named circles have plaques created in token of their achievements. Honda, says Jones, has no problem publicly acknowledging its gratitude to, among other teams, the 'Missionary Position' and 'Three Men and a Ferret'.</p>

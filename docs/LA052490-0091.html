			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: PARAMOUNT;  </P> <P> PUPILS TO BE MOVED FROM 3 CROWDED SITES  </P> <P> The Paramount Unified School District Board of Education has unanimously  approved a plan to move an estimated 700 elementary pupils from their  neighborhood schools to a renovated facility to relieve overcrowded conditions  in the 12,500-student system.  </P> <P> The five-member board made its decision Tuesday after three public hearings in  which numerous parents voiced objections.  </P> <P> Parents said they were most fearful of their children crossing busy streets and  traffic from the nearby Century Freeway, now under construction. Many of the  objections came from parents living in the Hollydale area. Although nearly 300  children were scheduled to be transferred from that area, the board compromised  and allowed 61 pupils to remain at Hollydale.  </P> <P> Children will be transferred starting in September from three of the most  crowded elementary campuses, Hollydale, Roosevelt and Lincoln, to Wirtz  Elementary School.  </P> <P> Wirtz has been used as an annex for Paramount High School. Students who have  been using the annex will return to the high school campus in September after  classroom construction is completed.  </P></p>

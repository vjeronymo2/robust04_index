But what about its problems? In the view of the  Zemessargi, they are virtually nonexistent. Just 30 weapons were  lost this year. If you add the 20 in 1992, the result is  insignificant--only one weapon has been lost for every 340  volunteers.    The problems lie elsewhere. For example, the personnel of  the  18th Zemessargi Battalion were upset that there is just one  grenade for every three volunteers and that they are forced to  buy bullets at their own expense. In order to avoid weapons  losses, it was proposed to improve the way they are kept:  According to one volunteer, Modris Zermanis, a medical academy  student, students should be allowed to keep weapons in their  dormitories.    A member of the 23rd Battalion took an even simpler approach  to this question. He proposed that volunteers be authorized to  carry weapons not only when in uniform and on duty, but also  when off duty. The danger of this proposal is obvious: Fifty  people have died at the hands of these valorous "guardians of  order" in the republic in 1993. But this clearly doesn't bother  the Zemessargi.</p>

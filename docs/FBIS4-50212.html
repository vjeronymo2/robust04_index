			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Jinfu (3076 6855 4395): "China's </F> Anticorruption Work Is Gradually Institutionalized"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- China has gone all out  to conduct anticorruption work since 1978, when China's  procuratorial organs were restored and reorganized. Since then,  700,000 corruption and bribery cases have been accepted and  heard, of which, 400,000 have been filed for investigation and  prosecution, and 8 billion yuan worth's embezzled money and  goods have been recovered. From 1982 to 1993, seven cadres of  provincial and ministerial levels, over 300 cadres of department  and bureau levels, and over 7,000 cadres of county and section  levels, who were guilty of corruption and bribery, were placed  on file for investigation and prosecution by procuratorial  organs throughout the country.    Since the convocation of the third plenary session of the  11th CPC Central Committee, China's anticorruption work has  begun to be implemented in line with the legal system. The  restored and reorganized procuratorial organs have actively  conducted the work of dealing blows to economic irregularities,  including the work of opposing corruption. Particularly since  the CPC Central Committee adopted the decision of profoundly  launching the anticorruption struggle in August 1993,  procuratorial organs have given full play to their functional  role to emphatically investigate and punish the corruption and  bribery cases committed by working personnel of party and  government organs, judicial departments, law-enforcing  administrative departments, and economic management departments.  Procuratorial organs have also concentrated their efforts on  investigating and cracking a number of major and appalling  cases, thus achieving remarkable results in the anticorruption  work. From September 1993 to March 1994, procuratorial organs  filed 22,220 corruption and bribery cases for investigation, of  which, 9,948 cases involved an amount ranging from 10,000 yuan  to 100,000 each, 789 cases involved an amount ranking from  100,000 yuan to 1 million yuan each, and 37 cases involved over  1 million yuan each. At the same time, 904 cadres at or above  the county and section levels, who committed the crimes of  corruption and bribery, were investigated and punished (of whom,  71 were of department and bureau levels). A total of 13,019  cadres guilty of corruption and bribery were brought to the  people's courts for prosecution.    While launching the anticorruption struggle, procuratorial  organs have established crime-reporting centers, perfected the  crime-reporting system, and successfully created the effective  method of mobilizing and depending on the masses to struggle  against corruption and bribery during the new period of not  carrying the mass movement. According to statistics, since the  establishment of crime-reporting centers, the crimes reported by  the masses have become the major source of the corruption and  bribery cases filed by procuratorial organs for investigation.  From 1988 to 1993, procuratorial organs throughout the country  accepted a total of 750,000 clues for solving corruption and  bribery cases.    During the anticorruption struggle, procuratorial organs  have  gradually given rise to a mechanism of opposing corruption and  investigating corruption cases, in which higher levels are  combined with lower levels and organizational operation is  rapid, thus pushing the anticorruption work to the new path of  regularized and modernized development. At present,  procuratorial organs throughout the country have an  anticorruption and investigation contingent of 38,000 people.</p>

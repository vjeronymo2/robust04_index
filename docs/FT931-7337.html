			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Colombia steps up hunt for Escobar COLOMBIA'S government has ordered top police and army units to Medelln to mount the country's 'biggest single operation' to capture Pablo Escobar, the fugitive cocaine king, Reuter reports from Bogota. TV pictures showed helicopters and transport aircraft landing heavily-armed troops in Medelln and the surrounding area of Antioquia Province where Escobar is believed to be hiding. President Cesar Gaviria has blamed Escobar for a campaign of car bombings that have killed over 40 people in Medelln and Bogota in the past two months, but claimed last week that security forces were finally closing in on him. Escobar escaped from jail last July during a bungled operation to transfer him to a more secure prison. Despite a reward of Dollars 6.7m (Pounds 4.7m), one of the highest ever offered by a government for the capture of a criminal, he has remained at large. A senior police officer said army commander Gen Hernan Jose Guzman and deputy National Police director Octavio Vargas Silva had arrived in Medellin to direct the operation. Deputy Prosecutor-General Francisco Sintura also flew in amid tight security, leading some to speculate that Escobar may be intending to surrender.</p>

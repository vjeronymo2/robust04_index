			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / World Trade News: Intelsat gives launch contract to China INTELSAT, the international telecommunications consortium, has for the first time in its 29 years granted a contract to China Great Wall Industry Corporation for the launch of an Intelsat satellite in 1995-96. The contract - for the first model of a new Long March series - is contingent on the receipt of a US export licence. The US state department, which has authority over such export licences, has granted permission in the past for export of two Hughes satellites, launched by Great Wall, for Asiasat and Aussat, two regional systems. However, each licence application has to be considered separately, and approval will depend on the technology embedded in the satellite, a state department official said. Mr Tony Trujillo, a spokesman for Intelsat, said the contract to China Great Wall is part of a broader plan by the new director general, Mr Irving Goldstein, to stress price saving and efficiency within the organisation to prepare for competitive threats posed by fibre optic cable and separate satellite systems. Great Wall is selling its service for an (unspecified) 'competitive' price, and Intelsat wants to diversify its launch suppliers, Mr Trujillo said. The Intelsat board has also endorsed the introduction of medium-term and long-term debt into Intelsat's capital structure in order to reduce the average cost of capital. Mr Goldstein said in an interview that he is now preparing for the 'first foray' into the international capital markets. 'It's another part of our culture change,' he said. 'Instead of being 100 per cent equity-financed we will move toward a Eurobond offering in the third quarter of 1992.' Intelsat's basic telephonic service will grow 'only modestly' on the high density routes connecting industrialised countries, he said. Its main growth for telephone services will be in eastern Europe and third world markets.</p>

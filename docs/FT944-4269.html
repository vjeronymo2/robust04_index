			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Microsoft opens Chinese Window US software giant Microsoft signed an agreement yesterday with China to create a new standard for Chinese personal computer operating systems. Microsoft signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Electronics Industry to create the standard by developing and delivering a Chinese version of Microsoft's operating system, Windows 95, in partnership with Chinese companies. The new operating system will accelerate the growth of personal computing in China by making PCs easier to use and by providing a new generation of Chinese software applications, Mr Charles Stevens, vice president for the Far East region of Microsoft, said. The Chinese version of Windows 95 - the next generation of its flagship Windows due for release next year - will be fully compatible with Microsoft's worldwide Windows product engineering and design. Beijing regulators had refused to accept the Chinese version of Windows as a standard for China after Microsoft alienated electronics ministry officials by developing the mainland version, nicknamed P-WIn, not in China but in Taiwan, which uses a different form of Chinese characters and dissimilar methods of keyboard entry.</p>

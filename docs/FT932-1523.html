			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca Pounds 1.3bn rights taken up by 86% ZENECA'S Pounds 1.3bn rights issue was taken up by 86.15 per cent of its shareholders and the balance of the issue was placed yesterday at 612p, 12p above the rights issue price. Shares in Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged from Imperial Chemical Industries at the beginning of this month, rose on the news, closing at 626p, up 8p. SG Warburg and BZW, the securities houses which organised the placing, took a 0.2 per cent fee for the placing, equivalent to 1.224p per share. Investors who did not take up their rights will therefore receive 10.776p per share. The deal is the largest underwritten rights issue to have succeeded in the UK market, with no shares being left for the underwriters to take up. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Zeneca, said he was 'delighted' by the take-up of the issue. Mr John Mayo, finance director, said: 'We achieved all the objectives we set ourselves'. Neither Mr Mayo nor Zeneca's brokers would say how many shares were sold by the international marketing syndicate set up to find demand from outside Zeneca's existing shareholder base. Market sources suggest this operation did not find significant new demand for Zeneca. Mr Mayo said that, 'the syndicate sold shares in all the major time zones; Europe, the US and Japan'. However, he added that against a background of uncertainty in the US over healthcare reforms, 'while there was demand, it might not have been at the level seen two years ago'.</p>

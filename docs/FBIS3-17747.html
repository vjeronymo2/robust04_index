Our  correspondent Ihor Bak reports:    [Begin Bak recording] Members of this delegation which  arrived in Ukraine on 24 March -- including well-known  politicians from a number of European countries -- have had the  opportunity to obtain information, so to speak, first hand, in  particular from the head of the Supreme Council, the head of the  Central Electoral Commission, representatives of political  parties, etc. Members of the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly  delegation visited Zhytomir, Lvov, Donetsk, and a number of  other oblasts, in addition to Kiev.    On 27 March, that is, on the day of elections, the  parliamentarians of foreign countries observed the progress of  the elections in 80 constituencies, including those located in  military units. Thus, having informed Ukrainian and foreign  journalists of their conclusions, the foreign observers  emphasized that the elections in Ukraine were held in accordance  with Ukraine's law on the elections of Ukraine's people's  deputies and with a high rate of citizen participation. They  were gratified to note that the elections were held on an  alternative basis [alternatyvna osnova]. However, at the same  time, they stated that a great number of candidates for deputy  seats in many constituencies caused serious troubles in the  process of voting. Because of this, electors made mistakes  during the voting, and a significant number of election ballots  was found invalid. In spite of this, Peter Emery, head of the  CSCE Parliamentary Assembly delegation, said during the news  conference that we can state that the Ukrainian elections were  democratic and successful.

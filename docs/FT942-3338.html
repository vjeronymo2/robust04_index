			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Bad start for Railtrack Today's one-day rail dispute in the UK is an inconvenience for millions of people who rely on rail transport, and an unwelcome reminder of the bad old days. It is more than an inconvenience for Railtrack, the state-owned company set up in April to run British Rail's track and signalling operations as it is privatised. In its first few months of existence, it needs to win the confidence of its customers and conclude dozens of deals with the train-operating companies and the track maintenance companies. A one-day strike of Railtrack's signalling staff, with the promise of more to come, is an inauspicious start. Further, with its own privatisation hoped for before the next election, Railtrack is caught in a bind. It wants to keep down its wage costs to maximise its sale price, but if it continues with its hard line against the RMT rail union it will face a growing bill for compensation from track users unable to run trains. Railtrack is not blameless for the current mess, which involves a pay claim going back seven years. It appears to have indicated that it was ready to offer an interim pay deal to signals staff, before withdrawing the offer and saying that an offer would only be made at the conclusion of productivity talks. The union, however, must take most of the blame for today's events. Railtrack accepts the logic of a catch-up payment for signals staff. But union members are demanding some of that money now - and without a link to productivity changes. To strike for such a deal is more than premature: it is irresponsibly exploiting Railtrack's vulnerability at a delicate stage in its development. More than 100 years of adversarial industrial relations on the railways will not disappear overnight. But now that the railway system is being exposed to market forces, the new rail managers are under even greater pressure to manage change without industrial conflict. They cannot do that with a trigger-happy RMT.</p>

The two-story homes in the first phase will be priced in the low  $400,000s. Sales are scheduled to start in late summer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Information Center  </P> <P> Construction has begun on a $1.5-million dome-topped Spanish-classical  information center for the Rancho del Rey master-planned community in Chula  Vista.  </P> <P> The 1,600-acre Rancho del Rey is being developed by McMillin Communities and  Home Capital Development Group, a unit of Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> Located north of East H Street between Otay Lakes Road and Interstate 805, the  community will eventually have about 4,000 houses and a business park. First  houses are expected to be started in August, according to a spokesman for  McMillin Realty, the marketing agent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Senior Citizen Project  </P> <P> Construction has begun on Morningside of Fullerton, a $75-million community for  senior citizens at Brea Boulevard and Bastanchury Road in Fullerton.  </P> <P> When completed in late 1992, the 41-acre project will provide 338 apartments  and villas for healthy seniors, a 99-bed skilled nursing facility and a 44-unit  complex for older people needing special medical care. The project is being  developed by CoreCare, a group of Fullerton-area residents and physicians who  have have built similar projects in the past.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rentals for Seniors  </P> <P> Construction is scheduled to begin this summer on Silvercrest Residence, a  74-unit senior citizen rental project south of the Santa Paula Freeway on the  east side of Petit Avenue in eastern Ventura.

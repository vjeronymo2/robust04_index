			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary recognizes the importance of reducing possible interruption in funding to the extent consistent with the conduct of a responsible review of the financial and administrative capability of the school under new ownership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department currently reviews only transfers that have taken effect, and thereby have caused the eligibility and certification of the institution to lapse, even if the transfer is subject to a condition  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> subsequent <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , such as obtaining the Department's approval and certification. The Department has taken this position because it ensures that the parties submit only transfers under which the purchaser has conducted the requisite due diligence to ensure that approval and certification will be granted. The Secretary believes this position is fair because the regulations state fully the standards under which the qualifications of the school for certification will be measured, and because virtually all the information on which approval of the institution under new ownership depends is fully available to, and in many instances derived directly from, the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary sees no reason why a purchaser should not be able and expected to have made a fully informed decision to purchase before submitting the application for certification. Unfortunately, in the past, purchasers have often engaged in wholly inadequate due diligence, given scant professional attention to the requirements for participation in the student assistance programs, and presented seriously deficient applications for approval. These deficiencies unnecessarily consume Department review resources and needlessly delay approval decisions for the institution. Lack of competent due diligence also results in other purchasers purporting to be unaware of problems with the qualifications of the institution they have purchased that are serious enough to make Department approval impossible. The Secretary's procedure for review of change of ownership applications will foster responsible and effective due diligence by the purchaser.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulation provides that the Secretary will review an application filed with respect to a transfer that is subject to any contingency, provided that the sale was otherwise completed. A transfer that is otherwise final is considered completed even if the seller retains a security interest in the institution or its assets to assure satisfaction of payment of the purchase price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters believed that a transfer of ownership to a person who had been engaged in management of the school should not be considered a change within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. Others urged excluding transfers of ownership interests among current shareholders, particularly if the institution was owned by a close corporation and the shareholders had held those interests for several years or the shareholder acquiring the controlling interest had been engaged in managing of that institution. Other commenters urged that transfers of controlling ownership interests from the owner upon retirement to a shareholder currently involved in management of the school be excluded from changes in ownership within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 498(i) of the HEA requires an institution to reestablish its educational credentials and its administrative and financial capability after a change of ownership and control. Transfers of ownership commonly take place between those holding the controlling interest in the institution and individuals who have been managing the institution. While there may often be a continuity of management and administration through such transfers of ownership, the financial capability of the institution after the current managers assume controlling ownership interests may be dramatically different than under the prior owner, particularly where the transaction is structured as an asset sale rather than a stock transaction. The fact that the new owner already had an ownership interest, or was involved in management of the institution, or both, does not provide assurance that scrutiny can responsibly be waived for those reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 498(i)(3) of the HEA does provide that the transfer of the interest of an owner upon his or her death to a family member or to a current owner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> may <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be excluded from its purview. This exclusion would apply readily to the kind of unexpected transfers of control that would occur of necessity upon the death of an actively-managing principal of an institution owned by a closely-held corporation. However, the rationale for deferring to this humanitarian objective of facilitating a smooth transition in this narrow circumstance does not support waiving otherwise-mandated scrutiny in a broader range of transfers involving corporations that are not closely held, or planned transfers to those who have neither an ownership interest nor any managerial involvement in the institution. The Secretary considers it prudent to limit the waiver at this time only to those transfers of the interest of a deceased or retiring owner either to one who is a current manager and owner of the institution or to an immediate family member, and to evaluate the consequences of this kind of waiver, before considering further waivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulation is changed to adopt the same description of the family of the owner as that used in &sect;600.31(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Most commenters welcomed the adoption of bright-line tests for identifying changes of ownership and control, and the use of the acquisition or relinquishment of a 50 percent interest in the institution or its owner was generally agreed as a suitable line. Some commenters stressed the importance of looking to control rather than simply percentage of ownership interest, and urged that a transfer of ownership interest between active and passive investors be disregarded if the transfer did not change the control of the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In proposing that the term ``control'' as used in section 498(i) of the HEA and current regulations be interpreted with reference to SEC regulations, 17 CFR part 230.405, the Secretary intended to recognize that ``the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise,'' included the power held by a managing partner or active investor to effectively direct the decisions and policies of the partnership or corporation. Therefore, the intent and effect of the proposed rule was to recognize that a transfer of an ownership interest to one who holds some ownership interest and who already had the power to direct the management of the entity does not constitute a change of ownership resulting in a change in control. Such transfers do not fall within the purview of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

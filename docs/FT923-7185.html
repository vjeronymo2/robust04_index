			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Major orders fighters to Gulf: Britain pledges 1,800 troops to escort UN relief convoys in Bosnia BRITAIN last night responded to the conflicts in southern Iraq and Bosnia-Hercegovina by deciding to send warplanes to the Gulf and offering up to 1,800 troops to escort United Nations aid convoys in the former Yugoslav republic. After a six-hour meeting with senior ministers, Mr John Major, the prime minister, announced that six Tornado jet fighters and two refuelling aircraft would join an international force to clamp a 'no-fly' zone on southern Iraq. This will stop Iraq from using its aircraft to attack Shia Moslems in the area. Officials said any troops sent to Bosnia would be under the UN flag to escort convoys operating with the consent of the warring factions. It was stressed at the highest levels in Downing Street that there was no question of the troops being used to 'fight a way through to besieged towns' in the republic, which is torn by ethnic conflict between Serbs, Croats and Moslems. Troops would not be sent to 'fight their way to Armageddon and back', one senior minister said. France yesterday also announced support for the US plan to curb President Saddam Hussein by enforcing an air exclusion zone in southern Iraq. Mr Major said the exclusion zone, to be set up within days, was a response to 'clear evidence' that Mr Saddam had adopted a policy of 'systematic murder, genocide' of the area's Shia Moslems. The international coalition of forces ranged against Iraq would fly 24-hour air patrols over southern Iraq, mainly with US aircraft, but France had agreed to contribute a force similar in size to that of the UK, he said. Mr Major expected the Iraqi air force would stop bombing the Shia communities, but added: 'If they fly in the proscribed area, then they will be attacked.' Rejecting suggestions that the operation was being mounted to help the re-election prospects of President George Bush in November, Mr Major charged Mr Saddam with repeatedly flouting UN resolutions by 'systematic repression' of the Shias. Officials said the Tornados  - which can be used in both combat and reconnaissance roles  - would be in the region within days. There was speculation they would be based in Bahrain, from which they operated during the Gulf war. The international force would operate under existing UN resolutions but the precise scope of the zone would be finalised in discussions at the Security Council in New York, officials said. A note warning Iraq would then be handed to the Iraqi ambassador at the UN. Mr Major, who broke off his holiday in Spain to chair yesterday's emergency ministerial talks, signalled that the plan to send a maximum of 1,800 British forces personnel to Bosnia did not represent a reversal of his strong opposition to direct western military involvement in the Yugoslav conflict. The personnel would form part of an enlarged UN force in the region, and would be sent only if requested by UN aid agencies. The offer of troops comes after the Security Council authorised the use of force if necessary to get humanitarian aid to civilians in Bosnia. France has already sent troops to Bosnia to help the relief effort. A range of more ambitious options was considered and rejected at the London meeting, including a defensive role against light attacks on convoys operating without the agreement of the protagonists, a defensive role against heavier attacks and opening up permanently defended aid corridors. But officials said each had been rejected because of the risk of drawing western forces into a full-scale conflict. A British Hercules transport aircraft found itself under threat yesterday as it was taking off from Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, after delivering relief supplies. A UN official said irregular forces in the hills locked on to the aircraft with radar equipment designed to target objects for attack. The US, meanwhile, is not planning to seek a fresh UN Security Council mandate before enforcing a ban on Iraqi aircraft flying south of the 32nd parallel. It believes resolutions passed at the end of the Gulf war are worded broadly enough to allow military action in defence of the groups being persecuted by Baghdad. Shia rebels in southern Iraq have come under intensified military pressure from Baghdad in recent weeks. US officials say they have detected a large buildup of Iraqi troops in the south. Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, said that the exclusion zone imposed in northern Iraq to protect the Kurdish population had proved effective. 'So we envisage, among the allies, going about things the same way over southern Iraq to protect the Shia population,' he said.

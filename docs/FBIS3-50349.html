			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Head of the Czech broadcasts of Radio Free Europe  [RFE] Pavel Pechacek has praised the positive attitude of our  government in the talks about the possible transfer of the  station from Munich to Prague. The decision has not been made  yet, Pavel Pechacek said, and added that further talks on the  topic will take place in Prague tomorrow.    In his words, however, the Czech section and the Institute  of  Free Europe and Liberty should move to Prague by the end of  June. The talks on accommodating these sections favor the former  building of the National Assembly.    According to Pavel Pechacek, representatives of RFE should  have talks in Bratislava with the Slovak Government on Friday.  According to Pechacek, the Slovak Government, in connection with  its proposal to end the possibility of RFE broadcasts on Velke  Kostolany, Poprad, and Presov transmitters, probably wants to  offer an alternative solution.</p>

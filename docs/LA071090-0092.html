			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Move Over, Di: Princess Kiko, 23, wife of Prince Akishino, 24, Emperor  Akihito's youngest son, drew admiring attention from guests on a weekend visit  to an imperial tomb in Kashihara, Japan. "She's so much more beautiful in  person," gushed one middle-aged woman in the crowd Saturday as the princess  walked a few steps behind her husband.  </P> <P> "I like the way she smiles."  </P> <P> Old Story: The Library of Congress will display personal mail between members  of Congress and their wives over the last 200 years, some of which suggests  Washington sex scandals are not new. Rep. Job Pierson of New York wrote to his  wife, Clarissa, on Dec. 17, 1834, that her brother, a U.S. senator, seduced a  maid the first week of her employment and "cohabitated with her during the  whole session . . . . The other boarders were angry at this monopoly," he  wrote. "They enticed some four or five girls from a house of ill-fame . . . who  came there every night."  </P> <P> Final Fourth Report: Georgette Mosbacher knows how to get attention. She showed  up at Alan Greenspan's Independence Day party at the Federal Reserve in a sexy  green outfit. But the commerce secretary's wife also caused a few raised  eyebrows because she wore an American flag scarf around her shoulders.  </P> <P> Space Rights: A physicist urged a UFO symposium to accept a bill of rights to  govern people from different worlds. John Brandenburg's declaration, presented  Sunday in Pensacola, Fla., says humans and extraterrestrials are all "children  of the creator" with equal rights. It forbids landings without consent of  future global authorities and prohibits alien bases on other planets'  satellites. Brandenburg ended his talk with the monologue from the "Star Trek"  series.  </P></p>

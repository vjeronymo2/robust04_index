			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (4): Strength and stability - The Economy DENMARK did not get much of a mention during the recent turbulence in European foreign exchange markets - which, as Mrs Bodil Nyboe Andersen, deputy governor of the National Bank (central bank) put it, was 'a good sign'. Mr Henning Dyremose, finance minister, and Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, economy minister, never tire of asserting that the country has one of the strongest economies in Europe, and they would like to keep it that way. By strong, they mean that there is a large current balance of payments surplus, low inflation and a moderate budget deficit. The balance of payments surplus was DKr23bn, or 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product, in the 12 months to June. Consumer prices rose by 2.1 per cent over the 12 months to August. The budget deficit in 1992 will be about DKr38bn, or 4.4 per cent of GDP, while the total public sector borrowing requirement, according to government estimates, will be about DKr17bn, or 1.9 per cent of GDP, this year and slightly lower in 1993. The surplus on trade in goods and services over the 12 months to June was about DKr56bn, or 6.5 per cent of GDP. Denmark is one of the few countries to meet the so-called convergence criteria required of countries participating in the third and final stage of the EC's economic and monetary union. Ironically, however, it is likely to make exemption from a commitment to join Emu one of the conditions for solving the problems caused by its rejection of the Maastricht treaty in the June referendum. The external strength of the economy may be weakened by the depreciation of sterling and the lire, by the savage fiscal policy imposed by Sweden this autumn, and by the slowdown in the German economy. Britain is especially important for exports of Danish agricultural products, notably bacon and other pigmeat products. Germany and Sweden are the country's two largest export markets. In its August economic survey, prior to the foreign exchange turbulence, the Economy Ministry predicted a volume increase in exports of 4.3 per cent in both 1992 and 1993. A somewhat lower growth rate in 1993 now seems probable. The economic strengths are paralleled by some economic weaknesses, especially low growth rates and high unemployment. The annual average increase in GDP for 1987-91 was 1.1 per cent. A bad harvest and rising interest rates forced the Economy Ministry to reduce its growth forecast for 1992 from about 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent, but it is hoping for a better 1993, with a forecast (in August) GDP growth rate of 2.5 per cent. Unemployment is expected to average 10.7 per cent, or 305,000, this year. It has risen slowly but steadily from 9.3 per cent in 1989. The combination of external strength with low growth and high unemployment has raised political demands 'to spend the current account surplus' - that is, to relax fiscal policy in order to strengthen domestic demand and bring down unemployment. This issue will be an important one when the minority government sets out to navigate the 1993 budget through the Folketing this autumn (the final vote on the Finance Act takes place in mid-December). The government's economics ministers see the budget deficit as a threat to the long-term stability of the economy, a point of view which has not been weakened by the currency turbulence in neighbouring countries, where large budget deficits have constituted part of the problem. Mr Dyremose's 1993 draft budget strives to hold down expenditure, and includes cuts of DKr7.5bn just to prevent automatic increases in expenditure. The proposed cuts include DKr3.5bn off transfer expenditure (from the government to households) and a 4,000 reduction in civil service employment. Compared with the 1992 Finance Act estimates, central government revenue will rise in 1993 by 3.0 per cent to DKr306.5bn and expenditure by 4.3 per cent to DKr340.4bn. The budget deficit will be rise from an estimated DKr28bn when the Finance Act was passed to DKr34bn next year but the actual deficit for 1992 is now expected to be DKr38bn, so, if the budget sums conform with reality, the deficit will fall in 1993. It was already clear, before the Folketing assembled for the new parliamentary year on October 6, that there was majority support for a significantly looser budget than the government has proposed. The cuts in transfer expenditure and reduction in civil service employment do not appear to have sufficient support to be carried through. The opposition Social Democratic party (SDP) has presented a policy programme which, it claims, would create 170,000 jobs by the end of the decade. While the government predicts that, if current policies are maintained, the net foreign debt - DKr264bn at the end of 1991 - will be eliminated by the end of the decade, the SDP claims that its policies will leave the deficit at about DKr80bn Most of the jobs which the SDP will create will be in the public sector. It wants to increase the number of places for adult education and training by 60,000, to provide more jobs through labour market policies, to increase personnel in child-care services and care of the elderly, and to widen the opportunities for early retirement. It also wants a big increase in infra-structure investments, a point on which its wishes are not so far from the government's. It is quite possible that the budget negotiations will break down, resulting in an election. But assuming that the negotiations are successful and a compromise is found, it is certain that the budget will be looser than originally proposed. This is not a prospect which appeals to the National Bank, as Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the governor, has made plain. Denmark ran up a large foreign debt as a result of 26 consecutive years with deficits on the current balance of payments account, between 1963 and 1989. And it entered the 1980s with an enormous budget deficit, peaking at about 11 per cent of GDP in 1982-83. Bringing the two deficits under control has been a painful process. It is easier to loosen fiscal policy than it is to tighten it again, and experience in the past with temporary easing of fiscal policy has always been bad, said Mr Hoffmeyer earlier in the autumn, when proposals for spending the current account surplus first surfaced. 'Now that we have achieved a stable economy for the first time in decades, let's not gamble it away again,' he said.</p>

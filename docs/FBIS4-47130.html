			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Delyagin, economist: "The Banking System </F> of Russia: The Commanding Heights Have Been Secured"]    [Text] For more than a year now information analysis  agencies have been publishing lists of the 100 largest banks of  Russia, grouping them according to various indicators. Slowness  in the processing of the information has resulted in the fact  that the data as of 1 January 1994 (with the final turnovers,  which is fundamentally important) have become known only  recently. Analysis of the state of affairs of the banks of the  "first 100" and of the "first 20" has allowed economist MIKHAIL  DELYAGIN to draw a number of interesting conclusions: about the  reduction of the concentration of assets in the largest banks  (which means a growth of competition in the banking sector),  about the continuing rise of Moscow as a financial center and  about the rearrangements in the upper echelons of the banking  community, the esence of which is in the relative weakening of  the "whales" among the former specialized banks and the rise of  young "tigers" based on trading and financial-industrial  groups.    The first thing that needs to be noted is that all the  ratings of commercial banks being published, regardless of the  procedures being used, are rather arbitrary. Moreover, because  of the unwillingness of a number of large banks to submit  information about themselves all ratings are incomplete. One can  somewhat reduce the indeterminacy that occurs in the process, in  our opinion, by examining only the very top of the banking  "pyramid"--the very large general-purpose banks which already  have gained considerable weight. According to the latest data,  the dividing line of this "top" can, again with a certain amount  of arbitrariness, be drawn under the first 20 banks, the assets  of which have exceeded the half a trillion ruble boundary. The  probability that any of them suddenly "will sink into  insignificantness" is small: these banks are already able to not  fear either a private nor a state criminal racket. That is why  it makes good sense to consider the situation of the first 100  and first 20 banks in parallel.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The Share of the Assets of the 20 Largest Banks in the Aggregate Assets o-|  |f the Banks of Russia                                                     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Position      |Name          |Share in the Assets of Russia's Banking Sys-|  |              |              |tem ()                                     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |              |1 Jan 93      |1 Jul 93      |1 Jan 94      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

The positions they occupied based on this i-|  |ndicator on 1 January and 1 July 1993 are indicated in the brackets. Sour-|  |ces: VESTNIK TsB RF za 1993-1994 gg (The Bulletin of the Central Bank of  |  |the Russian Federation for 1993-1994), the Reyting Information Center, an-|  |d the Bank Information Center.                                            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Thus, the first thing that strikes one's eye is the  reduction  in the concentration of bank assets, an important indicator  which is evidence of the scale of a commercial bank's  operations. In practice this signifies a certain levelling-out  of the forces of the commercial banks and the strengthening of  competition. Thus, if on 1 January the 100 largest banks of  Russia (not counting the largest bank--Vneshtorgbank RF [Russian  Federation Foreign Trade Bank]) represented 5.8 percent of their  total number and had 60.6 percent of the banking system's  assets, then on 1 July the indicators mentioned came to 5.4  percent and 71 percent respectively, and on 1 January 1994--4.95  percent and about 56 percent (in the last two cases--already  taking the Russian Federation Foreign Trade Bank into account).    The tendency towards a decline in the level of concentration  of bank assets for the first 20 banks is even more noticeable:  as of 1 January 1993 their number and assets came to 1.2 and  40.3 percent of the total amount respectively (not counting the  Foreign Trade Bank), as of July--1.1 and 63 percent, and as of 1  January 1994--1.0 and 38 percent.    However, as the quantitative concentration has decreased, a  regional concentration is occurring, primarily around Moscow.  Some 38 Moscow banks were among the first 100 as of 1 January  1993, including 13 in the first 20. As of 1 July the "Moscow  presence" had increased to 39 and 16 respectively. As of 1  January 1994 Moscow banks represented almost half of Russia's  largest banks (47) and completely made up "the upper 20" by  themselves. There are no financial centers in Russia comparable  to Moscow. The greatest number of banks that have been part of  the "upper 100" from other cities--three each--are registered in  Saint Petersburg, Ufa, Chelyabinsk and Krasnodar. Ufa should be  especially noted. Based on certain characteristics Bashkortostan  is becoming one of the most dynamic and attractive centers of  Russia. It is altogether not without reason that the Union of  Swiss Banks has chosen precisely it for the setting-up and  practical realization of a clearing system of mutual settlements  based on the most up-to-date technologies.    The table cited briefly illustrates the recent past of these  banks. The Rossiyskiy kredit bank, which has climbed from 63rd  to eighth place in the bank table of rank during the year, has  achieved the most rapid take-off. Its leadership realized almost  before all the rest the strategic advantages of a large charter  fund and concentrated its efforts on increasing the latter even  prior to the introduction of the open currency position, when  this was at variance with its current business interests.  Most-bank, which jumped from 77th place to 19th in six months,  is close to repeating Rossiyskiy kredit's "record." This bank's  success is to be explained in many respects by its support by a  powerful financial-industrial group.    By and large precisely the banks created by large  financial-industrial or trading structures were the most dynamic  in 1993. Apart from Most-bank their number includes Alfa-bank,  which has stepped right away from beyond the limits of the first  100 to 26th place, Neftekhimbank, Avtobank, and, certainly,  Natsionalnyy kredit bank.    The undoubted success of Sberbank (Savings Bank) should also  be noted. The share of the population's deposits in Sberbank has  dropped by a third during the past year--from 90 to 60 percent  of their total volume--but the bank has been able not only to  compensate for the losses incurred but also to strengthen its  position--apparently through the activization of directions of  activity that are not traditional for it, primarily the  expansion of currency operations and operations on the  inter-bank loans market.    Such large and well-known banks as Inkombank and MENATEP are  moving steadily upwards. However, reputation bears fruit only in  combination with aggressive marketing. Otherwise, the fate of  recent leaders, which are slowly but steadily being pushed  aside, would have befallen these banks. The latter include  Agroprombank, Mosbiznesbank, TOKObank, Moskovskiy industrialnyy  bank (MIB), Kredobank and Unikombank, not to mention those which  have vacated the "top 20," among which Elektrobank, which has  slipped from 11th place to 23rd in 1993, as well as Agroprombank  from Rostov-on-Don and Chelindbank, especially stood out. At the  same time it is for now too early to say that the trend towards  the relative weakening of the former specialized banks being  observed in the "first 20" is also true for the Russian  provinces.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed X.H.: "Economy Is Creating More Jobs Than </F> It Is Losing"]    [Text] The French economy created 25,700 salaried jobs in  the first quarter of 1994. Of course, we are still a long way  away from the 191,000 jobs created in the United States in the  month of April alone. This is the first increase in three  years. In the first three months of the year, salaried  employment increased by 0.2 percent according to the final  figures released by the Ministry of Labor. Not only is France  creating more jobs than it is losing -- for the first time since  1990 -- but the final statistics have proven to be better than  the provisional figures released in mid-May. Some 5,000 extra  jobs have been listed since then. Moreover, UNEDIC [National  Union for Employment in Industry and Commerce] is soon expected  to downwardly revise the number of extra job-seekers expected in  1994.    The tertiary sector, which since mid-May has been playing  its  role as a locomotive only very modestly, "is once again clearly  becoming a creator of jobs," thanks to trade (up 1.3 percent for  the nonfood retail trade) and service (up 2.4 percent for  services to businesses). On the other hand, the manufacturing  industry is continuing to lose jobs (down 0.6 percent), but at a  more moderate pace than the preceding quarter (down 0.8 percent).  <H5>  Toward 1 Million Welfare Recipients By The End Of 1994 </H5>   The number of unemployed people being compensated by UNEDIC  should not be as high as forecast in 1994, which could encourage  the implementation of an "active" policy by the unemployment  insurance system to benefit employment, with the support of  certain employees' unions. Whereas in March UNEDIC expected  that it would have to compensate 210,000 extra unemployed people  this year, this figure should end up being around 100,000. This  slower rise should be reflected in a financial surplus in the  unemployment insurance system that exceeds the two billion  francs forecast for this year.    The size of the "outgoings" as noted in UNEDIC registers can  be explained by the fact that the "groups of unemployed people  who entered the unemployment insurance system in 1991-1992 used  up their rights to enter the solidarity insurance system five or  six months ago," an expert explained. This upsurge in those  leaving the system should not conceal the fact that the number  of long-term unemployed rose 23 percent in one year and that the  average duration of unemployment has now reached 279 days.    Out of the 50,000 people who leave the unemployment  insurance  system every month, a little less than one-third join the  solidarity insurance program financed by the state and another  third or so find a job. The last third comes knocking on the  door of the welfare office, a trend which has been rising. At  the end of 1993, the Ministry of Social Affairs counted around  800,000 welfare recipients (up 18.1 percent in one year). At  the current rate, they will number nearly one million by the end  of the year.</p>

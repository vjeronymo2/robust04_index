			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Scandinavian banks set to securitise mortgages SEVERAL Scandinavian banks are preparing to securitise their mortgage portfolios, allowing them to ease some of the financial pressure they are under and to raise fresh funds. Scandinavian banks have been hit by losses in the property and commercial loans sector as a result of severe recession and poor credit analysis, and their credit ratings have suffered as a result. Postipankki, the Finnish bank, is planning a Dollars 500m issue of mortgage-backed securities, arranged by Merrill Lynch. The offering will be filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing the deal to be placed in the US domestic market, where the well-developed mortgage-backed market can offer finer pricing than in Europe. The deal will either be structured as a US offering or as a global offering. The deal will be made up of at least five tranches, the largest with a maturity of only one year, aimed at US money market funds. In addition, Union Bank of Finland has mandated Morgan Stanley to arrange a mortgage-backed issue later in the year. Spintab, the Swedish mortgage institution, is also said to be planning a mortgage-backed issue via Nomura. Dealers said that conditions were ripe for a wave of securitisation by Scandinavian banks. However, the logistical problems involved in setting up such deals means that a sudden rush of deals is unlikely.</p>

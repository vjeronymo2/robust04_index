			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK poultry industry 'at disadvantage' More stringent application of European Union rules in the British poultry industry is costing companies around Pounds 60m more than their competitors in other member states, according to the National Farmers' Union. Mr Norman Brook, NFU poultry chairman, told a House of Commons select committee that he believed the UK industry's costs were Pounds 30.4m higher than those of French companies. In addition, he estimated that tighter salmonella rules added 4p a dozen to the cost of producing eggs in the UK. UK poultry producers were operating on very low margins, which gave them little ability to invest in new equipment in line with tighter regulations on animal health, according to Mr John Maunder, managing director of Lloyd Maunder, poultry producers. 'I believe we lead Europe in animal welfare regulations. The industry is making a massive investment by January 1995 in new equipment,' he told the committee. The industry must bring its equipment up to meet standards set in the EU's Battery Cage directive which Mr Maunder estimated would cost about Pounds 10 a bird. Poultry industry representatives told the committee that a settlement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would put further pressure on producers with an expected large increase in imports to the EU. In addition, restrictions on export subsidies that would accompany a Gatt agreement could see French producers finding it harder to export outside the EU and diverting shipments to the UK. Separately, the British Egg Industry council told the committee that annual egg consumption in the UK had dropped from 225 a person to 177 over the past 5 years. Free-range eggs' market share had risen to 15 per cent over the same period, and was expected to grow to 20 per cent by the end of the decade.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sharp downturn at Hornby SQUEEZED margins and a swing from interest receivable to payable lay behind the sharply reduced pre-tax profits at Hornby Group, the USM-quoted toy, hobby and sports boat manufacturer, in the six months to June 30. Profits fell to Pounds 158,000 (Pounds 541,000) pre-tax on increased turnover of Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 10.3m). Mr Alan Cox, finance director, explained that the interest turnround from Pounds 65,000 credit to Pounds 58,000 charge derived partly from lower interest rates in the first quarter when Hornby has cash on deposit, but also from higher seasonal borrowings caused by the investment in Cassy, the new doll concept, and retailers, fearful of overstocking, ordering later. The November acquisition for Pounds 400,000 of the Dell Quay boat range helped Fletcher, the boat-making side accounting for 10 per cent of Hornby turnover, sell more units. In its well known branded toys, Mr Cox said that Hornby Railways and Scalextric, the racing car game, had been selling steadily and well. 'Brands can sell throughout the year, not just at Christmas.' Earnings fell by 3p to 1.2p per share. Again there is no interim dividend, because of the seasonality of the business.</p>

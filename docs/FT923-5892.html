			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Zofran hint for Glaxo DISCLOSURE that US officials are to discuss improved prospects for Glaxo's Zofran drug filtered through too late to have much effect on the shares in London yesterday. Nevertheless, the stock closed firmer, with US house Wertheim Schroder preparing an enthusiastic internal note. Mr Jonathan Gelles, Wertheim's pharmaceuticals specialist, will point out that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approves drug use in the US, will discuss increased use of Zofran, Glaxo's anti-emetic drug. The FDA confirmed that its advisory committee will meet next Thursday to discuss the use of the drug for post-operative nausea and vomiting. Mr Gelles said Zofran was expected to generate around Pounds 260m (Dollars 517.4m) this year and approval for extended US use could add a further Pounds 100m. Glaxo ended 2 firmer at 691p. WH Smith pleases Solid final results from WH Smith sent the shares forward 15 to 376p. A lower tax charge was the only real surprise, as news that the core retail businesses were holding up well and the DIY division was continuing to struggle were as expected. Ms Kimlan Cook at County NatWest commented: 'The chunky dividend and modest premium to the market mean the shares represent good value in the short term. But we remain neutral past then, mainly because of the uncertainties posed by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiries into newspaper wholesaling and compact discs, and the concern over the net book agreement.' Mr Nick Hawkins at Kleinwort Benson was more positive, arguing that the stock's defensive qualities and recovery potential represented good value at both levels. Wellcome hurt Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome fell ahead of publication of an article in a highly regarded US trade publication. The New England Journal of Medicine, out today, contains a 10-page article on the group's Aids drug, Retrovir. The article describes a trial by an independent US group which concludes that 'changing treatment from zidovudine (the generic name for Retrovir) to 500mg per day of didanosine (the generic name for the drug marketed by US competitor Bristol Myers Squibb) appears to slow the progression of HIV disease'. Nevertheless, analysts said the trial results had already been aired at the Amsterdam Aids conference last month and that Retrovir was likely to remain the main anti-Aids drug. The stock declined 15 before ending 10 off at 782p. Reuters firm An improved recommendation for Reuters helped the news and financial information service group to recover some recently lost ground. The shares were among the best performers in the FT-SE 100 Index and gained 13 to 1025p. Barclays de Zoete Wedd put the company back on its buy list after having a hold stance on the stock from March. Analyst Mr Paul Norris says the group's electronic trading system, Dealing 2002, is showing a pick-up following a slow start in June. He adds that Reuters will benefit from a 40 per cent exposure to the D-Mark against only a 20 per cent exposure to the dollar. Already weakened by worries about UK interest rates, the building sectors came under even more pressure as County NatWest published a bearish research note adopting a short-term sell stance on every contracting and building materials stock covered by the firm. Official figures showing a 19 per cent slump in construction orders in the June quarter added to the gloom. Emphasising that its use of the term 'sell' meant that it viewed the relevant share prices as likely to underperform the market by more than 10 per cent in the next three months, County's building team said it anticipated that at least 18 of the 31 companies covered will cut dividends. County said a rise in interest rates would 'push the housing market over the brink and turn catastrophe into disaster'. Redland, already depressed by a prediction from stockbroker Panmure Gordon of a 20 per cent reduction in annual dividend, dropped 20 more to 354p. Housebuilder Persimmon fell 8 to 181p. Interim figures from Guardian Royal Exchange were well received by the market and the shares ran up to 132p before slipping back to close fractionally ahead at 127p. Renewed institutional support and suggestions that sentiment towards composite insurers may be changing lifted Sun Alliance 1 1/2 to 219p. Sedgwick put on 7 to 108p and Willis Corroon 2 to 146p on hopes that US rates may rise sharply following Hurricane Andrew. Oil shares mostly continued to hold up well, although Lasmo attracted selling pressure and finished 5 cheaper at 129p on keen turnover of 3.2m shares. Specialists said there were no new stories behind the latest fall and that a technical bounce was now due. BP drew strength from news that US investors have increased their holdings of the stock by some 100m shares to 14.2 per cent since the halving of the dividend on August 6. County NatWest said US investors had carried on buying BP because the shares look cheap on a valuation basis compared to US stocks. Good two-way business in Ladbroke was attributed to the group's results due next week where the dividend is considered safe. The shares closed 3 off at 130p in turnover of 8.4m. Bullish noises from Marks and Spencer were said to have helped the shares, which climbed 6 to 287p. The company is said to have been indicating to analysts that interim profits are likely to be better than expected. Tightly traded publisher News International jumped 23 to 448p as the group announced a full-year profit of Pounds 48.1m, against a loss last year of Pounds 335.8m. British Steel was heavily traded again as a block of 8.1m shares dealt at 43p boosted turnover to 17m. The block was the second half of a tax-related 'bed-and-breakfast' deal. Steel eased  1/2 to 48 1/2 p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (3). WATER (2) Anglian, Yorks. NEW LOWS (247).

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EPA MISSES DEADLINE FOR SEWAGE RULING  </P> <P> The federal Environmental Protection Agency missed a congressional deadline  last week for a decision on whether to require more intensive treatment of  sewage being pumped into the ocean off the Palos Verdes Peninsula at a rate of  380 million gallons a day.  </P> <P> Under an amendment to an appropriations bill signed into law last month,  Congress told the EPA to decide by Nov. 30 whether to exempt the giant Los  Angeles County Sanitation Districts sewage plant in Carson from tighter  treatment standards.  </P> <P> The measure was enacted at the request of U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa  Monica), who says a federal ruling on the exemption is long overdue. But the  EPA never promised to meet the deadline, telling The Times last month that it  was considering the sanitation districts' request for a waiver "as  expeditiously as we can."  </P> <P> The sanitation districts, which expressed fear last month that the time limit  would hurt its chances to receive a fair hearing, welcomed news that the EPA  had not produced a ruling by Friday.  </P> <P> "We don't think science responds particularly well to deadlines," sanitation  districts spokesman Joe Haworth said Saturday. "We're grateful that at least  they're taking their time to make a decision."  </P></p>

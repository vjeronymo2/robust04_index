			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses buoyant after Friday's recovery in Dow Bourses were buoyant on Friday's late recovery on Wall Street, but there was an underlying note of caution ahead of US economic figures this week, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT, relatively firm last Friday afternoon, positively took off yesterday with the Dax index 41.68, or 2 per cent higher at 2,145.17 on the session, and another 1.1 per cent better in the post bourse at an Ibis-based 2,169.40. Financials returned to favour, Deutsche Bank topping a session rise of DM12.50 to DM803.50 with a further DM11 to DM814.50 after hours. Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that the turn in US bond yields, the low dollar and a firm domestic bond market - reflecting hopes of a further interest rate cut this Thursday - had produced a scenario in which Deutsche, particularly, could be expected to make money. Foreigners were buying the big blue chips again, said Mr Greven. Turnover rose from DM8.2bn to DM8.5bn and Volkswagen, a blue chip in favour, rose DM13.70 to DM485.50 in the morning, and another DM7 to DM492.50 in the afternoon. Analysts were impressed initially with Schering's 21 per cent sales growth in the first two months of 1994, but a more cautious tone came into the market late in the afternoon and the shares closed with their session gain of DM16 to DM1,036. PARIS ended the day broadly higher in line with other European markets and the positive tone from Frankfurt in particular. The CAC-40 index finished up 40.11 or 1.8 per cent at 2,215.02. The day's main excitement was Euro Disney, which initially advanced some 8 per cent on news that the financial restructuring package had been agreed, before falling back by almost the same amount as investors realised that the rights issue would be extremely dilutive. The shares finished down FFr2.90 at FFr33.85. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe explained that 600m new shares would be issued at FFr10 each, swelling the number in issue from 170m to 770m. The package, he said, was good news for Euro Disney, which had got its restructuring package through, and thereby would be able to half its debt to some FFr10bn, but was bad news for the minority shareholders. AMSTERDAM recouped Friday's losses, the AEX index ending 5.97 or 1.4 per cent higher at 423.90. KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, picked up Fl 1.70 to Fl 50.10 after reporting over the weekend that it was to declare a 45 cent dividend, and giving a bullish outlook on prospects for 1994. Ahold and Elsevier, which are due to publish 1993 results on Thursday improved respectively by 70 cents and Fl 2.90 to Fl 49.40 and Fl 178.90. Hoare Govett liked both, and commented that Ahold should be one of the major beneficiaries of strength in the dollar. MILAN finished higher but off its best, helped by strong telecoms and by short-covering ahead of tomorrow's end of the monthly account. The Comit index added 8.52 or 1.3 per cent to 673.78. Telecoms were supported by weekend comments from Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, confirming the privatisation timetable. Sip rose L70 or 1.5 per cent to L4,604 and Stet added L110 or 2.2 per cent to L5,016. Cogefar rose L135 or 4.1 per cent to L3,435, as interest was spurred by the launch of its rights issue on Thursday and the planned merger with other building companies into Italy's largest construction group. Domestic and foreign demand took Mediobanca L685 or 4.5 per cent higher to L15,871, but analysts said there was no news to account for the rise. BCI, whose privatised shares will be traded from Thursday, added L100 or 1.6 percent to L6,212. ZURICH advanced 1.4 per cent, taking its lead from strong bond and equity markets elsewhere in Europe, but the low level of business indicated that investors remained cautious. The SMI index rose 38.9 to 2,870.5. Cyclical stocks remained at the centre of attention. Foreign demand and a positive recommendation from a local bank took Oerlikon-Buhrle SFr15 higher to SFr169. Brown Boveri bearers continued higher, adding SFr33 to SFr1,212 and Sulzer certificates rose SFr45 to SFr1,060. Banks picked up some of their recent losses. Credit Suisse bearers rose SFr18 to SFr634. MADRID offered good rises in US quoted stocks and, inter alia, in Banesto and in Acerinox, the stainless steel company in which Banesto had a 34.5 per cent stake until some five months ago. The general index rose 5.52, or 1.7 per cent to 338.88 in tunover of Pta27.2bn. Of the ADR stocks, Repsol rose Pta145 to Pta 4,730 and Telefonica by Pta45 to Pta1,950. Banesto rose Pta33, or 4.5 per cent to Pta768 as Santander converted loans into 2.1 per cent of the equity; Acerinox recovered another Pta260 to Pta12,500 after dipping to Pta10,800 nearly two weeks ago, but dealers were cautious after a rise from around Pta9,000 last September.

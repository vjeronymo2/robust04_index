			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Samsung agrees to cut stake in Kia Motors THE SAMSUNG group yesterday agreed to reduce its shareholding in Kia Motors, ending its possible attempt to take over South Korea's second largest vehicle manufacturer. The decision by Samsung, one of the country's leading conglomerates, was taken after Kia vowed to resist any takeover bid and state officials warned that the government might intervene in support of Kia. Samsung recently became Kia's second largest shareholder with a 9.6 per cent interest after purchasing large blocks of stock on the Seoul bourse during the summer. Analysts believe that Samsung was setting the stage for a hostile takeover attempt next year when government restrictions on mergers and acquisitions will be eased. The retreat by Samsung is considered a setback to its plans to become a passenger car manufacturer. Samsung already owns Korea's leading electronics company and operates in other industries ranging from shipbuilding to construction. 'A takeover of Kia would have provided a shortcut for Samsung to fulfil its ambition of entering the auto industry and becoming a major producer,' said Mr Don Lee, a motor industry analyst for BZW in Seoul. Analysts saw several advantages for Samsung in the deal. A takeover would have meant that Samsung would immediately acquire production facilities instead of spending several years and billions of dollars building them on its own. In addition, it would solve Samsung's apparent difficulty in finding a foreign partner that could provide technology. Samsung is believed to have held fruitless talks with BMW of Germany and several Japanese carmakers on possible co-operation. 'The combination of Kia's production resources with Samsung's financial and research strengths could have transformed Kia into a formidable competitor against Hyundai,' Korea's leading car manufacturer, said Mr Lee. Kia was considered vulnerable to a possible takeover since heavy investments have put pressure on its finances and reduced earnings since 1990. It reported net profits of Won15bn (Dollars 18.5m) in 1992 and won5.2bn for the first half of 1993.</p>

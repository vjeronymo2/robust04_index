			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Russia 'at start of the road to reform' MR Yegor Gaidar, the former Prime Minister of Russia, said yesterday he was 'not too pessimistic about the future' and that Russia was 'at the start of a long road to reforms.' Speaking at the Institute for the Problems of the Transitional Period, of which he has become director, he confirmed in an interview with the Financial Times he has asked his ministers to stay in Mr Chernomyrdin's team, 'as long as they are certain they can continue with reforms. I think they should be there some months. There are dangers of hyperinflation, and of some efforts to change the course of privatisation. But I think the main lines have been set down and they will continue.' Asked why President Boris Yeltsin had not continued to back him as premier after the Congress of People's Deputies vote on Monday, Mr Gaidar thought, burst out laughing and said: 'I don't know. I think it was the terrible pressure from the Congress. You can only take so much of it.' Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, said that 'understanding my responsibilities for continuing the privatisation programme, I am prepared to continue', echoing other leading cabinet members. He warned that 'the central question is to avoid hyperinflation', and proposed that a 'top expert' like Mr Boris Feodorov, at present Russia's representative at the World Bank, should join the government as an inflation-fighter. The struggle over Mr Yeltsin's most solid achievement from the Congress, the agreement to hold a referendum on April 11 on a new constitution, is already under way. A draft of the outline of the constitution on which the Russian people will be asked to vote is in circulation, and shows that if Mr Yeltsin wins assent, the Russian parliament will be reduced to a single-tier body rather than the division between the twice-annual Congress and permanent Supreme Soviet as now. This would entail immediate new elections after the referendum, timed for April 11. The draft also makes federal law explicitly superior to that of the autonomous republics. The new Supreme Soviet would be the 'single representative and legislative organ of the Russian federation,' retaining its bicameral system of Chambers of the Republic and of Nationalities. The President would be 'head of state and the highest executive in Russia, leader of the executive and representative of the Federation in internal and external relations'. The new Supreme Soviet would have the right to legislate and have right of veto over the prime minister and the foreign defence, interior and security ministers, but loses its pre-eminence over the president and has few rights in economic policy. The right to private property is in the constitution, as is the proposal that 'economic relations are constructed on the basis of social partnership between the individual and the state, the workers and management, producers and consumers'. The state will 'regulate economic life in the interests of the individual and society'. Yeltsin to China, Page 4; Bank deal on trade, Page 5</p>

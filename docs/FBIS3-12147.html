This massacre resulted in the deaths of  dozens of people and the wounding of hundreds.    In a statement today to SPA, a responsible source expressed  his condemnation and censure of this regrettable event, which  bore the marks of extremism, fanaticism, and lack of respect for  human rights on the part of the Israelis.    The source laid responsibility for this massacre on the  Israeli Government because of its disregard for the crimes  committed by Israeli settlers against unarmed Palestinians. He  called on the international community to face up to its  responsibility of providing protection for the Palestinians, who  are suffering under the Israeli occupation, and of stopping  these serious crimes and massacres against them.    In conclusion the statement indicates that this abominable  crime might have a negative effect on the peace process in the  Middle East.</p>

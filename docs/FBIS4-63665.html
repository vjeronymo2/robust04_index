			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA observer, commentary under </F> the general heading: "Crimea: Up Along a Conflict Spiral.  Will Politicians Stop at the Line of Danger?"]    [Text] Reports about troops being deployed and moved up...  Attempts to seize and to resubordinate power agencies and  government authorities... Finally, menacing statements and  their refutations, a growing snowball of mutual accusations.  Later, when the irremediable happens, they will all claim that  no one wanted bloodshed and all struggled for sovereignty...    The situation that is coming about in Crimea appears very  complex. I would like to believe that the worst forecasts will  not come true, that the latest contacts between the Russian and  Ukrainian presidents will help ease the tension. However,  anyone who can recall how conflicts flared up in various  independent state states on the territory of the former USSR  cannot but be alerted by the degree to which the situation in  Crimea is reminiscent of what preceded bloody and lengthy wars  in Karabakh, Abkhazia, and the Dniester Region.    This is a perfectly familiar scenario. It is beginning to  unfold each time the legislatures of various autonomous entities  decide to stop obeying the center's commands. As a rule, this  happens against the backdrop of overall political instability in  the state as a whole. And each time it plays into the hands of  a politician who defends his power in a fierce struggle. He  sends troops and special-purpose units, starts threatening the  "separatists" with force.    All this ends similarly -- in blood. One cannot but ask:  Are all those who call themselves leaders really so out if it  that they are unable to make balanced, reasonable decisions (as  a matter of fact, there is one precedent, albeit a unique one,  where Moscow was wise enough not to forcibly impose its  authority on Chechnya)?    I think that the reason lies elsewhere: They simply think  that they can always fall back, stop at the line of danger after  upping the ante as much as possible and hitting the jackpot.  One always has the feeling that those who tried to take a  similar gamble in Abkhazia, Karabakh, and the Dniester Region  were simply not slick or lucky enough to succeed. And this is  the main mistake. The thing is that politicians are not  starting a boxing match that can be stopped any minute. They  set in motion large masses of armed people whose nerves are  strained to the limit. And they simply fail some people. A  minor bureaucrat, misunderstanding a command, wholeheartedly  rushes to carry it out; an armored personnel carrier or simply  an office car might run over a casual passer-by, or a live  cartridge might be carelessly put in the chamber of someone's  automatic rifle.    Such accidents have long become a rule in "hot spots."  Whenever they occur, conflicts begin to escalate by themselves,  an escalation that cannot be stopped by anyone. Moreover, if a  conflict flares up in Crimea, all we have seen earlier will pale  in scale alongside it. The reason is that the Black Sea Fleet,  which has never been split, will undoubtedly be drawn into it.    This threshold has not been crossed yet. We ought to do our  utmost to prevent this from happening.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Observer: Pilots facing turbulence Will Rupert Murdoch - when the time comes for him to step down from News Corp - hand over the reins as gracefully as has his old chum Sir Peter Abeles at TNT, the company he's dominated for the past 25 years? Sir Peter, a penniless refugee from wartime Hungary who started with one truck in 1950 and ended up running a ADollars 6bn transport empire with 52,000 workers, is not bowing out completely. He will remain a deputy chairman, but will be spending most of his time trying to sort out Ansett, the troubled airline jointly-owned by TNT and News Corp. Like Murdoch, Sir Peter is an impulsive entrepreneur whose company outgrew Australia. He also borrowed too much and has had to retrench. However, he differs from Murdoch in that he doesn't own a large chunk of his own equity and he has always had a reasonably strong chairman - Fred Millar - to keep him in check. Sir Peter's departure kills two birds with one stone. It enables TNT to introduce a more disciplined management style and means that Sir Peter will be able to devote 100 per cent of his time to Ansett, perhaps the biggest problem facing TNT and News Corporation. Although News Corporation has been strengthening its board of non-executive directors, Rupert Murdoch is chairman and chief executive. So who will tell him when it's time to go?</p>

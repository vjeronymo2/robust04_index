He had taken part in a meeting between  President Kravchuk and several members of Ukraine's parliament  representing Crimea Monday evening.    According to Sevastyanov, "at the meeting Kravchuk pointed  to  the unwillingness of Russia and the U.S. to revise borders or  recognize the Crimean Republic after their statement signed in  Moscow."    Kravchuk also stressed that he himself has nothing against  the candidates for the Crimean presidency, Sevastyanov noted.    According to Sevastyanov, Kravchuk said that "the Ukrainian  army will remain outside politics, and, should the situation  destabilize, the existing structures of law-enforcement agencies  will have to be used." Kravchuk made it clear that Crimea can  use additional law-enforcement forces, "if it is in a position  to keep them."    At his meeting with the deputies from Crimea, President  Kravchuk also said that neither the Ukrainian parliament nor he  himself will interfere in the process of establishing an open  economy in Crimea. According to the Ukrainian president, the  efforts to achieve economic stabilization in Crimea will now  depend solely on the measures the Crimean leadership will take.    Kiev will support all Simferopol's initiatives, if they do  not conflict with Ukraine's legislation, Kravchuk told the  deputies from Crimea.    In the first round of presidential elections in Crimea, the  greatest number of votes was collected by the pro-Russian  candidate, Yuriy Meshkov. In the second round, the present  Speaker of the Crimean parliament, Nikolay Bahrov, will be his  rival.</p>

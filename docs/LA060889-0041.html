			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATION COOKING CLASSES POPULAR IN PARIS  </P> <P> The soaring price of a fine dinner in Paris is giving tourists second thoughts  about plunging into a restaurant that boasts one or more Michelin stars. But  there is an affordable way to sample top-level cuisine in Paris: Take a cooking  class.  </P> <P> Three top Parisian cooking schools offer demonstration classes in English with  tastings of the results, printed recipes to take home and the chance to watch a  professional chef in action.  </P> <P> La Varenne, Le Cordon Bleu and the newest school, the Ecole de Gastronomie  Francaise Ritz-Escoffier, all have such one-session demonstration classes for  about $35.  </P> <P> "It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon," said one student from California  who attended the Ritz school. "It gives you as much a feeling of Paris as going  to the Eiffel Tower."  </P> <P> </P> <P> School Opened Last Year  </P> <P> Gregory Usher, director of the new Ritz Hotel school, headed La Varenne school  for several years and directed the Paris Cordon Bleu until he was asked to open  and head the Ritz school last year.  </P> <P> An American, Usher has lived in Paris since 1970, cooking in four Paris  restaurants, teaching, consulting and helping to write a Cordon Bleu cookbook.  He came to Paris during his junior year of college to study art history and was  won over to French food.  </P> <P> "I knew at once this was the place for me," he said. "During my first year in  Paris I ate at 85 different restaurants, and I've continued to seek out fine  cooking wherever I go."  </P> <P> Students in longer-term classes at the Ritz school come to Paris from all over  the world. The average student is in her early 30s (two-thirds are women) and  has done a "fair amount of cooking," Usher says. About a third are Japanese, a  fifth are American, and the rest are mostly European, though there are many  Latin-Americans and a few Australians.  </P> <P> "Some want to further their professional expertise. Some want the polish and  finesse that a school like the Ritz can give them," Usher says. "The important  thing for all the students is to be in France, which will always be the  important place for food."  </P> <P> What is different about the new school?  </P> <P> "First of all, it is the Ritz itself and the atmosphere of one of the finest  hotels in the world," Usher says. "And next, there are all the special  facilities that are part of the hotel." Usher says the school is the first  private, non-residential institution to offer a complete program in French  gastronomy, from bread-baking and pastry making to table service and floral  decorations. (There are some things the Ritz will not teach, however: "We don't  do ice sculpture," says Usher. "It has nothing to do with food.")  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Than a Kitchen  </P> <P> The classroom is more than a teaching kitchen: It is the hotel's two-star  restaurant. "Students have access to the same cooks, bakers and wine stewards  that serve the guests of the hotel," Usher says. The food for students is  served on the hotel's china, using the Ritz silver service and linens.  Ingredients used in the classes are provided by the same sources that supply  the hotel. French, naturally, is the first language of the classrooms.  </P> <P> Individuals who want to observe a professional chef at work or watch the  preparation of a special dish may attend one of the three-hour demonstration  classes.  </P> <P> For more serious students, the school offers one- to 12-week courses in cooking  theory, baking, wine, bread and cheese. There's an eight-week course in pastry,  chocolate, ice cream and holiday cakes.  </P> <P> Advanced cooking and pastry is featured in the 12-week Ritz-Escoffier diploma  course. Students here are offered internships in the hotel kitchen upon  completion of the course.  </P> <P> Courses are flexible, and classes are geared to many interest levels, Usher  says. All are non-residential. Cooking courses in other languages, such as  Japanese or Spanish, can be arranged.  </P> <P> The school's three-week Ritz Entertaining Course includes classes in cooking  and pastry-making, menu planning, wine selection and floral arranging. The fee  is about $750.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Learning From Mistakes  </P> <P> The students (no more than 12 per class) do all the cooking, "but Christian  watches them like a hawk," says Usher. "They don't learn by mistakes; they  learn by tasting things that have been correctly done." Christian is Christian  Guillut, chef of the Ecole, who was apprenticed 20 years ago as a teen-ager at  the restaurant Barrier in Tours when it had three Michelin stars. He has worked  in starred establishments ever since.  </P> <P> "Our philosophy is contemporary. Our program is a living program. There are no  museum pieces here," says Usher. When he was at another Paris cooking school,  "they were doing set pieces that have completely disappeared from the French  cooking repertoire -- those old-fashioned dishes with heavy sauces."  </P> <P> Usher garnishes the courses with visits to the shops of French bakers,  chocolate makers and cheese agers as well as to Rungis, the famous wholesale  food market serving Paris.  </P></p>

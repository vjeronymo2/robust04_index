			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Slawomir Popowski from Moscow: "Prime Minister </F> Pawlak's Proposals; `Partnership for Development' With Russia"]    [Text] During Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's visit to  Moscow, four agreements are supposed to be signed: on the  principles of employing Poles in Russia and Russians in Poland,  on the quarantine of plants, on early warning about nuclear  accidents, and on cooperation in the area of nuclear security,  as well as on cooperation in the antimonopoly policy.    The Polish party also insisted on signing a commercial  protocol for this year; however, it seems that these were all  futile efforts. Moscow does not want to agree to the settlement  mechanism proposed by Pawlak, which links Poland's purchases of  strategic raw materials to the imports of our goods.    In this situation, Warsaw's initiative is especially  noteworthy: It insists on specifying a catalogue of the issues  that have not been settled yet and of problems that impede the  development of economic cooperation. Similar protocols of  dissimilarities have already been drawn up more than once. This  time, however, the approximate date of their settlement should  be fixed, and people responsible for that should be selected.  Some people believe that this is the main goal of Prime  Minister Pawlak's journey to Moscow. As one of the high-ranking  Polish diplomats put it, if this is pulled off, we will be able  to consider the entire visit a success.    It is worth adding that Polish-Russian economic relations  are  now in a deep crisis, which to a considerable degree is also  related to the noticeable chilling of the political climate.  For a year and a half, if we do not take into account the talks  between both presidents, both states practically have not  maintained any contacts. Most of the problems that impede  cooperation and an exchange of goods and services have not even  been touched. As a consequence, the Polish-Russian trade  turnover again started to plummet more quickly. After a period  of relative stabilization in 1992 (at the level of 50 percent of  the turnover in 1990), the turnover in 1993 decreased by another  39 percent. The decrease in exports of agricultural-industrial  goods to the Russian market (by 62.5 percent) is especially seen  as very alarming.    The main reason for this state of affairs is said to be the  crisis of the Russian economy as well as drastic anti-import  measures taken by Moscow. This is true. On the other hand,  however, quite important is also the lack of any concrete  decisions concerning indebtedness (as a result of which many  Polish companies are simply afraid of conducting trade with  Russia), let alone the fact that there are no instruments in  place for supporting exports. There is even no bank that would  handle trade with the East.    By leaving for Moscow with his own concept of a "partnership  for development," Prime Minister Pawlak would like to unblock  the Polish-Russian economic relations and deal with, as he put  it, "the building of practical foundations of cooperation."  According to the Polish prime minister, all of the great ideas  have already been announced, and now it is high time for  practical activities aimed at implementing them. The prime  minister believes that it is possible to separate the economy  from politics.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   "Right now the problem is not that we should sign further  agreements because we have already signed many agreements,  treaties, and declarations with Russia: We should see to it that  our mutual relations are transferred to the level of activities,  especially economic activities," Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  said yesterday before leaving for Moscow. The prime minister  confirmed that, in Russia, he will discuss the "zero  option"--that is, the proposal that the debts of both sides be  annulled.    "During the meeting in Moscow, the problem of gas and oil  supplies from Russia will also be discussed," Industry and Trade  Minister Marek Pol said in the Polish Radio Third Program.    --by J.H.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: PCBs under attack Plant enzymes offer a new prospect for getting rid of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are some of the most pernicious pollutants made by man. Several million kilogrammes of PCBs have been released into the environment over the last few decades, through a wide range of industrial activities from solvent recovery to hydraulic fluid manufacturing. They are so toxic that land contaminated by them is unsuited for any other activity - even landfill. PCBs are chemically very stable organo-chlorine compounds. The conventional method of getting rid of them is high-temperature incineration, an expensive process (costing Pounds 2,000 per tonne of soil) which may itself give rise to toxic fumes. As a cheaper and safer alternative, scientists hope to exploit biotechnology to detoxify PCBs. A technique developed by Plant Science Limited (PSL), a company based at Sheffield University in the north of England, uses novel peroxidase enzymes derived from plant cell cultures. The effect of the enzymes is to polymerise the PCBs; the individual molecules are linked together into a non-toxic polymer which can be filtered off and disposed of by burial or incineration. General Electric of the US is pioneering a different approach to clean up the Hudson River in New York, which has been contaminated by its manufacturing operations. It uses live bacteria to break down PCBs. But Mike Fowler, PSL research director, says enzymes are a 'cleaner and more surgical approach' - and a much better commercial prospect. 'One of the beauties of using enzymes rather than micro-organisms is that peroxidases are stable in the presence of solvents which might kill micro-organisms,' he says. PSL is collaborating with Graesser-Biotechna, a London company specialising in anti-pollution technologies, to commercialise the enzyme-based process. A field trial is planned for later this year.</p>

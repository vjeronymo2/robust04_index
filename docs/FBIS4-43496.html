			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Flap on Berlusconi's Dismay With </F> `Opposition' RAI-TV"]    [Excerpts] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- Opposition parties called  today for mass mobilization in protest against Premier Silvio  Berlusconi's criticism of the failure of the public radio and  television broadcaster, RAI, to reflect the views of the nation  as embodied in his rightist government.    In further reaction, the chairman of the Lower House  Constitutional Affairs Committee [Gustavo Selva] urged the  resignation of RAI management and the naming of a special  commissioner and a former Lower House speaker [Giorgio  Napolitano] spoke against government tampering with the  broadcaster as members of the RAI editorial staff demonstrated  and Berlusconi talked to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro about  the RAI case.    Against the backdrop of headlines reporting the opinions of  the premier, whose Fininvest holds the commercial television  monopoly, the Democratic Party of the Left, Communist Renewal  and other opposition parties met to push for mobilization "in  defense of the right to information and as an immediate reply to  the premier's exceptional infringement in the issue of the radio  and television system," said a communique issued by these  leftist alignments.    Also today, the public broadcaster's editorial staff staged  a  demonstration in front of the Lower House building on what they  called, D-Day, or "the longest day." Leaflets handed out by  about 50 RAI journalists said, "As opposed to what happened in  Normandy, where the invaders brought freedom, there is today the  threat of a new `occupation,' of the public service."    "Berlusconi lets it be known that RAI must get into line,  otherwise he'll take care of things personally in a few days.  So were the other premiers who personally `handled' RAI right,  in degrading it professionally and loading it with debt?," asked  the flyer.    With the arrival of MPs, the demonstration turned into an  open-air debate, with some of the "stars" of the airwaves on  hand, and then into a "happening" when protesting miners whose  jobs are threatened were called over to join the show.    Inside, Constitutional Affairs Committee Chairman Gustavo  Selva, of the neofascist National Alliance, said the  "professors" who head RAI should have tendered their  resignations some time back. "If they don't, approaching is a  solution proposed by me for the naming of a commissioner for  RAI."    He also said a "save-RAI" bill, a supplementary funding  package for the heavily indebted broadcaster, should be rejected  by the Parliament because RAI should not be allowed to have  three sources of income, advertising revenues, annual fees paid  by the viewing public and public funds to level off debt.    Selva applauded Berlusconi's remarks, made yesterday, and  declared: "It is evident that RAI programs are anti-government.  This is an anomaly. In Germany, France, Britain, the public  broadcaster does not allocate an opposition attitude to the  government as does RAI. This is an anomaly to correct. But  perhaps the RAI editorial staff should do this," added the  committee chairman.    Taking the opposite view was Giorgio Napolitano, the former  Lower House speaker, who wrote a letter to the speakers of the  two new houses in which he argued, "It is admissible for the new  ruling coalition to demand the resignation of the RAI board,  named on the basis of a law approved by the Parliament. Laws  cannot be torn up like this."    He went on say he thought it correct to submit his views to  Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio, of Berlusconi's Forza Italia,  and Lower House Speaker Irene Pivetti, of Northern League  government ally, because of their roles "above the sides and  their scrupulous balance." If the present government upsets  recovery and revision under way in RAI, argued Napolitano, the  result would be only the application of a new spoils system  which would "deal the public service a death blow."    In conclusion, the former speaker said, "RAI must be  reformed, as provided for in the law passed by the Parliament in  June, and reform must define the way for naming a future board  after the present one completes its mandate. But RAI cannot be  manipulated in violation of the law and the constitutional  principles which safeguard it." [passage omitted]    The premier, talking later in the day about the turn-out of  RAI journalists, said, "This reaction conceals the usual  disinformation of certain communications mediums which, thinking  only of maintaining the status quo at RAI, evidently cannot even  stand to have the problem brought up." After disclosing that he  and the head of state had discussed the RAI problem, "seeing  that this is disinformation," Berlusconi said that many  newspapers had totally turned around the meaning of what he had  said.    "I think I expressed a very balanced opinion, perhaps banal,  and that is that I hoped that the public service would stay  independent, autonomous, balanced and that it would look to  government activities with a free spirit, talking well of it or  badly, according to the time and what the executive does," he  said.    In the meantime, Berlusconi's Forza Italia said the clamour  raised in the newspapers today only shows "once again the  prejudicial position against this government taken by most of  the press." This communique also urged, as regards RAI news, "a  return to the objectivity, independence and pluralism which  takes into account that the greater part of the voters have  determined the formation of the coalition ruling the country."

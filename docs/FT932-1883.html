			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Weighed down by green issues - In a Nutshell Is the environment to become the next burden to be placed on small firms? Quality assurance, in the shape of BS5750, has been enthusiastically adopted by many large companies, but is seen as an imposition by some small suppliers who are suddenly required to conform to a new set of rules. A new handbook, Buying into the Environment*, emphasises the need for a partnership between large companies and their small suppliers. It suggests guidelines for purchasers and suppliers when they are dealing with environmental issues and promotes best practice. Intended for large and small companies alike, it provides helpful explanations of the legislation, organisations and jargon in this field. *From Business in the Environment, 8 Stratton Street, London W1X 5FD.

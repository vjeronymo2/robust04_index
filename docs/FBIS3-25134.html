At 2:30 P.M. this  afternoon, the vice chairman of the NRC, Alhaji Moses Kigongo,  called for an adjournment of 15 minutes to allow for more NRC  members to come and form a quorum, as there were only 50  members. After 25 minutes of waiting, the house was called to  order, only to find that there was still no quorum. The house  was set to deliberate on the government white paper on education  and the public accounts committee report.</p>

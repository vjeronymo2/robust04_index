He declined to reveal their names saying "we  will tell you more about this as soon as possible." In an  answer to an Interfax question, Stepashin only indicated that  four rumor-spreaders were identified. Their fate and location  are now in the hands of the Prosecutor General's Office.    Stepashin appreciated the calm reaction by the president,  the  prime minister and other people involved in the alleged coup and  called on journalists to "approach fakes of all types in a more  balanced manner."    Among other reasons for the appearance of such rumors,  Stepashin pointed to the intricacy of the economic situation,  the amnesty and its political effects. He added that the  authors of the scheme also wanted to see the reaction by the  president, the power structures and persons mentioned in their  speculations and set them against each other. They failed,  Stepashin said.</p>

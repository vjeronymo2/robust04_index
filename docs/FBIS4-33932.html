			<p>BFN     [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano on  8 June did not rule out the possibility of his country  ultimately asking for arbitration on the Continental Glaciers  issue if the bilateral agreement on the Continental Glaciers  remains frozen in the Argentine Congress (its approval has been  pending for two years).    Figueroa noted that during his official visit to Argentina  he  reviewed this sensitive issue with his Argentine counterpart,  Guido Di Tella, on 8 June and both arrived at the following  conclusion: "We, the governments, already have done our part."  The foreign ministers now believe it all depends on the  Congresses.    When CLARIN asked him if his remarks meant that he ruled out  the possibility of resorting to arbitration, as established in  the 1984 Peace and Friendship Treaty, Figueroa -- visibly  annoyed -- responded: "I did not say that, but we do not rule  out any possible solution ... all possibilities remain open."    During a news conference at the National Foreign Service  Institute [ISEN], Figueroa, who was joined by Di Tella,  Argentine Ambassador to Chile Eduardo Iglesias, and Chilean  Ambassador to Argentina Eduardo Rodriguez, stressed that the  Argentine Government does not believe Chile would ultimately ask  for arbitration as compensation for a possible adverse ruling in  the Laguna del Desierto arbitration.    This possibility had been discussed at ISEN by Foreign  Ministry Secretary General Andres Cisneros and prompted an  information request by Peronist Santa Cruz Deputy Rafael Flores,  one of the rebels preventing the discussion of the Continental  Glaciers agreement.    Without citing any names, Figueroa noted: "There cannot be  any other official message from the Argentine Government but the  one voiced by Di Tella."    High-ranking Foreign Ministry officials speculate that after  November, when the arbitration court will issue a ruling on the  Laguna del Desierto case surely favoring the Argentine position,  Chile reportedly will seek arbitration on the Continental  Glaciers to compensate for this possible diplomatic defeat.</p>

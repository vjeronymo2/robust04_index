			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CUBS BEAT PHILLIES FOR 6TH STRAIGHT  </P> <P> The battle for first place in the Eastern Division of the National League was  not going on in St. Louis, where the New York Mets were playing the Cardinals.  </P> <P> It was being fought out at Philadelphia between the Phillies and the Chicago  Cubs.  </P> <P> Andre Dawson drove in three runs, and the Cubs beat the Phillies, 6-4, for  their sixth consecutive victory. Another fine relief performance by the Cubs'  Mitch Williams enbled them to take a one-game lead over the Phillies.  </P> <P> Williams retired all five batters he faced to save the win for Scott Sanderson,  who went 5 1/3 innings in his comeback bid. Williams has saved five games in  five attempts.  </P> <P> Sanderson, who missed most of last season with a disk problem, won for the  first time as a starter since 1987.  </P> <P> "I didn't have a curve, slider, changeup, nothing," Sanderson said. "The ball  felt like ice in my hands. And not because of the weather, either."  </P> <P> New York 9, St. Louis 4 -- The Mets, batting only .216 before the game, raised  their average 12 points and spoiled the Cardinals' home opener, dropping them  into last place.  </P> <P> Gregg Jefferies' bases-clearing double sparked a seven-run fifth inning to rout  Joe Magrane.  </P> <P> David Cone, who lost only three games last season, evened his record at 1-1,  although he tired in the late innings.  </P> <P> Montreal 7, Pittsburgh 6 -- Hot pinch-hitter Wallace Johnson doubled home the  winning run in the ninth inning at Pittsburgh after the Expos blew an early  lead.  </P> <P> Johnson, who drove in just two runs with 22 pinch-hits last season, has already  driven in four runs with two pinch-hits this season.  </P> <P> It was a costly loss for the Pirates. Two regulars, Andy Van Slyke (rib-cage  injury) and Sid Bream (knee injury), had to leave the game.  </P> <P> San Diego 6, Cincinnati 5 -- Jack Clark hit his first home run for the Padres,  a three-run shot at San Diego. Luis Salazar's homer proved to be decisive as  the Padres ended a two-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Eric Show went seven innings to improve his record to 2-1. Mark Davis, although  he gave up a run in the ninth and had the tying run at third base, earned the  save.  </P> <P> Davis has five saves in five chances, same as the Cubs' Williams.  </P> <P> San Francisco 7, Atlanta 5 -- Kevin Mitchell hit his fourth home run of the  season and drove in three runs at San Francisco to help the Giants take over  first place in the West.  </P> <P> Rick Reuschel overcame a rocky start to improve his record to 3-0.

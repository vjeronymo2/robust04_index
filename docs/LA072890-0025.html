			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> JORGE AND ROSS GO ON THE RECORD  </P> <P> Kleber Jorge has finally taken matters into his own hands. Despite the recent  highly visible presence around town of the expatriate Brazilian  singer-guitarist-songwriter, a record contract has been an elusive goal. So  Jorge and partner Rachel Ross invited a bunch of friends and fans to the cozy  environs of Studio City's La Ve Lee Restaurant on Tuesday night, booked a  mobile recording unit, and made their own recording.  </P> <P> Jorge's musical lineage traces in a direct line to the jazz-tinged rhythms and  rich harmonies of Antonio Carlos Jobim and Dorival Caymmi. Few of the nine new  works on the program revealed any of the rock and fusion influences that have  crept into the work of Jorge's contemporaries.  </P> <P> "Desculpe Caymmi," for example, a warm, sensuous song that provided a superb  setting for Jorge's dark-toned voice, used a Caymmi phrase as its starting  point. Other pieces -- "Belfort Roxo Street," "Brother" and "Freeway to  Saudade" were good examples -- matched Jorge's arching melodies with Ross'  multiplaned, storylike lyrics. In the best tradition of Brazilian popular song,  they combined the oddly complementary elements of dance, passion and social  awareness.  </P> <P> Jorge was at his best, soaringly lyrical on the ballads, bracingly energetic on  the rhythm tunes. For this program, at least, his excellent guitar playing took  a back seat to the accompaniment of Brazilliance. Jorge has made the group --  with Bill Cantos on keyboards, Glen Garrett on saxophone and flute, Arnou De  Melo on bass, Teo Lima and drums and Kevin Ricard on percussion -- into the  perfect vehicle for his music.  </P> <P> The only remaining question is whether or not any of the major record labels,  so lax thus far in recognizing Jorge's potential, will take a closer listen to  his self- produced recording. They'd be wise to do so.  </P> <P> Kleber Jorge and Brazilliant will also appear Wednesday at St. Marks in Venice,  and every Sunday in August at Lunaria in West Los Angeles. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

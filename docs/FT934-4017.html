			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Risk and Reward: Banks use swaps to counterbalance asset-sensitivity Low interest rates and a steep yield curve have bailed out the US banking industry in the past two years: but what will happen to bank earnings if interest rates rise and the curve flattens? The question has aroused much speculation but few answers - not least because it is impossible to tell from published data whether banks have used interest rate swaps and other off-balance sheet instruments to add to or reduce their interest rate exposure. Now, faced with scepticism over their sharply-rising use of derivatives, some US regional and 'super-regional' banks have begun a campaign to ease investors' concerns. BancOne has led the fight. The notional value of swaps in which it is involved jumped to Dollars 37bn at end-September from Dollars 21bn at end-1992, arousing concern and hitting its share price. Given that BancOne relies on a buoyant share price to further its acquisition strategy, it wasn't surprising to see chairman Mr John McCoy in New York last week trying to persuade 200 analysts and others that the bank wasn't speculating on interest rates. Other banks have also been working hard to reduce what they believe are market misconceptions, among them North Carolina-based First Union. Its use of instruments like swaptions and floors creates more nervousness than BancOne. Information from these two institutions suggests that, while earnings would normally benefit from a rise in short-term interest rates, they have used swaps to reverse that position. In effect, the banks are betting that short-term rates will remain flat or fall further in the next year or so. Most bank customers want to borrow against the (variable) prime rate and deposit at fixed rates, says Mr Richard Lodge, BancOne's chief investment officer: as a result, as interest rates rise, the income a bank receives on its assets goes up faster than the payments it makes to depositors. Both BancOne and First Union have used swaps to counterbalance this so-called 'asset-sensitivity' and tilt their exposure slightly the other way instead. They do this by entering swap agreements under which they receive a fixed interest rate and pay a floating one. BancOne says its use of swaps contributed 70 basis points to its net interest margin during the third quarter, which stood at 6.22 per cent. First Union, on the other hand, pursues a hedging strategy which in part reduces its current net interest margin at the expense of protecting future earnings. It bought a large option on a swap (known as a 'swaption') a year ago: this gives it the right to enter a swap agreement at a predetermined rate. Up-front premiums paid on deals like this are spread over the option's life, reducing current earnings. On the face of it, the two banks appear to have remarkably similar exposures to interest rate movements, though different methods of calculation make direct comparison difficult. BancOne says a gradual 100 basis point rise in interest rates during next year would lower earnings by only 3.3 per cent. First Union puts its interest-rate sensitivity at 3 per cent. What happens if the yield curve flattens, eating into the banks' margin-boosting trick of carrying bonds and swaps which pay fixed rates? 'They can't hedge that away,' says Mr John Leonard, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. But a flatter yield curve could bring higher loan demand - and then the banks could get back to a business the stock market believes they know much more about.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Arts: Fanny Burney's 'Busy Day' - Theatre For all her importance as a text-book figure in the history of the English novel, Fanny Burney is less often quoted than her father, Charles, who sheds an invaluable light on musical Europe in the 18th century. Yet if Fanny Burney the author is neglected, Fanny Burney the person exercises an increasing fascination. One-woman shows are not infrequent, and are a reminder of her courage, cheerfulness and independence. The RSC's royal anthology, The Hollow Crown, immortalised her near-surreal encounters with dotty George III and lugubrious Queen Charlotte. Journalistic vividness, perceptiveness and sympathy allied to high spirits and good sense explain why Jane Austen admired her. That much comes over in A Busy Day, one of Burney's unpublished plays, now at the King's Head Theatre, Islington, after its premiere from the Bristol-based Show of Strength Theatre Company last September. It would be good to see a really polished production, by the RSC, say, that imposed discipline on this panorama of late Georgian heiresses, fortune-seekers, snobs, beaux and arrivistes. This version is rustic but hearty, the overall effect resembling a jolly school play - the main impression being so homespun that the professional credentials in the cast's potted biographies come as a surprise. 'Adapted, produced and directed' by Alan Coveney, the play reveals elements old and new. An emphasis on fortune (mortgages, dowries, inheritances) looks forward oddly to Bulwer Lytton's Money, which also has a clubland scene and a tendency to foppish caricature (Lytton's fatuous Frederick Blount is surely a descendant of Burney's languidly inert Lord John). The grotesquely snobbish Lady Wilhelmina is the comic dragon with aspirations and pretension, an aristocratic version of Mrs Hardcastle or Mrs Malaprop. Our heroine Eliza has an embarrassing family she has grown away from, like Fanny Price in Mansfield Park; and the Austen link is strengthened by the supremely selfish Sir Marmaduke, a comic distortion of Sir Walter Elliott in Persuasion. Not that the work exists only as a thesis-writer's goldmine of cultural references. As the distended romp of this production shows, it has comic vitality, notably in such characters as Eliza's bedizened, nouveau-riche mother and sister, or the man-mad Miss Percival, whom Juliette Grassby has honking in mock-panic at imagined amatory pursuers. The hero's foppish brother is more conventional (though Ian Kelly's comic gifts come into their own), but, in this slightly unbalanced and still too long adaptation, manages to take over the plot with Miss Percival, now a spiteful avenger. The plot rambles, and I suspect such astonishingly Wildean remarks as 'One has no chance with any girl until her family are all against one' owe more to the adaptor than Miss Burney. What emerges is Burney's tolerance; it just saves her from being snobbish about lower-class ambitions or reactionary in her championship of middle-class values, just as her sense of humour redeems her from the charge of Thatcherism in her accolade of the City and its socio-economic virtues. The cast enjoy themselves and may soon learn how to pronounce 'harass' and 'exquisitely' in the traditional English way rather than the American. Fanny Burney's other plays may well deserve a look.</p>

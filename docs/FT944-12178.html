			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (2): Serious flights of fancy - Airport bookshops are increasingly paying attention to the needs - and aspirations - of the business traveller / Airport books In all those aircraft disaster movies, where the entire crew eats poisoned scampi, or Concorde gets attacked by a runaway Soviet missile, there is a stock of characters among the passengers helping to give dramatic resonance to what is usually a tiring plot: the irascible old lady who preferred to travel by train anyway; the ailing child; the hot-tempered husband who has rowed with his wife and wonders guiltily if he will ever see her again. No such film could appear today without another ubiquitous fixture of the passenger lounge; the self-improving business traveller. Many managers are so weighed down with work-loads that an uninterrupted couple of hours on a flight to a conference destination might be the only time they get to themselves - and they make sure they put it to good use. Spurning the chance to catch up on the Booker short-list, or finally make a start on War and Peace, they prefer instead to devote some precious time to books which promise, quite simply, to make them better at their jobs. The proof of these flights of fancy is on the ground, where airport bookshops are increasingly paying attention to the needs - and aspirations - of the business traveller. Sales of business books are as yet fairly modest  -some 6 per cent of total sales in W. H. Smith's 45 airport shops - but the displays of such material are fast acquiring the slick professionalism which the rest of the publishing world has long taken for granted. At the main W. H. Smith bookstore at London's Heathrow airport, business books are tucked between transport and military history and poetry. While it is hard for them to compete with some of the more lurid paperback best-sellers, they are having a go: titles such as Maverick], Japanese Maverick], Who Dares Sells, and Awaken the Giant Within are not packaged noticeably differently from the spies-and-sex potboilers which dominate airport bookshops. It is no surprise that there is such a happy convergence of interests between airports, publishers and business travellers. Ms Sam Brown, airports book buyer at W. H. Smith, says business books are one of publishing's greatest expansion areas. 'A very high percentage of airport users are business travellers, they are not price-sensitive and they have time on their hands,' she says. According to figures compiled by the British Airports Authority, 5.5 per cent of all book sales in the UK are from airport shops. 'It is not uncommon for a business manager, particularly a foreign one, to browse through the shop and put a mass order in once he or she arrives at the other end,' says Ms Brown. High-profile biographies, company histories and a whole range of pocket-books and manuals figure well in their sales - as does the new breed of quasi-philosophical tracts from authors such as Tom Peters and Charles Handy. Topping the airport business charts in recent months has been George Soros's The Alchemy of Finance, published by John Wiley. Mr Mike Crayford, the company's marketing executive responsible for airports, says it is no coincidence that the book is written by someone who is famous for having made a lot of money. 'It has sold extremely well - I guess business people think that reading it will make them lots of money. You could call it a kind of greed factor.' He says that many of the buyers at airport bookshops would not normally have the time or, possibly, the inclination to spend hours browsing in an 'ordinary' shop. 'In an airport, they are 'captured' on-site, with time to spare - it is an ideal selling scenario.' What seems curious is that, rather than take a couple of hours 'off' by sinking into a novel, today's business traveller is using every minute of his or her time for self-improvement. Or perhaps it is not so curious. Many of today's business books, heavily influenced by the self-help publishing boom, are written in the most racy, aphoristic language this side of Nietzsche. One of their most common - and popular - refrains concerns the need to clear away all one's paperwork, troubles and old-fashioned ideas and re-invent oneself from scratch. Such books cannot be read in the correct spirit when sitting in front of a heaving desk with a stream of appointments to keep. But once off the ground, can there be a better way of rejuvenating the mind than dreaming about becoming another Soros, or revelling in the freedom of 'liberation management', or re-styling oneself as a maverick, bucking the conformity which dominates one's working life? It could be that some of the most important decisions one ever has to face are best taken high above the ground, with a complimentary drink and a good book in tow.</p>

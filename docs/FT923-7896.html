			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / US pledges to act on war crimes THE US and the European Community yesterday pledged to help bring to judgment those guilty of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. Speaking on the first day of a two-day exceptional session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Mr John Bolton, US assistant secretary of state for international organisation affairs, said the US was 'fully prepared with others to see that individuals guilty of violations of international law and human rights principles are held strictly accountable'. He referred to a resolution approved by the UN Security Council late yesterday which urged states and organisations to provide information on possible war crimes to the Security Council. A US-drafted resolution put to the Human Rights Commission, which wonbroad support among the 53 members, called for appointment of a special human rights investigator to report by the end of the month on human rights abuses in Bosnia-Hercegovina and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. It also demanded immediate access for the International Committee of the Red Cross to all places of detention. For the EC presidency, Mr Martin Morland, Britain's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said the investigator's report would include recommendations on compiling evidence of human rights violations 'so that those responsible can be brought to book'. 'In that way, we can also send a clear message that  .. the international community will not tolerate gross violations, nor allow them to be forgotten.' The threat of war crimes prosecutions is seen by western diplomats as one of the few ways the international community can deter further atrocities in the Bosnian conflict short of direct intervention. Mr Bolton warned the warring factions that seized territory would never receive international sanction. 'Any state enlarged through the bloodshed of innocent civilians is an international pariah, an outlaw state', he said. 'The sooner the parties accept this fundamental fact, the sooner we can turn to peacefully resolving this crisis.' Mr Ejup Ganic, a member of the Bosnian presidency, told the Commission that Serbian agression in Bosnia had resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, more than 150,000 injured and 1.8m uprooted from their homes. He claimed that Serb militias had established more than 100 concentration camps holding more than 120,000 people. Mr Ganic called for the Red Cross to inspect the camps, permanent human rights monitors in the region and the setting up of a war crimes tribunal. In London, the Liberal Democrats urged the government to take in more refugees from the battle zone and renewed their calls for 'safe havens' to be set up within Bosnia for displaced persons, writes David Owen. Drawing on his experiences during a recent visit to Serbian-held areas of Bosnia, Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said the EC should 'sit down and work out a formula' for the equitable sharing of the refugee burden.</p>

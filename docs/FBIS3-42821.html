Meeting  With the Leaders of Political Parties and Grassroots Movements"]    [Text] On 17 November Geydar Aliyev, president of the  Azerbaijan Republic, held a meeting with the leaders of  political parties and grassroots movements at which were  discussed the war situation, the sources of the emergence of the  Nagorno-Karabakh problem, and ways of settling the  Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the  Supreme Soviet, State Secretary Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva, other  officials, and the leaders of all political parties and  grassroots movements, except for the People's Front of  Azerbaijan, and also representatives of the news media, took  part in the meeting.    The meeting was opened by Geydar Aliyev. He said, in part:    Discharging the functions of chairman of the Supreme Soviet  of Azerbaijan and subsequently assuming the office of president  of the republic, I expressed my opinion concerning the social  and political and economic life of Azerbaijan. This you know. I  would like once more briefly to mention that the continued  existence of the Azerbaijan Republic is connected exclusively  with state independence. Azerbaijan must build its state on the  basis of democratic principles. This means that a state based on  the rule of law should be built and a democratic society created  in the republic. We must take advantage of the achievements of  world democracy and the traditions of the first independent  state of Azerbaijan created in 1918. Freedom of the individual,  freedom of speech and worship, defense of human rights, the  equality of all citizens, and political pluralism should be  established in Azerbaijan as the basic attributes of a  democratic society.    As president, I will organize my activity on the basis of  these principles, G. Aliyev went on to observe. I have summoned  and once again summon the political parties and grassroots  movements of the republic to joint action and cooperation based  on these principles.    Speaking of the social and political and military situation  in the country, the president declared that, possibly, these  principles were not entirely applicable to the present position  of Azerbaijan, which has for approximately six years been living  under the conditions of war. Part of our land, the head of state  recalled, has been captured by the Armenian armed forces. There  are more than 1 million refugees in Azerbaijan. The republic's  economy is in a profound crisis. All this is forcing the  republic to live in accordance with the laws of wartime. But,  the president observed, I believe that all social and political  forces of the country and all citizens of Azerbaijan, regardless  of their beliefs, should today be serving a single goal--that of  defense of the unity, integrity, and sovereignty of Azerbaijan.  It will then be possible both to organize defenses and to  extricate the republic from this grim situation. I believe, he  emphasized, that we still have the opportunity for this.  Following the path of democracy, political pluralism, and the  market economy and creating extensive opportunities for the  development of enterprise, we can, having united all forces,  secure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the republic.    Having dwelt on the role of the political parties in the  accomplishment of national and state tasks, Geydar Aliyev  observed that the constructive position of all social and  political organizations is an essential condition of  cooperation. We must on this condition either continue our  activity on the basis of democratic principles or adopt the  frequently advanced proposal concerning the declaration of  martial law to save Azerbaijan and extricate the country from  the crisis.    Speaking of the reasons that had prompted the leadership to  organize this meeting, the head of Azerbaijan emphasized that in  building the strategy of his activity on democratic principles,  he would give preference to cooperation with all political  parties and public organizations operating in the republic. In  order that this meeting might be held on a democratic basis, he  announced, the representatives of all political parties and  public organizations were notified two days earlier on  television and invited to this meeting. We wanted, G. Aliyev  said, each social and political organization to send its  representatives to it itself. We wanted to meet and exchange  opinions with the representatives of all parties and movements,  regardless of their size and degree of influence on the social  and political life of the republic.    Geydar Aliyev expressed gratitude to the representatives of  all political parties and grassroots movements for their  participation in the meeting. In his opinion, the refusal of  representatives of the People's Front of Azerbaijan to take part  should be seen as the absence in this organization, which has in  recent years performed a definite and important part in the  political life of Azerbaijan, of a desire for constructive  cooperation.    Having touched on the questions to be submitted for  discussion by the participants in the meeting, the president  observed that its main purpose was consultation and an exchange  of opinions on a number of problems. There are many subjects for  discussion, but I believe, Geydar Aliyev said, that you will  agree that the main and at the same time most difficult task for  our republic, our people, and the state today is an end to the  war. We have been trying to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh  problem, which was imposed on Azerbaijan, for approximately six  years now. It seems to me that this is the most urgent, most  important question. If we can find ways out of the war, get back  the captured territories, and resolve the Karabakh problem, the  president observed, a solution of the other problems will be  possible.    Only by having resolved this problem can we achieve a  significant improvement in the sphere of constitutional  development, the economy, and social policy, overcome the  crisis, and erect a barrier to crime. I call on you, therefore,  for an exchange of opinions primarily on these matters.    In the past six years, Geydar Aliyev went on to say, social  and political organizations and parties and state authorities  and also organs of the press have expressed various opinions,  considerations, and proposals and implemented certain measures.  But none has thus far produced the desired result. Whereas six  years ago the Nagorno-Karabakh question was perceived only as a  problem, an incident, subsequently, growing by the day, by the  month, by the year, this problem became a casus belli between  the two states, between the two republics. There have been tough  military operations as of late. The fruitlessness of the  measures adopted by Azerbaijan is shown also by the fact that  control over the entire territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh  Oblast has been lost in the recent period, and even our areas  bordering the oblast have gradually been occupied by Armenian  armed forces.    The parties, public organizations, and organs of the press  are at this difficult time of our life once again presenting  various proposals and thoughts. Some people believe that this  question could be settled quickly and that Azerbaijan would be  spared this tragedy were their proposals adopted and the path  that they propose chosen.    I believe that the representatives of the political parties  and grassroots movements should advance their proposals today,  the head of state said. If the adopted measures are not  producing the desired result, Azerbaijan is suffering one defeat  after another, and some people believe that they are capable of  averting such a course of events, then let us confer. Each  thought, each proposal is valuable. If these proposals help  extricate Azerbaijan from the present difficult situation, these  proposals should, regardless of who made them, be adopted, and  we should join forces.    In my appeal to the people on 2 November, I called on all  citizens of Azerbaijan to rise up and join their efforts at this  difficult time for the republic, the president observed. I  called on all political parties and grassroots movements for  solidarity and service of the cause of defense of the  territorial integrity of the Azerbaijan Republic and a return of  the occupied land. Such is my opinion, and it is sincere. I  repeat: Everyone and all parties and organizations holding  different, even, possibly, diametrically opposite positions,  should unite for the sake of this goal. Everyone here has one  motherland--Azerbaijan--and we all live on the same  soil--Azerbaijani. Each piece of this earth is sacred for each  of us. If this rivalry and squabbling and this struggle for  power, wherein use is made of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem,  continues, if all this becomes the cause of a weakening of our  defense capability and a further expansion of the aggression of  the Armenian armed forces, if Azerbaijan falls apart and  perishes, where will those who are struggling for power form  their governments? I repeat: We have one motherland, and all  should act in its name.    I would like you today to have a candid, fruitful  conversation and for your thoughts not to be dissipated on other  topics, the president said. If we arrive at a specific opinion  on the matter under discussion, if we can truly unite all  forces, we will continue such meetings and hold discussions on  other matters also. But this will depend on today's discussion.  I hope that I have managed to clearly convey my thoughts to  those present. And now I am prepared to listen closely to your  opinions and proposals.    The floor was given over to the participants in the meeting.  In the course of the meeting, which lasted more than five hours,  the leaders of more than 20 parties and grassroots movements,  who had their say on the current strained atmosphere in the  republic and on ways of stabilizing the situation in Azerbaijan,  spoke. Some of the speakers condemned the People's Front of  Azerbaijan for the fact that its representatives had declined  this meeting.    A large part of the speakers evaluated this meeting as an  important step en route to political dialogue in the business of  regulating the social and political and military situation in  the republic. The activity that had been exercised as of late,  geared to the removal of the chaos and lawlessness which had  taken shape in the period of the leadership of the former  authorities, was approved. The need for the adoption of laws in  the military, political, and economic spheres, for a display of  decisiveness on a number of issues, and for the adoption of  tough measures was noted.    A proposal concerning the creation of a political  consultative council and the preparation of the mechanism of its  work was advanced at the meeting. But, in the opinion of a  number of speakers, were this council to be formed under the  auspices of parliament and its legal status to be defined, more  effective results could be expected. A large part of those who  spoke approved this proposal. It was observed that, having  united the forces of all political parties and grassroots  movements of the republic and having perfected and accelerated  even more the organizational development of the army, it was  essential to adopt comprehensive measures to prevent the seizure  of our land.    Those who spoke observed that inefficient use was being made  in the republic thus far of the material, scientific, and  personnel potential, the preparation of the youth for military  service had been organized unsatisfactorily, lawlessness was  being perpetrated at times under the guise of mobilization, and  the necessary conditions for speeches to the fighters in areas  of the front of the artistic intelligentsia and veterans to  raise the former's patriotic spirit were not being created.    The speakers said with concern that there is in the capital  of the republic and in other large cities no sense that there is  a war going on. They expressed regret in connection with the  fact that an uncompromising struggle was not being conducted  against mafia groups and criminal outfits, which are abusing the  current situation. In the opinion of certain speakers, martial  law should be declared, mobilization should be intensified, all  production bays, enterprises, and administrations should  organize their work in accordance with the requirements of  wartime, and everything should be adapted to the interests of  the front as quickly as possible. The participants in the  meeting spoke in detail about the mistakes in the organization  of the work of defense and noted the importance of sponsorship  of each unit and increased state concern for the families of the  fighters. A main military control inspectorate should begin to  function to shore up discipline in the army.    Many speakers emphatically condemned the fact that material  of an insulting nature, unsubstantiated and contentious, is  appearing in a large quantity in many press organs and  considered it necessary under the present conditions to suspend  the activity of all political parties and grassroots movements  and also to suspend the activity of a number of press organs.    Mention was made with satisfaction at the meeting of the  activity of the present leadership of the republic aimed at a  solution of military problems by political methods and of the  need for a continuation of this work. It was observed that a  cease-fire, if only for a short time, was necessary at this  difficult time for the country. In the opinion of the  participants in the meeting, it is necessary to find new  diplomatic channels, to use all means that could contribute to  the implementation of the resolutions passed by international  organizations, and to work actively on conveying to the world  public the truth about the predatory actions of the Armenian  aggressors.    Those who spoke emphatically condemned the attempts to  create  antagonism between the authorities and the opposition and said  that the present opposition was in fact conducting not so much a  political struggle as a struggle for power, which was  fundamentally contrary to the wishes of the Azerbaijani people.    Closing the meeting, Geydar Aliyev said, summing up the  exchange of opinions:    Although this meeting was belated, it was useful,  nonetheless. We have for five hours had a wide-ranging exchange  of opinions, and the representatives of political parties,  organizations, and movements have advanced a whole range of  proposals and thoughts. They included, undoubtedly, thoughts  that were useful, but also those that are far removed from the  main subject of our meeting. But I approach with respect and  attention each proposal and each thought, and I hope that all  this will be useful in the future.    At the start of our meeting, I explained that the main  conversation and main discussion should deal with one issue--the  extrication of Azerbaijan from the state of war, the return of  the occupied land, and a resolution of the Karabakh problem.  Unfortunately, there have not been enough specific proposals in  this connection.    You know that some newspapers operating from an accusatory  position in this connection and their owners want to create in  society the impression that they know the paths of a solution of  these questions and that the people who are directing the state  at this moment are pursuing the wrong policy and occupying the  wrong position and do not know how to resolve the urgent  problems. But today's meeting has shown that these words,  rumors, and slanderous articles are not backed by a single  specific suggestion or constructive thought.    I am convinced that in a republic subjected to military  aggression, confrontation needs to be brought to an end. Enough.  In these five or six years, confrontation in Azerbaijan has  reached extremes. This has been of no benefit either to the  people or the independent state of Azerbaijan. It is merely  damage that has been caused from year to year. All these blows,  having mounted up, have ultimately put the economy of the  republic in a difficult position, and this has been reflected  particularly in a weakening and limitation of the possibilities  of averting military aggression. As a result, part of the  republic has been snatched away. And unless an end is put to the  confrontation, certain forces, taking advantage of the Karabakh  problem, will continue the struggle for power.    If the people who were yesterday in power and who reduced  the  republic to such a condition, daily giving interviews in the  newspapers, continue, as before, to publish provocative ideas,  it will be impossible to preserve the republic, and it will fall  apart. Those who were in office yesterday and who have now been  removed and who were unable to resolve the urgent problems do  not today have the moral right to criticize, debunk, and give  interviews. They have quit the scene, and if they have  understood their mistakes, they should now be doing everything  really to help extricate the people from the present difficult  situation. Or they should step aside and say: Yes, we were  unable to handle this, let us see how it ends. But once again  stepping up confrontation under the motto, as Gabil Guseynli  said, "Either us or no one"--this should be seen merely as  treachery in relation to the people, which can only destroy the  republic. And this is complicating even more the already  difficult situation of the country and causing its economic  potential and military power great harm.    As many speakers observed, some persons, who are repeating  over and over: "We have lost yet another village," "One more  district has been captured," and rejoicing at this, are  celebrating it. Instead of uniting the people, they are  inflaming passions, which is increasing in society the trend  toward disarticulation and is an even more telling blow than  that which is being delivered by our enemy.    I want at our meeting first and foremost to bring to your  attention the fact that, as a president who has assumed this  immense responsibility, I know and sense how complex and  difficult it is. I would like those who love their motherland,  the land, and the people, and who are committed to an  independent Azerbaijan Republic, to help me see this mission  through to the end. If, on the other hand, assistance does not  follow and some people remain in opposition and engage in  complaining, I will undoubtedly have to put an end to this  attitude. I concur with the opinion of Neymat Panakhly to the  effect that division by the "power-opposition" principle is out  of the question at this time. If the state has for five years  been in a state of war and has for five years been losing land,  how long will there continue to be talk about such a division in  this state?    The "power-opposition" question is usually based on two  principles. The first is ideological. The opposition forces,  cleaving to different ideological views, disagree with the  ideology of the authorities, dismiss them, and implement their  own ideology. There is no ideological disconnection here at this  time. We all advocate the independence of Azerbaijan and must  defend this independence. There are no other opinions. Etibar  Mamedov has said that Azerbaijan's membership in the  Commonwealth of Independent States is weakening and limiting its  independence. I disagree with this opinion. I have my own  opinion in this connection, of course. And Etibar Mamedov knows  that the issue is by no means as he frames it. But he expresses  this opinion, since he has to be in opposition. Of the 15  republics of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that  gained independence, 12 are members of the Commonwealth of  Independent States. Only the Baltic states have not joined. But  have the countries that have joined the CIS lost their  independence? Have Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, or neighboring  Turkmenistan, which from the economic viewpoint comes out the  winner, as they say, lost their independence?    Someone said here that although Turkey a year ago allocated  Azerbaijan a loan in the amount of $250 million, not $1 million  of this sum has been utilized as yet. But Turkmenistan has  utilized it. According to information available to us, many  states are making big investments in this republic. But is this  meeting with any objections? Although Turkmenistan is a member  of the Commonwealth of Independent States, there are a number of  CIS documents that it has not signed. Why are we, joining the  Commonwealth and not yet having had time to properly see what is  what, saying that we have lost independence or are limiting it?    I would like to say once more that we all support  Azerbaijan's independence and that I personally have observed  repeatedly that I will defend Azerbaijan's state independence,  regardless of where I am, with all my activity, until the last  minute of my life. If the forces which are in opposition are  supporters of the independence of Azerbaijan, we have,  consequently, no difference of opinion. This is what our  ideology is based on.    In the past, our ideology was Marxist-Leninist, and now we  have rejected it. The representative of one party observed here  that he is a supporter of socialism and is opposed to a market  economy. This is his personal affair. But the majority of  Azerbaijani society has rejected communist ideology and the  building of socialism, and are supporters of Azerbaijan's taking  the path of the building of an independent, secular, law-based  state, founded on values common to all mankind and national  traditions.    This, consequently, is our ideology. One part of it is  composed of spiritual values and national traditions. We are  true to all this--culture, religion, national spirit, all  national traditions, and our history; I am not mistaken here, I  believe. As far as our religion is concerned, I will give you  one example. The Islamic religion is the religion that we have  followed for many centuries. Not only the Islamic, but also all  other religions, were in the Soviet Union under prohibition for  70 years. We have now been given freedom and we have returned to  our faith, and the freedom of worship of each individual is  guaranteed.    And this being the case, if between the authorities and the  opposition there are no ideological differences, there are other  complaints here: "You are in office, and I am not; consequently,  I will fight you in order to remove you and take your position  myself." Come on, brother, let us finish the war, and you can  take for yourself any position. But let us remember: The present  implacable opposition held until recently all the high offices.  No one took these offices away from these people; they left of  their own accord. I have spoken about this repeatedly.    And for this reason there are no grounds here, in a country  that has been at war for six years, for talking about power and  opposition. There should be no talk about this. Mistakes of the  state and the state authorities should undoubtedly be subjected  to criticism. The authorities should know their mistakes, to  avoid making them in the future. But this by no means signifies  that it is necessary to adopt a hostile, treacherous, terrorist  position in respect to them. There are currently among those in  opposition persons who live by terrorist sentiments and are  hatching terrorist plans. An investigation has shown that  certain people were brought in here for the physical  extermination of Geydar Aliyev and that measures for his removal  at a particular time had been implemented. So what kind of  opposition is this? What faith does it confess?    Do these terrorist organizations really want to save  Azerbaijan from Armenian aggression, or have they chosen this  path to achieve their personal ends? Terrorism is the meanest,  dirtiest path. So it has been throughout history, in all states.  There needs to be an end to this. As chairman of the Supreme  Soviet, I treated such phenomena with patience and do so now  also. But this does not mean that this patience is unlimited.    I believe that for Azerbaijan to be extricated from the  state  of war all forces must now unite. All specific proposals in this  connection will be studied and applied. I have not heard any  today. There was just one specific proposal--concerning the  creation of a consultative council. I personally agree here. The  state secretary will handle this matter. A consultative council  should be created, evidently, in connection with the Karabakh  problem. A general consultative council would enable us to  achieve a great deal. It should be created in connection with  the specific Karabakh problem, in order that this problem be  tackled within its framework with regard to the existing  proposals and possibilities.    If you wish to create a consultative council for the  administration of the state, there is no need for this at this  time, it seems to me. If the people have elected a president, he  will take the necessary steps to administer the state. The  Karabakh problem is the main problem for us. Together with the  problem of how to extricate Azerbaijan from the state of war,  there are undoubtedly other questions also, and they will not be  overlooked, either. But a consultative council is needed for a  solution merely of the Karabakh problem. If a consultative  council were really to work actively and this problem were to be  settled, this would be a notable event, because we have for six  years been unable to resolve it.    Inasmuch as this is a very big problem, and since a specific  discussion of ways out of the war seems unacceptable to some  people at the present meeting, evidently, I ask the  representatives of all the parties that are present here and of  those that are not to present within five days' time specific  proposals in writing on the Karabakh question and the country's  withdrawal from the war. We will examine all of them in the  consultative council, and I will examine them as president also.    You should know that from day one of my work as chairman of  the Supreme Soviet through the present, I have devoted 80  percent of my working day--and you know, most likely, that my  working day is quite long--only to this question. There is no  other solution. I personally have sought and continue to seek  many paths. On a number of matters I have conferred with persons  in my circle, members of the Defense Council included. Meetings  and negotiations have been held here within the framework of  Russia's mediation mission for a settlement of the Karabakh  problem with Ambassador-at-Large Vladimir Kazimirov. As you  know, I have taken a number of steps. Some people will like  them, some, not, evidently. But all this--negotiations with the  leadership of Armenia and of some of our officials with the  leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh--represents steps dictated by  necessity. I have conducted negotiations with the leadership of  Russia, Turkey, and Iran and with representatives of the United  States and other countries. There is no need, I believe, for me  to tell you about all this. But I am trying and will continue to  take advantage of all opportunities. Perhaps you have greater  opportunities. Please, give us your proposals. We do not need  empty words, accusations, squabbles, or rows; we need to present  specific proposals.    Some of those who spoke here approved our successes in the  achievement of a cease-fire. I will continue to endeavor to  ensure, operating from these positions, that fire not be  resumed. This is my personal position, and I will continue to  work in this direction. But how far this activity will be  successful I do not know. You have seen to what casualties the  violation of the cease-fire agreement has led. I am taking  certain steps in this sphere also. I said in my speech on 2  November and I repeat now that I see a possibility of  Azerbaijan's escape from the state of war and a return of the  lands in peaceful fashion. If some people can assist in this  direction, let him make his suggestion. Those, on the other  hand, who think otherwise may present their proposals also.    At the same time, on the other hand, there is no doubt that  we must strengthen our defense capability. It has been observed  here that there have been many reasons for defeats. If the  absence of internal stability and the weakness of the  authorities may be cited among them, ineffective use has at the  same time been made of the time since the winning of  independence, and we have been unable to create an army capable  of defending Azerbaijan. Mention has been made here of mafia  groupings, instances of bribe-taking--all this has occurred. But  mafia groupings have penetrated in great depth the army  structure also. While blood was being spilled at the front,  individual people here were appropriating monetary resources. At  a time when people have been dying, losing their homes, and  becoming refugees, some people, taking advantage of the  situation, have been enriching themselves illegally. This is our  misfortune, our tragedy. This also is why an army has not been  created.    It is rumored--I touched on this yesterday in conversation  with Etibar Mamedov--that certain battalions had been illegally  disbanded, and this was the reason for a number of defeats. I am  accustomed to speaking frankly. These inventions are far from  the truth. Let us agree to be frank. Military matters are not  decided by one person. Each party has the opportunity to apply  to a state body in writing and to obtain a written response. But  we should not be writing in the newspapers that one battalion  did this, another battalion, the other, and so forth.    Yesterday I called in Etibar Mamedov's presence the chief of  the Main Staff and told him that eight battalions had, it is  said, been liquidated and that this was why we had been  defeated. I ascertained that this was not the case. This is the  information: Instead of the 400-500 men that a battalion should  have, there were 15-18. And it is called a battalion, and money  and provisions are issued for 400 men, and so forth. The  military cited for me monstrous facts. In some army units both  in the past and until recently, the commanders would five days  before the issue of pay give 70-80 percent of the fighters home  leave, appropriating their money for themselves. In addition,  they would extort bribes from them so that they might be given  home leave. When we revealed the truth, reporting this on  television, some people objected: You cannot talk about the army  this way. But what should we do? This is the truth, and without  disclosing this truth, there is be no result.    All this--the fact that an army has not been formed as yet,  that there have come to be negative elements in its ranks, that  individual mafia groupings deriving personal gain from  everything have begun to operate within the army (such,  incidentally, was the grouping of Alikram Gumbatov, although  many people spoke about him to me as a hero, yet he has done  such thievery in the region as to have grabbed an armed  unit)--is the most important reason for our defeats.    Our priority path is negotiations in various directions for  a  peaceful settlement of the problem. At the same time, on the  other hand, we need to organize the army at the proper level,  strengthen it, and form highly professional units so that  Azerbaijan might defend itself both today and tomorrow and in  five and 10 years' time. If Azerbaijan is an independent state,  it should know how to defend itself. Whoever, therefore, has  specific proposals on this issue and on the question of our  peace negotiations and on the use of other possibilities of the  state, let him say what paths he sees. Someone could, possibly,  do something besides this also--let him say, and I will only be  grateful.    In respect to the army: Let us reach agreement. It has been  said here that the army needs political leaders. Indeed, there  are 40 parties, and if each sends his representative, what would  be the result? In the past there was one--the Communist  Party--and each army subunit, from the platoon up, had a party  organization and a deputy commander for political matters. In  some instances other factors are employed, it is said. But it  seems to me that if we concentrate all forces and appeal for  assistance to the intelligentsia, religious figures, scientists,  and respected persons, and if they can operate in organized  fashion, performing the necessary work in the army units, and  can foster in the fighters ethical and moral qualities and  fortify their spirit and will--this will be both our political  and ideological work. But this work should be performed not  occasionally, but constantly and in organized fashion.    Other questions were broached also. I do not wish to dwell  on  them. We will work in the economic and other spheres. The  preparations for an important conference on problems of the  economy are under way at this time; it will be held on Friday,  evidently. It was rightly mentioned here that the decline in  production in both industry and agriculture has continued here  in recent years and that the manufactured product is being  squandered. We know that there is a big gap between exports and  imports. Not even 10 percent of the value of the exported  commodities has been returned to the republic in many sectors.  All this has been lost somewhere and appropriated by individual  persons. On the one hand, we are losing the republic's land; on  the other, certain persons are weakening our already limited  economic opportunities. We are dealing with these matters.    Some of those whose activity is connected with the economic  sphere spoke here. I would ask that the parties present  proposals on economic problems also. This would help us. We  would examine and avail ourselves of them. But I would not want  to start a wide-ranging discussion at this time.    I mentioned earlier that the main question is that of the  war. Summing up the discussion of the war, there are some things  that I would like to add. Let us agree: Let the newspapers stop  using the subject of the war as an instrument of struggle. If  this goes on, I shall avail myself of my powers to adopt the  necessary measures. Proposals have been expressed here  concerning the imposition in the republic of martial law or a  state of emergency and the suspension of the activity of parties  and newspapers. These proposals are well founded. I want to tell  you frankly that, as president, I am assessing these proposals  and thinking about this. But I would not want to resort to such  extreme measures. But if it is necessary, to save the people,  the republic, Azerbaijan, possibly, we will be forced to take  serious steps. It has rightly been observed here that any step  is justified in the name of the salvation of Azerbaijan.    I would like these questions to be tackled on the basis of  mutual accord, national solidarity, and civic unity. This would  attest to our high culture. It would show that we are really  committed to democratic principles. At the same time, if we see  that all is falling apart, we will then avail ourselves of any  means, and this will be justified. I therefore warn the  newspapers: The slander campaign against the president, the  president's staff, the state secretary, and other officials must  cease. Criticism and insults are not the same thing, this is the  first point. Second, the criticism itself must be fair.    Certain speeches today were connected with personnel policy.  We have still done nothing to respond. What sort of personnel  policy can there be if there have still been no serious  personnel transformations. There has long been such talk. At the  same time, on the other hand, bear in mind that personnel policy  is a most complex field. Many people have in this transitional  period lost their sense of ethics, unfortunately. Yes, some are  saying: Dismiss me; I will set up a commercial structure and  live better than before. And this is truly the case.    It has been said today that bribe-taking has now assumed the  greatest proportions. I disagree. I was in charge of this  republic for 14 years, and right from the start of my activity  through the last days, even when I left in 1982 to work in  Moscow, up to and including my retirement in 1982, I fought  against bribe-taking. How were people punished at that time?  They were dismissed and expelled from the party (this was a big  punishment at that time. There is now no Communist Party, and  party expulsion is no longer frightening). Yes, I resorted to  these measures. We punished by imprisonment also. But  subsequently those who had been caught taking bribes donned the  garb of "victims of the stagnation period" and came to occupy  the highest positions. Are these the realities of our life? Is  this our history of the past 20 years? I was a participant in  this history. I was merciless toward bribe-takers. Both the  person giving the bribe and the person taking it are criminally  liable. People give bribes because they are accustomed to doing  so. When I worked here, I was often told that some people,  giving bribes, believed that they were in this way establishing  a close relationship with those to whom they were being given.    When I retired, there was no one left by my side. Some  people  explained this by the fact that I was tied to no one. They said:  You were tied only to an ideology, and now it has fallen apart  also. Those who came after you were surrounded by people. Some  live in Moscow or elsewhere, but they have their entourage. But  I will never be bound by such ties. I am today also linked with  the people spiritually and will live with this moral philosophy.    Do not think that I should fight bribe-taking alone. You  must  all fight it. But let us investigate which political party is  fighting bribe-taking. Who is fighting the mafia groupings?  Sponsorship is currently in vogue. Everyone has a sponsor. How  are the newspapers published? When I worked in the Supreme  Soviet, there was no possibility of publishing the newspaper  AZERBAIJAN. The state had no money. But the newspaper  DZHUMKHURRIYET appears three times a week, things are even  better for the newspaper AZADLYG, and the newspaper MUSAVAT  comes out more often than AZERBAIJAN. Where are they getting the  money from? With what funds are they being published? Is it not  the funds of the mafia groupings? Or perhaps they inherited the  money with which they publish the newspapers?    Let us speak frankly. I have fought bribe-taking all my life  and will continue to do so. At that time, even if people of the  system, from my circle, were proving to be an obstacle, I would  fight alone. It has happened also that on five occasions I  dispatched a commission to look into the work of the first  secretary of a district party committee, and everything was  covered up. The sixth time I formed a commission that revealed  everything. This person was expelled from the party and  arrested. Then Vezirov came and extolled them all. And the  newspapers wrote that whereas the punitive measures in 1937-1938  had been carried out by Stalin and Bagirov, in the 1970's these  punitive measures had been carried out by Geydar Aliyev. What  punitive measures did I carry out? I was and will continue to be  merciless toward bribe-takers. I was and will continue to be  merciless toward thieves. I have never been nor will I ever be  guided by personal interests. But you also should be the same.  The whole people should be the same. Everyone is now saying:  "Bribe-taking has the world in thrall." Very well, why do those  who say this not grab the bribe-taker by the hand? If he  subsequently does not incur punishment, we who are closing our  eyes to this may then be held to account.    I agree entirely that not only now but yesterday, 10, 20  years ago, our morals were damaged by bribe-taking. And this  phenomenon is progressing from year to year. On account of a  lack of discipline, on account of the fact that bribe-taking is  widespread in the law enforcement authorities themselves, and  its dimensions are spreading constantly, and we are duty-bound  to fight it. Everyone must fight this, and each in his own  sphere. If the political parties have ideas on this question and  have specific considerations or information on actual instances  of bribe-taking, we are prepared to use them.    Leave aside personnel policy. Mistakes may be made in  personnel policy. We have not yet begun personnel policy. People  are talking about Geydar Aliyev's circle. Who is in my circle?  Just two or three persons. And I believe that they are serving  the people loyally. Public opinion should not be shaped by  spreading various rumors.    A proposal concerning the creation of a higher military  inspectorate was made here. I believe that this is a workable  proposal. We could implement it.    I hope that our present meeting will initiate all subsequent  work. We will in the very near future adopt decisions on the  proposals that have been expressed here--on the consultative  council and the rest. I ask the political parties once again to  present within five days' time their proposals for what can be  done both in respect to negotiations and in the sphere of  military organizational development. I express my gratitude in  advance.    I believe that we have had a productive discussion. If you  have no objections and if you show an interest, I intend to  continue our meetings. I hope that they will be useful.    I thank everyone once again for their proposals and  opinions,  and I hope that today's meeting will become a factor laying the  foundation of civil unity and civil solidarity in Azerbaijan. Au  revoir.</p>

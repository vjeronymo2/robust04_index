			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / China debates how to control boom: Beijing sees high growth rates and investment as mixed blessings CHINA'S announcement this week that it was cracking down on the spread of economic development zones is perhaps the clearest sign yet that the leadership has resolved to restrain some of the country's wilder entrepreneurial impulses. But judging by the continuing debate in the Chinese press about the dangers of economic overheating - scarcely a day passes without reference to the problem - the leadership is far from a consensus on measures to cope with China's booming economy, which registered double-digit growth last year. Discussions on the subject among China's leaders appear to have been lively, with reformists such as Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier in charge of the economy, being accused by conservatives of possessing of a 'Great Leap Forward mentality'. This refers to China's disastrous attempt in the late 1950s to modernise its economy overnight. In a speech reported this week, Zhu answered critics - and at same time sought to reassure foreign investors who remain the key to China's modernisation drive - by saying that the government was not about to change course. Among conservatives such as Li Peng, the prime minister, there is a feeling, according to western economists, that the Chinese economy may have moved beyond Beijing's ability to control it, without drastic measures that may themselves bring chaos. The growing independence of powerful economic regions, such as Guangdong province in the south, is not the least of the constraints on the central government's ability to curb activity. The government's decision to freeze economic development zones, which enjoy special privileges such as tax breaks, came in response to growing criticism that it had lost control of licensing arrangements; and furthermore that thousands of hectares of invaluable agricultural land were being commandeered by those involved. According to the English-language Business Weekly these zones had grown from 117 officially approved at the end of 1991 to some 2,000 - and possibly many more - by the end of 1992. 'The State Council (cabinet) has announced it will recommend imposing tighter controls over new economic development zones in order to curb what has become a blind capital construction craze, ' the paper said. Burgeoning demand for building materials prompted a surge in prices last year. Steel prices rose by some 15 per cent and cement by 14 per cent, fuelled by the nationwide construction boom that saw imports of iron and steel rise to 6m tonnes - double the figure for 1991. Debate within the leadership about the mixed blessings of high growth rates is almost certainly being sharpened by preparations for the forthcoming National People's Congress, or parliamentary session, due in March, at which economic targets will be unveiled for the coming year; not that planned growth targets have counted for much in the past year or so. China's real GNP grew by about 12 per cent in 1992, exceeding both the planned 6 per cent and the 9 per cent average of the past 13 years. Industrial output grew by nearly 20 per cent. Chinese leaders, including both the cautious Li and Zhu, the reformer, have been talking of the need for 'macro' steps to cool the economy, but neither has been very specific about measures that might be adopted. Towards the end of last year, it seemed that China was heading towards more severe credit curbs - a first round of restrictions were issued last July - but more recent signals from China's central bank governor indicated that Beijing was not planning to embark on a tight monetary policy, for the time being. 'The projected bank loans for this year are more than those of last year, so by no means will we implement a tight monetary policy,' said Li Baoyuan, head of the People's Bank. Li added that credit growth planned for this year was 'proper and can back the economy to continue developing in a rapid and sound manner'. That may be so, but figures for 1992 reveal the real dimensions of the challenge facing the central authorities in their efforts to pace the economy in the face of an astonishing surge in new investment. Fixed asset investment grew by about 30 per cent, bank lending increased by around double the planned figure, money in circulation doubled, and the broader measure of money supply (M2) charged ahead by 28 per cent. Infrastructure deficiencies in the power and transport sector may in the end prove the most effective break on frenzied development. In the meantime, western economists are fairly sanguine about China's ability to cope in the short-term with its extraordinary growth cycle while resisting a resurgence of inflation. The national living costs price index rose a relatively modest 6. 2 per cent last year, although the rate was much higher, perhaps around 15 per cent, in the larger coastal cities such as Guangzhou, Tianjin and Shanghai, which have been the main centres of economic activity. However, 'they are in waters no-one has ever swum in before', said one economist. 'The International Monetary Fund doesn't know what China should do. China has gone further in reforming a centrally planned economy than anyone has before, and this has taken enormous economic and political courage.'</p>

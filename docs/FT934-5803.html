			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: All Poles together - Radio Radio 3 is running a Polish season over three weeks, to mark the 60th birthdays of Penderecki and Gorecki, and the 75th aninversary of the end in 1918 of Poland's partition. Mostly it is about Polish music and musicians, not for me to assess; but there are other features on Polish theatre and current social life. On Saturday there was an interesting talk on the theatre. In this country we may think of Polish theatre in the light of Grotowski and Kantor, well received by critics, less so by the public. Their work was a kind of dramatic emotion, but it expressed no overt politics, so the Communists gave it no ban - and no subsidy. The outstanding house was the Stary in Krakow, playing classics to both public and government approval, as it still does, with occasional foreign works. But Poland has 65 state theatres, with inadequate subsidy and inadequate audiences. There is room for action. Appropriately, the Sunday play was Slavomir Mrozek's Slaughterhouse, translated by Ralph Manheim, a horrid satire where it is proposed that the hold that art has on the public might be replaced by killing. The violinist hero (Nigel Anthony) is responsible; he accidentally brings to life a bust of Paganini, and the new live Paganini becomes a virtuoso butcher, his earlier desire. Butchery replaces music in the public mind; at the climax, the butcher hero, as he now is, is billed to perform on the Philharmonic platform a concerto for two bulls. The theme is valid indeed, the public subjection to fashionable beliefs. Mrozek gives too little to his sub-themes, the selfish love of the violinist's mother (Patricia Routledge) or the violinist's weakness for a friendly girl flautist (Emily Richard). The hero does not appear for his bull-concerto, possibly for one of those causes, but the performance is not cancelled; the Philharmonic President calls for a substitute from the house. But the play cunningly ends before he gets a reply. Some good short programmes illustrated Polish life and times. The political change has made little difference - 'we are social democrats' - but the press is freer. Table Talk dealt with the delights of the Polish kitchen, the accent (as throughout the week) being on Krakow rather than Warsaw. In Snapshots, presenter Bogdan Frymorgan told of the 'cavalry', the underground Bohemians of the 1980s who now direct their liberty to the TV. He gave an interesting talk too about the Wielieczka salt-mines that contain a 17th-century chapel and a basketball-pitch. Yesterday Wlodek Lesiecki gave a talk-cum-concert of traditional Polish music, as enjoyable as it was interesting, and far more up my street than Time and Silence, the first of Brian Morton's six - six] - pieces on Polish jazz. There was little of this until about 1956, just when I think jazz began to die. Since we have strayed into jazz, on Tuesday Radio 2 gave a programme on Lorenz Hart, to my mind the best popular lyric-writer ever, and this I had to hear. It was dramatised, with David Suchet as the gay, drinking, unreliable Hart and Jack Klaff as the composer Richard Rodgers, to whom Hart had to explain internal rhymes and feminine endings, before putting them so cleverly into his songs. Lorelei King sang - 'My heart stood still', 'Mountain greenery', 'Manhattan' and more, not a dud among them.</p>

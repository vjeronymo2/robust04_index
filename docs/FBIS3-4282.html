Chief responsible persons of various  organizations directly under the provincial authorities, army  units, institutes of tertiary education, and scientific research  institutes gathered here to hear provincial party committee  Secretary Wang Maolin's report on changing concepts under the  condition of the socialist market economy. The year 1994 is a  crucial one in quickening the pace in building the socialist  market economic structure as well as one in which the greatest  number of reform measures are to be presented. To help the broad  cadres have a clear picture of the role of various reform  measures in building the socialist market economic structure,  the provincial propaganda department, and work committees of  organizations directly under the provincial authorities decided  to sponsor a series of report meetings on deepening reform and  quickening the pace in building the socialist market economic  structure. The first report would be made by provincial party  committee Secretary Wang Maolin.    Wang Maolin's report made yesterday had three parts: First,  to realize renovation of concepts and make a leap in thinking is  the objective requirement of building the socialist market  economic structure; second, to outline several major aspects in  changing concepts and making a leap in thinking; and third, how  to realize this change in concepts and make a leap in thinking.

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ocean disposes of non-UK bulk liquid storage operation OCEAN GROUP, the freight, environmental and marine services conglomerate, has sold the non-UK activities, or some 80 per cent, of its bulk liquid storage company for Pounds 55m including debt. Panocean Storage &amp; Transport, the sold business, has operations in the Netherlands, Belgium and the US. In 1992 it made operating profits of about Pounds 5m (Pounds 5.7m) and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.1m. Shares in Ocean rose 10p to 296p yesterday. The buyer is Royal Pakhoed, one of the biggest storage groups in Rotterdam, the world's largest port. The consideration is expected to be about Pounds 41m and Pakhoed is also assuming some Pounds 14m of debt. At December 31 the businesses had a net asset value of about Pounds 51m. Mr Nicholas Barber, Ocean's chief executive, said that the sale would reduce his company's gearing by 20 points to about 17 per cent and would result in a book loss of about Pounds 16m. He said that in profit terms Panocean 'had kept its nose clean', but that there had been a low cash return on the assets. 'We took a hard-nosed view of a business not able to deliver the results we required,' he added. Ocean has retained Panocean's UK business, which has operations on Merseyside and Humberside and, at December 31, a net asset value of about Pounds 7m. Pakhoed said the acquisition would boost its total worldwide storage capacity by about 20 per cent and would give it a foothold in a new business, the storage of edible oils and fats. Besides chemicals and mineral oils, Pakhoed is already active in the storage, transport and distribution of fruit and forest products. Pakhoed said it expected the Panocean operations to make more than 1992's Pounds 3.1m when under its control, partly because of lower interest and overhead costs. Mr Barber said he expected the recommended final dividend for 1992 to be maintained at 9.62p to hold the total at 14.33p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Konovalov report: "Growth of Private Farming </F> Stops"]    [Text] An alarming trend has recently been noted in  Russia's private farming movement: The growth in number of  private farms has come to a halt and a noticeable exodus of  private farmers has begun in a number of regions. There have  been hundreds of announcements by private farms in the Far East  and Russia's south that they are ceasing their activities.    However, it would be a mistake to regard these facts as  evidence that private farming in Russia has no future, as  supporters of collective farming were quick to do. If you look  more carefully at the statistics, you can see that even in  regions where the reduction in the numbers of private farmers is  most significant, reaching 3-4 percent, there is at the same  time an increase in the area of land used by private farmers.  Private peasant farms are being enlarged, land is being  redistributed, and economic management of private farms is being  optimized.    This process is absolutely natural and to be expected. More  than a year ago Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun forecast in  this newspaper an imminent slowdown in what was at that time  rapid growth of private farming as the potential for such growth  is limited, and forecast the optimization of private farming's  share in the rural economy for a protracted period. On the  other hand, the development of private farming through the  reform of collective farms, turning them into joint-stock and  cooperative farms, as is happening at present, should have  proceeded much more intensively.    But individual, family farms in the hands of private farmers  are also proving their viability. They have approximately a  5-percent share of agricultural land today. But according to  what are for the moment preliminary figures for last year's  results, private farmers' production of basic types of  agricultural output was significantly higher than 5 percent.  Private farmers sold more than 2 million tonnes of grain alone  to state resources while the state purchased in all about 26  million tonnes.    Nevertheless, problems in the private farming sector have  gotten more acute recently, as, incidentally, they have in the  agricultural sector as a whole. This is first and foremost  linked to the financial situation. In the opinion of Vladimir  Bashmachnikov, chairman of the Association of Russian Peasant  (Private) Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives [AKKOR], the  fairly massive exodus of peasants from private farming is due to  the fact that a "financial bottleneck" arose at the end of last  year: The state dragged its feet paying for output which had  already been delivered, and the banks harshly demanded the  return of credits. Many peasant farms found themselves on the  verge of bankruptcy and ruin.    According to Bashmachnikov, the situation has changed today.  Some of the state debts have been paid off and credits have been  extended, although at high interest rates. A search is under  way to find sensible types of relations between private farmers  and banking structures.</p>

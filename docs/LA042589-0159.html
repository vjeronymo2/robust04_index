			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PENNSYLVANIA'S LOTTERY REACHES $100 MILLION  </P> <P> Pennsylvania's Super 7 lottery jackpot hit $100 million today, and the frenzy  over a North American record was getting to be a little too much for some state  residents.  </P> <P> It's not the money they mind. It's the out-of-staters.  </P> <P> "Go home, Marylanders!" one man shouted out his car window as he drove by the  Case &amp; Keg in Shrewsbury, just across the border from Maryland, where about  200 people waited in line to buy $1 tickets.  </P> <P> The scene was repeated across the state as long lines and traffic jams formed  around ticket outlets ahead of Wednesday's drawing.  </P> <P> At Philadelphia International Airport, the ticket line was 30 deep at  lunchtime.  </P> <P> TWA pilot Bob Link flew from his home in Columbus, Ohio, to Greater Pittsburgh  International Airport to buy $25 worth of tickets for himself and $86 worth for  friends and relatives.  </P></p>

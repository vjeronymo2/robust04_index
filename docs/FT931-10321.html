			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs uneasy at Portillo's review TORY BACKBENCHERS yes-terday argued for keeping large areas of the welfare state out of the government's strategic review of public spending priorities, as Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, outlined his plans in the Commons. In the Commons, Tory backbench concerns focused principally on the National Health Service and pensions. However, Tory MPs were privately voicing fears that the review would not achieve its aim of reassuring the markets. More than one commented that the government seemed to have no appetite for taking radical decisions, and that no crackdown on spending that was likely to be approved by the Commons would have enough impact on public borrowing. 'It's more than window-dressing, and it's essential but it won't get us out of the deficit problem. The only ways out of that are inflationary growth and extending the VAT base,' one backbencher said gloomily. The public warnings to Mr Portillo began with a contribution from Mr James Couchman, the Tory MP for Gillingham, who said the provision of healthcare free at the point of delivery was cherished by rich and poor alike. 'Any erosion of that principle would be resented very deeply throughout the country,' Mr Couchman cautioned. On pensions, Sir Anthony Grant, Conservative MP for Cambridgeshire South West, urged Mr Portillo to bear in mind that an increasing number of elderly people had based the last years of their lives on present figures. 'They are not in a position to make drastic changes at this stage of their life, and they don't expect to be let down,' Sir Anthony said. Labour's bitter opposition to the review was signalled by Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary. She condemned it as a 'panic response' to the government's economic mismanagement. 'It would be wholly wrong if the British people, already suffering in this recession, ended up paying the price in worse policing, worse schools and worse healthcare, and in lost pensions and lost benefit,' she said. The prospect of alliances between Labour and some Tories has already been enough to blunt the cutting edge of last year's spending round, and some Tories believe the government's 21-seat majority will undermine the confidence which yesterday's statement that the government would tackle public spending was intended to create. 'They'll be tougher about spending for four years hence than they will for next year,' said one former minister. The only way to achieve spending cuts, according to one MP, was for the Treasury simply to present a stark choice: 'Ministers will have to give people the choice between cuts and income tax rises,' he said.</p>

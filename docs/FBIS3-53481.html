He said that 3,931 sentences  were passed and implemented.    This came in a statement the interior minister made to a  meeting of the Consultative Council's Arab, Foreign Affairs, and  National Security Committee this evening. Consultative Council  Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi chaired the meeting. [passage  omitted]    Al-Alfi said that a firm stand against terrorism comprises a  basic part of the Interior Ministry's security plan without  ignoring its overall security duties. He said the ministry's  security plan stresses a decisive confrontation with terrorism  to safeguard stability and the citizens' security while at the  same time raising the standard of services to the public and  remedying negative conditions in the country's prisons.  [passage omitted]    The interior minister said that the current confrontation is  based on the security forces always taking the initiative in  striking effective and repeated blows against dangerous groups  while ensuring that all legal standards are observed. He  explained that there is no alternative to a firm and  comprehensive confrontation with terrorists because any other  course would mean compromising the homeland's future and destiny.    He pointed out that the initiative shown by the security  forces has put a decisive end to the exploitation of the mosques  in Asyut for the propagation of extremist ideas and helped to  uncover the plan to assassinate the prime minister and to  apprehend the terrorist group in Shubra al-Khaymah that had been  instructed to carry out a series of assassinations and other  terrorist acts. [passage omitted]    The interior minister revealed the existence of bilateral  agreements to extradite terrorists, noting that several of them  have been extradited from abroad and several others will be  extradited shortly. He said this is being done with the help of  other government departments.    Concerning the disappearance of former Libyan foreign  minister Mansur al-Kikhya, the interior minister said: We have  not uncovered the facts of the case yet. We cannot say anything  if we are not sure of it.    He said he is totally opposed to indiscriminate arrests and  that only the actual culprit must be punished. Adding that he  will not hesitate to question and punish anyone who makes a  mistake, he said daily inspections must be made in all  governorates and central police stations to maintain proper  performance standards and ensure that members of the public  brought to police stations are well treated.

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WITH GRAF, IT'S CASE OF BEST GETTING BETTER  </P> <P> Steffi Graf is preposterous. The rest of women's tennis can only gape at her  massive, injurious strokes and accomplishments, one Grand Slam won and another  already being discussed.  </P> <P> There have been various suggestions as to how to cure her dominance at the  Virginia Slims of Washington, Carling Bassett Seguso intimating Graf should  join the men's tour, and a spectator putting forth the notion she should play  left-handed.  </P> <P> Prayer is always nice.  </P> <P> Or they can wait for those rare occasions when she runs a temperature. She  rules the game for a 72-3 record last season, seeming impossible to duplicate  until she opened 1989 with a laughably easy defense of the Australian Open for  her fifth consecutive Grand Slam title.  </P> <P> "She's alone," CBS analyst Mary Carillo said. "Anybody who might be in her way  is too nauseous. That's what she's done to them."  </P> <P> Graf, at 19, is getting better. "She's just a kid, she still needs another two  years," her coach, Pavel Slozil, said. "Then they're going to be in even bigger  trouble."  </P> <P> They are already in a state of emergency. Chris Evert is merely fodder for  Graf's lethal groundstrokes.  </P> <P> Even Martina Navratilova now seems overwhelmed by the teen-age insurgent.  Gabriela Sabatini and Pam Shriver have the most recent victories against her --  when she was sick.  </P> <P> Evert has said the only thing that can stop her is "boredom." Players are  laboring in the weight room and on the practice court, trying to catch up.  </P> <P> "She's beating everyone quite badly," said Manuela Maleeva, the third seed who  at No. 7 is the highest-ranked player other than Graf in the Slims of  Washington field. "The motivation is, to not to be one of these that loses to  her so easy. To stay with her a little."  </P> <P> Bassett Seguso, flicked from the sleeve of Graf by 6-0, 6-0 last week,  predicted: "No one will beat her this year." Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet  Union, the No. 8 player in the world, is on course to meet Graf in the  semifinals, but is frank in assessing her chances. "I am not ready to beat  her," she said. "Every person is not 100 percent, so maybe she has a weakness.  But I don't know what it is."  </P> <P> One would think this dearth of threatening opponents would indeed bore Graf.  But it has not slowed her at all, and that perhaps is the key to this  phenomenon, that she is one of the most ambitious players to ever play the  game. "If I didn't have goals, it wouldn't be interesting," she said. "I try to  please myself."  </P> <P> Both baseliners and serve-and-volleyers have been equally unavailing against a  rounded game that displays no evident vulnerability. Only the three defeats in  the last year show it can be done: Sabatini upset her at the Virginia Slims of  Florida, 2-6, 6-3, 6-1, when Graf suffered from jetlag; and again more  convincingly at Amelia Island on clay, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.  </P> <P> Graf protests, "You can always lose, it's always a possibility." But this is  because she is human. Sabatini's deep, heavy topsin does seem to bother Graf,  mainly because it forces her 10 feet further from the baseline, and there her  shots lack some of their usual power. Or a sharp serve-and-volleyer on a good  day, while Graf has a bad one, will make her vulnerable. Shriver's semifinal  victory at the Virginia Slims Championships in November was gallant, 6-3, 7-6  (7-5), but Graf had a head cold.  </P> <P> In searching for a technical weakness in Graf, one can only nitpick. Her  forehand is not a perfect illustration; she makes contact with the ball  somewhat late, almost parallel to her body. While it might be preferable to  meet the ball earlier, her physical strength is such that it doesn't matter,  and in her case might be an asset because it makes her stroke harder to read.  </P> <P> "Her technique is not textbook," said Barbara Potter, the 12th-ranked player  who is regarded as a student of the game. "But neither was John McEnroe's serve  or Bjorn Borg's forehand."  </P> <P> It has often been said that Graf's backhand is a weaker shot, slightly less  reliable than the forehand. But in the last year she has developed the ability  to hit either a consistent hard slice or crushing topspin, and now that remark  evokes gales of laughter from analysts. "Compared to what?" Carillo said. "Her  forehand? Yeah, it's not her forehand. Because nothing is her forehand."  </P> <P> Mainly opponents must contend with Graf's furious pace. At 5 feet 9 and 132  pounds, she is among the hardest hitters the game has ever produced; harder  than Navratilova, some suggest. Only Sabatini, Helena Sukova and Claudia  Kohde-Kilsch can match her on some strokes, but not consistently. In response  Sabatini has tried to build up, adding strength to her shoulders. But this  could limit her flexibility and mobility.  </P> <P> "There's a difference between strength and power," Carillo said. "Sabatini can  lift a couch. Steffi can throw the couch across the room. That's the  difference."  </P> <P> There is one phase in which the other women players cannot hope to approach  equality with Graf, and that is her pure instinct for the game. Her movements  are almost as biomechanically correct, with an anticipation that Potter  estimates begins as soon as the ball is eight feet from the strings of her  opponent's racket.  </P> <P> It starts in her quick firing legs, which have not the slightest bit of fat.  She has an inexhaustible energy level for practice and training, "She's almost  antsy," Potter said. Partly this comes from a discipline that is found nowhere  else on the women's tour. She doesn't indulge in nightlife and likes to be in  her room by 9 p.m.  </P> <P> "There is something special inside her, she's doing it for herself," Slozil  said. "She needs tennis. Her body needs to run."  </P> <P> It is widely acknowledged that Navratilova is the only player with the physical  prowess and discipline to defeat Graf consistently. But the former No. 1 player  in the world has made just one final in the last five Grand Slam events, and  that was a defeat to Graf, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1.  </P> <P> Quite apart from Graf's physical attributes, she is beginning to exert an  intangible mental block on other players. Potter thinks a common mistake her  opponents make to try to hit shots they can't make, "to search for a game they  don't have."  </P> <P> There have been extended periods of domination before, by Evert in 1974 when  she won 55 consecutive matches, and Navratilova in 1984, when she went on a  74-match streak without a loss, a record that still stands. But while those  were lengthier reigns than Graf's 46 straight match victories last season,  consider Graf lost just two sets in sweeping the Australian and French opens,  Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year and the Australian last month.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member </F> Samir Ghawshah, in Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, on 7  February; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, let us begin this dialogue  by trying to clarify the status of the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations that seek to implement the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles. Where do the talks stand? What  points have been agreed upon?    [Ghawshah] Doubtless, agreement has been reached on numerous  points but we have not yet received an Israeli response to  several others. At the Davos meeting, several points were  raised to which Israeli Foreign Minister Peres gave no answer.  He said he wished to consult with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin  and would return with a response. We are awaiting the Israeli  reply to see how much momentum it would impart to the  negotiations. Failing this, we will stay in the vicious circle  in which Israel wants the negotiations to revolve. This is the  result of Israel's hardline attitude and intransigence.    [Al-Jundi] Do you believe the meeting with the Israeli  foreign minister in Cairo today will lay the foundations to  implement the Declaration of Principles?    [Ghawshah] If Israel shows a positive attitude, this will  remove many hurdles and make it possible to reach agreement  within days. If Israel maintains a hardline position, the  vicious circle will persist.    [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, observers ask that if all these  problems have occurred in the initial stages of implementing the  Declaration of Principles, what will happen when many other  complicated problems, now postponed, are tackled? Does the  pessimistic outlook that keeps emerging also affect the PLO  leaders?    [Ghawshah] The Israeli positions raise eyebrows, especially  as the Palestinians have shown much flexibility and made many  concessions. Instead of responding favorably, Israel has  persisted with its hardline attitudes. We believe that the  Palestinians are more flexible and more committed to  implementing the agreement on the specified dates.    [Al-Jundi] There is, doubtless, a great difference between  flexibility and making concessions, is there not?    [Ghawshah] As I have said, we, the Palestinians, have shown  much flexibility. We made concessions sometimes to surmount the  obstacles barring the implementation of the agreement. The  Israelis, in return, adopted a hardline position and are still  making proposals that are not close to the agreement's text and  do not show a real commitment to implement it on the specified  dates.    [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin  often discusses security. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  announces that no concessions can be made on security. Do the  Israelis realize that security is also a Palestinian concern?    [Ghawshah] We have approached the security issue as such.  But the other side exaggerates the issue and claims that some  issues are security affairs when they're not. We think that  continuing Israeli intransigence and stubbornness on some  positions will not achieve security, but constitute a future  threat to it.    [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat  will arrive in Cairo tomorrow and meet President Muhammad Husni  Mubarak. Can we say that this a sign that 'Arafat will not meet  Peres or will only come to Cairo after the Palestinian  delegation has conducted lengthy discussions with the Israeli  foreign minister and possibly reached real results that merely  need a signature?    [Ghawshah] Brother Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat] visit to  Cairo and his meeting with President Mubarak will deal with  bilateral ties. This is important to the Palestinians. They  will also consult on numerous issues. We cannot link the date  of this visit with Peres' visit. As for 'Arafat's meeting with  Peres, or possibly with Rabin or others, this will depend on the  progress in the negotiations and on Israel's willingness to  overcome the hurdles and reach an agreement.    [Al-Jundi] Can we say that 'Arafat's failure to come to meet  Peres in Cairo today is a Palestinian message indicating that  'Arafat's talks with the Israeli foreign minister are futile?    [Ghawshah] We cannot say that. But we do not think it is  necessary for 'Arafat to meet Peres in all the ongoing meetings.  Remember, the basic meetings are between the delegations and the  members of the Liaison Committee. Although the need  occasionally arises for a meeting between President 'Arafat and  an Israeli delegation headed by Peres, we basically believe that  President 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin should hold a  meeting. Its purpose would be to reach a final agreement and  sign it.    [Al-Jundi] We thank our guest Dr. Samir Ghawshah, a member  of  the PLO Executive Committee. You are always welcome. Thank you.    [Ghawshah] Do not mention it.</p>

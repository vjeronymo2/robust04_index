			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market falters but holds above 2,700 AN increasingly tired equity market managed to close above the 2,700 level on the FT-SE 100 Index but not without a considerable struggle. Ending the day 9.9 lower at 2,702.0, the Footsie stocks attracted just enough support very late in the day to drag the index up from the day's low of 2,697.8, reached just after a weak opening by Wall Street. The market was looking extremely uncertain at the close, with leading traders said to be increasingly worried about the short-term outlook for Wall Street. The US market had been hoping for a cut in discount rate. There was very little excitement in the market at the outset, with no evidence of any of the much-rumoured number of so-called 'mega deals'. And there were wry smiles around the dealing desks at the absence of the Kuwait Investment Office/BP/Hanson deal widely rumoured to have been in the pipeline. BP lost ground yesterday, with turnover failing to reach 4m shares. The buying of BP on Wednesday was described by one old hand in the market as 'low quality'. Fund managers paid only minor heed to the latest batch of economic news, which included money supply figures and bank and building society lending for April. Economists apparently took a second look at the sharp increase in the bank lending figure but they were not unduly troubled by the money supply data. Lingering fears remained that a sizeable rights issue may be in the offing. However, traders said the Friday before a bank holiday was not the ideal day for a big issue. Much of the early trading was taken up by company news items. An early slide by BT shares, after the group revealed its first annual reduction in profits, was arrested and then reversed as telecoms specialists came away reassured from the post-figures meeting with the company. A number of previously bearish analysts were said to have adopted a much more positive stance on the shares. Combined turnover in BT 'old' and 'new' was easily the heaviest in the market. Banks remained in the limelight, with European Commission clearance of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's bid for Midland Bank the trigger for more buying of Midland shares. Insurer Prudential was the best individual performer in the Footsie, responding to rather unlikely takeover stories involving Lloyds Bank. Standard Chartered shares, on the other hand, were given a rough ride by the market after news that losses in securities trading by its Bombay branch have prompted Standard to make a Pounds 50m provision. Turnover in equities just managed to top the 500m mark, reaching 505.7m shares. Dealers were said to be slightly surprised that customer business on Wednesday had easily exceeded Pounds 1bn, amounting to Pounds 1.2bn. Much of yesterday's activity, however, was made up of non-Footsie stocks, indicating, dealers said, that the big institutions were not heavily involved in the day's business. Food retailing was one of the worst performing sectors, after the re-emergence of stories that a price war between the big supermarket groups is on the horizon.</p>

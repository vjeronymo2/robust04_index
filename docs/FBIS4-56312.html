			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The latest CID [Multispecialty Development  Counselors]-Gallup poll indicates that the majority of votes in  the upcoming presidential election will be split between Ernesto  Perez Balladares of the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] and  Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement. If the presidential  election had been held between 25 and 29 April, 30 percent of  Panamanian voters would have voted for Perez Balladares, 26  percent for Ruben Blades, 17 percent for Mireya Moscoso de  Gruber, 14 percent for Ruben Carles, 2 percent for Eddy  Vallarino, 1 percent for Samuel Lewis Galindo, 1 percent for  Jose Salvador Munoz, and 9 percent were undecided or preferred  not to answer.    These results were based on 1,200 interviews. In the report,  the CID-Gallup pollsters noted that, bearing in mind the rapid  increase in support for Ruben Blades, they were unable to  predict one week before the elections whether Ruben Blades or  Perez Balladares would win. According to the polling firm,  Perez Balladares' lead is larger than the 3-percent margin of  error, but only slightly.    In the latest CID-Gallup poll, one's attention is drawn to  the difference in the support by region of the country for both  Perez Balladares and Ruben Blades. In the survey, Perez  Balladares had a support rating of 31 percent in the  metropolitan area and 29 percent in the rest of the country for  a total of 30 percent. Ruben Blades, meanwhile, had 33 percent  in the metropolitan area and 18 percent in the rest of the  country for a total of 26 percent. Blades has a 2-percent lead  over Perez Balladares in the metropolitan area, while Perez  Balladares has an 11-percent lead over Blades in the rest of the  country. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the number of votes for  each region, Perez Balladares has a 4-point lead over Blades at  the nationwide level. The margin of error is 3 percent.    In the trends section of the report, CID-Gallup indicates  that in the March-April period, Perez Balladares registered a  slight 3-percent drop, while Blades registered a 14-percent  increase. CID- Gallup comments that if this trend continues,  singer Ruben Blades could end up the winner.    CID-Gallup ends its report by stating: We oppose the  restrictions imposed by electoral tribunals on conducting polls  and releasing their results just prior to Election Day, as is  the case in Panama. According to CID-Gallup, it is clear that  the situation could change in the final week before the  elections, and it will be impossible to report the trends during  this final week to the public.</p>

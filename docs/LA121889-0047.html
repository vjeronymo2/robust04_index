			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLAUS GOES OFF THE DEEP END IN DIVING TRADITION  </P> <P> Nancy Keyes met Santa Claus this week -- on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> But when the 28-year-old Anaheim diver swam up to claim her Christmas present,  Santa didn't give her anything from his soggy bag of goodies.  </P> <P> "He said my hands were too full," Keyes, a computer instructor, lamented  afterward. "I had a camera in one hand and I was trying to take pictures of  him."  </P> <P> Keyes was participating in one of Southern California's more unusual Yuletide  celebrations. She accompanied a diving expedition of 24 people Saturday who  erected a Christmas tree and received gifts from a diving Santa in the chilly  waters off Santa Catalina Island.  </P> <P> The so-called Santa Claus Dive has been an annual ritual of the Los Angeles  chapter of the Underwater Photographic Society for much of the chapter's  32-year history. The little-known tradition is also observed by a handful of  other Southland scuba clubs and shops.  </P> <P> "To us it's pretty normal, but every time we tell someone else they think it's  abnormal," said Mark Dell'Aquila, 27, of Manhattan Beach, president of the  underwater club's local chapter.  </P> <P> "This is just a nice, calm way to celebrate Christmas, unlike going to the  malls," added Susan Hamusek, 45, a first-time Christmas diver from Lynwood.  </P> <P> Embarking from San Pedro in the 78-foot dive boat Charisma, veterans of past  Christmas dives swapped stories.  </P> <P> "Last year we were pushing the Christmas tree through the kelp beds and people  passing in other dive boats just looked at us like 'What are you doing?' " said  Mary Wicksten, a marine biology professor who travels for the dives from her  home in Texas. "But that was nothing compared to the way the fish were looking  at the tree. Apparently, the fish thought we were crazy too."  </P> <P> With the Charisma anchored in 30 feet of aquamarine water in the Isthmus Cove  off northeastern Catalina, the divers assembled a collapsible tree, lowered it  into the sea and swam it in place on the bottom.  </P> <P> Dell'Aquila suited up as Santa Claus, strapping on a beard and squeezing a  Santa costume over his diving suit. Then he held his nose and jumped  boots-first into the 60-degree water.  </P> <P> Perched underwater next to the tree, he handed out gifts -- liquor bottles  wrapped in foil, for the most part -- and posed for pictures. Orange-colored  garibaldis, California's protected state fish, darted in and out of beds of  yellow kelp.  </P> <P> Back topside, Dell'Aquila was roundly praised as he squirmed out of the Santa  suit and the tree was disassembled until next year.  </P> <P> "He was a good Santa Claus," allowed Cory Gray, a Culver City engineer and club  membership chairman.  </P></p>

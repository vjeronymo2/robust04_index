			<p>BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Deputies of the  Georgian Parliament resumed today their examination of the  package of Georgian-Abkhaz documents signed in Moscow. The  session of the country's supreme legislative body was held in an  atmosphere of heated debate and demonstrated radically different  approaches to this problem.    A number of members of opposition parties and factions gave  a  sharply negative assessment of the latest Georgian-Abkhaz  document, putting emphasis on a clause relating to the  restricted return of the refugees to their original places of  residence, which is conditional on their nonparticipation in  hostilities and nonmembership of military formations ready to  enter the territory of Abkhazia.    In the opinion of the opposition, this, being a disguised  method of "filtering out" the deported people, is incompatible  with the Georgian side's position. Some radically-minded  parliamentarians even raised the issue of no confidence in the  Georgian head of state and his personal representative at the  Moscow talks, Aleksandr Kavsadze, who had signed the  controversial package of documents on behalf of Georgia.    A large proportion of members of the parliamentary majority  welcomed the signing of the Georgian-Abkhaz quadrilateral  agreement. They believe that this step was necessary in the  current situation. They see it as the only chance to allow the  return of the refugees to their homeland and to influence the UN  Security Council to take a decision to deploy peacekeeping  forces in the conflict zone.</p>

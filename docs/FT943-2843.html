			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Substantial increase seen in European equity market trading Trading in the European equity markets increased substantially in August, after four months of decline, in a delayed response to rising share prices as most market indices advanced for the second successive month. Volumes were up by 10.7 per cent from July, having dropped by 17.9 per cent in July. Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities, which compiles the figures, notes that all the market indices were higher apart from France, Spain and Italy, and these three markets were also the worst performers in August in volume terms. 'International investors continued to take their holidays more seriously than local investors,' Mr Cornish adds. 'Although there were individual market exceptions, the volume in European stocks traded on Seaq International in London, as a proportion of volume in Continental domestic markets, fell to 15.2 per cent in August, the lowest level since January.' The Netherlands saw the sharpest rise in August volumes, up 29.9 per cent after a 30.3 per cent fall in July. Belgian trading rose by 29.4 per cent and German volume was 19.8 per cent higher. Swiss domestic volume increased by 1.2 per cent, but the 2.4 per cent rise in the market index was accompanied by a 15.2 per cent decline in the volume of Swiss shares traded on Seaq International, underlining the disenchantment of foreign investors towards the market. By contrast, France, where volume rose by only 1.0 per cent, saw the proportion of London to domestically traded French shares move up to 42.2 per cent, from 40.3 per cent in July. Italian volume continued to slide as politics clouded the outlook, while Spain was the month's biggest loser, with volume down by 29.5 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly total in local currencies (bn) Bourse             May      June      July       Aug            US                   1994      1994      1994      1994    Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium          73.08     71.22     43.50     56.27          1.73 France          175.15    215.75    145.26    146.71         27.15 Germany         151.07    165.42    127.41    152.68         96.69 Italy           99,228    59,404    49,940    46,276         29.31 Netherlands      21.80     26.40     18.40     23.90         13.49 Spain         1,340.00  1,308.75  1,282.19    903.85          6.91 Switzerland      26.12     21.63     18.58     18.80         14.14 UK               44.27     46.32     45.16     52.78         81.14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOUISIANA;  </P> <P> GOV. ROEMER REFUSES TO BLOCK EXECUTION  </P> <P> Gov. Buddy Roemer denied clemency for a retarded man scheduled to go to the  electric chair Thursday for murdering a state trooper at 17. Roemer rejected  the recommendation of the Louisiana Pardon Board, which voted 3 to 2 Monday at  the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, that he commute Dalton Prejean's  sentence for the 1977 slaying of Trooper Donald Cleveland to life in prison.  The governor's announcement came minutes after the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of  Appeals in New Orleans turned down an appeal from Prejean, now 30.  </P></p>

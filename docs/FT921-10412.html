			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian barriers 'putting off explorers' PROBLEMS IN exploration access, together with various barriers to investment, have made Australia a less attractive target for an overseas-based minerals explorer and developer, according to an executive of the Australian miner, MIM Holdings. Mr Ken Dredge, executive general manager of MIM Holdings (Lead and Zinc), yesterday said 26 per cent of Australia's land mass is closed to mineral exploration through either environmental or aboriginal claims. A further 22 per cent is under claims for further restriction. Access to large land tracts at minimal costs is essential for successful exploration. For every 1,000 initial explorations, roughly 100 warrant further detailed work and just 10 are drilled. 'Limiting access to land only increases these odds,' Mr Dredge said. Speaking at an annual conference of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Mr Dredge noted the uncertainties in the country's investment rules. He cited the ADollars 2bn (Pounds 830m) coal development project of Utah Development Company in Bowen Basin in the late 1960s. Shortly after the project started turning in handsome returns following energy price rises in the early 1970s, the Australian government introduced a special duty on open cut coal production and a regime of rail freights for subsequent export coal projects that incorporated additional royalties. Last year's federal government decision to refuse approval for gold and platinum mining at Coronation Hill also illustrated the present mineral investment environment. 'The uncertainty and confusion created by such decisions resulted in Australian miners spending increasing proportions of their exploration budget overseas,' Mr Dredge said.</p>

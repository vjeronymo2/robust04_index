			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / People: Lenton resigns Ingram Lenton has resigned from his position as non-executive chairman of Compass Group on grounds of ill-health. He is also giving up his post as chairman of Watts Blake Bearne. Lenton had been with Compass, which lost its then chief executive, Gerry Robinson, to Granada, in 1991, since 1987. The chairmanship will temporarily be taken over by Robinson's replacement as chief executive, Francis Mackay, though he said yesterday that the company hoped to place a new non-executive chairman 'during the first quarter of the new year'. At WBB, where Lenton had been for six years and its chairman since 1991, he will be succeeded by Michael Beckett, a director and deputy chairman since May 1992. Lenton's place on the board will be taken by Alan Lesser who, until he retired in June 1993, was chief executive of RTZ Borax &amp; Minerals.</p>

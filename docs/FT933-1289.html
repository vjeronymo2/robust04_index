			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: La Generale confident despite slip NET consolidated profits at Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, slipped to BFr4.37bn (Dollars 125m) in the first half of 1993 from BFr4.47bn last time. The company claimed, however, it was already reaping the benefits of its new strategy aimed at reducing exposure to cyclical industrial stocks. Before exceptional gains, it pushed up profits slightly, to BFr3.67bn from BFr3.65bn, on turnover of BFr91.9bn against BFr104bn. As part of the strategy, La Generale yesterday announced the sale of its 43 per cent stake in CBR, the Belgian cement company, to Heidelberger Zement of Germany. The BFr22.5bn proceeds will be held in readiness for acquisitions by subsidiaries, or by the group itself. The main contributors to the holding company's profit in the first half were Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, with a profit of BFr1.23bn against BFr1.31bn last time, and Groupe AG - the Belgian part of Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group - with BFr579m against BFr525m. La Generale was also helped by a return to profit at Recticel, the Belgian chemicals group. Recticel announced yesterday a consolidated net profit of BFr40m in the first half of 1993, compared with a BFr279m loss in the equivalent period. The holding company, which owns 74 per cent of Recticel, benefited from BFr94m of Recticel's operating profits in the first half, against a loss of BFr43m in the first half of 1992. La Generale warned yesterday the economic climate was unlikely to improve in the second half of 1993, and that the group's industrial companies would continue to suffer from the uncertain market situation. However, its service companies would make 'a positive contribution' to full-year results.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: President and parliament The creation of a Federation Council, initially comprising the existing heads of the administrations and parliaments of Russia's 88 regions and republics. This would be the top tier of a new, two-chamber parliament to be known as the Federal Assembly, which would be the supreme legislative body. Subsequent elections for this new arrangement would supersede the existing Supreme Soviet and its Congress of People's Deputies. The 400-member lower house would be the State Duma, of which two thirds would be elected from individual constituency candidates and a third from party lists. The new parliament would adopt a new constitution to lay the legislative basis for division of powers among parliament, presidency, national government and regional administration. New Federation Council, presidental and local elections would then be held. The president would continue to be head of state and the highest official (there would be no vice-president). The president would appoint the prime minister and propose candidates for othertop appointments. He could dissolve parliament under certain conditions. The new parliament, unlike the present one, would be strictly limited to legislative and supervisory powers and no longer be the 'supreme organ of state power.'</p>

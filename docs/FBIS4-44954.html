			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Majid 'Atiyyah] </F>   [Text] The Egyptian delegation, which included Drs. Kamal  al-Janzuri, 'Atif 'Ubayd, and Yusif Butrus Ghali, has returned  from extensive negotiations with the World Bank, the IMF, the  U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID).    Discussions naturally revolved around the "paper" drafted at  the end of last March by Egyptian and World Bank experts and  signed for Egypt by Dr. Yusif Butrus Ghali and for the World  Bank by Ram Shapra, head of its Middle East Department.    The "paper" is the outcome of an evaluation of the [current]  structural reforms. The reforms are undertaken in the context of  the second stage of the Economic Reform Program and the  Structural Adjustment Program, and the reforms involve the areas  of finance, privatization, and the timetable for implementation.    The "paper" contains three major elements--the positive  results of the economic reforms program in light of agreed  recommendations; defining the issues that should have been  already resolved but remain pending; and the actions to be taken  by the government this year and through July 1995 when the  program expires.    As far as the overall economy is concerned, the "paper"  reports that implementation proceeded as planned and achieved  tangible results in all aspects of performance and standards  through the end of 1993.    The government committed to continue planned fiscal measures  intended to reduce the budget deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP by  the end of June 1994, and to narrow it even further in the  1994/95 budget.    The government committed to bringing down the rate of  inflation from 15 percent in 1992/93 to 7.4 percent by January  1994.    The $900 million balance of payments surplus realized in the  first six months of the year came close to the $2 billion target  for the year.    The report also states that the current account deficit has  been reduced at a faster rate than planned. That deficit  currently stands at 1.3 percent of GDP.    The Uniform Tax Law has been promulgated in the hopes of  improving current budget revenues. The law prevents the  double-taxation of corporations and economic activity. It also  reduces the burden of those of limited means.    Trimming government subsidies helped contain the growth in  public spending and in wages as well as stabilize investments at  the targeted level of 7 percent of GDP. The ceiling for  expenditures has been set at 7.2 percent of GDP.    The government has acceded to World Bank recommendations to  limit public sector investments to infrastructure projects and  leave other investments to the private sector.    Egypt must continue to channel credit to the private sector  and to lower interest rates. The latter have indeed dropped in  the second half of last year from 15 to 13.4 percent, thereby  reducing inflationary pressures.    Exchange rates stabilized at about 3.39 pounds per dollar  despite inflows of currencies and remittances. Intervention by  the Central Bank helped set that rate.    The government reduced customs duties to a maximum of 70  percent. Other tariffs in the 30 to 40 percent range have been  reduced by 10 percent as previously agreed in the program.  Duties on capital goods have also been reduced from 10 to five  percent.    As a result of government discussions with World Bank  experts, a GATT consultant was named to help the government  "purge the legislative climate" of anti-dumping policies and to  put safe and secure mechanisms in place.    It has also been agreed that the government will introduce  into the People's Assembly a bill that would allow foreign  companies to engage in foreign trade side by side with domestic  export/import firms. The draft-law would abolish all remaining  restrictions on private sector trade in cotton and would allow  non-Egyptians to engage in the cotton trade on par with  Egyptians. It would also allow foreign banks to open on-shore  branches and would encourage competition by allowing insurance  companies to operate within the country.    It was agreed as well on the need to expedite the  introduction into the People's Assembly of a rental housing bill  that would abolish all rent controls on new or vacated housing  units.    The discussions also touched on the need to lift all  restrictions on industrial investments such as eliminating the  need to obtain permits from the Investment Authority or the  Industrialization Authority in order to construct factories in  new communities. The Bank's delegation commended the decision to  abolish the prior sanction requirement for investments of 5  million pounds or less. That ceiling has been raised to 10  billion pounds under the decree issued by President Mubarak on  labor day.    Also discussed was the underwriting of privatization costs  by  the general state budget or through the resources of the  companies being privatized or restructured.    Even though the World Bank gave satisfactory performance  evaluations to public sector companies, a list was made of 35  companies that were due for divestiture under the 1992/93  program but will be privatized under the 1993/94 program instead.    Discussions also dealt with the delayed "liquidation" of  certain companies, because the government supplanted them by  other companies with a book value of 475 million Egyptian  pounds, even though only 355 million pounds in liquidations were  actually realized by the end of 1993.    Still on the subject of privatization, the delegation  commends the existence of a full-time cabinet portfolio  dedicated to the public business sector. The ministry implements  programs to encourage worker participation in privatization  programs through more than 50 investor/worker federations. Many  privatized company shares have also been made available on the  stock exchange.    The discussions also dealt with reforming the banking sector  and with reducing the Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves  requirement from 15 to 10 percent of each bank's aggregate  earnings redeposited interest-free with the Central Bank. The  talks touched on whether banks meet the capital requirements set  by the Basel Committee and on whether they allocate adequate  reserves to cover non-performing loans. World Bank experts  commended the implementation of the agreement to sell public  bank equities in banks and private firms, otherwise known as  joint banks or joint investment companies.    In a different area, the discussions focused on the delayed  implementation of certain aspects of agreed programs such as  boosting the GDP rate of growth which remains weak in certain  instances, causing unemployment to rise to 17 percent.    Other shortcomings in program implementation that were  discussed included:     -  People's Assembly failure to impose a 5-percent tax on  savings earnings.    -  The imposition by the government of a 2-percent customs duty  over and above the current fee which is 1-percent higher than  the customs duties set by recent customs conventions.    -  The consumer price of electricity remains at 80 percent of  marginal cost when the government had promised to implement  higher rates.    -  The entry of foreigners in the cotton market remains  restricted, in that cotton trade is restricted by law to  Egyptian nationals. The World Bank delegation criticized the  government for setting a minimum selling price for an interim  period that is yet to be defined.    -  World Bank experts would rather do without certain investment  formalities in the governorates. Examples are defining areas  suitable for investments and issuing local government permits.    -  World Bank experts criticized the manner of privatizing the  insurance and Social Security sectors by not factoring in  options for reforms in social security, especially in view of  the propensity to combine the Insurance, Social Security, and  Pension departments.     It was agreed to expedite the introduction into the People's  Assembly of the new insurance bill, which would allow foreign  firms to operate within the country and would provide for  monitoring "private funds" in order to raise their investment  standards. At this point, the World Bank criticized the  government for seizing insurance surpluses, amounting so far to  33 billion pounds, and for the low interest rate it pays on them.    The talks established goals for 1994, including the  completion of a study to set up an autonomous organizational  structure for utilities.    They also stressed the need to sell more shares of banks in  which public sector banks have equity ownership; to encourage  the formation of employee associations to help workers obtain  bank loans to acquire shares; and to expedite the drafting of a  uniform law on corporations and economic activity which would  govern such eventualities as bankruptcies, anti-trust cases,  mergers, and arbitration. The World Bank expressed willingness  to help get this bill drafted before the current session of the  People's Assembly adjourns.    The Bank also emphasized the need to eliminate Ministry of  Supply sugar and cooking oil subsidies by the end of 1995; to  fully liberalize the cotton trade by the end of 1995; and to  liberalize housing rents by the end of this year.    It was also learned that those recommendations on the course  of economic reforms notwithstanding, both World Bank and IMF  presidents commended the rate of Egyptian reforms, which  exceeded expectations. The government, meanwhile, has been keen  on facing up to the expected negative aspects of the reforms  program by paying careful attention to its social consequences  in order to safeguard the livelihood of those with limited  incomes.    Even though the Bank and the IMF have both recommended that  wages be contained, the government has approved auxiliary wage  increases year after year in order to safeguard worker quality  of life. It has also continued to subsidize most basic  commodities and such public services as education and health and  to make financial contributions to pensions and social insurance.</p>

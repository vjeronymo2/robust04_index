			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with B.V. Demchenko, administrative head of </F> Derzhsilhosprod, by B. Polishchuk, correspondent: "How Will We  Sow the Fields With Spring Seeds?"]    [Text]    [Polishchuk] Borys Veniaminovych, what's the situation now  with regard to developments on the spring fields?    [Demchenko] It is a complex matter. In connection with the  fact that last autumn considerable areas were not plowed due to  a lack of fuel, as well as shortfalls and spillages of winter  wheat from freight cars for technical reasons, we must increase  the sowing by a factor of 1.5 at a minimum.    [Polishchuk] How many hectares, in particular, must be  resown  in winter wheat?    [Demchenko] Approximately 2,600,000 hectares. That includes  areas which were insufficiently sown last autumn.    [Polishchuk] What's the situation with regard to seeds?    [Demchenko] In my opinion, we will have no problems with  regard to seeds for the spring sowing. We need 2 million tonnes  of them; the farms already have 1,788,000 tonnes; and  approximately 300,000 tonnes of such seeds will be released from  the state reserves.    [Polishchuk] But the farms are entering upon the springtime  period with empty cash-boxes.    [Demchenko] We have taken that into account, and several  variant solutions have been proposed. If the grain-products  system owes a particular farm money for grain that the latter  sold to it last year, such a farm will be able to obtain seeds  by way of a mutually agreed-upon procedure. Provisions have been  made to loan seeds at a certain interest rate, payable after the  crop has been harvested. And if a particular farm has money of  its own, it can simply buy seeds.    [Polishchuk] But what about prices? Won't it be the case  that  a farm sold a tonne of wheat last year for 500,000 krb  [karbovantsy], but now it will have to pay triple that amount  for an equivalent number of seeds?    [Demchenko] The prices are tolerable. A tonne of seeds for  spring crops will have a price ranging from 1.5 to 2 million krb.    [Polishchuk] And what about corn seeds? Because, of course,  a  great deal of land will also be planted in this crop.    [Demchenko] It was planned to sow 1.5 million hectares in  this grain crop. But it is now clear from all the evidence in  connection with the spillage losses of winter wheat that we will  have to sow 1.8 million hectares in corn--that plus 3 million  hectares for silage. Therefore, there will be a total of 4.8  million hectares sown in corn. With regard to seeds there is--so  to speak--good news and bad news. As a whole, there are enough  corn seeds in Ukraine. We need 120,000 tonnes of them, and the  state reserves contain 125,000 tonnes. It is stored and can be  delivered to various sites in accordance with the following  procedure: Whoever has the means to buy corn seeds can do so.  For example, more than 10,000 tonnes from the Cherkassy region  and 7,500 tonnes from the Vinnitsa region. The terms of  agreement are the same as for the spring-wheat seeds: sales,  mutually agreed upon considerations, or loans. Agreement has  been reached with the railroads about providing freight cars.    [Polishchuk] But why did you say that there is also some  "bad  news"?    [Demchenko] There are two things that I'm afraid of. First,  that we may not collect these seeds rapidly enough. Spring is  already knocking on our door. And second: that a great deal of  harm may be done to us by a kind of selfish provincialism. This  already happened last year, when certain farmers sold to foreign  countries a portion of the corn seeds which had been distributed  to them by our state. At present corn seeds are primarily  located in seven oblasts. Let me repeat that there are enough of  them for all Ukraine. But some persons may be tempted again by  the lure of easy money, even though here in our country the  price of a tonne of corn seed is really quite decent--ranging  from 15 to 18 million krb. We must clearly inform people as  follows: Ukraine anticipates a difficult year in agriculture and  in the economy as a whole; it would be a sin to complicate  matters even more than they already are.</p>

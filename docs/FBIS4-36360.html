			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Umar Kallab] </F>   [Text] In a three-hour meeting held in the portrait gallery  of the Parliament House, Prime minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali  presented explanations to House members and answered their  questions. Reactions differed on the meeting. While some House  members regarded it as successful and satisfactory, others said  it was an ordinary meeting in which nothing new was presented.  House Member 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah asked reporters to rest  because there was nothing new for them.    AKHIR KHABAR acquired the text of the dialogue at the  portrait gallery. Speaker Tahir al-Masri welcomed the prime  minister, saying he hoped the meeting would succeed and that the  prime minister would give the members satisfactory answers to  their questions, whose highlights had been discussed outside the  gallery. Al-Masri confined the questions to five points:  inter-Arab relations, particularly Jordan's relations with  Egypt, Syria, and Yemen; Jordanian-Palestinian relations; public  liberties; the mechanism of employment in the government; and  the Washington tripartite talks.    Al-Masri concluded by emphasizing his request that the  members of the House be thoroughly briefed.    Al-Majali began by speaking about Jordanian-Egyptian  relations, voicing great satisfaction with the recent  Egyptian-Jordanian talks and the agreements reached, saying that  Egypt treated Jordan with high esteem and that issues are  proceeding very well and that Jordan is continually following up  the implementation of these agreements by telephone.    On Jordanian-Syrian relations, al-Majali said that during  his  majesty's recent visit to Syria, Jordan was surprised when the  Syrians demanded more than coordination, alluding to a form of  unity. Jordan voiced its firm stand on such issue, pointing out  that it is prepared to promote relations with the Syrian  brothers provided a calm and objective study is made first in  order to make any form of a union a success. On the  Syrian-Israeli track, al-Majali said "it seems" that the Syrians  have covered a good measure of coordination with the United  States and it was obvious from their talks that things are  proceeding well on the Syrian track.    On the Jordanian stand on the Yemeni crisis and the official  media position, which some of the House members regarded as  biased in favor of the north, al-Majali said: We take sides  only with unity and legitimacy. Unity has been democratically  chosen by the Yemeni people and we respect it.    Al-Majali criticized 'Ali Salim al-Bid, explaining to the  House members that when he came to Amman to sign the Pledge and  Accord Agreement, al-Bid was accompanied by his wife and  children. However, he kept them on the plane and alighted  alone. He said that al-Bid's talks with his majesty continued  until 0200 in the morning. Al-Majali said that al-Bid was so  late in coming that Prince Hasan took him from the airport by  helicopter to gain time and that his delay was intended to rob  the negotiations of the needed time and prevent a discussion of  all issues. This shows that al-Bid did not want unity. This  was basis of the Jordanian position.    Al-Majali rejected al-Bid's charges and accusations that  Jordan assisted the north and affirmed Jordan's clear stand on  this issue.    Al-Majali then spoke about the Jordanian-Palestinian  relations, declaring his dissatisfaction with what is happening.  He said the talks now are not on the desired level. Meetings  are held then working committees are formed. Jordan names its  committee members but the PLO stalls and does not name its  committee members. In the latest meeting, talks lasted until  midnight and issues were proceeding satisfactorily but the head  of the Palestinian delegation, Ahmad Quray', asked the head of  the Jordanian delegation to give him some time to consult with  the leadership in Tunis. They went and never returned to sign  what had been agreed upon.    On the issue of public liberties, al-Majali stressed the  importance of internal security and said that his government  gives it its utmost concern. He said: I do not deny that there  are certain excesses here or there but the government is  determined to respect liberties. He said the number of those  detained by the intelligence department is 20 and that the  department assured him that the moment they are interrogated,  those who prove to be innocent will be released and the others  will be referred to court. He said the department has allowed  their relatives to visit them.    On the issue of civil service appointments, al-Majali said  the government explained this in the press and said that the  civil service appointments system will be revised. He noted  that this is an administrative issue and it should not be  interfered with. He said that government will accept any  observations by House members on this issue.    On the Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli talks in Washington, al-Majali  said that this is an economic issue and has no political aspects  but an attempt to explore the region's economic and political  conditions. The prime minister's explanations on this point were  not sufficient.    The House members then directed their questions at the prime  minister. Twenty members spoke, focusing on both internal and  external policies. The Islamic Action Front members noted that  the prime minister was appointing his relatives and in-laws to  special posts. The prime minister categorically denied this  charge and challenged them to show him a single instance of this  kind.    Member Bassam Haddadin questioned the government's lack of  neutrality on Yemen and noted that there were signs of a  separate solution between Jordan and Israel. Al-Majali answered  by saying that the position toward Yemen is neutral and the  government is neutral. He also said that it is impossible for  Jordan to accept a separate solution with Israel.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIRPORT COMMISSIONERS DELAY SHUTTLE  DECISION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners deferred a decision Wednesday on  whether to lift an interim moratorium preventing enlargement of the passenger  shuttle van fleet serving Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> An association of the largest shuttle van companies has filed suit against the  board to keep the moratorium in place. The companies claim that the fleet has  grown too large, resulting in slashed profits and cutthroat competition. The  moratorium was enacted last September to allow the board to study ways of  better regulating the shuttle van industry.  </P> <P> The board's next meeting is scheduled for December.  </P></p>

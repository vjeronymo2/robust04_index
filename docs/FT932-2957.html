			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of New Zealand (9): A supplier to niche markets - Manufacturing has responded to the new economic climate MANUFACTURING industry is recovering from the sharp shocks it received over the past decade as a result of the efforts by successive governments to restructure the economy. The real value of sales grew 6.7 per cent in 1992, a complete rebound from the 6.3 per cent contraction in 1991. The latest figures from the Manufacturers' Federation show that the ratio of pre-tax profits to sales in the 1992 year was 7.4 per cent, up from 6.4 per cent in 1990. The general manufacturing sector showed real growth in exports of 15.1 per cent compared with 1.7 per cent in 1990, and some industries were facing capacity constraints. The sector has also seen the first growth in employment, and hours worked for six years. However, the federation's survey says that the sector's biggest worry has been the growing amount of imports in the domestic market. Industry had already taken a series of knocks from 1980 onwards as the National government moved slowly towards tariff reductions, especially in textiles. It received a setback from 1984, when the the reformist Labour government, virtually overnight and without warning, decided to deregulate the economy and open it to import competition, with the aim of making the industry focus on exports. From 1960 manufacturing had expanded strongly under the combined stimulus of import protection and a range of government incentives, aimed at securingDevelopment full employment and economic diversification. The changes in the 1980s severely damaged industry morale, and led a number of international companies to relocate their factories to Australia and elsewhere where tax and other incentives were available. Many industries became uncompetitive, and their owners closed them down. Industry's efforts to respond to the new environment created by these changes was, furthermore, hampered by the combined effects of financial sector deregulation, and the subsequent share market boom, which saw the channelling of investment towards speculative endeavours. The Labour government, too, deliberately ran a high exchange rate policy in an unsuccessful attempt to control domestic interest rates and inflation. The domestic market entered a severe recession from 1988, and the manufacturing sector was also struggling against the Labour government's reluctance, or slowness, to deregulate other markets, such as labour, transport and shipping. The high value of the dollar led to a flood of imports, which were by then virtually uncontrolled. Peter Coakley, of the manufacturing advisory group said in a recent detailed report that the first signs of industry recovering began to be noted in 1989, as the benefits of the economic reforms became stronger and new export oriented strategies of manufacturers began to generate results. 'For a time this was masked by continuing retraction in various parts of the sector due to imports, but the extent of the new competitiveness in manufacturing is evident from its increased competitiveness, rising confidence, and the resurgence of exports across a substantial part of the sector in the past year.' The present National party government has provided two important benefits to the sector. One has been a relaxation in the Reserve Bank's inflation target, which was given an extra year to reach nil inflation. This allowed it to relax monetary policy and led to a fall in the value of the Kiwi dollar. In recent weeks, however, the value of the Kiwi dollar has risen strongly, owing to improving economic signals. This has led to protests from manufacturers, especially those dealing with Australia, where the currency has weakened sharply. There has also been a fall in domestic interest rates from around 17 to 10 per cent over the past two years. However, the main beneficial change has been the Employment Contracts Act, which effectively weakened the power of the trade unions (see facing page). Initially, this led to a fall in incomes, though latest figures show wages are growing due to increased productivity payments. Real sales generated per hour in the manufacturing sector are running at a record level. 'Manufacturing have been able to maintain high productivity in spite of increasing staff numbers and the totals of hours worked. This indicates that the reform of workplace practices and management systems is providing the basis for a sustained improvement in the international competitiveness of New Zealand businesses.' In 1992, manufacturing unit costs of labour fell by 5.5 per cent compared with a 4.2 per cent rise in Singapore and a nil change in Australia. Munro McLennan, an executive with UK meat group, Weddell Crown, said recently that the export meat industry was a 'magnificent example' of the changes taking place in processing. Previously unions banned more than eight hours work at a plant, which led to costly duplication. Now three-shift plants are common, industrial conflict seems non-existent, productivity payments are common, and workers are undertaking more complex processing tasks. New Zealand manufacturers see their future as a supplier of niche markets. This has been fostered by the way industry developed. Many companies, such as white goods maker, Fisher and Paykel, became adept at handling small production runs during the years of import protection. This the industry believes has brought competitive advantages in terms of product development, innovation, quality controls and the ability to supply short run or urgent orders. Industry is now export oriented, and figures show that, despite the severe setbacks of the later 1980s, has more than doubled its share of total export receipts over the last 20 years, a trend that will continue. New Zealand manufacturing export growth at 7.3 per cent last year continues to be higher than the OECD average of 5.6 per cent. The geographical pattern of New Zealand's export trade has also changed significantly over the past 15 years as markets have become more diversified. In 1976 Australia took 43.1 per cent of New Zealand's basic manufactured exports, Japan 32.3 per cent and a range of other markets 24.6 per cent. Last year Australia's share was slightly lower at 42.7 per cent, Japan's considerably lower at 16.5 per cent, while a greater range of destinations, notably Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, took 40.8 per cent of total manufactured exports.</p>

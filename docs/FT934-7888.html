			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Six tender for Pounds 300m London-Heathrow link BRITISH, German, French and Japanese companies are among six bidders for the main tunnelling contracts for the Pounds 300m Paddington to Heathrow rail link. The privately financed scheme is to be built by a joint venture between BAA, which runs Heathrow airport, and British Rail. Japan's Export Import Bank recently agreed a loan facility of up to Pounds 135m to help finance the project. The tunnelling works will be the main cost. Taylor Woodrow, the UK contractor, has been appointed overall construction manager for the 25km line. The tender list for the tunnelling works comprises Balfour Beatty from the UK and five joint ventures involving UK and overseas companies: Amec, with Hochtief (Germany); Sir Robert McAlpine, Taylor Woodrow, Wayss &amp; Freytag (Germany) and Bachy (France); Miller, Tarmac, Kumagai Gumi (Japan) and BEMO-NATM (Austria); Kier, Murphy and Kunz (Germany); Nuttall, Trafalgar House and Zublin (Germany). The works involve constructing escalator and lift shafts as well as driving two 2.95km tunnels from north of the M4 to underground stations connecting to terminals 1, 2, and 3 at Heathrow. A further 3.2km single track tunnel will connect with Terminal 4. Tunnelling for railway stations is highly specialised and only a small number of British and international companies have the necessary expertise.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Alcatel to buy mobile phone stake Alcatel Alsthom, the French engineering and telecommunications group, said yesterday it planned to take a stake of about 20 per cent in the mobile telephones operations of Generale des Eaux, the utilities and communications group. Alcatel said its decision to seek a stake in Cofira, the mobile telecoms arm of Generale des Eaux, follows the failure of its bid to win the licence for France's third mobile telecoms telephone network. Earlier this month, the French government awarded the licence to Bouygues, the construction and communications company. The government claimed Alcatel's position as a leading supplier of telecoms equipment had prejudiced its bid to become an operator. But the company rejected the argument and said it still intended to expand in telecommunications services. The investment in Cofira could involve the purchase by Alcatel of the 19.9 per cent stake currently held by Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making state-owned bank. Alcatel said it was in discussions with Credit Lyonnais, but that it was also holding talks with other minority shareholders in Cofira. The proposed alliance is the latest step in the reinforcement of the mobile telecoms activities of Generale des Eaux. Two weeks ago, it said it had extended an alliance with Vodafone of the UK and it was forming a partnership with Southwestern Bell of the US.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATURALLY, READERS TAKE RIPS AT GARVEY  </P> <P> Steve Garvey, who has recently impregnated two women while marrying a third,  stated that, "I'll live up to my moral obligations, which I feel strongly about  because I'm a Christian."  </P> <P> Apparently he feels that meeting his financial obligation to the children is  tantamount to meeting his moral obligation to them.  </P> <P> He struck out on this one. But perhaps some good will come of this. Maybe  Californians will finally see Garvey for the sanctimonious phony he always has  been.  </P> <P> BOB LENTZ  </P> <P> Sylmar  </P></p>

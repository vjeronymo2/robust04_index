			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Pan Am terminates route pact with Delta PAN AM, the defunct US airline, has terminated its agreement to transfer its Detroit-London route to Delta Air Lines, clearing the way for Pan Am to sell the route to Northwest Airlines. Pan Am said its action was based on a termination clause in the Pan Am-Delta contract to transfer the route to Delta. Delta yesterday responded by asking the US Department of Transportation to 'finalise its Show Cause Order and issue certificate authority to Delta' to operate the route. Delta and Northwest have been battling for the route for several months. Delta had claimed it purchased the route as part of a package of Pan Am assets, including Pan Am's East Coast Shuttle and remaining transatlantic routes, it bought during the autumn. Northwest, which has a hub in Detroit, has strongly contested Delta's application. Delta said it would continue to operate the service under temporary rights granted by the department of transportation after Pan Am stopped operating in December. 'This case has been one of the most - if not the most - litigated route transfer proceedings in history,' Delta said. 'The public interest requires prompt action.' Pan Am said US bankruptcy court judge Cornelius Blackshear had denied Delta's request for a temporary restraining order to block the contract termination. Pan Am has also withdrawn its filing with the Department of Transportation to transfer the route to Delta, and has filed a joint motion with Northwest to transfer the route to Northwest. In January, Pan Am brought a Dollars 2.5bn lawsuit against Delta, claiming Delta had acted to assure that Pan Am failed. Delta has brought its own counter suit against Pan Am.</p>

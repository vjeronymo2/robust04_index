			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Italian acquisition helps Sherwood advance to Pounds 18.5m A strong performance from the Italian bra maker acquired last April helped Sherwood Group, the Nottingham-based lace, lingerie and socks maker, to lift 1993 profits by 9 per cent. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 18.5m - just above the figure given 10 days ago in a profits warning. The shares, which fell 19p to 151p after the warning, closed yesterday at 132p, up 2p. Lepel, the Italian acquisition, contributed Pounds 3.4m to profits and Pounds 10.4m to total turnover of Pounds 153m (Pounds 144m). Margins at Lepel were 32.9 per cent. Mr David Parker, executive chairman, said the Italian company had lived up to Sherwood's high expectations. Garment sales, including sales from Lepel, totalled Pounds 74.2m, up from Pounds 66.1m. Operating margins were 16.1 per cent, against 13.2 per cent. However, the increased profitability in lingerie was offset by a decrease in socks, which were hit by imports to the UK. Turnover in lace increased from Pounds 78.4m to Pounds 80m, or 52 per cent of total sales. Of this, half was sold in continental Europe. Operating profits of the group's European lace makers fell from Pounds 4.68m to Pounds 1.58m on unchanged turnover of Pounds 49.5m, reflecting the devaluation late in 1992 of sterling, the lira and the peseta. The group is restructuring its Dentex lace operations in Germany and the Netherlands, streamlining the sales mechanisms and cutting the number of sites. In addition, the group management is being restructured, with a lace operational board and garments operational board reporting to the main board. Mr Parker is quitting his dual role as chairman and managing director to become executive chairman. Mr Jim Telfer, who has been in charge of Birkin, the UK lace maker, has been appointed group managing director. Mr Ben Martin, recently retired as a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has been appointed as second non-executive director. Earnings per share edged ahead to 10.7p (10.6p) and the board is proposing a final dividend of 1.9p (1.7p) taking the total for the year to 2.9p (2.6p). COMMENT If profits for the current year come in at about Pounds 21m, the shares look cheap with a prospective multiple of 11. The balance sheet is strong, with interest cover just over eight times. But the group blew a small hole in its credibility by issuing a warning so soon before the results. It now has to show that the impressive margins at Lepel are sustainable; that the new management structures for the group and Dentex are working; and that it can fight back in the sock market. If recovery comes, the shares could be seen as a bargain. But there remains the risk of something else going wrong and not being picked up until late.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Riyad Mansur in Amman] </F>   [Excerpts] The Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [PFLP] has expressed great appreciation for Jordan's  official stand toward the Hebron massacre. It said this stand  reflects the profound link and common destiny between the  Jordanian and Palestinian peoples. The PFLP also appreciated  Jordan's decision, along with Syria and Lebanon, to halt the  negotiations in protest against the massacre of the age.    The PFLP held the PLO leadership and Executive Committee,  led  by Yasir 'Arafat, responsible for the current status of the  Palestinian revolution and the PLO itself. It called upon  'Arafat and the Executive Committee to resign because they are  unable to assume their national and political responsibilities.    PFLP Political Bureau member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, who has  frozen his membership in the Executive Committee in protest  against the Madrid negotiations, has called for forming an  interim PLO and Palestinian revolution leadership from inside  and outside the territories. This leadership should be capable  of ending the deterioration in the PLO's status and the  Palestinian situation in general.    Speaking to SAWT AL-SHA'B, Malluh said the new leadership  should be qualified and capable of assuming its national and  political responsibilities and worthy of being entrusted with  the rights and national cause of the Palestinian people,  primarily their right to repatriation, self-determination, and  independent statehood. [passage omitted]    Malluh strongly rejected the attempts of Rabin and his  government to confine international protection of our people to  Gaza and Jericho and to be supervised by civil observers. He  said: We want full international protection by deploying a  sufficient number of troops that can prevent a repetition of the  daily massacres committed by the occupation authorities.    Malluh welcomed the return of Fatah's hawks and panthers to  armed struggle against the occupation authorities and settlers.  [passage omitted]    Malluh condemned U.S. policy that is biased toward Israel,  calling for exposing it because it paves the way for further  massacres against our people and sheds light on the true U.S.  position toward our people's national rights. He urged those  who have illusions about -- or wager on -- the U.S. position to  drop their illusions and wagers. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (16): The invisible 'glue' in IT systems - . . . For OLTP Software MOST business transactions end up on a computer nowadays. A sales order recorded from a telephone call, a withdrawal from an automatic teller machine in the wall of a bank or a quote for an insurance policy - all eventually find their way into a computer system somewhere. Since computers were first used in commerce, there has been a demand for these transactions to be executed in 'real time' or 'on-line' - giving rise to the concept of on-line transaction processing (OLTP). For many years this type of computing has been the exclusive province of specially-built systems based on proprietary computer hardware. IBM's mainframe computers are the best-known example - although all the leading computer manufacturers offer comparable systems. In the last few years, however, there has been a demand for a different kind of OLTP. The spread of computer networks, which include equipment and software from different suppliers, has forced OLTP into the wider market for open systems. US market researchers at the Gartner Group expects this sector is set to grow significantly in the next three years. It says that the total market for mid-range transaction processing was worth Dollars 190m in 1992. But by 1995, Gartner Group says it will be worth Dollars 3bn worldwide. It goes on to say that this new market will be dominated by two OLTP software products. Unix System Laboratories, Tuxedo and IBM's CICS/6000 are expected to take over 50 per cent of the market between them. CICS is, perhaps, IBM most successful software product with over 33,000 sites worldwide. It was originally developed for IBM's System/370 mainframes over 25 years ago and has become the established market leader. In September 1992, IBM announced a new, open version of CICS under the name CICS/6000. This new version not only runs on IBM's RS/6000 Unix computers, it is also being made available to other computer manufacturers - Hewlett Packard being the first to take a licence. Computer suppliers see OLTP as an important open systems' software technology. Many companies rely on OLTP as the base for operational systems such as accounting and customer-service support. Open systems must, therefore, be able to cope with OLTP if they are to continue to grow and, in the last two years, the standards infrastructure has grown to include the mechanisms to make this possible. The IBM-backed Open Software Foundation (OSF), for example, has published a standard for distributed computing which covers this. It includes a technique called the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) which can pass the complex messages through a network, regardless of the operating environment or computer hardware. IBM's new version of CICS uses the RPC to allow it to work across different systems. Meanwhile Unix International, a rival faction in the open systems market, has put its weight behind an alternative transaction-processing system called Tuxedo. Although Tuxedo and IBM's CICS look set to compete with each other in the market for open transaction processing systems, they could end up co-operating. Tuxedo is able to work with CICS systems already and IBM has announced that a version of Tuxedo will be available for its mainframe computers - running with its AIX/Unix - later this year. Unix International also supports many of the OSF standards and there are strong pressures for the two standards to come together. The International Standards Organisation (ISO) and the X/Open Group are also working on a set of standards for open OLTP. These include the XA interface, a standard which enables OLTP products from different manufacturers to 'talk' to each other. This means that a CICS system and a Tuxedo system can co-exist on a network and exchange transactions. The rush to provide OLTP software is not only restricted to traditional suppliers like IBM, however. Database software suppliers, such as Oracle, Informix and Sybase, have also identified OLTP as an important growth area. They have added OLTP features to their database management software products in the last few years - partly to expand their market, but also to meet a growing demand for lower-cost OLTP systems. NEW WAVE OF HARDWARE Database software suppliers have also worked closely with a new wave of computer hardware manufacturers to provide an alternative to the traditional mainframe hardware platforms. Companies like Sequent and Solbourne have built powerful computers by plugging many small processors together. These systems rival the performance of traditional mainframe systems and, when used with the new OLTP/database software products described above, can support OLTP applications at much lower cost. OLTP is likely to become increasingly important in the context of office systems and 'workgroup' computing, too. OLTP offers tried-and-tested mechanisms which can ensure that important messages get from one part of a network to another. While this might not be especially important in simple electronic mail systems, it becomes very important in the new breed of groupware applications now beginning to surface. These applications need the type of mechanisms offered by current OLTP software to ensure data integrity and access security. Groupware packages like Lotus Notes and FCMC's Staffware are being used to automate work procedures such as loan approvals and sales calls. If they are to be effective, they will need the same checks and controls used in traditional OLTP applications. OLTP software is the invisible 'glue' in modern information technology systems and will become increasingly important as more and more business transaction are conducted through computer networks.</p>

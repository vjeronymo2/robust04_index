			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / How to Spend It: The new prince of goldsmiths - Big designers grab the headlines but sometimes the smaller workshops and ateliers give greater pleasure. Those heading for Italy might like to know that there are some little-known craftsmen and designers whose wares are well worth tracking down A FLORENTINE, Milanese or Roman can spot jewellery by Buccellati from across a crowded room. Its hallmark is hand engraving of silver, white and yellow gold of such intricacy that the metals sparkle like precious stones. Any gems that happen to be encrusted within this setting are almost incidental. Lorenzo Buccellati is the 'favourite son' of the late Mario Buccellati, who was dubbed 'The Prince of Goldsmiths' by the author Gabriele d'Annunzio back in 1922. The house of Mario Buccellati was founded in 1919 in the shadow of la Scala in Milan's Largo Santa Margherita. Now it occupies a site in the mecca of fashion in Milan's via Montenapoleone. A second shop is sited in the smartest street in Florence - the via Tournabuoni, which literally means 'the street of good returns.' Lorenzo is the artist and Claudia, his wife, is the marketing force behind Buccellati. Lorenzo does not design for global glitterati who might anyway prefer a more ostentatious style a la Bulgari - the Italian jeweller that is Buccellati's biggest rival. 'High' jewellers such as Cartier of France have somewhat tarnished their exclusive image with the highly accessible (and profitable) 'Les Must' collection. Even Van Cleef &amp; Arpels of Paris's Place Vendome has a boutique collection. But Mario Buccellati has deliberately stuck to the hand-engraving tradition and has avoided tarnishing his image with a more popular and accessible collection in the way that Cartier (with Les Must) and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels (with a boutique collection) have done. As well as its own shops the pieces can be found in another 72 user-friendly family jewellers in provincial Italian towns, where a full-blown Buccellati shop would not work. These family jewellers carry a pared-down 'Diffusion' collection of Buccellati's simpler, traditional gold earrings, rings and cufflinks. There is no compromise over quality: it is merely a collection in the lower price bracket of Buccellati's range. Buccellati's shops, with their museum-like air, can be daunting: security has to be very tight after a series of robberies in 1989. Display cabinets show jewels of great beauty, but also charming silver objects such as small birds, leaves and flowers for table displays. In Italy, as in the rest of the world, it is not the right time for great displays of wealth. Lorenzo Buccellati's 'high' jewellery designs are valued for their craftsmanship and appeal to more subtle tastes. But he goes on quietly making special pieces for his own customers - most notably Florentines - which show that though tastes may have changed, money is not exactly scarce. For example, he made a three piece 'suite' of necklace, earrings and ring for a Florentine businessman a couple of years ago. To make the same thing today would cost Dollars 7m, (Pounds 4.6m) calculates Claudia Lorenzo, gold calculator in hand. But to Lorenzo it is not value and cost that interests him, but design. The necklace is best described as a collar of lace woven in diamonds and set in highly engraved yellow and white gold. There are 67.96 carats of diamond, including 20.21 carats in nine teardrop yellow diamonds, which were Lorenzo's inspiration. The client left it to Buccellati, with no price limit. All he said was: 'Lorenzo, it must be diamonds. Do your best.' Only the Buccellati shops in Milan and Florence - owned by Lorenzo and Claudia - may bear the name Mario Buccellati. Lorenzo's brothers, who set up independently after a family feud over money, control other Buccellati outlets in Rome, Porto Cervo, Paris, New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo. Mario Buccellati's hand-crafted production means that volume is small so there is invariably a waiting list. Clients include royalty, the arts and showbusiness, the Queen, Prince Charles, Peter Ustinov, Liza Minelli, Barbara Sinatra and the late Arturo Toscanni and Maria Callas.</p>

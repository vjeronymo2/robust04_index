			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD WANTS TO DOUBLE NUMBER OF HISPANIC DEALERS BY MID-'90S  </P> <P> Ford said Friday that it plans to try to double the number of its  Hispanic-owned auto dealerships by the mid-1990s in a move to bolster its  position within the growing Hispanic market.  </P> <P> The program is similar to efforts by Ford and the other domestic auto makers to  increase the number of black-owned car dealerships around the country. It also  follows criticism by some minority groups of Japanese auto makers for their  failure to open up import dealership opportunities to blacks and other  minorities.  </P> <P> But unlike the domestic industry's black dealership efforts, which were  developed partly under pressure from the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Operation Push,  Ford officials said they have not been working with any Hispanic organizations  to create the dealership program.  </P> <P> "We believe there are Hispanics with automotive experience and the financial  capability to acquire a dealership; however it will be our job to find  dealership opportunities for these individuals," said Robert Rewey, vice  president for Ford's sales operations. "Ford will provide operational support  and training for individuals who meet our appointment qualifications."  </P> <P> Ford said it currently has 40 Hispanic-owned dealerships and is aiming to  increase that to at least 80 by the mid-1990s. A Ford spokesman did not know  how many of the existing Hispanic dealerships are in California.  </P> <P> Overall, Ford said it now has 316 minority-owned dealerships around the nation.  </P> <P> Rewey observed that Hispanics now represent 7.7% of the U.S. population and are  forecast to become the nation's largest minority by 2010. "It has been  estimated that Hispanics have $160 billion in disposable income, and that  figure will grow considerably during the next decade," he added.  </P> <P> A Ford spokesman said the attempt to expand the number of Hispanic-owned  dealerships should help Ford's marketing efforts in areas like Southern  California that have large Hispanic populations.  </P></p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Technology: Smoking out the truth - Sheila Jones and Frances Williams on the statistics of tobacco Statistics can give imprecise truths, precise lies, but never facts. Yet statistical studies of smoking habits and mortality rates in the developed world have established in the minds of most that there is a strong link between smoking and the incidence of lung cancer and other diseases. Earlier this week, the World Health Organisation and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund published their study, Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries 1950-2000*. It concludes that 3m people worldwide are dying each year through diseases related to smoking. The tobacco 'epidemic' is killing six people a minute. The study, citing US data, found that the risk of lung cancer is 24 times higher for a smoker than a non-smoker. For heart disease the risk is three times greater. The tobacco industry, as a whole, has fought hard against a growing mountain of statistical evidence. John Ashford, a consultant in statistics, dismissed the WHO/ICRF study this week in a BBC radio tussle with Richard Peto, one of the co-authors. According to Ashford, an adviser to several international tobacco companies, the study is 'scaremongering - generating very large numbers and using them to frighten people'. Studies since the 1950s, when Sir Richard Doll first pointed to a causal link between smoking and cancer, have all painted the same picture: that tobacco kills. This is the point about statistics, says Peto. 'We are not claiming precision, but we are getting the right picture,' he says. 'The overall numbers might be too high or too low, but using the same methods in different years and in different countries, you can see how the epidemic is evolving.' The WHO/ICRF report bases its conclusions and forecasts in large part on data collected in the US and the UK. It examines smoking habits and mortality rates over four decades. Forecasts are based on the proportion of smokers in the population, and on the assumed risk based on US and UK data. The main point is to examine smokers and death rates over prolonged periods, according to the authors. The current epidemic is among males in the developed world who started smoking as young men in the mid-1940s. The increase in male deaths is slowing, as smokers in the developed world respond to health warnings, but it is speeding up among female smokers, and among men in developing countries, where smoking has been taken up later. In the US, researchers asked 1m Americans in the early 1980s how much they smoked and monitored their death rates over the next few years. The US is a 'mature epidemic population' - that is, the risks of smoking have had the chance to work through a lifetime. A UK study of 40,000 doctors, which asked the same sort of questions in 1951, came to broadly similar conclusions. Both studies found that smokers faced a much greater risk than non-smokers of premature death from lung cancer or from vascular and respiratory diseases. The WHO/ICRF study goes on to predict that the worst is yet to come, especially in developing countries, where smoking is rising among men. There is no evidence the trend applies to women yet, but it could come with economic modernisation and changing lifestyles, according to Alan Lopez, another co-author. The quality of the data in the developing world is mixed, says Lopez. 'But for some countries, such as China, we have very precise information . . . we know a lot of men are smoking in developing countries. We don't know for sure what the risk of death from smoking is in these countries because the full impact is yet to come.' The WHO/ICRF authors say their next task is to gather yet more statistics. 'They won't change the big picture,' says Peto. 'But they're bound to change the fine detail. The question with statistics is not 'is this exactly right?' No, it isn't. But, if you ask: 'is this the order of the epidemic?' Yes it is.' * Mortality From Smoking in Developed Countries - 1950 - 2000. Oxford University Press. Pounds 50.</p>

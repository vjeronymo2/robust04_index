Hameed exchanged views on bilateral, regional and  international issues at their two-hour official talks here today.    At talks, Hameed briefed his Chinese counterpart on the  current situation in his country, saying that his country will  stick to a stand of solving domestic problems through political  dialogue.    Qian spoke highly of the economic development in Sri Lanka  and appreciated the efforts by the Sri Lankan Government in  realizing national conciliation and safeguarding territorial  integrity and unity of the country.    On regional issues, Hameed said, "Although disputes are  existing among the South Asian nations, the South Asian  Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has made much  progress in recent years."    Qian said, "China has attached importance to developing  relations and cooperation with South Asian countries as South  Asia is an important region with a large population and a  potential large market as well".    Qian expressed the hope that South Asian countries will  remove external interference and find peaceful resolutions of  the disputes so as to create a peaceful environment for  developing economy in the region.    About Indian Ocean Peace Zone, Hameed said, "As a sponsor  country, Sri Lanka hopes this peace zone will make progress as  the confrontation of the two big powers has ended."    Qian said, "China has been supporting the proposal for  establishing the Indian Ocean Peace Zone."    He noted that "The big powers outside the zone should  withdraw the military existence in the Indian Ocean region and  respect the independence, sovereignty and security of the  countries in the region".    The two foreign ministers also had in-depth discussions on  other regional and internal issues of common interest.    Qian arrived here on February 28 on a two-day official visit  to Sri Lanka.</p>

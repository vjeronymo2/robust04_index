			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sulayman Namir: "New Saudi Aid for Palestinians </F> in Occupied Territories"]    [Text] The Saudi minister of finance and national economy,  Muhammad Aba-al-Khayl, has announced that King Fahd of Saudi  Arabia has issued directives to allocate $20 million as aid to  Palestinians living in the occupied territories for them to  establish development, educational, and health-related projects  as well as social welfare projects and public facilities via the  United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees  (UNRWA).    Mr. Aba-al-Khayl said that the $20 million is part of a  total  of $100 million which King Fahd has decided to provide as aid  for the Palestinians in the occupied territories.    It should be mentioned that Saudi Arabia had pledged to  provide the $100 million, as aid to the Palestinians in the  occupied territories for them to establish their government and  authority, after the signing of the Oslo agreement dealing with  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    The Saudi minister, in a statement broadcast by the Saudi  News Agency, also said: "An UNRWA delegation will arrive in  Riyadh in order to conclude an agreement concerning arrangements  for carrying out the agreement between the Saudi Development  Fund and UNRWA dealing with cooperation in this area."    Diplomatic observers see in this decision by King Fahd an  indication that Saudi Arabia has not waited for the  establishment of the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho in order to  begin furnishing the aid it had publicly committed itself to  providing after the signing of the Oslo agreement. On the  contrary, Saudi Arabia decided to begin right away with its aid  to Palestinians in the occupied territories who are suffering  from bad economic, educational, and social conditions. This is  being done by means of UNRWA, which oversees projects dealing  with improvement of the Palestinians' conditions in the  territories, so that the furnishing of the aid is not influenced  by political developments involving the Palestinian cause or by  the course of the negotiations with Israel.    Saudi Arabia apparently feels that the negotiations still  require time--time that the Palestinians perhaps cannot afford  to take because of their economic and social conditions in the  occupied territories.    In this regard, it is noted that there are three types of  material aid that Saudi Arabia is providing to the Palestinians  at this stage, and they are the following:    1. Official aid that will start going to the Palestinians  via  UN humanitarian organizations, and this is the aid that was  announced yesterday.    2. Aid for the masses of people, which will go to the  Palestinians via the PLO. This aid is being collected by popular  committees to help the Palestinian people, and they are headed  by Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of the district of  Riyadh. Most of the aid is collected by means of 5-percent  deductions from the salaries of Palestinians working in Saudi  Arabia. This aid has never been cut off since it began being  collected in 1968--not even during the periods of tension in  relations between Saudi Arabia and the leadership of the PLO,  and not even during the crisis period when Iraq occupied Kuwait.    3. Aid for the masses of people, which is collected by means  of campaigns organized to support a particular project, such as  the campaign unleashed by Prince Salman Bin-'Abd- al-'Aziz, on  instructions from King Fahd given during the latter part of last  Ramadan, to save Jerusalem. This aid, according to Prince  Salman, will go directly to the Palestinians of Jerusalem.    In addition to these types of aid, there are other forms of  Saudi aid provided directly to the occupied territories. There  is, for example, the aid to specific projects such as the  project to restore the al-Aqsa Mosque and other Islamic holy  places in Jerusalem, which King Fahd donated money to finance  last year. There is also the aid consisting of donations to some  of the educational, social, and health-related establishments in  the occupied territories, such as the unpublicized donations  provided by King Fahd to the hospital run by the Association for  Islamic Charitable Purposes in Jerusalem and King Fahd's recent  donation to the victims of the massacre in Hebron.    In addition to the above, there are donations provided by  Saudi businessmen directly to educational and health-related  projects in the occupied territories, such as the donation by  the Saudi businessman 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Juraysi, head of the  Saudi Council of Chambers of Commerce, for the purpose of  constructing and furnishing Bi'r Zayt University's College of  Administration and Business building. Before this, there was the  donation by the businessman 'Umar al-'Aqqad for the purpose of  constructing and furnishing the College of Engineering in this  same university. Also, the businessman Sabih al-Misri donated  $3.5 million for the construction and furnishing of a new  building for the medical clinics in the hospital run by the  Association for Islamic Charitable Purposes, and many Saudi  companies and establishments have donated sums of money annually  to this hospital.</p>

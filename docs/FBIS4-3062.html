			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By trainee staff reporter Fang Hsiao-i (2075 2556 11837): </F> "Deng Nan Confirmed in Front of Chinese and Foreign Reporters  That Deng Xiaoping Is In Good Health"]    [Text] Beijing 15 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--Deng Xiaoping is in  very good health [shen ti fei chang jian kang 6500 7555 7236  1603 0256 1660], and is much concerned with China's  construction, Deng Nan, vice minister of the State Science and  Technology Commission confirmed to reporters here today.    She said that there are all sorts of rumors about her  father's health overseas, which they had got quite used to, and  would sometimes joke about. Each day, my father follows his  routine practice and completes his set work as before, including  a lot of reading. He continues to go for a stroll every day,  and we even played bridge together the evening before last.    The State Council Information Office called a news  conference  for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Media Hotel today, and  Chen Yaoban, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, and  Deng Nan, vice minister of State Science and Technology  Commission were invited to brief reporters on the white paper,  "China's Agenda 21-- Population, Environment, and Development of  China in the 21st Century," and answer their questions.    One after the other, several foreign reporters asked Deng  Nan  about Deng Xiaoping's health. Deng Nan answered: I quite  understand your concern for my father's health. There are often  all sorts of rumors about my father's health, which we have  gotten quite used to. Sometimes, we joke about them. My father  is in pretty good health, and is very much concerned with  China's construction, including the entire implementation of the  targets set forth in "China's Agenda 21."    At the news conference, Deng Nan said: Everyone is equal  before Chinese law.    Deng Nan made that point when answering foreign reporters'  questions on the sons and daughters of some cadres in China  abusing their power.    Deng Nan said: You have all learned recently that Li  Xiaoshi, a former vice minister of the State Science and  Technology Commission, was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.  To my knowledge, Li Xiaoshi is also from a senior cadre family  background. To my mind, anyone, either the man on the street or  the son of a senior cadre, so long as he violates the Chinese  law, will be meted out due legal sanction.</p>

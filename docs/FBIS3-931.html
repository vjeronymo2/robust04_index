[passage omitted] [PAC  Secretary General] Benny Alexander said foreign countries which  had previously frozen funds promised to the organisation -- on  condition it renounced violence and committed itself to the  transition process -- would release them.    With little more than a month to go before elections,  sources  say the PAC is battling to obtain funds to run a fully-fledged  election campaign.</p>

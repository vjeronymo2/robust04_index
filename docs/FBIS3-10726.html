			<p>Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle by </F> "24 Horas" program anchorman Bernardo de la Maza at the  Television Nacional de Chile studios on 9 March -- live or  recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [De la Maza] The Codelco  [Copper Corporation] case has undoubtedly tarnished the last  days of President Aylwin's administration. Will it influence  the start of yours?    [Frei] It is a national problem. It does not involve an  administration, it involves our country and it must be solved.    Apart from the proceedings to resolve this case -- which are  being handled by the courts, the office of the comptroller  general, the state defense council, and the Chamber of Deputies  -- the country is interested in our future actions.    We want to establish a very strong modernization process. We  have already begun by not appointing an executive vice  president: Each managing director will be responsible for his  area.    When formed, we will announce the new board of directors. We  will announce it when the new Codelco executive officers are  appointed. We will very strongly encourage the modernization of  this company, which is a key company in the country.    [De la Maza] When one views what happened in Codelco, one  believes it maybe is without solution. It apparently involves a  man who -- acting wrongly -- took the money of Chileans and --  in a nutshell -- speculated on the international markets and  lost more than $200 million in just a few weeks. What can be  done to prevent this type of action?    [Frei] I believe there must be a control system. Every  company in the world ... [changes thought] I am also an  entrepreneur, I have worked for many years in private companies.  There was no control. We must find out why there was no  control.    Within the modernization process, we must clearly establish  responsibilities and ensure that control is applied every day.    [De la Maza] It has been said recently that no one will pay  for this loss, that Chileans will not have to pay it because  there was some reserve money. Do you agree?    [Frei] If Codelco receives less money in the next few years  as future transactions are completed, it is obvious that Chile  will receive less money.    [De la Maza] So all Chileans will have to pay for this loss  in some way.    [Frei] Exactly.    [De la Maza] It has also been said that the Codelco case  negated the idea of loyal and constructive opposition to the  administration of President Patricio Aylwin. Do you agree?    [Frei] I do not. I have spoken with members of the  opposition. I invited the presidents of the two main opposition  parties, Andres Allamand [National Renewal] and Jovino Novoa  [Independent Democratic Union], to dine at my house. We met  when I was elected president. We will work together because I  believe a president must deal with national issues and should  always seek agreement on national issues. We may have different  view points and disagreements, but there are national issues  with which we must deal. As president I will deal with them  from the national point of view. Regarding the opposition, I  would like it to be loyal and constructive; an opposition that  states its differences. In a democratic system it is good to  have a rotation of governments, opposition, and control; and  that is the task of the opposition.    [De la Maza] Do you expect disloyal opposition over the  Codelco case?    [Frei] No. Of course, in a process as complex as the Codelco  case some people may make inappropriate comments. This is part  of our popular tradition but I believe the investigation must  continue.    [De la Maza] As of next Monday you will be the president in  La Moneda Palace. Among the measures you will be unable to  adopt is that of removing the Army commander [General Augusto  Pinochet]. As a democrat how do you feel, faced with this  situation?    [Frei] From the point of view of principles -- as I have  always said -- I would like the president to have that right.  But I respect the Constitution and the laws because this is a  process we started in 1988. We will continue it because , as we  always said, this is how we would do it, this is how we did it,  and this is one of the successful aspects of the transition.    [De la Maza] Will you suggest to General Pinochet that he  leave the Army Command?    [Frei] He has the constitutional right to remain in his post  until 1997. As of 11 March, following my inauguration, ours  will be a relationship appropriate between the president of the  Republic and the Army commander.    [De la Maza] The fact that this situation continues -- a  situation that does not fully coincide with a democratic regime,  along with the situation of appointed senators, etc. -- do you  believe the transition is not fully completed?    [Frei] I believe -- as pointed out in the 1989 program --  that some tasks were established for the transition and some  were established for the next government. Some were not  fulfilled, but we hope to fulfill them during my administration,  including those mentioned. These tasks should be fulfilled  within a framework of agreement, because under those conditions  laws and agreements are permanent and no government will attempt  to change them. We will work on those tasks under that spirit.    [De la Maza] Regarding this and other political reforms,  such  as the electoral law, do you like to move fast or slow?    [Frei] In the appropriate manner because the people are  waiting to see how we will solve their real problems, how we  will work on issues such as poverty, education, health,  environment, and social security -- the big issues.    [De la Maza] Will you move faster on those issues?    [Frei] These issues will have priority. This does not mean  we will forget other issues. Every issue will be dealt with at  the appropriate time. On 21 May [opening of Congress] I will  clearly point this out.    [De la Maza] How can the people interpret your decision to  appoint a socialist as interior minister?    [Frei] I would say this shows the full consolidation of  democracy and that nothing is prohibited for any Chilean.    [De la Maza] As a former businessman -- you are known as a  businessman -- do you believe capitalism is cruel to the poor.    [Frei] Obviously, and this is what we have been trying to  change in this country. In only a few countries has it been  shown that accelerated development is compatible with social  justice and equity. This is what we have been working on during  the last few years. We need investments and efficiency to  overcome poverty, but we also need a real effort because, as I  have said many times in the interior, many Chileans live in  conditions similar to the most developed countries in the world,  while near us many live in misery. From the point of view of  ethics and solidarity, I believe we can and should make an  effort. My government will make an effort.    [De la Maza] President Aylwin provided aid, will you  increase  it or do you feel it is sufficient?    [Frei] I believe we can increase it because the country is  in  a different condition than when Aylwin received the government  in 1989. Agreement has been reached on taxes which allows to  spend more on social issues. I will also propose from the  beginning of my administration -- perhaps make it the number one  priority of my government -- that the struggle against poverty  should be a national issue, not just for the government but for  all sectors of the country. We will invite all sectors --  workers and businessmen -- to a great national crusade against  poverty. In my speech on 12 March, I will announce that I will  preside over the ministers social committee, emphasizing from  the beginning the priority issues of our administration.  [passage omitted]</p>

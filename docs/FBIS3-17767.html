			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Sergey Zheleznyak, including </F> recorded comment by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev; from  the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] [Zheleznyak] A guard of honor welcomed the Russian  defence minister in Bucharest today. Pavel Grachev's visit is  evoking special interest here. I will recall that it was  postponed twice, the last time because of the broad anti-Russian  campaign started by the opposition last December. The  cancellation of the visit obviously disappointed the official  authorities at the time. For more than two years our countries  did not have any agreements on military cooperation. Bucharest  does not hide the fact that it sees its security only under  NATO's roof. Romania was the first to sign the Partnership for  Peace Treaty with it. At the same time, despite all kinds of  statements on its striving toward military cooperation with the  West, Romania understands perfectly well that it cannot do  without an accord on military cooperation with its most powerful  neighbor in the east. Today, Pavel Grachev and Romanian Defense  Minister Gheorghe Tinca discussed and signed such a document.    [Grachev] It is a comprehensive treaty that presupposes a  resumption of the most normal relations with the sovereign state  of Romania.    [Zheleznyak] Technical cooperation is of special interest to  Romania. Its Army is equipped with artillery, tanks, aircraft,  and other Soviet-made hardware. The country has no money to  replace it, but spares and ammunition are needed to keep the  military hardware in operational condition. The Russian defense  minister plans to attend military exercises and meet the  president and prime minister of Romania.</p>

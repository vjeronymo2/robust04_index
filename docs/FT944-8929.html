			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Thomson expands in electronic publishing with Dollars 339m deal Canada's Thomson Corporation is further expanding its electronic publishing business by offering to pay USDollars 339m for Medstat, a Michigan-based group which collects and analyses medical claims data. The Medstat purchase follows Thomson's Dollars 465m acquisition of Information Access Company from Ziff Communications of California. Electronic publishing is one of the fastest-growing areas of the publishing business. 'Demand is ahead of the market's ability to supply,' one Toronto analyst said yesterday. Medstat, which is listed on Nasdaq, earned Dollars 7.4m in the year to September 30 on revenues of Dollars 64.9m, making the purchase price equal to more than five times revenues. Some observers earlier expressed concern at the high multiple, about 3.5 times annual revenues, which Thomson paid for IAC. Company officials told analysts earlier this week that they expected the IAC acquisition to pay for itself within 11 years, and to be worth at least two or three times the purchase price by then. Medstat provides a number of services based on health-care data. They include databases supplied to government agencies and research groups, and claims information to large employers, insurance companies and others with an interest in holding down healthcare costs. Thomson plans to make a cash tender offer for all outstanding Medstat common shares at Dollars 27 a share. Medstat's chief executive, Mr Ernest Ludy, who founded the company in 1981 and owns about 11 per cent of the stock, has agreed to tender his shares. Medstat's senior managers have agreed to stay on after the acquisition. Thomson was able to use cash on hand to pay for IAC. The Medstat purchase may require it to raise some debt, but the analyst said that 'their debt-to-equity is not out of line, and they have to take advantage of the opportunities'.</p>

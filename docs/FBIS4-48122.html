			<p>BFN     [Text] Schweizer-Reneke May 11 SAPA -- Damage to an Eskom  [Electricity Supply Commission] transformer in Schweizer-Reneke  on Wednesday [11 May] night was caused by an electrical fault  and not sabotage as at first feared, Town Clerk Bertus  Engelbrecht told SAPA.    He said an Eskom transformer failed and a municipal  transformer was subsequently damaged. "The police routinely  investigate any explosion, but in this case the problem was an  electrical one," he said. He said Eskom had by late Wednesday  night begun repairs and that power to the north west town should  be restored by Thursday afternoon.</p>

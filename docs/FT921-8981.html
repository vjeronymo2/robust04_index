			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Pioneer declines 5.8% in spite of small sales rise PIONEER ELECTRONIC, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday reported a 5.8 per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits in the third quarter, which ended in December, as a modest rise in sales was offset by the higher value of the yen. Sales advanced by 6 per cent to Y185.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn), while pre-tax profits declined 5.8 per cent to Y24.7bn. Net income after tax dropped by 5.5 per cent to Y12.5bn. Although audio product sales were strong in Japan, European sales were hit by the high value of the yen. Video product sales were strong because of the success of compact stereo systems which incorporate laser disc players. Sales of laser disc equipment, used for karaoke sing-along systems, rose overseas. Car electronics products were lifted by sales of car navigation systems installed in new vehicles. Although sales of car stereo equipment were weak in Japan, overseas sales were helped by a new anti-theft system. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, pre-tax profits were down by 15.8 per cent to Y53.4bn, while sales rose by 2.4 per cent to Y466.4bn.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Hobby horses for learners - Polo is a difficult game to master. Keith Wheatley visits a business which teaches beginners to handle a mallet POLO IS NOT an easy sport to get started in. The game itself is so exciting that any spectator would be tempted to climb up on a pony, swinging a stick with HRH and the best of them. Deep pockets are an initial requirement. A basic equipe of two ponies, trailer, clothing and membership of a UK club would probably cost around Pounds 10,000. Even if the cash is available for a debut - and plenty of complete beginners buy expensive boats to go yacht racing in - there is the ghastly ordeal of being a highly visible novice in a team of only four. As the summer polo season reaches its height there would quite possibly be a sizeable crowd on the touchline, their passing interest in polo fuelled by Jilly Cooper's 'jodhpur-ripping' best-sellers. 'I have an occasional nightmare of being on stage in an orchestra, in front of a large audience, with a violin in my hands which I can't play. That must approximate to a first game of polo at a member's club,' laughed Anthea Hartley of the Chiltern Polo Centre, based at her home, Lower Bassibones Farm, near Great Missenden 30 miles north-west of London. Last year she began to turn the family hobby (four Hartley children aged 12 to 19 all play Pony Club polo) into a business. Her concept was to use the barns, stables and 65 acres of pasture at the farm to open polo's equivalent of the golf driving range. 'Beginners and people who can't afford the grand end of polo give us our market,' said Anthea. Three evenings a week in the summer there are group classes where anything up to 15 people pay Pounds 40 for two hours instruction, including the use of a pony. Polo has to be safety-conscious. The possibilities for calamity with horses colliding at 30 mph is very real. So one of the earliest classes is a rules session on a green table-top - complete with plastic ponies  - marked out as a polo field. In a barn that also doubles as a dormitory during residential courses for younger players, a mixed group of pupils ranging from a local builder to a Peat Marwick accountant, pore over the display and discuss tactics with New Zealand instructor and professional player Simon Hill. But even at a first lesson our tyro player gets to mount up and a play a chukka, one of the seven-minute spells of intense action which make up a match. In the gossip columns it may be the Princess of Wales waiting behind the goal line, chez Hartley it is more likely to be son Toby, 17, patrolling with a hockey stick to stop the ball being lost in a nettle bank. While after-work tuition on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays is the backbone of the business, Chiltern Polo Centre has its bespoke side. One northern businessman, challenged to play by a colleague but without any previous experience, recently booked three days of one-to-one tuition. A team from the Quorn, challenged to polo by another hunt, took a crash course. Other healthy sources of revenue are affluent Nigerians and Ghanains sent to England by indulgent fathers and anxious to learn polo for the social status it confers in west Africa. 'Word of mouth is important but we advertise every week in Horse &amp; Hound (the weekly magazine that is a bible in equestrian circles) and that is our primary source of new clients,' said Hartley, adding that she spends just under Pounds 3,000 a year with the magazine. Referrals from polo clubs themselves are increasing. 'I doubt the really grand clubs even know we exist but the others are beginning to send one or two beginners to us,' she said. Instructors are paid on a freelance basis but the yard has two full-time staff during the season. They undertake a small amount of livery and schooling for more experienced players looking for a place to keep polo ponies. Using these, plus her children's mounts, gives Anthea Hartley the ability to maintain the large number of ponies a school requires at relatively low capital cost. An additional bonus is that as the polo bug bites deeper into its victim, a pupil often becomes a pony-owner with an animal to be kept at livery, creating more revenue for the centre. These people are far from plutocrats. One regular arrives on summer evenings with his polo sticks (Pounds 55 each) strapped to his motorcycle. 'My son played via the Pony Club and I got talked into having a go,' said Malcolm Stirling, 39. 'Now it's become a terrible obsession, I've bought a pony, and I have to come here for these weekly therapy sessions.' Robert Colin, a loss adjuster from Ealing, west London, booked a lesson on impulse last summer, after browsing through Horse &amp; Hound. Now he admits, in the confessional tones of a compulsive gambler, that polo takes up all his spare time and money - around Pounds 700 in an average month. 'It's just all-consuming,' says Colin, 35. Geoff Hartley, Anthea's husband is a successful businessman and a committed non-equestrian. He does the books for the polo school and declares it to be 'already breaking even, with the potential to be profitable.' From the family's point of view it enables them to enjoy a passionately loved - and very expensive - hobby at no direct cost. 'Polo and kids is a bit like school fees,' said Hartley. 'If you thought about what it was going to cost overall you'd never educate them at all.' Chiltern Polo Centre, Lower Bassibones Farm, Lee Common, Great Missenden, Bucks. Tel: 0494-837798.</p>

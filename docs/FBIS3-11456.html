			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  today left an apparent sensation of confusion over the  pharmaceutical patents law insistently claimed by the United  States. While he said that without the approval of this law it  would be "impossible" for Argentina to join the North American  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), he at the same time played down  the idea that the delay in approving the law would dramatically  influence things, considering that all the pressures so far  received are but "warnings."    The contradictory concepts became apparent during a news  conference given by Menem at Government House a few moments  before receiving in his office U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who  arrived in Argentina to speak precisely about the need for  Argentina to have a law on pharmaceutical patents rights  acknowledging the rights of foreign inventions, as well as about  the dangers of corruption and drug trafficking.    During the news conference President Menem gave his opinion  that approval of a law on pharmaceutical patents rights "does  not represent an absolute condition" by the United States for  Argentina to access NAFTA, while a little after he added that  "in principle there is no possibility that Argentina could join  NAFTA if the pharmaceutical patents rights law is not approved  first."    Afterward Menem said that the claims and connections between  the approval of the law and joining NAFTA "are simply a kind of  warning about our relations," noting that "the Argentine  Government is doing the same with the U.S. Government regarding  agricultural subsidies."    Instead of clarifying the Argentine position regarding this  controversial subject, Menem's statements really contributed to  generating greater confusion among those who, soon after he made  his statements, began to closely read and analyze them.    The president said that the draft law on pharmaceutical  patents rights "is one of the promises we made to the U.S.  Government two and a half years ago, when Carla Hills was U.S.  trade representative," adding that "since then we have been  making efforts to get Congress to approve the law."    On another subject, Menem again denied the possibility that  the opening up of labor laws will be imposed by decree, and said  that the government expects the bill "to be approved by  consensus in Congress."    The Argentine president also noted statements by Eduardo  Bauza, secretary general of the presidency, that the candidates  for Menem's vice president are Vicente Joga, Ruben Marin, and  Eduardo Duhalde.    Menem said: "In a party like the Justicialist Party, and in  a full democracy, those who decide on the presidential ticket  are not the leaders but the party members."    Further on, Menem spoke about former British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher, saying that "she was too outspoken when she  said that Argentina's return to democracy is partly due to her."    He described her statements as "absurd and aggressive,"  considering them "things one has to listen to and then be silent  about, as they make no sense."    "Here we live in democracy and freedom thanks to the  Argentine people, and in no way thanks to Mrs. Thatcher," he  stated.    Menem said that the Malvinas war "was not the unleashing  factor that made Argentina return to democracy and freedom. It  was the people's permanent and constant struggle that made  tyrannies lose their validity, here as in any part of the world."    Asked whether Thatcher's presence in Chile would affect  relations between Chile and Argentina, Menem said that relations  "have never been as good as they are now," adding that relations  "at the Armed Forces level are really spectacular."    On another subject, Menem said he does not share the belief  of Radical Civic Union leader Leopoldo Moreau, who said that the  Constituent Assembly should place all judges on availability  status [en comision].    "This is an entirely unwise statement which is not in  keeping  with the current terms referred to in the Constitution," he said.    As for the medical checkup he will undergo tomorrow at the  Buenos Aires Cardiovascular Institute, Menem said it was  "routine," adding that "I have had them ever since I came to the  presidency."    "The thing is that they are now more significant, following  the carotid surgery I underwent last October," Menem stated.    He also said on that on 1 May he will announce during his  message to Congress the implementation of a three-year plan that  will extend through 1996.    "All the conditions are ready to announce something of this  kind through 1996 or perhaps 2000," he said, adding that "we  have had a zero inflation rate since last year."    Menem then said that he was aware of the charges by nun  Martha Pelloni regarding the alleged sale of babies in  Corrientes Province.    He said that "a charge of this kind, in which several  organizations are mentioned, is worrisome" adding that "the  subject is being investigated."</p>

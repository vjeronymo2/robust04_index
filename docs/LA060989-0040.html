			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Holy Pirating, Robin! "Batman" and Warner Bros. have declared war on video  piracy. When Warner's new "Batman" film opens June 23, every one of the 4,000  worldwide theatrical prints will bear an identification marking code to enable  the tracing of illegally duplicated videocassettes. Warner has used this system  on past releases with positive results. The encoded serial marking -- not  readily visible -- is detectable in all pirated film-to-video and subsequent  video-to-video transfers, which allows Warner Bros. and Motion Picture Assn.  investigators to identify the source of pirated copies. Warner Bros., joined by  other film companies, has raided more than 3,799 pirate establishments  worldwide -- 211 in the U.S. alone in the last year. Film piracy may constitute  a felony with a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and/or a $250,000  fine. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

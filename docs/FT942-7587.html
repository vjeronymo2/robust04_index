			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Leadership Contest: Blair seeks to repair ripped social fabric It was a curious venue for the man who may be the next leader of the Labour party. In the neo-something splendour of a Westminster hotel ballroom, Mr Tony Blair yesterday addressed academics, social workers and community police officers. His host was the free-market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. His subject: crime and the family. Mr Blair had made it clear that his first speech since the death of John Smith was not to be seen as the opening shot in his leadership campaign. Formally, that must wait until after the European elections. But Mr Gordon Brown, his friend and rival for the modernisers' ticket, had already staked out his claim at the Welsh Labour conference. Mr Brown, who looks less likely by the day to step aside for Mr Blair, plans another important speech this weekend. Mr John Prescott, determined to stand as a candidate of the left, will put his case in an address tomorrow to the Prison Officers' Association. So the narrow remit of Mr Blair's subject and his feigned irritation with the television cameras did not prevent the 41-year-old shadow home secretary from setting out his ideological stall. His reputation as one of Labour's leading 'modernisers' rests on his efforts during the past few years to construct a new philosophical compass for the party. Like the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s, he judges that if a political party puts in place a firm strategic framework for its ambitions, the detailed policymaking tends to look after itself. His thesis yesterday was straightforward. For the past 15 years the prevailing ideology had been one that promoted the interests of the individual above everything else. It has been based on a fundamental flaw. Thatcherism, Mr Blair contended, missed the point that the individual cannot escape from the environment in which he or she lives. Unfettered liberalism produced an atomised society. Mass unemployment, crime, drug abuse, poor education and poverty were all signs that the social fabric had been ripped apart. To take the specific example the IEA conference was addressing, individual security had been severely curtailed by rising crime. People could not prosper without a stable, cohesive society. Mr Blair offered the Labour modernisers' prescription. It was not a return to the centralist collectivism of earlier stages of socialism: 'The task of the left is not to replace this crude individualism with old notions of an overbearing paternalistic state.' Nor was it based on the simplistic notion that individuals could escape responsibility for their actions by pinning the blame for anti-social behaviour on unemployment or poverty. Rights brought responsibilities. Instead, Labour wanted social action - through private-sector and voluntary, as well as government initiatives - as the route to individual opportunity. Housing, education and social policies would be tailored to that central ambition. The audience applauded warmly. Mr Blair must hope that his own party will be as receptive.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Strikers picket British Museum Exhibition of solidarity: strikers picketed the British Museum yesterday as civil servants in London stopped work for a day, Michael Smith writes. The museum and the Tate Gallery were closed to the public, and a picket was mounted outside Downing Street. The two largest Civil Service unions claimed that at least half of their members in the capital staged a one-day strike in a dispute over London weighting allowances. Government departments dismissed the claim, saying most offices were open, although some provided restricted services. The Department of Employment said less than a quarter of its 7,200 London staff obeyed the strike call by the NUCPS and CPSA unions. Sixteen out of 167 of its offices were closed to the public. The closures included two Jobcentres. Customs and Excise said 1,357 of its London staff, representing 18 per cent of the full complement, went on strike. It had to put an 'honesty box' for passengers at Heathrow airport's terminal 4, but most passengers elsewhere were subjected to normal checks. The unions said they would seek a meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to begin 'serious negotiations' on the Treasury's refusal to raise weighting allowances. The allowances, last raised four years ago, are Pounds 1,750 for working in central London, Pounds 1,000 for five miles to 10 miles from the centre and Pounds 725 for 10 miles to 18 miles out. They are lower than for most other workers, but the Treasury says it has improved basic pay substantially for many staff and has introduced local pay additions for jobs with recruitment and retention difficulties.</p>

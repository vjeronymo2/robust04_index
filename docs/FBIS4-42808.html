			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "D.N.": "Clear Majority for Membership?"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- The dramatic final period before the  European Union [EU] referendum next Sunday [12 June]: From a  summary of three Ifes [Institute for Empirical Social Research]  polls that were conducted over the past three weeks, Ifes head  Ernst Gehmacher reaches the conclusion that there is a clear  trend among those who are thus far undecided: The majority of  them will vote for EU membership at the referendum.    Yesterday, Monday, at a press conference Gehmacher said: "A  negative result would be conceivable only if something important  happens during the final stage" that would produce a protest  against the government parties or a "profound influx of  pessimism." As an example, he cited the collapse of a large  company.    The decisive thing is to what extent voters can be mobilized  during the last days. If the turnout for the EU referendum is  85 percent, Gehmacher even expects 56 percent to vote for  membership. Only if the turnout were 60 percent "would the  result be very narrow." However, the sociologist thinks: "Such  a low turnout is no longer very likely."    According to the results obtained by Ifes, the ratio of  those  who are firmly determined to vote for or against EU membership  is 31:31. However, among those who are still undecided, those  who sympathize with EU membership are in the majority. This  trend has developed over the past three weeks.    The reason: The entire "establishment," from the church to  the trade unions, advocates EU membership. "It has been  possible to produce a climate of opinion that says one should  vote for EU membership," Gehrmacher said at the press conference.    Gehmacher stressed that the attitude toward the EU is  primarily determined by whether or not economic trends in  Austria over the next five years is seen positively. A total  of 58 percent of the optimists are firmly determined to vote for  membership. In contrast, 61 percent of the pessimists say that  they will vote against EU membership at the referendum.    According to this Ifes classification, those skeptical about  the future are the largest group of the population -- 52  percent. A total of 45 percent of them are still uncertain.  Mobilizing this group would result in a clear increase in yes  votes, Gehmacher said.</p>

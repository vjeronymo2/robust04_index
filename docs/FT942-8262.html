			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Call on exam standards Sales agents in the pensions and insurance industry should be made to sit examinations invigilated by independent experts rather than their own companies, according to Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive of BAT Industries which is one of the UK's biggest insurers, Peter Marsh writes. Voicing general concern about the standards for training and competence proposed by the new Personal Investment Authority, Mr Broughton said external invigilation was one way to assure the public that the industry was operating ethically. BAT, which owns the insurers Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, has still to decide whether to join the authority, which is due to take over in the summer as the umbrella regulatory organisation to protect the private investor. In recent months BAT had proposed specific suggestions to the authority for improving its standards on training, but the discussions had come to nothing, Mr Broughton said in an interview. Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of the Lautro insurance watchdog which is to be subsumed into the new authority, said the idea of external invigilation was a 'red herring' because many companies had improved their training standards under Lautro guidance in the past two years. Critics have said that in the past, sales agents have lacked expertise about available products and also been under intense pressure to sell because most of them are paid on a commission basis.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, Feb 3 (AFP) -- The Spanish and Danish  foreign ministers indicated Thursday [3 February] that a  decision on sanctions against Croatia was imminent, as Zagreb  continued to deny the presence of its troops in Bosnia.    Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana issued his warning  after meeting here with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic.    Solana said that if reports of regular Croatian troops being  involved in fighting in Bosnia turned out to be true, "the  international community will have to seriously examine the  issue" of sanctions, the Croatian news agency HINA reported.    Valentic rejected the charges and said that "the  international community's pressure for a peaceful settlement  must be applied evenly on all warring parties," the agency added.    Zagreb has acknowledged that up to 2,000 "volunteers" --  mostly Croats of Bosnian origin -- were fighting alongside  Bosnian Croat (HVO) forces in Bosnia, but said that no active  regular army troops were involved.    Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said in Rome Thursday  that although some of the Bosnia "volunteers" were former  soldiers and officers, there were no regular Croatian forces  serving there.    Zagreb had no intention of intervening in the Bosnian  conflict, he said after a meeting with his Italian counterpart  Beniamino Andreatta, adding that the number of volunteer  fighters on the Moslem side was much higher.    Andreatta earlier told Italy's parliamentary foreign affairs  committee that, if reports of the presence of regular Croatian  troops in Bosnia were correct, there were dangers of a  "substantial change in the attitude of the international  community towards Croatia."    He added: "The position of Italy and other European  countries, who have until now forcefully rejected calls for a  lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems, would  risk being weakened."    Meanwhile in Copenhagen Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg  Petersen said that "the United Nations should impose sanctions  against Croatia because of its military involvement in Bosnia."    He said Denmark would appeal for sanctions at the European  Community's foreign minister-level meeting in Brussels Monday,  and would also propose, as an alternative, the lifting of  Croatia's preferential trade status with the EC.    Although he admitted that opinions are divided within the  EC,  he said Denmark felt that the presence of Croatian troops in  Bosnia "should not go unnoticed."    After his meeting with Valentic Thursday, Solana was to meet  with UN special envoy in ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi before  heading back to Madrid.    He had earlier visited the Spanish UN peacekeeping  contingent  in Medjugorje, in southern Bosnia.</p>

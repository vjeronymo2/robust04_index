			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Fundamental shift occurring in world pulp industry A FUNDAMENTAL shift in the pulp industry is occurring between the northern and southern hemispheres. The southern hemisphere, mostly South America and Asia, will become the world's forest plantation and pulp factory, while the north will increasingly supply specialist papers, said Mr Erling Lorentzen, chairman of Aracruz Celulose, the largest South American pulp group. The warning has serious implications for pulp and paper industries in Scandinavia and North America. Forestry represents 40 per cent of Finland's exports, 20 per cent of Sweden's and 15 per cent of Canada's. Mr Lorentzen, addressing the Financial Times pulp and paper conference in London, said he doubted one company could embrace the skills needed for large-scale pulp production and manufacture and marketing of paper. Paper production would be concentrated near customer markets, to keep costs low and satisfy clients' delivery needs. But northern hemisphere pulp manufacturers were at a disadvantage and would have to rationalise. Those most threatened were high cost producers. Production costs per tonne for bleached hardwood kraft pulp were Dollars 247 in Brazil, Dollars 300 in Finland, Dollars 365 in Sweden and Dollars 370 in Canada. The most important component was the cost of wood. Brazilian plantations were more productive than those in the northern hemisphere. Eucalyptus takes about seven years to harvest, against as much as 60 years for pine in Scandinavia. Substitution of eucalyptus for bleached northern kraft pulp is already occurring, the market research company Hawkins Wright, says. Eucalyptus has increased its market share by 800,000 tonnes between 1989 and last year; bleached northern kraft pulp lost nearly 1m tonnes. The recession and rising environmental demands would speed rationalisation, Mr Lorentzen warned. Hawkins Wright says world demand for chemical market pulp rose 1.7 per cent between 1987 and 1992 from 26.1m tonnes to 27.8m. Capacity rose 5.3 per cent from 26.7m to 32m.</p>

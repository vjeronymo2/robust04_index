Was all  of this an accident?    [Aniyar] Yes, these are the pitfalls of life. It was not in  my plans for it to end this way. I did indeed engage in politics  when I was very young. At the end of the dictatorship, I served  for three years in the Legislative Assembly of the State of  Zulia, but this was so many years ago that, practically  speaking, it is no longer a part of my life--just a memory. I  have devoted all of my time to the university. Almost without  realizing it, I found myself involved in the world of politics,  because if one feels one is in direct contact with the problems  of the country, as one should be, the time comes when one cannot  abstain from setting his hand to the possible solution of those  problems. And one day, I realized that, almost without knowing  how, I had accepted the government candidacy, and now I find  myself the governor-elect. All of these things continue to  surprise me, because in my political life, I have always been a  spectator. I watched myself and what was happening to me as if I  were observing it all from the outside.    [Saldivia] You still do not see from within?    [Aniyar] I know that I am on the inside, but I have a  strange  ability to see myself from the outside.    [Saldivia] And how do you see yourself?    [Aniyar] As an individual attempting to battle for the  things  in which she believes, in a political world in which almost no  one believes in these things. The proof that this is so is that  despite the fact that there have been very clear victories in  these elections, and the people have indicated that they still  see a potential in democracy, I am currently witnessing actions  by the traditional old politicians who do not know how to lose,  and who are trying to muddy a process that was clear and honest.  And thus one wonders if there are still participants in this old  political story who are finding it hard to accept defeat, who  are clinging to the old procedures, and who do not see what is  happening in the country.    [Saldivia] What is happening in Zulia?    [Aniyar] The same thing that is happening all over the  country. There is a great sense of weariness with the  corruption, the omnipotence, and the imported macroeconomic  schemes that have nothing to do with the reality here, as well  as rage at the total crisis.    [Saldivia] Why did the COPEI [Social Christian Party] lose,  while a year ago, it won yet again? Was Oswaldo Alvarez Paz  simply the winner?    [Aniyar] Zulia is a state that has always pursued a search  for alternative leaderships, which were not always available to  it. An opportunity came when Luis Homez ran as a candidate for  government office, but it died at the end of the electoral  campaign. From that time on, no alternative leadership was  available until mine emerged.    [Saldivia] Who was the last MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]  candidate?    [Aniyar] Juvencio Pulgar, of course, together with Oswaldo  Alvarez Paz today. And I have the impression that he won the  votes that Oswaldo Alvarez Paz still had away from him.    [Saldivia] What are the specific problems pertaining to your  election today?    [Aniyar] The election results have been recognized by all  the  parties except the COPEI. The obstacle is the fact that Leonardo  Ferrer does not want to admit he lost and came in third. He went  to the CSE [Supreme Electoral Council] to demand that it impugn  400 election certificates. This is very funny, because those who  are challenging these documents are alleging electoral crimes  committed by people in their own party. It was they who were the  presidents and secretaries of the election boards--those who  doubtless gave the orders to affix one more signature, or one  less seal. This plot was organized well in advance, because they  knew four months ago when I entered the contest that I was  leading in the polls. Do you want me to tell you the truth? What  is happening is that they are trying to put matters in order  before I take government office. There is great concern because  I have said that I am going to ask for an audit. I have had no  input in the 1994 budget, which will cover a half of my term of  office. It is made up of current and payroll expenditures, with  a minimum amount for investment--and that, by the way, is being  seriously threatened. This is very serious, because if I cannot  express my views about the budget that is going to govern my  administration, this will prevent me from resolving any of the  problems of the state. They are working to ruin my  administration. What we are seeing is a delaying maneuver.    [Saldivia] What do you mean by the phrase "putting matters  in  order"? Do you believe, then, that Oswaldo Alvarez Paz has  embarked upon some peculiar manipulation process?    [Aniyar] Yes. This government in Zulia is known as the  10-percent government. It turned into the 20-percent government  as the campaign approached, thanks to the tribute exacted from  the public works contractors. Incidentally, one of the elements  in my electoral campaign, which was of course oriented toward  explaining that it is possible to govern without corruption, was  precisely a specific offer to resolve the problem of harassment  and commissions on public projects. That, among other things.  The payrolls here have been artificially inflated. The names of  individuals who are not experts in their sectors have been  added. For example, there are individuals on the orchestra  payroll who are not musicians. They have just nervously sworn in  more than 500 individuals who were allegedly hired some time  ago. It must be presumed that the accounting processes were  backdated. Officials are giving jobs to their friends, to their  little party comrades. This is extremely serious. This  phenomenon can be seen in other state governments as well, and  it is very difficult to change because of this evil tradition of  inflating the payrolls. Each governor brings in his own team and  then, when he departs, leaves it behind.    [Saldivia] And with what team will you be working? That left  behind by Oswaldo Alvarez Paz?    [Aniyar] With the decent team Oswaldo left behind and  staffers other governors left in place. With the exception of  the top segment of the payroll, which will be made up of my  trusted advisers. But I will not allow anyone to be included on  the official payroll who has been put there fraudulently, or who  is not actually working.    [Saldivia] Do you plan to maintain some distance from the  MAS  in your work in the government, as Governor Tablante did?    [Aniyar] No, I have a staff already selected, and it is  basically independent. There is one MAS member and one from the  Convergence, while the others are independents. They are all  people whose orientation in politics is similar to mine and to  that of the MAS. Because it must be realized that they all have  the same point of view about an alternative in politics. They  are all individuals with a 21st-century mentality. I am an  independent, but this does not mean that I will turn my back on  the MAS in governing, because it has provided me with good  support and an excellent apprenticeship in honesty and political  commitment. All I have learned I learned in the MAS faction as a  senator. Therefore, the counsel of the MAS continues to be  welcomed, but my independence is not to be challenged.    [Saldivia] What mistakes that the MAS governors made do you  plan to avoid repeating?    [Aniyar] I do not think there were errors. Each governor has  his own way of doing things. I am not like Tablante, but I have  seen that he developed a government with very effective social  policies that I would like to understand fully so as to use them  if they are suitable for Zulia. In the same way, the policies  implemented by Andres Velasquez in Bolivar were effective. And I  can also learn about some things done in the health sector in  the states of Anzoategui and Carabobo, and about what has been  done in education in Bolivar and Merida.    [Saldivia] Could it be said that you owe your place in  government to Jaime Lusinchi, because of the role you played  with regard to the accusations made?    [Aniyar] No, because this is not the only thing I have done  in my political life. I did extraordinary work (and I do not  feel immodest in saying so) in the health sector when I served  as president of the Senate Health Commission for two years. We  faced up to the need for a complete package in the health  sector, a life-and-death issue. And that is the proper term for  it. In this connection, I was able to make contact with the most  dramatic reality--the life and death of the individual citizen.  I believe that it was this--the possibility of having some  impact in this sector--that led me to accept, deep within  myself, the candidacy for government office. In addition, I have  a long history as a university professor in the state of Zulia,  and a 10-year career as a writer for the local daily newspapers.  This has created for me a host of invisible friends, as Uslar  Pietri has said.    [Saldivia] Are you the moral conscience of Zulia?    [Aniyar] I do not know. That seems a bit of an exaggeration.  I am indeed seen as occupying a different position, from the  point of view of stating and interpreting matters, and as a  result I have succeeded in identifying with many citizens.    [Saldivia] Didn't Alvarez Paz do more good for Zulia than  the  personally appointed governors?    [Aniyar] Absolutely not.    [Saldivia] Do you mean that the process of direct election  is  only beginning to serve Zulia now?    [Aniyar] No. The situation in Zulia is very special. I say  that Zulia is like a country.    [Saldivia] The people will think you are a separatist.    [Aniyar] Zulia has declared itself an independent republic  three times in history.    [Saldivia] And do you advocate this?    [Aniyar] No, but that is what the history of Zulia shows,  and  the citizens of Zulia have always wanted to be different from  the citizens of the rest of the country. Oswaldo discovered that  this was an important thing for Zulia, and he greatly encouraged  this state feeling. He exploited the sense of loyalty to Zulia,  the feeling that Zulia has given everything and received  nothing, because the country lives off the production of Zulia,  its oil and farm output, while it only receives the same as any  other sad state in the country. That is the truth, and at the  present time, Zulia is one of the 10 poorest states in  Venezuela. Oswaldo speculated with this situation, and said that  he would make Zulia "the seat of Venezuela." However, what he  did was to make it the poorest place in Venezuela, because the  figures now reveal a catastrophic situation. He described  himself as the first citizen of Zulia, which was quite offensive  to the people of Zulia. He promulgated some ostentatious  measures, for example his decree that the history and geography  of Zulia would be studied in the schools. This was a plan, by  the way, that was never realized. He created a state flag, and  in the last electoral campaign, everything was based on the fact  that Zulia would have a president. He speculated with this  situation, and neglected the concrete real situation being  experienced by the Zulian citizen, who saw that everything was  catastrophic. The citizen of Zulia is a very emotional  individual, and this was the reason for the voting support I had  in Zulia.    [Saldivia] Are you planning on an administration of two or  five years?    [Aniyar] My hope is for five, to parallel the five years of  President Caldera's constitutional mandate. A two-year  administration makes no sense, for one can only begin to work in  that time. And so I hope that this confidence in me will last,  despite the obstacles being placed in my way. I believe that it  will last, because the vote of the Zulian citizen is very  emotional, and those who voted for me were emotional as well. In  fact, there were a number of Oswaldo-Lolita votes. The people do  not vote a straight ticket. That has come to an end in  Venezuela. There were also Claudio-Lolita and Andres  Velasquez-Lolita votes, because Causa R instructed its  supporters to vote for me. And, of course, there were many  Caldera-Lolita votes.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> One person is murdered every three hours in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest  city, and homicide is the main cause of death among adult males in the country  as a whole, according to a U.N. report prepared for the current session of the  U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The 39-page document calls Colombia's  record of violence "astounding." There were 3,413 violent deaths with political  motives between January and October last year, according to a two-member U.N.  team that visited Colombia in October. Medellin is the base of a cartel  believed to control much of the world's illegal cocaine trade.  </P></p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian bank float attracts strong demand ITALIAN investors defied a lacklustre stock market and pre-election blues to turn the country's biggest initial public share offering - for 20 per cent of Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the leading Italian bank - into a roaring success, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The deal, launched on Monday, was closed early yesterday on account of strong demand. Demand in Italy alone at the end of the first day exceeded the 125m shares on offer, while foreign investors bid for over L550bn of shares, equivalent to 36 per cent of the deal, according to preliminary figures from Mediobanca, the lead manager. Under Italy's new rules on public share offerings, the issue had to be kept open for at least two days. Some 67,000 applications were received in Italy alone by the end of the first day, reflecting the strong retail interest in the deal, while around 800 institutional investors applied from outside Italy. San Paolo's own clients were among the keenest buyers. Demand from customers exceeded 30 per cent of the overall value of the deal, meaning that other allocations would have to be scaled down to fulfil a pledge that customers would be allocated at least 30 per cent of the shares.</p>

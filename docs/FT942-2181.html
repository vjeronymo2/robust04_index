			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Chinese authorities urge restraint China has told World Cup fans to turn their TVs low and stop shouting 'Goal]' late at night. China did not qualify for the finals, but millions of soccer followers are staying up late to watch matches live on state-run television. In a front-page commentary, the Communist Party's People's Daily told fans: 'Keep the TV down low. When you see a great goal, keep your emotions under control. Don't shout loudly or applaud.' Fans were urged to 'guard against accidents happening (at work) because of lack of sleep.' The time difference between China and the US means that many of the matches are broadcast in the small hours of the morning.</p>

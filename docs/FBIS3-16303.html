			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow-Kiev -- Speaking to a UNIAN correspondent  today, Russia's Ambassador-at-Large Yuriy Dubinin, who is  heading the Russian state delegation at the negotiations on the  Black Sea Fleet, refuted a Radio Liberty report which quoted him  as saying that Russia has no intention of taking an inventory of  the Black Sea Fleet, as well as a report by the same radio  station on "Ukraine's reluctance to abide by last year's  Massandra accords." Yuriy Dubinin refused to give his opinion  on the fleet's inventory insisted on by the Ukrainian side but  stressed that the issue is within the competence of the  Ukrainian and Russian delegations. "Any attempts to turn the  Black Sea Fleet negotiations into a shoot-out by unilateral and  public statements will have little effect," he said.  "Undoubtedly, [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk's proposals  on the fleet will be discussed. The final date for a meeting  between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations has not yet been  set."    Speaking on the Black Sea Fleet issue, Ukraine's former  defense minister, Kostyantyn Morozov, told UNIAN today that the  sides must first fulfill their previous obligations. "The fleet  must be divided by 1995, and its non-Ukrainian part must leave  the territory of Ukraine, in which Russia can count on our  assistance," Kostyantyn Morozov stressed. "I am convinced it  would be unreasonable to drag this problem into the next  century." He also emphasized the lack of grounds behind  Moscow's allegations that Ukraine is not abiding by the  Massandra accords. "We don't know any such accords. The  Russian side means the verbal agreements between Presidents  Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin which are not accords as such  but merely a reflection of their common view on the negotiation  process." The main premise in this process, the former minister  believes, should be Ukraine's legislation and security.</p>

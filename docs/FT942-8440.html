			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Personal View: High on dividends, low on investment There is currently much concern about the low level of investment in the UK and the impact of government policies on investment. Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, is conducting a review of the effects of taxation on savings and the flow of funds to companies. Further attention has been drawn to company investment by the recent report of the House of Commons trade and industry select committee. A specific aspect of this debate which has come to the fore is the possible link between high dividend payments and low investment spending. Could it be more than coincidence that the UK company sector has high dividend payouts and low investment? The traditional view within economics is that high dividend payouts should be irrelevant for investment. Companies that have attractive investment projects but not enough internal finance from retained profits should be able to raise suitable external finance, from debt or new share issues, in well-functioning capital markets. Given the expected return on investment, neither the level of current profits, nor the share paid out as dividends, should influence investment levels. Recent econometric evidence has tended to reject this view. This is confirmed by our analysis of the investment spending of 626 quoted manufacturing companies. We found that availability of internal funds does affect investment spending for a significant fraction of companies. This is consistent with other evidence. For example, the Confederation of British Industry trends survey consistently shows that a shortage of internal finance is perceived to be a significant factor limiting investment spending. This suggests many companies find external sources of investment finance more expensive than internal funds. We are not suggesting that this reflects any failing of the UK financial system. Financial constraints on investment spending may be the inevitable consequence of differential information. What this research does indicate is that policies which reduce the availability of internal finance are likely to have an adverse impact on company investment. High company taxes are an obvious cause for concern. Corporation tax revenue has increased by about 50 per cent in real terms since Lord Lawson's 1984 reform. This increase in company tax payments has done nothing to help investment spending; it has reduced the post-tax return on investment and reduced the availability of internal funds. Our study also suggests that high dividend payouts will directly reduce investment for companies whose investment spending is limited by a shortage of internal finance. This adverse effect is likely to be particularly important during recessions. The availability of internal finance for investment is reduced by the decline in company profits during recessions, and this is worsened by the downward inflexibility of dividend payments. We believe that this evidence calls into question the wisdom of Britain's existing tax structure, which gives a big tax incentive in favour of paying out dividends rather than retaining profits. The tax credits associated with dividends make dividend income more attractive than capital gains for tax-exempt institutional shareholders, including pension funds. Only for top rate taxpayers is it likely that dividend income is not tax-efficient. It is possible that high dividends have countervailing benefits that could justify this tax subsidy. Most of the advantages that have been claimed for high dividends, such as the spur to managerial efficiency provided by financial pressure, could more obviously be achieved by debt commitments. And even if high dividends are beneficial, this would surely be recognised by companies and shareholders. The case for government intervention to promote high dividends is unproven. We would welcome moves towards a more neutral tax treatment of the payout decision. One way in which this could be achieved is through a reduction in the rate of advance corporation tax. Former chancellor Norman Lamont reduced this rate from 25 to 20 per cent in his 1993 Budget. A further phased reduction, possibly associated with lower tax rates on dividend income for personal taxpayers, could eliminate the existing tax bias. An added benefit of this approach is that the lower refunds of dividend tax credits to institutional shareholders would raise tax revenue for the government. This revenue could be used to cut corporation tax, offsetting the impact of lower tax credits on the stock market, and giving a further stimulus to company investment.

In an editorial, the newspaper said U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher described the negotiations as "very  promising," because "he noted how serious the Syrian position  was."    The bilateral talks resumed Monday after a four-month break  following the signing of the PLO-Israeli autonomy accord in  September, which Syria condemned, arguing that separate deals  undermined the Arab negotiating position.    "The negotiations will make progress if Israel conforms to  the requirements of peace, but the search for a settlement will  go back to square one if the Jewish state continues to stand by  its previous positions," the newspaper said.    On Wednesday Christopher described as "very promising" the  new format for the negotiations, with meetings restricted to the  heads of the Israeli, Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese and  Palestinian delegations.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / People: Scottish food retailer takes life easier Gordon Baxter is retiring as chairman of Baxters of Speyside, the family soup and jams producer, which he has expanded from employing 11 people in 1946 to a payroll of 600 today. He is handing over at the age of 76 to Joe Barnes, who was joint managing director of the retailer J Sainsbury until 1990. Baxters' products - such as its well known Royal Game Soup - are made at its base at Fochabers in northeast Scotland. It claims to dominate the premium end of the UK soup market. Last year it had sales of Pounds 38.46m, on which it made profits of Pounds 3.7m. Although the business was founded by Gordon's grandfather in 1868, its real growth took place after the second world war. Gordon is considered an inspired marketeer who has built up excellent contacts in the UK food industry, while his wife Ena devised some of the most successful recipes. The company is 98.6 per cent owned by the Baxter family and Gordon says the tally of takeover approaches he has rejected now stands at 172. 'We give them a nice reception, may even take them fishing on the Spey, but send them away empty-handed,' he says. He expects the company, which has no debt, to remain in family hands for another generation. Barnes, 64, will be part time chairman for two or three years and will train a family successor. Gordon says this is likely to be his son Andrew, 35, now group deputy chairman. Andrew's sister Audrey, 33, is group managing director. Gordon Baxter's retirement will not be restful. He will handle the group's corporate public relations and links with leading figures in worldwide food retailing, as well as supervise the busy visitor centre at Fochabers.</p>

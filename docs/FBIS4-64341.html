			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gunter Hofmann: "Playing It Completely Safe" </F>   [Text] Rudolf Scharping reacted calmly as always to the  criticism of his party friends from Schleswig-Holstein. He's not  about to let them throw a monkey wrench into his plans, even if  his choice of words might have been a little less harsh. And  least of all after his return from Washington and New York, and  the friendly echo that his obligatory performance triggered  there.    Calmly, he predicted that also the grumbling in the SPD  [Social Democratic Party of Germany] caucus in the Bundestag  over his "governing program" would subside once the matter had  begun to be discussed there--as has always been the case in the  past. And just as calmly (please read on!) did he come out of  the debate, which never materialized.    Calmness is his trade mark and, in part, perhaps even his  program. Translated into political terms, this means that he  would somehow like to occupy the political middle. Such  imperturbability resembles that of the chancellor, who,  incidentally, is likewise averse to releasing the ominous middle.    The "rock-in-the-breakers" motif is indeed currently being  experienced in two versions [Scharping's and Kohl's], and the  adherents of both politicians are undecided whether to view  their tremendous unruffledness as exciting, frivolous, or boring.    As was the case among the comrades in Eckernfoerde during  their party congress, and, for that matter, is the case  generally among many Social Democrats being questioned at this  time, the prevailing mood tends more in the direction of  criticism. But does one want to rob the candidate and party  chairman of the optimism with which--as he did again recently  before the representatives--he speaks of "resoluteness and  unity"?    Who is spreading the bad mood in opposition? Silence  prevails  in the room, aside from a few cursory peripheral comments  concerning minor changes that might be made to give the  consumer, taxation, and traffic policies a little more color.  Not to forget the 250 German marks [DM] child allowance.    To be sure, Rudolf Scharping says that he wants a  discussion,  now! But at the same time this discussion must, at the latest,  be over and done with by the party congress on 22 June in Halle.  But such a discussion will never even materialize. Even the  representatives from Schleswig-Holstein had already forgotten,  by the time they left for Bonn, their misgivings about the  "timidity, lack of profile, and ennui," which could cause the  electoral victory to be squandered.    Doubts are growing, and, what is more, within the SPD,  whether the single issue of employment will suffice to unseat  the incumbent chancellor and to serve as the basis for the great  transition. Members of one group are asking for small changes in  direction. The others, such as Michael Mueller, are hoping that  the transition in October will bring about some fundamental  changes, and they would now like to get at least some idea of  this change: to wit, how the civilization process can still be  controlled in the future and an entirely amorphous development  prevented. And that despite the realization that the economy is  dramatically distancing itself from intervention by the federal  state.    Whether they be wishes for small guidelines or hopes  directed  at a major change in paradigms--many of the party colleagues are  currently shelving their doubts. In view of this, it is nothing  short of a bold exception to the rule when the Social Democrats  from the north play out their trump cards by insisting on a 1.5  percent property levy on the "especially rich," which would  allegedly bring in DM600 billion in additional revenues, a labor  market tax on civil servants and the self-employed, a speed  limit, renunciation of the Intercity Express project [a planned  high-speed rail line between Hamburg and Berlin], or a  Bundeswehr trimmed down to 300,000 soldiers.    Rudolf Scharping will have to give in to some extent, to be  sure. But basically there has been no change in the "campaign  philosophy" as recently formulated in the TAGESZEITUNG by SPD  whip Guenther Verheugen, according to which "financial security,  job security, social security, internal and external security,"  are the issues of primary concern. Security per se. Together  with its siblings: Caution! Freedom from risks! Avoidance of  conflicts!    In Verheugen's opinion, a speed limit would be an "absolute  killer topic" [during the campaign]. The secretary continued:  Election results of recent years have shown that, on the one  hand, majorities can be gained for parties showing a tendency to  bring about change. On the other hand, however: "Whereby--I  admit--it is difficult to distinguish whether the people really  want changes or whether they are simply so dissatisfied with  what they have been offered in the past that anything at all is  preferable to what they have now."    Do they just want to get rid of Helmut Kohl, or do they want  more? In the assessment of this question, the SPD is unsure of  itself, and resulting from this uncertainty is its "security  philosophy." But since it does not know if the people want "real  changes," e.g. in matters related to the environment, the party  is likewise reluctant to become truly more precise.    Always to be recommended, to be sure, is that reality not be  lost sight of for sheer bureaucracy and red tape. In that case,  however, based on the ideas promulgated to date, how is even a  breath of the atmosphere of breaking up and launching a new  beginning to be conveyed?    And what is more: If the election year is not utilized to  gain majorities for certain policies, where, in the period of  doubt that prevails afterwards, are the impulses and the inner  legitimacy to come from which are to serve as the basis for the  new beginning? Basically no differently than the CDU [Christian  Democratic Union], the SPD, as well, must after all first  recreate leeways for creative politics. It is precisely at this  juncture that confidence in Helmut Kohl has waned. What is  politics able to accomplish at all any more? And what are  parties able to accomplish in the process? And could the  cogoverning opposition accomplish more and other things along  these lines than Kohl's coalition?    If, for example, in matters pertaining to the ecology, the  SPD currently ignores or puts off until after the election much  of what has been laboriously learned in the course of time, this  can hardly be quickly made up for again tomorrow. What is  unimportant today will not automatically become relevant again  tomorrow.    All this is being carried on the shoulders of Rudolf  Scharping alone, without a "team." At most, Oskar Lafontaine  becomes slightly perceptible along the periphery. But otherwise?  The chairman either takes everything on himself, or (more  likely) he mesmerizes everyone with his sober reflectiveness. At  any rate, the SPD campaign seems to consist primarily of him.  The situation is similar in the CDU with Kohl, and in the FDP  [Free Democratic Party] with Kinkel: politics as a solo program.    Patiently, Rudolf Scharping answers his critics by pointing  out that so far he has always reached his objective. With  unruffledness. Witness the asylum law, the blue helmets,  appointment to the Constitutional Court. The more often  Scharping puts something off for the future, the more impatient  some of his adherents become, however, or they defect to the  Greens, something which the latter can only welcome.    The fact that shedding ballast and leveling out differences  with the government are not enough must, at the latest, have  become clear to Scharping during his America trip. For hardly  does he show a willingness to yield and does he discover (not  only foreign policy) commonalities, when CDU caucus chairman  Wolfgang Schaeuble and others search anew for what separates  them. Here with the notion that the Bundeswehr be employed  domestically, there with the proposal that it be used in the  Balkan conflict as well--all these things are not least intended  to show the opposition, despite all its adjustments, in an  unflattering light.    A dangerous game, both with the constitution as well as with  "Francistic methods," thus Scharping's reply to Schaeuble. But  does the SPD have much of its own to counter this with? Aside  from distancing itself--did it prepare itself early on and  adequately to oppose the fact that foreign policy a la Schaeuble  is being increasingly subordinated to "nationalistic criteria,"  as Scharping now claims? If it is convinced of its need, should  it not long since have evidenced a firm Europe-oriented policy?  Can it offer the East Europeans greater "membership prospects"  today than the government, and in addition one which has also  been coordinated in the West? Did it counter, in good time,  Schaeuble's recommendation that unity can only be gained with  national emotions?    So far the SPD has not come up with an answer to the  question  as to how it can win over those who adhere to their "breaking up  atmosphere" in the event a policy marked by vagueness and  putting off and a very imperturbable candidate perhaps do not  suffice.    The Discovery of Slowness--thus the title of a novel  published in the early 1980's. These words took wing, seemed to  breathe zeitgeist, indeed even seemed to serve as a prescription  for politics. But is it appropriate for today's dramatic  conditions? Can it be a prescription for the 1990's? Sten  Nadolny's hero, incidentally, the slow one, got far, but he fell  short of reaching his objective.</p>

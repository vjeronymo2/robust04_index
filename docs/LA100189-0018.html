And "Godfather III" (Paramount) is casting.  </P> <P> And while "Highlander" grossed a mere $5.6 million domestically for Fox, it  took in $100 million internationally. That's why director Russell Mulcahy and  actor Christopher Lambert are reteaming for . . . "Highlander II." Pat H.  Broeske  </P></p>

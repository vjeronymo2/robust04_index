			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AIR STATION CRASH TAKES LIVES OF 2 NAVY FLIERS  </P> <P> An EA-6B Prowler, an electronic warfare plane used by the Navy to jam enemy  radar, crashed Monday while taking off from North Island Naval Air Station,  killing two of the three airmen on board.  </P> <P> Based at the naval air station on Whidbey Island, Wash., 80 miles northwest of  Seattle, the twin-engine jet was operating out of North Island while on "a  routine training mission" when it crashed at 5:38 p.m., Cmdr. Bob Pritchard  said.  </P> <P> The surviving airman was flown by military helicopter to the Navy Hospital in  Balboa Park, where he was listed in stable condition Monday night. The names of  the crew were being withheld pending notification of next of kin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Debris Along Runway  </P> <P> A storage shed at the end of the runway was destroyed in the accident,  Pritchard said, with wood and debris from the plane scattered along the length  of the airstrip. He said no other property, civilians or naval personnel were  involved.  </P> <P> Observers at the scene reported pieces of the fuselage being strewn along the  runway and a thick black smudge lining the airstrip for a distance of about 600  feet.  </P> <P> Pritchard said the plane "hit the ground and just burst into flames," sending  up a plume of black smoke that was seen for miles. He said the cause of the  crash was unknown but that an investigation was "already under way," with a  report expected today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Crash  </P> <P> As Navy investigators were sorting out the details of the EA-6B crash, an F-14  Tomcat fighter went down 10 miles east of San Clemente Island at 8:57 p.m.  Monday.  </P> <P> Pritchard said that "two crewmen of Fighter Squadron 51, homeported at Miramar  Naval Air Station" ejected from the F-14 and were picked up at 9:43 p.m. by  "small craft in the area." He said the men appeared to be in good condition  late Monday night, but the F-14 was "lost at sea."  </P> <P> Pritchard said the Tomcat, an "air superiority fighter," is assigned to the  aircraft carrier Carl Vinson but was flying out of Miramar when the crash  occurred.  </P> <P> He said names of the crew members were being withheld. San Clemente Island is  about 50 miles west of San Diego.  </P> <P> Pritchard said the entire fleet of Grumman-made EA-6Bs is based at Whidbey  Island. He said the plane went down several hundred yards from the ocean, and  all the debris fell on land, just shy of the shoreline.  </P> <P> "It was just at the end of its takeoff," Navy Lt. Jack Papp told the Associated  Press. "It crashed just as it reached the end of the runway. There was nothing  left. The plane's a complete loss."  </P> <P> Pritchard said the EA-6B can accommodate a four-man crew, but only three  officers (one pilot and two electronics specialists) were on board. He said the  plane is used "for countermeasures, for degrading enemy radar," and the crew  was what's known as a replacement squadron that went by the Navy designation of  VAQ-129.  </P> <P> "These were gentlemen who had their wings," Pritchard said. "They were  experienced aviators, just learning the particulars of the EA-6B, the aircraft  they'd be flying, prior to joining the fleet."  </P> <P> Navy spokeswoman Mary Ann Heiserman said by telephone from Whidbey Island that  the EA-6B is an all-weather electronic aircraft specializing in  "countermeasures." She didn't know the age of the EA-6B that crashed but said  the first one was built in 1971. She said that it was part of the "tactical  electronic warfare squadron" based at Whidbey and that training missions,  calling for flights in and out of naval air stations, are common. She said the  Prowler is designed to be launched from a carrier and jam land-based enemy  radar during bombing missions.  </P> <P> The weight of the EA-6B when empty is 32,162 pounds. It can carry an internal  fuel load of 15,422 pounds, according to "Jane's All the World's Aircraft." Its  "maximum level speed" at sea level is 651 m.p.h., with a cruising speed at  optimal altitude of 481 m.p.h. It was originally unarmed but is now being  equipped to carry anti-radar missiles underwing.  </P></p>

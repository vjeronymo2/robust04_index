			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY;  </P> <P> EXPLORING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> FROM THE ADL;  </P> <P> THE STRUGGLE IS HARD  </P> <P> For more than 75 years the Anti-Defamation League has worked to eradicate  prejudice. The struggle has been difficult.  </P> <P> Statistics cannot begin to measure the continuing impact of bigotry, but they  are distressing. Recent reports indicate a marked rise in acts of violence  directed at minorities, Jews, gays and others perceived as different. The ADL  has issued three recent studies of the disturbing skinhead youth gangs --  adolescents espousing an ideology of hate and acting out their beliefs.  </P> <P> Despite the setbacks, the effort to reduce prejudice must increase. The  Anti-Defamation League has initiated a campaign involving the media, the  corporate world and the educational community in a joint effort to reduce  prejudice and stereotyping.  </P> <P> This Los Angeles Times supplement is one aspect of the "A World of Difference"  campaign. Work by KCBS-TV, the Milken Family Foundation, the Southern  California Human Relations Coalition and the James Irvine Foundation will  ensure that by the end of 1989 our community will have a greater understanding  for the rich diversity that has become Southern California. DAVID A. LEHRER,  Regional Director  </P></p>

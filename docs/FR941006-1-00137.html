			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The available data show that poisonings are occurring in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large measure because of the efforts of children. Table 4 shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that in 9 of the 21 reported pediatric poisoning deaths that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved iron-containing products packaged in containers with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CRC's, the victims gained access to multiple doses of iron-containing product by their own efforts or through the efforts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another child. Most of these children were under 51 months of age. Thus, a label warning statement is unlikely to have any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning or significance to them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA requests comments on its tentative conclusion that label  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning statements are not sufficient to ensure that the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain iron-containing products will be safe. Comments that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bear on the effectiveness of labeling warning statements to deter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> young children from directly gaining access to these products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be most compelling if they contain supporting data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, FDA believes that label warning statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will help to reduce the incidence of pediatric poisoning because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they will ensure that adults are aware of the pediatric toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of iron and will encourage responsible adults to properly reclose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and store iron-containing products. However, FDA is concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that warning statements alone will not prevent the misuse of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CRP's that has contributed to the epidemic of iron poisonings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children. FDA notes that CRP's themselves are a de facto warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the contents of the package present hazards for children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Yet, in 21 of the 26 pediatric poisoning deaths in which the type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of packaging was reported, the product was packaged in containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with CRC's (Table 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the effectiveness of label warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements is generally considered to be dependent on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several factors including, but not necessarily limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to: The personal relevance of the warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information; familiarity with the warning information; perceived hazard from the product; and desensitization or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habituation to warnings after repeated exposures (Ref. 24).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, a report on the effectiveness of a labeling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational program to prevent pediatric poisonings from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidental ingestion of prescription drugs shows that labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and educational programs are not always sufficient to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric poisonings, and that, in some instances, additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging safeguards are necessary to ensure the safe use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain substances (Ref. 25). Therefore, FDA tentatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that label warning statements will not be sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure the safe use of certain iron-containing products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA finds that iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pose a unique hazard to young children. The pediatric hazard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented by these products is directly related to their iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content. As discussed above in section I.B. of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document, ingestion of 25 mg or more iron per kg of body weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is considered a toxic dose, and ingestion of 100 to 200 mg iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per kg of body weight can be lethal. Once a potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lethal dose of iron has been ingested and absorbed, medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervention to halt the toxic progression of iron poisoning is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult and often unsuccessful. Successful treatment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron poisoning is determined primarily by the amount of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingested and how rapidly medical intervention occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the risk of pediatric iron poisonings with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irreversible and potentially fatal consequences that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented by higher potency iron-containing products, and of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent limitations on the effectiveness of labeling and educational programs, FDA tentatively concludes that it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate to rely solely on these measures to ensure the safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Are noncomplying CRP's a principal cause of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning deaths?  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NDMA contends that new packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements beyond those outlined in its petition are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to reduce the incidence of pediatric iron poisonings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NDMA petition asserts that the available data on pediatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-poisonings are deficient to the extent that it cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined whether products associated with the poisonings were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaged in compliance with CPSC's packaging requirements, and it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggests that iron-containing products packaged in noncompliant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CRP's are the principle cause of pediatric iron-poisonings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, NDMA provided no information to support its view.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has carefully examined the available information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric iron poisonings and could find no evidence to support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NDMA's contention that the iron-containing products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with these poisonings were packaged in CRP's that did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not comply with regulations established by CPSC. In the absence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of such evidence, FDA can find no basis on which to conclude that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliant, child-resistant special packaging is the primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause of pediatric iron-poisonings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Are additional packaging requirements appropriate?  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively concludes that full compliance with CPSC's CRP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, even if there are warning statements in labeling of iron-containing products and appropriate educational programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be adequate to ensure the safe use of certain iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements if bottle and closure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging were to continue as the predominant means of packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such products. FDA recognizes that each of these measures either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been successful in limiting the number of poisonings or can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reasonably expected to be effective in reducing the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisonings. However, given the potentially fatal outcome that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can result from pediatric iron-poisoning, FDA is not persuaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these measures are adequate to ensure the safety of the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of certain iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively concludes that to reduce the incidence of pediatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron poisonings to a level that would permit the agency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclude that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of these products, it is necessary to require a specific type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of physical barrier to access these products. Therefore, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively concludes that additional packaging requirements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA requests comments on this tentative conclusion. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is particularly interested in receiving comments that bear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the effectiveness of different types of packaging to limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric access to toxic amounts of iron. Comments will be most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persuasive if they are supported by studies and other data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

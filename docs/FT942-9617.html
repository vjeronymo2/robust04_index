			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar softer The dollar finished slightly softer on the foreign exchanges yesterday as weaker than expected inflation figures introduced some doubt about the outlook for US monetary policy, writes Philip Gawith. The market has factored in an imminent tightening from the Federal Reserve, but a spate of weaker than expected economic data has brought into question the extent by which rates are likely to rise. The US currency finished in London at DM1.6671 against the dollar from DM1.6708. Against the yen it closed at Y104.755 from Y104.505. The Greek drachma was under attack following the announcement of legislation to free all capital transfers in July. Anticipating a possible devaluation, the market drove the drachma down by more than one drachma to close at Dr148.10 against the D-Mark. The D-Mark was little changed in Europe, with trading quiet as many dealers stayed away from their desks following the Ascension day holiday on Thursday. The Bank of Spain cuts its key money rate to 7.50 per cent from 7.75 per cent, and the Bank of Ireland cut its short-term facility rate to 6.25 per cent from 6.5 per cent. Sterling traded very narrowly with the sterling index unchanged at 80.1 throughout the day. It closed at DM2.5012 from DM2.5052 against the D-Mark. Against the dollar it closed at Dollars 1.5004 from Dollars 1.4994. US consumer inflation for April rose by only 0.1 per cent, compared with forecasts of a 0.3 per cent gain. This led some analysts to revise down their estimates of what constitutes the 'neutral' monetary policy stance the Fed is seeking. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO bank, said he could not see the federal funds rate - currently 3.75 per cent - rising above 4.5 per cent in the next few months. But Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said the signal from the bond market 'is that the Fed is going to have to catch up with inflation expectations.' With the US economy growing at close to twice its potential growth rate, Mr Hannah said a 2.5 to 3 per cent real short rate was probably appropriate - meaning Fed funds at about 5.5 to 6 per cent. The market took Spain's rate cut to be politically motivated, given that the government is under considerable pressure over various corruption scandals, and recent inflation data is unexceptional. Also, the cut was made against the background of a currency that has been fairly weak recently. The peseta finished in London at Pta82.65 against the D-Mark from Pta82.48. The Irish punt showed little reaction to the 25 basis point cut in the short-term facility rate to 6.25 per cent. It finished at IPounds 0.409 against the D-Mark from IPounds 0.410. Sterling futures had another good day with the December contract finishing nine basis points firmer at 94.02. Nearly 22,000 lots were traded. Euromark volumes were low and there was little movement. The Bank of England did not operate in the UK money markets after revising its forecast from a Pounds 250m shortage, to a flat position. In Germany, call money was firm at 5.45/5.55 per cent, compared to the repo rate of 5.35 per cent.</p>

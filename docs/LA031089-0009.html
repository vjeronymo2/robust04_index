			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LENDL BREEZES; IVANISEVIC, 17, UPSETS CHESNOKOV  </P> <P> Top-seeded Ivan Lendl and fifth-seeded Emilio Sanchez both breezed into the  quarterfinals Thursday night in the $415,000 Eagle tennis tournament, while  Yugoslavian teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic upset eighth-seeded Andrei Chesnokov of  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Lendl, the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world, needed just 69 minutes to  eliminate South Africa's Christo van Rensburg, 6-0, 6-2, in their second-round  match.  </P> <P> Van Rensburg, ranked 37th in the world, won only six points in the first set.  </P> <P> "If tonight is any indication, I'm hitting the ball quite well," said Lendl,  who defeated Paul Annacone, 6-2, 6-4, in the first round.  </P> <P> Sanchez, a Spaniard ranked 17th in the world, beat Australia's Mark Woodforde,  6-3, 6-3, in a 68-minute match.  </P> <P> Unseeded Jim Courier, 18, eliminated 30-year-old Johan Kriek, 6-1, 6-1, in  another second-round match on the hardcourts of the Scottsdale Princess resort  hotel.  </P> <P> Kriek, a South African ranked 39th in the world but unseeded here, had ousted  third-seeded Jimmy Connors, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, in the first round.  </P> <P> Still, the big winner Thursday was Ivanisevic, 17, ranked 119th in the world.  He beat the 19th-ranked Chesnokov, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> Ivanisevic blew a 4-1 lead in the first set but came back to score what he  called the biggest victory of his career.  </P> <P> "The first set, I was up 4-1 and then I started to hurry," Ivanisevic said.  "Every backhand that I hit was out. Then I started serving bad and lost some  games. In the second and third sets, I played not too bad."  </P></p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Still very much on track Sir, Observer criticises Railtrack's presentation of its case and suggests that this failure may be because my heart is not in my job ('Wrong track', June 28). I cannot pretend that restructuring the grading and working practices of 4,600 key Railtrack staff presently grouped in 14 grades with a wide range of allowances and enhancements for their varied responsibilities is easily simplified. I hope that effort and persistence will enable us to explain the value of our offer. I am concerned, however, at the suggestion that I lack the commitment to do so. That is wholly untrue. I have been extremely fortunate in my recent career. It was a privilege to work for the late leader of the opposition and his team, as it has been since to work for ScotRail, among the most talented and high-achieving of the BR profit centres. I am equally enthusiastic to be able to play a part in Railtrack's task of safeguarding the future prosperity of the rail network. I am touched by your concern for my heart but can assure you that it is, as ever, in my work. Lesley Smith, head of government and public affairs, Railtrack, 40 Bernard Street, London WC1N 1BY</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG VIOLINIST REFLECTS ON HER DIZZYING DECADE;  </P> <P> MUSICIAN: NADJA SALERNO-SONNENBERG, WHO PLAYS O.C. MONDAY, ROCKETED INTO THE  LIMELIGHT. NOW SHE WANTS TO FOCUS ON MORE PERSONAL PURSUITS.  </P> <P> It's been a long, hard decade for violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg. And at  29, her career still booming, she now wants to concentrate on other, less  professional areas of her life.  </P> <P> "Over the last year, I've just been overwhelmed by it all," she said in a  telephone conversation from her home in New York. "My 20s went by really fast.  I think I've made all the right decisions, but as I turn 30, my goal is to  schedule things so I enjoy my life a little more."  </P> <P> She performs Monday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center with pianist  Cecile Licad -- a longtime collaborator and childhood friend -- in a program of  violin sonatas by Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms.  </P> <P> The event is being sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society.  </P> <P> "I still give about 15 to 20 recitals a year," said Salerno-Sonnenberg. "Cecile  and I last collaborated about two years ago, and it's great to team up with her  again. We'll have a recording coming out again soon."  </P> <P> Born in Rome and holding dual citizenship, in both Italy and America,  Salerno-Sonnenberg speaks English like a native, with all of the colloquialisms  that anyone growing up on the East Coast would acquire. She is also fluent in  Italian and even Sicilian, a dialect she picked up from her grandparents.  </P> <P> Her hyphenated name, she said, "is the result of combining my mother's last  name -- which gives me some Italian flavor -- with my ex-stepfather's. I've  never been married."  </P> <P> She remembers her early music lessons in Italy with Antonio Marchetti and his  advice that her potential would best be realized in the United States. When she  was 8, her family moved to New Jersey, where she studied with Jascha Brodsky at  the Curtis Institute and was one of the first enrollees in its preparatory  division.  </P> <P> She moved to New York at 17 on a scholarship to study at Juilliard. Three years  later, she won the Naumberg Award, which launched her solo career so quickly  that she left school. She never graduated.  </P> <P> "I don't excel in a mold," she observed. "At Juilliard, I was lucky to have a  teacher like Dorothy DeLay, who became almost like a surrogate mother to me and  taught me the basics of playing the fiddle. I was a very stubborn student and  insisted on doing things my way. Then, when I got too frustrated with a passage  of music, I'd go to her and ask her why I couldn't play it. She recognized my  need for freedom, and that helped me a lot."  </P> <P> Her tours of the world, performing with the finest of orchestras, conductors  and other artists, brought a tidal wave of publicity. Young, attractive and  talented, Salerno-Sonnenberg found herself chased by throngs of journalists  throughout America.  </P> <P> "It was all that media stuff that really made things jump," she recalled.  "Someone would write an article on me which someone else would read and would  want to write another article and so forth and so on.  </P> <P> "Then you fly into a big city, look up and suddenly you see your picture where  you didn't expect it. I remember doing a bit on '60 Minutes' and the next  morning I had an offer for the lead role in a major Hollywood movie. You start  to lose track of it all."  </P> <P>  Violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and pianist Cecile Licad play sonatas by  Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms on Monday at 8 p.m. at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $8 to $25.  Presented by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. Information: (714)  556-2787.  </P> <P> </P></p>

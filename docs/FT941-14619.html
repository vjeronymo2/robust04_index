			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP begins talks on marketing Canadian find BHP Minerals has begun talks with the international diamond trade on ways to market output from the Australian group's potential new mine in northern Canada. The discussions reinforce optimism that BHP and its Canadian partner, Dia Met Minerals, will press ahead later this year with construction of a mine in the Lac de Gras area, 300 km north-east of Yellowknife, capital of the Northwest Territories. Mr Hugo Dummett, BHP's director of exploration in North America, says that, 'if all goes according to schedule', the property could be in production by 1997. Mr Dummett adds that BHP has held discussions 'with everyone in the marketplace', including De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation, which organises the cartel that controls the world rough (uncut)diamond trade. He says, however, that so far 'no commitment has been made to anybody'. BHP says that it has assured other players that it recognises the delicate balance of the market and that it will act 'responsibly' in marketing stones from the Lac de Gras deposit. Analysts expect that at least a portion of the mine's production will be channelled through the CSO. A final decision on the mine and on the distribution of its production will not be made until completion of a bulk-sampling programme, which is about to get under way. BHP has imported a 10-tonne bulk-sampling plant from South Africa and has set up a 112-person camp at the site. The plant will test at least 8,500 tonnes of rock from at least two of the most promising kimberlite pipes. Mr John Lydall, analyst at First Marathon Securities in Toronto, predicts that, based on exploration results from 15 of the 26 pipes discovered so far, the Lac de Gras property could generate 'substantially' more cash flow than even American Barrick's flagship Goldstrike gold mine in Nevada. According to estimates by diamond appraisers in London and Antwerp, the value of the most recent Lac de Gras samples equates to USDollars 140 per tonne of mined material. Assuming mining and processing costs of about Dollars 27.50 a tonne, Mr Lydall calculates a gross profit margin of some Dollars 12.50 a tonne. This would translate into a pre-tax cash flow of Dollars 1.7m a day from a mine with a daily throughput of 15,000 tonnes. Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in Toronto, tentatively predicted in a recent report that four or five kimberlite pipes would be developed at Lac de Gras.</p>

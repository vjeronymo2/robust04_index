			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Observer: Spires ascent What's with the British trade union movement? Aside from the discourse on the signal workers' strike and a brief self-parody from miners' leader Arthur Scargill, this year's congress must have been the mildest on record. It seems to have coincided with an almost complete absence of Liverpudlians in Blackpool - and hence a paucity of those militant pronouncements that so often seem to be delivered with a Scouse inflection. And now the next TUC president, the general secretary of the Banking Insurance and Finance Union, is an alumnus of Balliol College, Oxford, for heaven's sake. Leif Mills was to be heard yesterday congratulating himself on having attained 'the last unclimbed peak of British life for the college'. At least his accent is decidedly on the prole side of cut glass.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Letter: Energy policy must avoid being hostage to changing fortune Sir, Your leader 'In search of an energy policy' (October 29) is aptly titled. It gets to the heart of the matter in its assertion that privatised energy is preferable to a nationalised version provided it is linked to effective, even permanent, regulation. Unfortunately there is, for government, always a political risk in declaring policies which may become hostages to fortune when circumstances alter. The best we can hope for is some energy objectives that will stand fast in the face of change. Maybe these should simply aim to achieve: competitive energy prices, for UK industry and commerce, and affordable warmth and comfort for people; security, safety and diversity of sustainable energy supply; we must not empty the earth's larder of natural resources nor damage our environment in the process. While energy objectives are entrusted to three independent regulators (OFT, Offer, Ofgas) and to two government departments (of trade and industry and of the environment), there is a worry that their separate actions will not always harmonise. Energy inquiries now under way should consider the case for more centralised and open scrutiny of the market forces on which energy policy seems at present to be based. Ian Powe, director, Gas Consumers Council, 6th Floor, Abford House, 15 Wilton Road, London SW1V 1LT</p>

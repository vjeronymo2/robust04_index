On the basis of a project prepared by the UNHCR a  number of Afghan immigrants voluntarily returned home, before  the recent civil war and fratricide in Afghanistan. As of next  Nowruz [21 March 1994], the said project will be followed up;  however, if there are some who desire to stay in Iran, then we  will issue cards for them. [passage omitted]    The interior minister said Iraqi refugees in Iran numbered  around 50,000.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Protection plea for EC workers WORKERS should not suffer severe loss of rights to future occupational pension benefits when they move jobs within the European Community, according to a UK government draft proposal. It is estimated that about 3m EC nationals work in other EC countries, mainly in skilled manual, professional or managerial jobs. Labour mobility is a principle aim of the European Community. Watsons Europe, the actuarial firm, estimates that about 150,000 managers are adversely affected by the lack of harmonisation in EC pensions. Some workers are able to negotiate compensation for loss of pension rights with their new employers. The government believes the single European market, due to be completed by December 31 1992, might mean many more workers moving between jobs in different EC countries. Many migrants have to freeze occupational pensions in one country and start a new one in the state to which they move. Efforts to harmonise occupational pension schemes were scuppered last year by the EC because pensions are linked to taxation and therefore affect the sovereignty of member states' taxation policies. The UK government intends to use its presidency of the council of ministers to make progress on the issue. It hopes to reach an agreement in time for a meeting of EC social affairs ministers in Edinburgh in December. EC workers enjoy greater protection over state pension benefits. A British worker who retires in France must be paid a proportionate amount of his or her state pension from the country of origin, plus a proportionate amount of that of the host country, depending on length of residence. A consultation paper, published by the social security department, calls on the EC to protect the future occupational benefits of these workers. The paper includes the draft resolution for consideration by other EC member states. The deadline for comments on the Social Security Department's consultation document is September 25 1992.</p>

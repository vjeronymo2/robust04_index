			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (4): Truce sought in bidding wars - It is costing states more and more to lure investors AS THE cost of incentives to lure new business investment has climbed to an estimated Dollars 30bn a year, more and more US state and local officials are wondering whether they are giving away the store. The latest skirmish among states - for the Dollars 300m Mercedes-Benz plant that went to Alabama - may prove to be a catalyst for a serious rethink of these bidding wars. The size of Alabama's incentives package was regarded by many as over the top. It included Dollars 253m upfront, plus tax breaks over 25 years that could be worth an additional Dollars 230m. Criticism of competition for new business investment as an inefficient and inequitable use of public resources has been building for years. As the amount offered in incentives by US state and local governments has grown, opposition has become louder. One critic from a New York citizens' watchdog group has called corporate site shopping 'polite extortion'. And Governor Jim Edgar of Illinois, a Republican, has been insistently calling for a truce in the bidding wars by all states. At a National Governors' Association meeting in August, Mr Edgar made some headway toward his goal. The organisation issued a policy statement to the effect that competition among states for investment should not be ruled by how much a state sweetens the deal for a single investor, but by how much the deal can improve the state's general business climate. The competition should be judged on education, transportation, tele- communications, tax policies, business regulation and fiscal stability, the governors said. Notably, they also agreed that they had the right to consult whenever they believed a company was trying to play them off against one another to win bigger concessions. They warned, too, that governors should be prepared to take the political heat that might result if they declined to engage in a bidding war for a high-impact, high-profile project. While all these seem noble goals, Mr Jay Kayne, policy studies director for the National Governors' Association, says that the governors do not realistically expect a quick halt to high-cost bidding. The competition for Mercedes, for instance, had already reached a fever pitch. But they do hope to spur some states to at least review their incentive policies. The NGA has been trying to meet top corporate leaders to win their co-operation. The slow growth of the US economy has been blamed for pushing up the cost of incentives. With fewer big investment projects on offer, states that are in desperate need of jobs feel compelled to bid up their hand-outs to companies. 'It's market forces,' says Mr Kayne. Moreover, in cases involving big, high-profile investors, Mr Kayne likens a state's pursuit of a project to the development of a shopping mall. 'If you get the Sears or the Macy's in there, then other stores will want to come in.' The consequences of reckless bidding are, however, becoming more punishing. In 1991, for example, Indianapolis won the bidding for a United Airlines maintenance facility by contributing a large chunk of the Dollars 1bn or so that Indiana could give away. But in the process, the city put itself deeply in the red. The doubts about fat packages of incentives have been heightened by surveys of company executives which show that these hand-outs often do not in themselves sway corporate decisions on site locations. If contenders offer approximately the same proximity to markets and materials, good transportation and infrastructure and availability of labour, incentives amount to little more than a thick layer of icing on the cake for some companies. As the mood on incentives has soured, a backlash has been rising against companies that do not fulfil their promises, particularly on job creation. States have increasingly placed 'clawback' provisions in their deals, requiring that subsidies be returned if a company's promises are not fulfilled. However, PHH Fantus, the leading corporate relocation adviser, says that its clients rarely accept such conditions and they are negotiated out of a deal. Nonetheless, a number of law suits have been filed on the basis of a company's failure to deliver on its promises. One of the better known ones is that of the Ypsilanti Township, in Michigan, against General Motors. GM's Willow Run assembly plant, located in Ypsilanti, was chosen to be closed in early 1992, violating what the township said was the company's promises of jobs and investment in return for tax abatements. The township won its case in the first trial, but lost an appeal by GM in the Michigan Court of Appeals. The state's Supreme Court then refused to hear the case, but the township is still pursuing an aspect of its case further. While its previous action would have forced GM to fulfil promises on jobs and keep the plant open, its current tack is to press a claim of 'unjust enrichment' against GM and win back money that the company saved from Ypsilanti's tax abatements. Cases such as this have given pause to both sides in negotiations for site locations. They also have contributed to a new sobriety among state and local officials in their approaches to new investors. Yet, while the need for job-creating investment is still pressing, the US is unlikely to see the end of these bidding wars - as the scramble to secure the Mercedes-Benz site clearly shows.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COST-OF-LIVING VALUES: SELECTED LOCATIONS 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Location                 Total annual costs      Index                             (Dollars)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Los Angeles, CA               75,975             126.6 Washington, DC                71,622             119.4 Boston, MA                    68,750             114.6 Chicago, IL                   65,812             109.7 Atlanta, GA                   63,494             105.8 Minneapolis, MN               62,744             104.6 Seattle, WA                   61,938             103.2 St Louis, MO                  60,034             100.1 (Standard US city             60,000             100.0) Houston, TX                   58,184              97.0 Phoenix, AZ                   56,344              93.9 Memphis, TN                   55,793              93.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on a family of four with an annual income of Dollars 60,000, living in a 2,200 sq ft home which carries a mortgage and incurs all normal home ownership and maintenance costs. The family owns two cars, a late model driven 14,000 miles a year and a four-year-old model driven 6,000 miles yearly. Car expenses include fixed and operating costs. The family pays federal, state and local income taxes, as well as sales taxes; it buys typical goods and services for a family in that income bracket at that location. It has also set aside an amount for investments and savings. Costing is based on representative communities surrounding the core city in which families earning Dollars 60,000 a year are most likely to reside.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Runzheimer International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

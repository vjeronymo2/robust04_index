			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted regardless of the circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Our new policy calls for an original and six copies to be submitted. The binding of applications is optional.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. We just missed the deadline for the XXX competition. May we submit under another competition?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Yes, however, the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the requirements of the competition to which it is submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate for my project. What should I do?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. We are happy to discuss any questions with you and provide clarification on the unique elements of the various competitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Will you help us prepare our application?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements, evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants should understand that this previous preapplication consultation is not required, nor will it in any way influence the success of an application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the application closing date, depending on the number of applications received and the number of competitions with closing dates at about the same time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tell me the outcome?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome of the review prior to official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need to notify a local school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, because final funding decisions have not been made at that point, we cannot share information about the review with anyone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. We no longer return unsuccessful applications. Thus, applicants should retain at least one copy of the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Is travel allowed under these projects?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we will request the project directors and evaluators of funded projects to attend an annual project directors meeting, you should include annual trips for each to Washington, DC., in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on the scores of all the applications and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. What happens during negotiations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. How do I provide an assurance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Except for SF&hyph;424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' simply state in writing that you are meeting a proscribed requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. Where can copies of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , program regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, they can be obtained from the Government Printing Office by writing to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC. 20402. Telephone: (202) 783&hyph;3238. When requesting copies of regulations or statutes, it is helpful to use the specific name, public law number, or part number. The material referenced in this notice should be referred to as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act) (Public Law 101&hyph;392, 104 Stat. 753 (1990)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) State Vocational and Applied Technology Education Programs and National Discretionary Programs of Vocational Education Final Regulations, 34 CFR Parts 400 and 426.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Education Department General Administrative Regulations, 34 CFR Parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85, and 86.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. What are the Department of Education's Program Effectiveness Panel and National Diffusion Network?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The Program Effectiveness Panel (PEP) is the Department of Education's primary mechanism for validating the effectiveness of educational programs developed by schools, universities, and other agencies. The National Diffusion Network (NDN) is a Federally funded dissemination system that helps public and private schools, colleges, and other educational institutions improve by sharing successful education programs, products, and processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations governing PEP and NDN are codified at 34 CFR Parts 785&hyph;789. For information about PEP, prospective applicants may wish to read  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Making the Case: Evidence of Effectiveness in Schools and Classrooms <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which contains criteria and guidelines for submitting project results to PEP.

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CEAUSESCU'S BROTHERS SOLD SOVIET MILITARY DATA TO U.S.  </P> <P> For 10 years before deposed Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's execution,  the U.S. government secretly bought advanced Soviet military technology from  Romania through Ceausescu's two brothers, who served in high government  positions.  </P> <P> As part of the clandestine intelligence program coordinated by the CIA, the  U.S. government paid more than $40 million to Romania through foreign  middlemen, with about 20% ending up in Swiss bank accounts controlled by the  Ceausescu family, according to intelligence sources.  </P> <P> The Ceausescu connection was part of a broader U.S. weapons-buying operation  that reached into the highest levels of the East Bloc military Establishment.  The CIA and the U.S. military were able to obtain important components of the  tactical, non-nuclear weaponry -- including air defense systems -- that the  Soviet Union has in place to protect itself and other Warsaw Pact countries.  </P> <P> From Romania alone acquisitions included the latest version of the Shilka, one  of the most effective anti-aircraft systems in the Soviet inventory; mobile  rocket launchers that were improved by the Romanian military, and radar systems  used in identifying targets and directing the firing of various Soviet  anti-aircraft weapons.  </P> <P> Armed with this knowledge, U.S. military planners could then develop effective  countermeasures or perhaps not build a costly weapon.  </P> <P> "The potential value of these things is almost incalculable," a U.S.  intelligence officer said. "The only way you can truly unlock the secrets of  your adversaries' weapons is to physically have them."  </P> <P> For example, access to the Soviet radar systems reportedly aided in U.S.  development of the revolutionary Stealth technology, designed to allow aircraft  to elude radar detection.  </P> <P> U.S. government officials say that Nicolae Ceausescu was not personally  involved in the dozen or so transactions but that the operation could have  succeeded only with his tacit approval.  </P> <P> "It was an assumption from the beginning," said one U.S. intelligence officer.  "It was never something that we had to debate. None of this could happen, our  presumption was, without him."  </P> <P> The Romanian operation came to a halt with Ceausescu's overthrow and execution  last December. The two brothers also are out of the picture: Marin Ceausescu,  71, was found hanged Dec. 28 in the basement of the Romanian trade mission in  Vienna, which he headed. Lt. Gen. Ilie Ceausescu, 63, deputy defense minister  and secretary of the Supreme Political Council of the Romanian Armed Forces,  was arrested and remains in custody.  </P> <P> The pro-democracy upheaval in Eastern Europe has disrupted the broader  operation, but not ended it. Over the past decade, the U.S. government has paid  more than $250 million to obtain the latest versions of Soviet-made weapons  systems through contacts in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany and  Bulgaria, according to those interviewed.  </P> <P> The contacts included influential military or Communist Party officials, whose  willingness to sell was seen by some in the U.S. intelligence community as a  reflection of growing discontent among some Warsaw Pact officials.  </P> <P> "It was corrupt to the core," a former U.S. official said. "There was no  ideological discrimination. If you wanted to use this as an indication of the  fragility of the system, this was a classic."  </P></p>

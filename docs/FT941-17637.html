			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Sink or subsidy - Jazz Leaving aside harmless men in bowler hats and striped satin waistcoats, jazz divides people. For the unconverted, the sound of improvisation is akin to tinnitus. But, to the modernist at least, jazz is the sound of art in action. Jazz is young - it is only 75 years since the word was first uttered. And if its artistic development has been explosive since then, it is only just emerging from the underground to take its place in the conservatory, concert hall and on the air waves. As with all cutting-edge art, jazz and its practitioners need subsidies to develop and flourish. Listeners, too, need access to a music best taken live, which means more touring and better venues. Jazz in the UK has not fared well thus far, however, and has played second fiddle to all the other performance arts. In March, though, the Arts Council will reveal the results of its first ever National Review of Jazz. This assessment will then be used to allocate funds for the following financial year (1995/96) although, given the gloomy climate for funding as a whole, and the council's record over funding jazz in particular, the beard-and-beret set are not optimistic. Arts Council research (for 1991/92) shows that the same number of people attended opera as jazz (2.74m). Those at opera got Pounds 7.95 subsidy a head while the jazzer got just 8.5p. While it might not be fair to play off one art form against another - classical music buffs get Pounds 1.66, ballet fans Pounds 5.74, and contemporary dance-goers Pounds 1.56 - the numbers do say something about the artistic order, and how the funders see the place of jazz in it. Jazz has coloured a great deal of what is considered new and exciting in music (in rap as much as in new classical music) and even in literature (Toni Morrison's Jazz), and it continues to explore new territory. This development, precisely because its success is not assured, so often takes place without commercial encouragement. But this is the place for subsidy, surely. (Or perhaps the creeping comfort of the 'heritage' movement would be more generous about preserving, say, trad jazz). It is not even that modern jazz is entirely too challenging: audiences are submitting themselves to it in increasing numbers. The same Arts Council survey has shown attendances for the music have grown by 20 per cent in the five years to 1991 - the so-called jazz boom. This is why the jazz constituency - musicians, promoters and audiences, - feel a turning point has been reached. Not only would renewed funding keep the fires of improvisation burning in 1994, it could also reward the growing curiosity of new listeners.</p>

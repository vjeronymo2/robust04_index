			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Karpenko: "Parliament's Discussion of </F> Privatization in Russia Unusually Calm So Far"]    [Text] Joint hearings on the results of privatization took  place in the Russian parliament 12 April. Considering past  experience of such events, they were amazingly calm and  businesslike. According to Anatoliy Chubays' report, the major  results of check privatization were the creation of a major  stratum of private owners (around 40 million) and a stock  market, as well as a new -- to us, that is -- investment  institution: investment funds, of which there are now more than  650. He spent a further hour answering numerous deputies'  questions, practically none of them aggressive or angry,  surprisingly enough. Now were there any quesitons of this kind  during the discussion of the results.    The tranquil atmosphere in the hall was surprising also  because the substantial file of materials prepared for the  hearings, weighing in at 1.5 kg, included some explosive  findings by deputies' groups, accusing the Committee for the  Management of State Property of all manner of mortal sins. For  instance, the "Russian Way" ["Rossiyskiy Put"] deputies' group,  headed by I. Anichkin and S. Baburin, finds that the current  privatization "contains the roots of a speculative, mafia,  criminal economy," "robs working people, contains the roots of a  civil war and possible return to totalitarianism," and so on.  While Mr. Zhirinovskiy, on behalf of the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia], in his typically forthright manner,  simply prposed that an audit be carried out and that criminal  actions be taken against the privatizers.    But these charges were totally absent from the speeches at  the hearings, indeed there was no political debate at all --  according to one deputy, the discussion was not about "political  economy and not about economic policy." But the hearings have  not ended and will be continued next week. Maybe the  aggressively minded section of the corps of deputies intends to  try to obstruct privatization then.    Evidently believing there was no possibility of a political  scandal, some deputies started to drift away as soon as the  discussion began. By the end of the hearings you had the  chronic disease of the former parliament -- only around  one-fourth of those who had originally assembled were still  present.    I put the following question to Anatoliy Chubays after the  parliamentary hearings: How do you explain the entirely  good-natured and calm tone of the speeches today?    "Perhaps it is a good thing that today's discussion was not  at the level of hysterics and hurling of vouchers," Anatoliy  Borisevich replied.    Incidentally, a whole series of speeches, perhaps not very  shrill or flashy, was substantive and contained rather  significant new elements. There were speakers today who are  participating responsibly in privatization. What, for example,  does the check fund indicate? "We want to be actively engaged  in long-term investments and we cannot do that for one reason or  another." Look, a structure has emerged, which demands that  deputies make it possible to engage in long-term investments --  it is an entirely new situation in the real Russian market.  There were plenty of moments of this kind. Let us pray that  the second part of the discussion is as substantive and without  any hysterics...    "And are they to be expected, do you think?"    "Well, those who were preparing certain recommendations have  not gone away. I think they will come to the next hearings  revitalized. I am well aware that serious preparations are  still going on. Nothing happened, because the atmosphere in the  hall was wrong. Certain young deputies simply lacked the  experience of political intrigues. I expect there will be  statements by political parties about what I have lovingly  stashed away in my own briefcase, about my responsibility for  the disintegration of Russia, and so on. Let us draw any  conclusions about how aggressive parliament is when the hearings  are over..."</p>

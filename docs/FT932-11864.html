			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: BNL seeks new partner and L3,000bn injection BANCA NAZIONALE del Lavoro, the Italian Treasury-controlled bank, needs to raise L3,000bn (Dollars 2bn) in fresh capital and in the absence of additional state funds is looking for a new partner. Mr Gianpiero Cantoni, chairman, speaking after the board approved the 1992 accounts, said the capital injection was not 'to cover losses but to develop BNL's mission as a universal bank'. BNL has been weakened by the scandal over Dollars 4bn in loans made by the bank's Atlanta branch to Iraq. Last July, when it was converted into a public company with the Treasury holding a 57 per cent stake, the government estimated BNL needed L2,000bn in fresh funds. The Treasury as well as its other main shareholder, INA, the state insurance institute in line for privatisation, made it clear no public funds were available. BNL has been looking for an outside partner, but the authorities are considering first an Italian alliance. For 1992, the bank raised net earnings 5 per cent to L78bn. Gross profit before depreciation and provisions rose to L1,419bn from L1,204bn. As in 1991, the gap between net and gross earnings is explained by the need to set aside depreciation charges and provisions totalling L1,839bn. Mr Cantoni said BNL was awaiting the outcome of legal developments in the US over the BNL-Atlanta affair and the trial of Mr Christopher Droghoul, former branch manager, to see how much of the Dollars 350m credit guaranteed by the CCC, the US credit guarantee body, could be recovered.</p>

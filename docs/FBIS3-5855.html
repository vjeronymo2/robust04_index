They agreed that the third-party organization should be managed  by the private sector without members who are ex-governmental  officials. Japan-U.S. relations have become stressed due to  Japan's surplus. Both Keidanren and Rengo believe that Japan  should aim at reducing the surplus by promoting structural  reform, particularly through deregulation, and that deregulation  conducted mainly by bureaucrats may be limited in its effect.  Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa and other top officials  intend to make a formal proposal on their demands to top  officials of the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA],  including Director General Koshiro Ishida on 24 March.    The concept of setting up a third-party body is based on the  recommendations previously made by the "Economic Reform Study  Council" (known as the Hiraiwa Council) and the Ad Hoc Council  for Promoting Administrative Reform. The MCA is currently  studying details of this body. However, Keidanren thinks "the  fact that bureaucrats, mainly from the MCA, assume leadership in  working out the bill is, in itself, a problem," (according to  the Keidanren Secretariat). Thus, top Keidanren and Rengo  officials decided to discuss this matter in depth.    During the meeting, Rengo Secretary General Washio said: "As  a third-party organization, it should exclude members who speak  for the government ministries and agencies and it should select  members mainly from the private sector. It should have an  independent secretariat and be granted rights to recommend  investigations and to order submission of related documents."    Keidanren Vice Chairman Isao Nakauchi said: "I quite agree  with you." Thus, the participants agreed on excluding former  governmental officials.    With regard to the issue of reducing Japan's surplus, they  agreed that "while we oppose setting up numerical targets, it is  necessary to promote cutting the surplus in various ways,  including expansion of domestic demand."</p>

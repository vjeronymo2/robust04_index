			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: PURSUIT OF STARSHIP FAILS TO GET OFF GROUND  </P> <P> Beam me up, Scotty, somebody down here is trying to rip me off.  </P> <P> Like a noble Vulcan battling a gang of beetle-browed Klingons, free-lance  writer Craig Pendergast has a mission. He feels Paramount Pictures Corp. swiped  his ideas for the movie "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock."  </P> <P> Pendergast, 33, a San Diego resident and marketing manager for a vocational  school, circulated his script, "Ghost Ship," to several Hollywood agents in the  early 1980s. He even has a letter from William Shatner's agent saying the actor  admired the "hook" (the obstacles the hero must overcome).  </P> <P> But when Pendergast asked for a cut of the movie's profits, doors were closed  and phone calls were not returned. His lawyer wrote to Paramount, outlining  more than a dozen plot similarities between "Ghost Ship" and "Star Trek III."  </P> <P> Some examples: Both the screenplay and movie involve new propulsion units for  the "warp" engines of spacecraft. In both, Adm. Kirk is temporarily relieved of  command. In the screenplay, the 9-year-old son of Spock plays a central role;  in the movie, the 9-year-old is Spock himself, regenerating by the "Genesis"  effect.  </P> <P> A Paramount attorney responded that any similarity between screenplay and movie  is because Pendergast used "elements of our copyrighted works" from previous  "Star Trek" movies. He said the movie was already in "post-production" when  "Ghost Ship" arrived.  </P> <P> In 1986, Pendergast filed suit against Paramount, Shatner, Leonard Nimoy (who  played Spock and directed "Star Trek III") and several agents and writers.  Lacking the money for a lengthy legal battle, Pendergast has not pursued the  court case.  </P> <P> He has, however, begun petitioning Congress to change the federal copyright law  to make it easier for free-lance writers to pursue claims of literary theft.  </P> <P> "I just can't get it out of my craw," Pendergast said. "And I'm not even a  Trekkie."  </P> <P> He is also writing a novel. This time, he's not taking any chances. He won't  discuss even the barest outline before it's completed, copyrighted and  delivered to an agent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ornament Hoods  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department hopes it has put a stop to the snatching of hood  ornaments in North County.  </P> <P> For months, the ornaments from Mercedes-Benzes and other upscale cars have been  disappearing in record numbers -- and reappearing as jewelry and club  medallions worn by teen-agers. A code of silence among the teens seemed to  protect the snatchers.  </P> <P> Four high school students have now been arrested for snapping off ornaments,  smashing windows and taking stereos from cars on a Vista used-car lot. When  they allegedly ripped off a fellow student's car, somebody called the cops.  </P> <P> Detective Mary Helmen describes the four as first offenders from "good  families" who turned to vandalism out of boredom.  </P> <P> "I doubt we'll get all the ornaments back," she said. "The whole senior class  is wearing them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Imbalance of Nature  </P> <P> Rattlesnakes sometimes bite people. Rattlesnakes always scare people. So, when  the county Department of Parks and Recreation opened Louis A. Stelzer Park on  Wildcat Canyon Road outside Lakeside six years ago, the indigenous rattlers  were relocated.  </P> <P> Whenever a red diamondback or a southern Pacific is spotted, county rangers  slip a noose over its head and gently move it to a brushy ravine several miles  from the public area. The snake population has dropped sharply, but fewer  snakes means more mice.  </P> <P> The park's other mouse-eaters, two owls and a family of hawks, have not been  able to handle the extra workload. As a result, the park has now hit critical  (mouse) mass.  </P> <P> "We've had a mouse explosion," said park ranger Maureen McNeece. "They're  eating our files, our maps, our books, everything. We put out baited  mousetraps, but they keep coming. It's extraordinary."  </P></p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Workers seek to stop USAir contract move Labour unions at USAir, the US carrier in which British Airways holds a 22 per cent stake, say they are seeking a federal injunction to stop the airline's plans to contract out its airfreight and mail handling operations at 35 cities, writes Richard Tomkins in New York. USAir announced the move last week, saying it would save Dollars 10m a year. The 510 full-time and 122 part-time workers affected would be invited to apply for other jobs within the company, it said. Just before USAir announced the move, a majority of its 8,000 fleet service workers had voted to join a union. Yesterday, the United Steelworkers of America, one of the unions covering the industry, accused USAir of trying to discourage employees from joining by creating the impression it would retaliate with lay-offs. USAir said the union's suit was 'baseless and without merit'.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation (22): Customer service enhanced - Electronic forms / Electronic mail has long taken over from telexes and paper forms at Mercedes-Benz Mercedes-Benz originally installed Verimation's Memo office automation package to get rid of telexes. Today, the vehicle manufacturer not only uses the package as its standard method of telecommunications, both internally and to dealers, but also as a replacement for paper forms, writes John Kavanagh. Mercedes-Benz has 1,000 staff and 180 franchisees in the UK. It introduced Memo in 1988 on its IBM mainframe computer at the UK headquarters in Milton Keynes. The franchisees now have computer systems of their own and all but a handful connect to the mainframe to use Memo. There are 2,000 electronic mailbox users on the UK system. 'The initial aim was to cut the number of telexes and telephone calls,' says Mr Andy Sheldon, who is responsible for supporting Memo users in the UK. 'We were getting 500 free-format telexes a day from the UK franchisees, for example, to order emergency parts needed on top of their standard stock deliveries. 'The franchisees now complete a structured electronic form on their systems and transmit it via Memo. Staff in the parts department check all orders on their workstations and can accept, reject, correct or query them, sending the queries back via electronic mail. All this has cut paper and time. 'Another major time-saving application went live last October. In the past, if a part received by a dealer was damaged, a lot of paperwork was raised and it took 15 days to process a claim. We've now introduced an electronic form here, too. The warehouse people look at a claim on screen and decide on the appropriate action. There is no paper involved at all. 'This has cut the time to handle damaged parts from 15 days to 1 1/2 days. There have been staff-savings here: previously there was a significant data entry function, but now the dealers do it themselves.' The electronic forms are also used internally. Secretaries fill in weekly absence reports for their departments through Memo. Staff going on trips book travel and accommodation by sending an electronic form to the company's travel agent, which is linked to the system. The latest application is expected to have a big effect on customer service. 'From February, dealers can get immediate automatic decisions on goodwill claims,' says Andy Sheldon. 'If a part fails just outside the warranty period, the dealer can fill in an electronic form; this goes through Memo to a system on our mainframe which looks up the customer details and various tables to decide whether the part will be replaced free of charge. Previously this involved phone calls or faxes: now there's a decision within five seconds, while the customer is with the dealer.' Other central applications also have links to the electronic mail system. When new cars arrive at Harwich from Germany, the vehicle system is informed and this generates a message to the appropriate dealers. Mercedes-Benz does not use the bulletin board facility, which can hold announcements for inspection by any user. Instead, it sends general messages  -such as reports on stolen cars - to a central electronic mail box which each dealer has in addition to its individual staff mailboxes. 'All the mailboxes are held on disc on our mainframe and there are about 100,000 messages stored at any time, so if we had the bulletin board we would save disc space by only holding the general messages once,' Andy Sheldon says. 'However, that means buying the software, so it's swings and roundabouts.' The diary facility is used extensively to arrange meetings and book rooms and equipment. 'Very few people in my division have diaries,' Mr Sheldon says. The UK operation chose Memo because the group uses it as the worldwide standard. Mercedes-Benz's international data communications network links 15 mainframe computer installations and serves 110,000 Memo users, making the company Verimation's biggest customer. Most communication in the UK and with Germany and other countries goes via electronic mail as a matter of course. 'We saved several hundred thousands pounds in the first year by cutting phone and telex costs,' he adds, 'but we've had electronic mail for so long now and it's become so ensconced that we don't even really think about the savings any more.' Memo electronic mail system Memo also offers electronic forms, work flow management, bulletin board and scheduling facilities, some as standard and others as extras. It was launched in 1984. The latest version, 4.1, was released at the end of 1993. Supplier: Verimation, formed by Volvo in Sweden in 1984 and in the UK in 1987. Now 25 per cent owned by Volvo and 75 per cent by Swedish software company Sapia. Volvo owns Memo. Turnover in 1992 was Pounds 12m. There are five staff in the UK and 280 worldwide. Number of users: 1.9m at 900 worldwide sites, including 42 in the UK and 420 in the rest of Europe. Memo has 7.5 per cent of the mainframe electronic mail market in the UK and 8.5 per cent worldwide. It has 4.5 per cent of the total electronic mail market, world-wide. Price: Depends on computer. Unlimited licence for an IBM MVS mainframe is Pounds 34,500.</p>

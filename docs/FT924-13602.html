			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Kohl and Delors demand united front on treaty CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, insisted yesterday that the 12 EC member states must press ahead together in ratifying the Maastricht treaty on European union. At the same time they agreed that the Community must show it is ready to 'learn from its mistakes' and to answer the growing public concerns in many member states. The two met for an extraordinary two-hour session in Bonn. 'Birmingham must produce a clear signal of cohesion and confidence that Europe will continue to move ahead on the basis of Maastricht,' they declared. Germany is strongly supporting initiatives to strengthen the transparency of EC decision-making, and the need for maximum 'subsidiarity'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ion Cristoiu: "Romania's Status in the World </F> at the End of 1993"]    [Text] Those who follow the international press and  television were able to note that, of late, a true campaign has  begun to present Romania as the country with the greatest number  of difficult problems in Eastern Europe. Ever since the  beginning of December, the big dailies and news agencies in the  intensively developed countries placed particular emphasis on  the antigovernment and antipresidential demonstrations organized  in Bucharest and throughout the country by the trade unions and  students organizations. All press items and television  broadcasts mentioned the fact that these were the most  widespread people's demonstrations in the wake of December 1989.  Western investors, who form their opinion about a country from  newspapers and television programs, probably had the impression  of a social-politically instable Romania that is shaken by  social unrest. Thus it is clear that no investor will be  tempted to invest his money in a country that is more unstable  than quicksand. The anniversary of the Romanian revolution was  an opportunity for the international press and television to  review the road covered by Romania so far. Catastrophic, to say  the least, was the conclusion drawn by all press reportages and  television programs devoted to this inventory. From the United  States to Japan, readers were reminded that Romania is the only  country in the East where the communists are still in power and  that Romania is a country led by extreme nationalists, even  fascists. Now, at the end of the year, Western reporters deemed  it fit to deal again with Romania. The image one gets from  Western television reportage is that of a backward country that  has been unable to break away not only from communism, but not  even from Ceausism [Ceausescu-type of system]. The European  television channel Euro-News last week broadcast two singularly  violent reportages devoted to Romania. First, they dwelled on  the absolute poverty prevailing in the country. Second, on the  nostalgia regarding Nicolae Ceausescu. Other reputed television  channels also carried programs devoted to Romania. CNN, for  instance, carried a brief reportage on HIV-positive children in  Romania, who are spending their last days in the misery of local  hospitals. The French TV5 Channel dealt with the street  children. The images broadcast by CNN, Euro-News, and TV5 to  the world are strikingly reminiscent of the images broadcast by  international television channels immediately after the December  1989 revolution. It goes without saying that now, at the end of  1993, Romania's image in the world, an image created by the  international press and television, is as poor as that of 1990.    The violent campaign against Romania may be surprising up to  a point. Within the inventory made regarding 1993, the  presidency and government boasted about great international  achievements: the granting of most-favored-nation status, the  accord with the IMF, and the admission to the Council of Europe.  More surprising than ever before, President Ion Iliescu assured  us that Romania's isolation has come to an end. The position of  the international press and television is also shocking because  of the way they report on actual reality. No matter how  critically we viewed Iliescu's regime, a regime that has been in  power in Romania since December 1989, we cannot say that nothing  has changed on the sociopolitical or economic levels. At least  from a legal point of view, the foundation was laid for a  pluralist system, there is freedom of expression, and the market  economy has begun to take shape. It is clear that the  television programs and press articles devoted to Romania do not  bear this in mind. Portraying Romania in black colors is also  slightly strange from another point of view. For more than a  year now, the government and presidency have been talking about  the tremendous political and financial efforts to improve our  country's image in the world. Tremendous sums of U.S. dollars  have been spent on publicity in reputable dailies and weeklies.  Each Romanian in the Diaspora is being courted infinitely. The  Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that all our embassies have  made it their aim to present the true situation in our country.    The surprising nature of Romania's disastrous image in the  world is only apparent. In actual fact, the poor portrayal of  our country in the Western press and television is perfectly  explicable. It represent the effect of a situation that was  specific to Romania after the December 1989 revolution. The  period that followed the Romanian revolution was a period of  disappointment throughout the world. I am not talking of the  fact that the former party activist, Ion Iliescu, is at the helm  of the country. In other countries, which belonged to the  communist camp, power was also taken over by former communists.  They, however, manifested themselves from the very beginning as  firm advocates of political pluralism, democracy, and market  economy. Admitting publicly that they had been communists, they  proved that the long experience of dictatorship convinced them  of the failure of implementing the Marxist-Leninist doctrine.  Ion Iliescu and his cronies did not do the same. For a long  time, the current president acted as a tardy perestroykist. In  his statements in 1990 he pleaded for communism with a human  face. This public support for communism was coupled by a number  of political actions, which were clearly at variance with  democratic principles. I am talking of the famous miners'  incursions, which attempted to eliminate the opposition and the  independent press by means of armed civilians. By and by, the  international press formed the image of a Ion Iliescu full of  communist nostalgia.    Public opinion throughout the world was convinced of this  on the basis of the articles and televised reportage devoted to  the violation of the principles of democracy in Romania after  December 1989. Unfortunately for Ion Iliescu, the history of  Russia and of the Eastern countries took a different course than  the one desired by him. In Russia, the former activist Boris  Yeltsin proceeded to radical democratic reforms and the market  economy. All the countries, which used to belong to communism,  firmly embarked on the road to a market economy. Had Gorbachev  not fallen, had Russia not embarked on the road to democracy,  and had the communist regimes in China and Cuba not declared the  bankruptcy of the centralized economy, Ion Iliescu would  probably have advocated the cause of communism with a human  face. Left all by himself in Eastern Europe, slowly, slowly the  president worked toward a substantial change in his political  platform. Under domestic and international pressure, he  declared to be the advocate of democratic reform. Firmly  influenced also by the former FSN [National Salvation Front]  reformist grouping, he had to accept, albeit reluctantly, the  radical measures in the direction of proceeding to a market  economy. Consequently, pluralism and a free market began to take  shape in Romania. The press, however, works with general  images, in general terms. It has to constantly bear in mind the  already existing opinion of its readers. Thus, when it came to  Ion Iliescu and realities in Romania, the international press  and television were subject to this very law. The president's  and our country's image is that formed in the wake of the 1989  revolution. That is the image of a neocommunist president who  is leading a country immobilized by its obsolete structures. To  alter this image is a very difficult thing. For this to happen,  the international press would have to assume numerous risks,  including that of contradicting its readers. Consequently,  foreign reporters come to Romania with an image they formed in  1990. Here, however, they find a much more pronounced reality.  It is difficult and practically impossible for them to reflect  these nuances in their reporting. This is why they seek  elements in Romania's reality today that will confirm their  preconceived image. Hence the contradiction between the  reportages devoted to Romania of late and the reality of our  sociopolitical situation, including the president's conduct. It  is useless to talk about how harmful this perception of our  country in the world is. As I have said before, the former  communist countries are involved in a fierce competition in  order to attract foreign capital and to occupy a place in the  forefront in the world today. This period following the  collapse of communism is decisive for the place of a former  communist country in the world hierarchy. The big European and  worldwide games are taking place now. This is tellingly proven  by the question regarding the East European countries' entry  into NATO. All East and Central European countries want  guarantees on the part of the most powerful military treaty in  the present-day world regarding possible expansionist attempts  by Moscow. Obtaining such guarantees is, for each country that  used to belong to the communist camp, a matter of national  interest. The position of the West toward this desire of the  East European countries is being established, however, on the  basis of the image each of these states, which were formerly  under Soviet occupation, enjoy in the world. Thus it is clear  that Romania's image in the international press plays a decisive  role in the place and role attributed to our country by the  great powers in the Balkan area and in Europe. Naturally, there  are numerous situations in which the great powers specifically  bear in mind their geopolitical interests. No government of any  Western country can take the liberty, however, of ignoring  public opinion. No matter how important Romania would be from a  geopolitical point of view, the leaders of the major powers also  have to bear in mind what the public thinks about Romania. And  the beliefs of the public are forged by the press and  television. From this point of view, we may say that Romania's  image in the international press and television profoundly harms  our national interests. The West's reticence toward our entry  into NATO is a sign of this harmful reality.    However, how can Romania's image in the world be changed?  That is very easy. Through a radical change in the political  regime, a change that through its spectacular nature would  decisively influence Western public opinion. This change could  be achieved, among other things, in two directions. One would  be President Ion Iliescu's firm public commitment to reform and  democracy. As long as the president continues, however, to  flounder, to promote an ambiguous policy that is neither  rightist, nor leftist, this direction will be practically  impossible. Another solution would be to form a coalition  government with the participation of the opposition. Given its  exceptional nature, this event would capture the attention of  the media throughout the world. For the international press and  television this would be a real opportunity to persuade the  public that something has happened in Romania. Is Cotroceni  [presidency seat] aware of this requirement? Judging by the  bluff represented by the initiative of consulting the  parliamentary parties, it seems that the answer is no.</p>

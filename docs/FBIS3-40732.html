There was widespread agitation following this in both the Lok  Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. In a short period of two hours, the  Lok Sabha had to postpone proceedings three times, the Rajya  Sabha, twice.    In the Rajya Sabha, the first to raise issue were JD [Janata  Dal] and the members of the LF [Left Front]. They demanded to  know if the administration had accepted the Dunkel proposals.  They demanded that Prime Minister Rao come in person to the  parliament to explain the government's position. Those present  from the BJP also supported this demand by JD and LF. It was  believed that the government had already adopted the draft, and  the JD members had worn black arm-bands to show opposition to  this. In the Rajya Sabha, Jaipal Reddy (JD), and Sugumal Sen  (CPI-M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] raised this issue.  There were press reports of the cabinet committee appointed to  investigate financial matters approving the signing of the  draft, and they demanded to know if this was true. Jaipal Reddy  equated the signing to the staking of India's sovereignty. As  this statement led to agitation and disorder in the House,  Deputy Speaker Najma Heptullah postponed the proceedings. When  they re-convened, opposition members raised the same issue  again. They demanded that the government issue a statement on  this matter, and that the Commerce Minister come in Person to  explain the matter in the House.    Following this, Sayyad Chipte Razi, deputing for Heptullah  pacified the assembly by announcing that Najma Heptullah had  conferred with Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji, who had agreed  to give a briefing the next day. Jaipal Reddy, Subrahmanyam  Swamy, Ashok Mitra, and others did not accept this and  threatened to paralyze proceedings if they were not told  immediately if the government had decided to sign the agreement  or not. This was followed by great confusion in the parliament.  Since the situation kept deteriorating, and nothing could be  accomplished, the speaker had to postpone the proceedings once  again to the next day.  <H5>  `Dharna' by Political Parties: </H5>   On Wednesday, many political parties and farmers' groups  conducted a "Dharna" [picketting] in Jantar Mantar opposing the  Dunkel proposals. They insisted that the government not sign the  draft, and demanded a total rejection of it. Samajwadi Party's  general secretary Raghu Thakur, Telugu Desam Parliamentary Party  leader, V.S. Rao, CPI-M leaderAshok Mitra, Indian People's  Front's national general secretary, Kumudini Pati, and Bharatiya  Kisan Sangh-Delhi Branch leader Mahavir Singh participated in  this dharna-agitation.    Leaders who spoke in the dharna gathering accused the  government of selling the country out instead of safeguarding  its interests by opposing schemes like the Dunkel plan. There  were nation-wide agitations opposing the Dunkel proposals.</p>

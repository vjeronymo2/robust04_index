			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Risk and Reward: UK equity options trading fails to find its stride EQUITY options trading in Germany has surged in the last few years, despite the relatively low level of stock investment in Germany. But the UK equity options market has still failed to take off, even though UK fund managers are heavily invested in stocks. Preconceptions that an active stock market is a prerequisite for a healthy options market seem to be wrong. A year after the merger of London's futures and options exchanges, amid hopes that the union would revive trading in UK stock options, the best that can be said is that volume has stabilised. Trading in individual stock options had been falling steadily since 1987, when retail investors were scared off by the stock market crash. But UK fund managers have not been willing converts, despite marketing efforts by the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe). Liffe's difficulties are part of a broader trend: US-based exchanges - from a far stronger base - have suffered declining volume in stock option business, as retail investors deserted their markets. But Germany's Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), has bucked the trend. In 1992, the DTB traded 14m Dax option contracts and 10m individual stock options, compared with 3m FT-SE options and 4.5m individual equity options on Liffe. There are a number of factors involved. First of all, the smaller number of large German companies may actually have proved an advantage, rather than a disadvantage. Liffe lists 66 UK stock options, while the DTB lists only 15, concentrating on the relatively small group of blue-chip German companies. Mr Roger Barton, head of product development, said that Liffe is considering reducing the number of options, but the problem is that liquidity tends to shift, so that an option on one stock may be very quiet for as much as a year, and then suddenly spring to life. Many options specialists believe that the DTB's screen-based trading system is better suited to options that Liffe's open-outcry market, since it is easier to trade a variety of similar products - in this case, different series of options - on a screen. Liffe's APT screen-trading system is being developed to handle options, but the board has yet to decide whether to go ahead with screen-based trading. The systems capability is expected to be ready by the end of the year. Many options traders also argue that the rules governing the UK stock market are a severe handicap to dealing in stock options. The delay in reporting large equity trades gives the main equity marketmakers an unfair advantage, and forces options marketmakers to make prices on an uneven playing field, they argue. Another advantage for the DTB is that there are tax benefits involved: foreign investors can avoid paying capital gains tax on German share dividends by using the options market. But, given the potential revenues available, many analysts are surprised that more UK fund managers do not write call options. Writing, or selling, call options involves agreeing to sell an equity at a pre-set 'strike' price: an extremely dangerous practice for investors who are not covered. But for fund managers, holding huge portfolios of shares, it is a relatively attractive method of earning money and boosting performance. But even if more fund managers started to write options, there is still a lack of business on the other side of the equation, hence Liffe's desire to promote equity options among retail investors, who often buy options as a means of obtaining exposure to a stock for a limited outlay. The other hope is that the development of a more active over-the-counter market in equity derivatives, which many banks are actively pursuing, would feed through into the exchange-traded market as banks seek to manage their exposure. But business in that area too, seems to have stalled.</p>

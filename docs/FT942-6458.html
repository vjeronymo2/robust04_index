			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Data deluge will set tone for summer - New York In the US, the Memorial Day weekend traditionally marks the beginning of silly season. As Wall Street gets back to work tomorrow after the three-day holiday, investors will face an avalanche of economic reports which could set the tone for the summer months. Tuesday will bring news of personal income, consumer spending and new homes sales during April. The flow of data will intensify the next day, when the National Association of Purchasing Management will release its monthly survey of business activity. It will culminate with the Commerce Department's report on May employment, due out Friday. The optimistic scenario sees stocks holding up well, even if the bond market slips further. The leading indices could show modest improvement if the data confirm expectations that the economy slowed slightly in May. 'I think we are in a phase in which most of the monthly numbers will remain subdued,' says Mr James Solloway, head of equity research at Argus in New York, whose estimates are generally below those of his colleagues. If there are surprises, however, share prices could suffer a setback in sympathy with bonds. 'We are faced with a bond market which still on the defensive,' Mr Solloway says, 'It will stay that way until it becomes clear that monetary policy is tight enough to slow the economy.' If the NAPM index comes in at 60 or better, against a consensus forecast of 57, or if the gain in non-farm payrolls exceeds 300,000, against an expected rise of 285,000, the season may prove to be more sombre than silly. The next move by the Federal Reserve to tighter money would then loom larger. A fortnight ago, the Fed seemed to suggest it would hold off further interest rate increases until autumn. However, then it had not made any guarantees, a point underscored on Friday by Alan Greenspan in testimony before Congress. The chairman did not spell out the Fed's intentions, but he stressed that 'uncertainties regarding the economy remain'. His remarks left the bond market, already riding out a big bump caused by the Commerce Department's upward revision of its first-quarter Gross domestic product, on even shakier footing going into this week. However, Mr Joseph McAlinden, director of research at Dillon Read in New York, believes stocks will hold steady despite the data barrage. 'The markets may enter a temporary period of calm,' he writes in his May advisory. He argues that none of the reports this week will shed light on the impact of the Fed's series of four policy tightening. He says the effect of tighter money on the economy will not show up until at least July. However, the analyst remains bearish. He characterises his lazy summertime scenario as the 'eye of the hurricane', a period of calm in the middle of a two-phase market correction. 'We continue to believe that the second leg will kick in when the end-of-the-summer inflation reports come in worst than expected.'</p>

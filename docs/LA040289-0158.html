			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PUBLIC WOMAN AS HONORARY MAN;  </P> <P> THE WARRIOR QUEENS BY ANTONIA FRASER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $22.95; 383 PP.)  </P> <P> "The Warrior Queens," Antonia Fraser's most recent historical essay, is  lore-packed, quirky in its approach, and fascinating to read. If nonfiction  books can be thought of as detailed answers to unvoiced questions, then the  question answered by this one is: How have female political and military  leaders gotten away with it? How have they managed to fob themselves off on  those hardest to convince -- soldiers and other politicians, those  quintessentially male devisers and players of boys' games -- as worthy leaders  of the charge or captains of the ship of state, although long of hair and bulgy  of breast? Such women have been few enough in number so that the exceptions  have very much proven the rule. But what about those exceptions? What was their  strategy, their sleight-of-hand? What was their secret?  </P> <P> In pursuit of answers, Fraser has assembled a remarkable group of women for our  contemplation. She begins with Boadicea herself, that famed but shadowy  1st-Century British tribal queen who led a revolt against the occupying and  oppressive Romans, massacred a lot of them, and was said to have committed  suicide when her forces were massacred in return. Fraser provides as faithful  an account of the events as is possible, given that information is scarce and  reports vary. But she is just as interested in Boadicea's metamorphoses in  historical and literary accounts through the ages -- from pious patriot and  martyr, mother of her people, to unwomanly, bloodthirsty shrew, to symbol of  heroic British imperialism, ironic in view of the fact that her own revolt was  against an earlier imperialism. The accounts of her have varied according to  what men considered proper womanly behavior, and to what the British considered  proper British behavior; thus Boadicea has been both slut and saint. Very early  on, the myth detached itself from the real woman in question, and has been  floating around ever since, ready to stick itself like a leech to any woman  hardy enough to brandish a spear or declare for office.  </P> <P> Fraser follows up with a varied assortment of women from many centuries and  civilizations who have held, however briefly, the reins of power: Zenobia, the  3rd-Century Queen of Palmyra who also challenged Roman rule; Empress Maud, of  the 12th-Century English wars of succession; Queen Tamara of Georgia, "The Lion  of the Caucasus"; Elizabeth I, inspiring her troops to battle the Spanish  Armada; Isabella of Spain; the engaging Queen Jinga of Angola, who successfully  defied the Portuguese colonists; Catherine the Great of Russia; the Vietnamese  heroines, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi; the amazing Rani of Jhansi, who fought the  British in India; Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, and a good many more, concluding  with that handy bookend to Boadicea, Margaret Thatcher. Their childhoods, their  paths to leadership, and their styles vary enormously, but they have one thing  in common: All were instantly mythologized. Male military leaders, taken for  all in all, have been men, and that has been enough; but female ones cannot be  mere women. They are aberrations, and as such are thought to partake of the  supernatural or the monstrous: angels or devils, paragons of chastity or demons  of lust, Whores of Babylon or Iron Maidens. Sometimes they have profited from  the female saints or goddesses available to them through their cultures,  sometimes they have had to work against such images. Their femininity has been  both shackle and banner.  </P> <P> As leaders, they have had to be, like female doctors a decade ago, better than  men. They have shamed their male followers by displaying superior courage; they  have shamed their male adversaries by inflicting defeat on them at the hands of  a mere woman. They have outmaneuvered, outtalked, outblustered, and in some  cases outshot and outridden the cream of the male crop. Altogether they are an  impressive lot, and Fraser is to be congratulated for rescuing them from their  own myths and for giving them their due as individuals, the lesser-known among  them as well as the household words.  </P> <P> But although they have been trotted out like a roll call by many advocates for  the equality of women, and presented in many guises -- from turn-of-the-century  pageants to Judy Chicago's "Dinner Party" -- these women have seldom allied  themselves with women in general, or with movements for the improvement of  their lot. More typically, they have distanced themselves from women, like  Elizabeth I, who was against female rule but saw herself as a divinely placed  exception, or like Catherine the Great, who spoke of the "weak, frivolous,  whining species of women." Many have preferred the status of honorary males. If  you're playing boys' games, you need to be one of the boys.  </P> <P> This book should be required reading for any woman going into politics,  truck-driving or the Army; indeed, by any woman going into anything, unless her  chosen field is uniquely feminine. Public women are put through different tests  of nerve, attract different kinds of criticism, and are subject to different  sorts of mythologizing than are men, and "The Warrior Queens' " indicates what  kinds.  </P> <P> Those of us for whom politics is a spectator sport will find it useful, too. It  goes a long way toward explaining the various media transformations of, for  instance, Margaret Thatcher, from her Attila-the-Hen period through her  Iron-Maiden-Falkland-War phase to her incarnation as an editorial-cartoon  Boadicea, complete with whip and chariot, triumphant on election day and  dragging a clutch of pygmy men in her wake. Women leaders, it seems, find it  difficult to be life-sized. For good or ill, they are gigantic.  </P></p>

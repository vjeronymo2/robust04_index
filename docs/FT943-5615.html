			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Broker caution hits Rolls Aero-engines group Rolls-Royce came under pressure in heavy trading of 15m shares as broker's trimmed 1995 forecasts after the group reported interim figures at the bottom end of expectations. The shares fell 10 in early trading after the company revealed profits of Pounds 40m, against a market range of Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m. However, with analysts on the sector away at other results meetings, bargain hunters quickly moved into the stock leaving it to trade in positive territory for a short period mid-session. The shares eventually closed 8 down at 180p, as analysts digested what many considered a downbeat presentation from the company chairman. Researchers were particularly concerned by comments from the company that engine deliveries for 1995 were at this stage likely to be lower than expected. Many analysts stuck to their 1994 forecasts of around Pounds 100m but reduced the following year's figure to reflect the company's comments. NatWest Securities reduced its figure by Pounds 9m to Pounds 136m, while Credit Lyonnais downgraded its forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 135m. The shares have outperformed the market for most of the year and general profit-taking, along with sell recommendations from several brokers earlier this weak, contributed to the malaise.</p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: A positive impact Sir, Joe Rogaly ('Down with the lottery]', December 17/18) says the national lottery 'will provide no benefit to anyone save perhaps the shareholders of Camelot'. May I suggest that the scheme acts as a welcome redistribution of available funds from the leading national fund consumers to much needed micro-projects in many communities and thus has a positive impact on the lives of countless people.

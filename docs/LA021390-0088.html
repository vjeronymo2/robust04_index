Both clubs rescheduled for  this weekend.  </P> <P> The Coast Guard also ordered all ocean races out of the Long Beach area  canceled on Sunday when the oil slick neared that area. Clubs affected were  Long Beach Yacht Club, Seal Beach Yacht Club, Alamitos Bay Yacht Club and  Little Ships Fleet.  </P> <P> Races inside the harbors of Newport Beach and Alamitos Bay were sailed as  scheduled.

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Marriott rejects investors' claims MARRIOTT, the hotels and management services group, has rejected demands made by representatives of a group of preferred shareholders who have said they intend to bring a lawsuit against the company, AP-DJ reports. The group includes UBS Securities, an affiliate of Union Bank of Switzerland, which holds the largest number of preferred shares in the group. It maintains that Marriott's split of the company, with one segment receiving most of the debt and the other most of Marriott's equity, is 'unlawfully coercive of, and detrimental to, holders of preferred stock.' According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group wants Marriott to change its reorganisation plan, and said it would seek compensation if the plan goes through.</p>

			<p>Traffickers   <F P=102>   94WB0036A Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 19 Apr 94 STATES  Section pp 1, 4 </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0036A </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rocio Galvan] </F>   [Text] Tijuana, Baja California [BC], 18 April--The PAN's  [National Action Party] local congressional faction submitted a  report to the state's governor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, regarding  the shooting that occurred in this town on 3 March. It declares  that the State Judicial Police (PJE) have been implicated in the  drug traffic "ever since Francisco Franco Rios was named head of  the State Attorney General's Office." This claim was made today  by Congressman Armando Ayon, a member of the legislative body's  Justice Commission.    Armando Ayon added that the document confirms certain  statements made by Mexico's ambassador in France and by the  ex-attorney general of the republic, Ignacio Morales Lechuga, to  the effect that "Baja California judicial agents are giving  protection to the drug traffic."    The document sent to Ruffo Appel was ratified by the eight  PAN congressmen in the present legislature, who explain: "Not  all the Judicial Branch officials and agents are in collusion  with the drug traffic."    The investigation was conducted after the shooting that  occurred on 3 March at the La Mesa local branch office, where  five persons were killed: an incident that has not yet been  totally explained. According to the aforementioned report, PJE  agents gave protection to at least one of the drug traffickers  involved in the shooting on this town's Diaz Ordaz Boulevard.    For this reason, the congressmen requested that Ruffo Appel  call for the resignation of Francisco Franco Rios, since the  police collusion with the drug traffic has been proven.    The PJE commander detailed here, Jorge Alvarez Barriere, for  his part, announced that 13 agents from the force had been  dismissed within the past two weeks: five for showing positive  results in the drug testing, and the other eight for "loss of  confidence" in them.</p>

He also assured that the relations  between the Armed Forces of both countries are excellent and  that the measures Colombia is taking to reinforce Venezuelan  border surveillance are the best possible.    [Begin Munoz recording] Never have relations with Colombia  been as good as they are now. The relationship between both  Armed Forces go further than the personal friendship between the  heads of the Colombian and Venezuelan Armed Forces and this also  holds true for the defense ministers -- relations are excellent.  I believe the measures Colombia is taking to support our  domestic measures is a great demonstration of a broad support  based on the various international agreements exercised through  both defense ministers and the various military commanders, both  Colombian and Venezuelan. The agreements we have are being  honored. [end recording]    Likewise, the defense minister reported that starting  January  greater border security efficiency is to be expected. Regarding  the possibility that civilian and military personnel in the  Amparo Case [alleged border massacre] may be pardoned, Munoz  said that the president is studying the case together with other  cases.</p>

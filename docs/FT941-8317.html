			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / International Press Review    By JOHN BURTON, PATRICK BLUM, CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and HUGH CARNEGY SOUTH KOREA South Koreans have expressed concern about US press coverage of the North Korean nuclear issue, which at times has been alarmist - such as a detailed scenario for a Second Korean War published in the New York Times early this month. Mr Han Soon-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, privately protested about the sensational reporting to US officials when he visited Washington last week. In an interpretation that reflects traditional anti-US sentiments, some Korean media have suggested that the US press reports are part of a campaign by 'American hardliners' to raise tensions on the Korean peninsula. Their goal is to persuade Seoul to buy more US weapons, such as the Patriot missiles that Washington recently announced would be sent to South Korea. 'If a war occurs on the peninsula, the Koreans' survival would be at stake. But a war here would have little effect on the destiny of America across the ocean and would rather serve to boost the sagging business of the US defence industry,' said the national Yonhap news agency. That view was also reflected in a cartoon in Hankuk Ilbo following North Korea's announcement last week that it would accept renewed international nuclear inspections. It shows customs official waving down a truck bearing Patriot missiles from the US. 'Please stop. North Korea has accepted nuclear inspections,' says the guard. 'Gee, now where am I going to sell them?' replies the driver. 'No one can deny that there has been a disparity between Korea and the US in the perception of the North Korean nuclear issue,' said Dong-Ah Ilbo. 'The US has been dealing with the problem from a standpoint of global strategy aimed at ensuring the stability of the nuclear non-proliferation system. Korea has been handling the issue as a special condition within the framework of relations between the two Koreas.' Chosun Ilbo pointed out that differences between Seoul and Washington also rest on the South Korean perception that it has been sidelined during the negotiations on the nuclear issue, which have focused on contacts between North Korea and the US. POLAND AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC In stark contrast to the hue and cry of the press in Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria about Bosnia, Poland and the Czech Republic have been almost silent this week over Nato's ultimatum on air strikes. As the Nato deadline neared, only the Gazeta Wyborcza, a Polish daily read by around 5m Poles, devoted a commentary to the subject. The columnist noted that the threat to use force meant that the 'western world was beginning to rebuild its political, military and moral credibility'. The paper added that Russia was fighting to retain credibility as a regional power in the Balkans. 'After being completely eliminated from the Middle East and after eliminating itself, for lack of money, from the third world, Moscow is now concentrating on organising a sphere of influence in its closest neighbourhood,' it said. This, according to the writer, would include Serbia. Gazeta Wyborcza adds that the Nato threat, if followed through, would be the alliance's first military action since its formation in 1949. It would also mean that Nato would be extending its sphere of influence to Bosnia, a welcome precedent for Poland, which wants to be covered by Nato's umbrella. While most Czech newspapers approved with reservations Nato's ultimatum, domestic interest has focused on the contrasting views of President Vaclav Havel, who strongly supported Nato's decision, and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who was cool towards Nato involvement. Mr Klaus expressed fears about foreign intervention, warned of rising violence and said he was 'fully convinced' that Nato would not make air strikes against Serb positions. As with most things, Czech concerns tend to be predominantly parochial, explaining the considerable coverage given to the dispute. In an article headlined The Protracted Malaise of Foreign Policy the independent daily Mlada Fronta Denes argued 'the Czech state cannot afford differences of opinion between its president and premier on the possible bombardment of a not-so-remote European country'. The left-wing Rude Pravo warned that subsequent attempts to present the difference as merely one of emphasis could only put into question the reliability of official pronouncements on important issues. And the right-wing Telegraf said Mr Klaus's approach had done the Czech Republic no good. 'Keeping a certain distance from the conflict does not improve, to say the least, the Czech Republic's reputation abroad,' the paper said. SWEDEN The ski-boot is on the other foot, and it hurts. While Norway revels noisily in the glory of staging the winter Olympics in Lillehammer - and the repeated triumphs of Norwegian athletes - neighbouring Sweden is feeling more than a little put out. As the elder of the Nordic countries (Stockholm ruled Norway until 1905), Sweden is unused to seeing its smaller cousins dominate the international limelight. It bowed gracefully last autumn when Norway brought Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation together for their historic peace agreement, but magnanimity has been wearing thin over the past week as Norway has stacked up gold medal after gold medal while Sweden has so far won none. A pained reporter for Dagens Nyheter, the biggest selling morning newspaper, bewailed that the relegation of Sweden's Pernilla 'Pillan' Wiberg to fourth place in the Super-G slalom had deprived him of the chance to write about 'the girl who was to lift us out of the Norwegian vale of tears that Lillehammer signifies for us Swedes'. Expressen, a tabloid, put it more bluntly: 'Swedes only cheer when a Norwegian falls down,' it said, introducing an article by an ethnologist analysing why Sweden was doing so badly. Under a front-page picture in Friday's Dagens Nyheter of a failed Swedish cross-country skier wistfully watching Norwegian Bjorn Daehlie collect his gold medal, reporter Ake Ekdahl, his tongue only slightly in his cheek, pointed the finger of blame at Prime Minister Carl Bildt. 'Bildt knew last autumn,' said the headline as Ekdahl revealed that the government was warned months ago of the coming humiliation of the 'blue and gold flag' but did nothing about it. The message was that Sweden should spend more on training its sportsmen and women.</p>

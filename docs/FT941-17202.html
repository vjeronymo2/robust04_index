			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Reuters offers municipal deal Correction (published 11th January 1994) appended to this article. Reuters subscribers will soon be offered a set of municipal securities information products in a deal between the international news and information company and JJ Kenny, a wholly owned subsidiary of municipal bond inter-dealer broker McGraw-Hill. CORRECTION McGraw-Hill was incorrectly described as a municipal bond inter-dealer broker in the January 5 edition of the FT.

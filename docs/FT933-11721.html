			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Poor reward for service Sir, Between 1987 and 1992 the workload of the Insolvency Service increased fourfold. During the same period the number of civil servants employed in Official Receivers' offices increased marginally. Insolvency Service workers who coped with the increased number of insolvencies and maintained the high standards for which they are respected and renowned have now received their reward for five years' hard work. The 'independent review' announced recently by Neil Hamilton MP aims to turn the clock back 100 years and privatise large parts of the Insolvency Service. The last review in 1982, under the chairmanship of Sir Kenneth Cork, concluded that individual insolvencies should be administered by impartial civil servants, ie the Official Receiver. The current review, however, will consider changes in legislation to ensure that ministers get what they want, the privatisation of the Insolvency Service. With spare capacity in the private sector growing as the number of insolvencies fall, staff in the Insolvency Service will be faced with redundancy. The IPMS Insolvency Service Branch will be fighting privatisation because it is not in the interests of creditors, individual insolvents, insolvency practitioners, or those in the Insolvency Service who, during the last five years, have shown what public service means. Keith Ellis, vice-chairman, IPMS Insolvency Service Branch, c/o Official Receiver's Office, Hull</p>

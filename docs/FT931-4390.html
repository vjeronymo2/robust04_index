			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Technology: On the fast track / A look at the Briway rapid transit system At first sight, it looks like just the sort of eccentricity for which the English are renowned. How else to explain the presence of an urban rapid transit system running through the grounds of a 2,000-acre private estate in leafy Surrey? Yet this rich man's train set is not just a folie de grandeur. It is a serious attempt by Alan Bristow, the former helicopter king, to take on the giants of the world railway equipment industry with a British light rapid transit system. The rumbustious Bristow, 69, made millions out of serving the world's offshore oil and gas industries with his helicopter business. Now retired, he has sunk Pounds 9.6m of his personal fortune over the last five years into what he calls the Briway transit system. Aided by a 28-strong team of specialist engineers, he has designed and built an 860m-long system on his estate and runs it 20 hours a day under test. Now all that remains is to convince someone to put it into commercial use. Bristow says he was led into the idea in 1987 by the rise in interest in modern-day trams during the 1980s and by his belief that other systems were expensive, unattractive and based on outdated technology. The Briway system differs from others in running not on rails, but on a flat track using quieter pneumatic tyres. It is guided by horizontally-mounted rubber-tyred wheels which run against the inside faces of guide rails on each side of the track, while power is collected through contact shoes running against conductor rails underneath the rails. The presence of the guide rails means the system is best suited to cases where it is segregated from other traffic - for example, airport terminal shuttles. But Bristow has also developed a street-running variant guided by a slot set into the roadway and powered by overhead contact wires. Bristow says two key features distinguish the Briway system from those of other manufacturers. It is based on existing mass-produced components from the automotive and rail industries which can be bought cheaply off the shelf, and Bristow has applied aerospace industry techniques of testing each part of the system through millions of cycles on his Surrey estate rather than expecting passengers to act as guinea pigs. He also believes he can beat anyone on price. 'By using a whole bunch of proven components and putting them together in a unique way, our price performance is superior to what people have become accustomed to paying through the nose for.' Sensitive to suggestions that his entry into the rapid transit industry might lack credibility until he finds a customer, Bristow points to the fact that Briway had been the preferred system for a proposed 2 3/4 -mile transit in Southampton until the project was scuppered two years ago by the city council's failure to win the necessary legislation. Undeterred by that setback, he says he is now tendering for five contracts worldwide - three of them airport shuttle schemes (two in the Far East and one in Europe) and two urban projects (one in the Netherlands and one in Denmark). Together, the projects are worth Pounds 150m, he says. Beyond that, a world market for transit systems worth Pounds 2bn beckons over the next four years. 'Of that, nearly half, or Pounds 960m to be precise, is ideally suited to Briway,' Bristow says - enough to turn a toy into a serious proposition.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks decline ahead of jobs data Wall Street AFTER TRADING in a narrow range either side of opening values for most the day, US share prices ended lower after a late burst of selling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.36 at 3,583.63. The more broadly based Standard&amp; Poor's 500 ended down 1.56 at 459.18, while the Amex composite finished up 0.59 at 463.95, and the Nasdaq composite down 2.23 at 762.54. Trading volume on the NYSE was 255m shares. Trading was subdued from the start as participants once again chose to keep their heads down while awaiting the September employment report, due out this morning. The monthly jobs report is traditionally the most eagerly-anticipated set of economic figures, and the markets are hoping that today's numbers will give them a fresh look at how the labour market is faring in a still struggling economy. The consensus of analysts' forecasts has non-farm payrolls rising by about 150,000 last month. Wall Street, however, has a poor track record of forecasting the jobs figures, and there have been numerous occasions this year when the monthly employment numbers have surprised the market, usually by producing a more bearish report than expected. This explains the markets' cautious approach to today's data, and the lack of much movement in share prices yesterday until selling in the final hour of trading sent prices to new session lows. There was some news on the jobs front yesterday - the Labor department announced that the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance fell by 9,000 in the final few days of September - but the numbers failed to move the markets. Among individual stocks, retailers were in the limelight after some of the biggest companies reported their latest monthly sales figures. The news was neither disappointing nor particularly encouraging, and investors seemed unimpressed. Sears, Roebuck fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 1/8 , while JC Penney gave up Dollars 1 at Dollars 46 1/2 , the Limited eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 23 1/4 and Kmart eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 24 3/8 . Corning plunged Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 27 3/8 in volume of 4m shares after the company warned that of a third quarter charge against earnings of Dollars 130m. Motor stocks were in demand amid heavy trading, with General Motors up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 43 7/8 , Ford Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 55 7/8 and Chrysler Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 49 1/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Liberty Media rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 28 1/2 on the news that Tele-Communications is considering a Dollars 3.3bn stock deal to regain full control of the company. Canada TORONTO prices showed little movement in moderately active trading as the the TSE-300 composite index gained 5.31 points, or 0.13 per cent, to 4,060.79, according to preliminary figures. Advances led declines by 374 to 345. Volume at 62.49m shares was above Wednesday's 55.52m and amounted to CDollars 582.5m compared with CDollars 563.5m.</p>

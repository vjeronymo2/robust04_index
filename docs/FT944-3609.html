			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Poland ready to back bonds Poland is considering guaranteeing bond issues by companies that win contracts in the country's motorway programme, Mr Richard Pazura, a deputy finance minister said at a Financial Times conference on the programme. The programme aims to build 2,600 km of highways under Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) agreements at an estimated cost of Dollars 10 bn (Pounds 6 bn) by the year 2010. Already Poland, advised by JP Morgan, the investment bank, is preparing to launch Dollars 200 m worth of bonds in the country's first entry into the foreign bond markets.  However, this is the first time that an official has said the government is looking to private investors and international financial institutions to provide 85 per cent of the financing for the programme, Mr Boguslaw Liberadzki, the transoport minister, told the conference. Preliminary bidding for BOT concessions is expected to open next February,  with the granting of the first concessions expected early in 1996. The toll highway programme would provide a link across Poland between the European Union and the countries of the former Soviet Union as well as between Scandinavia with central Europe and the Balkans. It reflects the fast growth of car ownership in Poland.</p>

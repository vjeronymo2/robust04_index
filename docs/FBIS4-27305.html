			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Noble Ideological and Moral Traits of Soldiers of Great </F> General"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- A by-lined article of  NODONG SINMUN today tells about the noble ideological and moral  traits of soldiers of the great general Kim Chong-il, saying no  titles are so honourable and precious for the Korean people than  the title of revolutionary soldiers of the general.    The article says:    The soldiers of the great general Kim Chong-il are steadfast  revolutionary fighters safeguarding the party and the leader  with their lives and pure revolutionaries who think and act in  accordance with the ideas and intentions of the party and the  leader.    They are also indomitable fighters who consistently share  life and death, sweets and bitters with the party and the  leader in any circumstances.    Referring to the noblest ideological and moral traits of  general Kim Chong-il's soldiers, the article says:    Characteristic of the ideological and moral traits of our  revolutionary soldiers is, above all, that they have the  unshakable revolutionary conviction and will to believe in and  follow only the great general Kim Chong-il.    Their belief in the great general Kim Chong-il is the part  and parcel of our revolutionary soldiers' ideological and moral  traits.    Ours is the inexorable belief that as long as we are guided  by general Kim Chong-il we are sure to win. Ours is the  unshakable determination to fight on, entirely entrusting our  whole destinies to the party and the leader. Ours is the  revolutionary principle which will never change in any adversity.    This conviction is the most solid and noblest ideological  sentiments which we have consolidated on the basis of our deep  understanding of the greatness of general Kim Chong-il through  our life experience.    Another characteristic of the ideological and moral traits  of  our revolutionary soldiers is that they cherish revolutionary  fidelity to the great general Kim Chong-il.    The soldiers of the great general Kim Chong-il have a warmer  sense of obligations than others to repay the benevolence of the  party and the leader.    Their fidelity is a sincere and pure one emanating from the  minds of the soldiers who always deeply cherish the love and  benevolence of the illustrious leader. It is a noble spirit of  devoting their all to repay even a little the benevolence of the  party.    Characteristic of the ideological and moral traits of our  revolutionary soldiers is also that they have a revolutionary  view of life that they can lead a worthy life only when they  fight under the guidance of the great general Kim Chong-il.    Our view of life is the steadfast revolutionary creed that  they should feel honored to live or die on the road of  revolution following the illustrious leader, and the  life-giving water exalting human dignity and life forever.  Living in luxury or riches cannot be a happiness for them and a  life, however long it may be, cannot be called an eternal life.  Their happiness and eternal life lie in living a worthy life  under the loving care of the party even if they lived a day.    Now, our country has a great army of loyal revolutionary  soldiers who share views and the same destiny with the great  general Kim Chong-il. The entire Korean people are all  revolutionary soldiers of general Kim Chong-il.</p>

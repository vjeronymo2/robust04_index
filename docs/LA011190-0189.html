Kenney, who was first elected in 1981, said he had never planned  to serve more than two terms, which are four years each.  </P> <P> "I've been on the council eight years," Kenney said. "I'm announcing now  because this is the time of year when a lot of people decide whether they are  going to run."  </P> <P> Kenney, a director of pharmacy services for two hospitals in the county, was  mayor twice, in 1984 and 1986.

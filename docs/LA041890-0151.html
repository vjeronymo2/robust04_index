BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PEPSI SIGNS BURMA AGREEMENT  </P> <P> Pepsi said today that it signed an agreement to operate in Burma, despite calls  by dissidents and human rights groups not to invest after a military crackdown.  </P> <P> The agreement was signed last month with a private partner, and Pepsico  International has a 35% share in the venture, said Barry Shea, company vice  president for Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> The company will ship soft drinks to Burma and is building a $3-million  factory, which should be completed by the end of the year, on the outskirts of  Rangoon, the Burmese capital, he said.  </P> <P> Shea was unwilling to comment on the human rights issue. "Obviously we like to  stay out of politics," he said.  </P> <P> The military government seized power in September, 1988, by crushing a mass  uprising for democracy. Hundreds of people were killed.  </P></p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Analysts disagree over wage trends TWO OF Britain's biggest pay analysis organisations have taken sharply differing views on whether the downward trend in pay settlements is continuing. Industrial Relations Services today publishes its latest report, which says that in the three months to the end of May the average settlement across the economy was 2.3 per cent. 'A number of indicators suggest that pay award levels remain under strong downward pressure, and there seems little immediate prospect of basic pay rises increasing,' IRS report says. Incomes Data Services, a rival organisation, has however, seen signs that the level of pay increases 'may now have stabilised'. IDS, which reports that two thirds of recently monitored settlements gave rises between 2 per cent and 3.9 per cent, says: 'Assuming that economic recovery is under way, there is likely to be some rebound from the belt-tightening of prolonged recession.' IDS says that one in seven of recent rises are above 4 per cent. Incomes Data Services, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS. Industrial Relations Services, 18-20 Highbury Place, London N5 1QP.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / UK Company News: UK fund managers cautious on Europe The weakness in global equity and bond markets during February did not produce many significant shifts in investment policy among UK fund managers, according to the monthly Smith New Court/Gallup survey of investor intentions. Although less inclined to run down their holdings of European equities than last month, the latest survey found that managers continue to be much more cautious about the near-term outlook for European equities than was the case towards the end of last year. The German market is the one where fund managers were most likely to reduce their exposure. In contrast, the UK and Japanese markets continue to be ones which managers expected to do best over the next three months Fund managers' optimism about the outlook for the UK economy has faded a little, however, with the percentage expecting conditions to improve over the next 12 months remaining at 88 per cent. Only 17 per cent expect the economy to get 'a lot better' compared with 21 per cent in February. Institutions have also raised their forecasts on dividend growth from 6.3 per cent to 6.9 per cent.</p>

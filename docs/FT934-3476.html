			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (6): Relief as the banks return - Deal structures After the excesses of the late 1980s, the past few years have seen power in the structuring of management buy-out deals shift back to the banks. They have become much more cautious in their approach to buy-outs, and stipulate more conservative lending ratios. This insistence on proper cover for their loans has not prevented the banks becoming slightly more willing to provide the funds that are needed. 'The banks have come back into the market, and there is more debt available now than there has been for the past three years,' commented Mr Graham Hutton, a director of Morgan Grenfell. This increase in liquidity is a relief to the venture capital industry, which had begun to fear that shortages of loan finance would seriously limit the profitability of deals. Unless the equity providers can gear up their funds with loan finance, the returns become unattractive. Some venture capitalists feared at one stage that deals were becoming 'under-geared'. The banks will normally require an equity to debt ratio of 1:1 though some are prepared to move to 1:1.5 on the more attractive deals. But contrast this with the peak of the buy-out boom in 1989, when the banks were willing to provide loans amounting to nearly six times the equity in a deal. These times were unusual, however, and the figures were skewed by a small number of very large deals. The smaller deals, which account for most buy-out activity in terms of numbers, have always been more conservatively structured. The two-tier nature of the buy-out sector, and its impact on the way deals are done, is revealed in recent research by Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. Smaller deals, those valued at less than Pounds 10m, have seen a drop in the amount of equity and mezzanine finance used, while the amount of debt has remained steady. The gap left by the decline in equity and mezzanine has been made up by increases in the amount of vendor loan notes and in the contribution made by the management team. The amount of equity in these smaller deals has fallen over the past two and a half years, from more than 40 per cent to just over 33 per cent, while the contribution of debt has hovered around 40 per cent. Vendors contributed nearly 11 per cent to the value of deals in the first half of 1993, compared with around 7 per cent in the previous three years. This was the highest share held by vendors since the buy-out centre, established in 1986, began compiling these statistics. The attraction to a vendor of retaining a stake in a buy-out company is that it will benefit if the company does well. Vendors are concerned that they will look foolish if a business which they have sold prospers, particularly when the deal is done at a stage when the economy seems set for recovery from a long recession. Vendor involvement can also boost the nominal value of a deal, and make a sale appear more impressive to shareholders. Managements, too, have been increasing their stake in the businesses they buy. The average management contribution to smaller deals rose to 9.5 per cent in the first half of 1993, from between 7 and 8 per cent in the preceding three years. Larger deals, those valued at more than Pounds 10m, have traditionally been financed by larger amounts of debt, though the gap between debt and equity has closed in the past two years. Equity accounted for less than a quarter of total funding in large deals in 1991, but rose to around one-third in 1992 and early 1993. The contribution of mezzanine and debt has held steady at about 6 per cent and 45 per cent respectively. As deal prices have fallen to more realistic levels there has been less need to bridge the gap between debt and equity with large amounts of mezzanine finance. Involving an independent mezzanine provider can also complicate a deal, so venture capitalists have sometimes preferred to turn to the vendor if extra funds were needed. But this did not stop the contribution by vendors to larger deals halving in the past two and a half years, from 15 per cent in 1991 to 7.5 per cent in the first half of 1993. The management's contribution fell to just 1 per cent, the lowest level for more than four years. As the banks have become more experienced at financing buy-outs, so their assessment methods have been refined. There has been a shift from judging deals on balance-sheet ratios, which are not necessarily the most relevant measure when a business is about to undergo radical change. The banks now look more closely at projected cash flows and interest cover. The recent drop in interest rates has meant that banks can now obtain interest cover of 3:1 on buy-outs, a rate as good as they could obtain on corporate credits. The decline in the use of mezzanine finance has had the additional effect of boosting the security of senior debt. The banks have also become less willing to leave due-diligence work to the providers of equity capital, and are now more likely to commission their own reviews of a company's finances and market prospects.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------          LEADING DEBT ARRANGERS: MAY 1981 - SEPTEMBER 30, 1993

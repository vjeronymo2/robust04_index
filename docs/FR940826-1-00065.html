As discussed above, because the auction process itself requires additional expenditures of capital to acquire licenses, this new licensing procedure in many respects holds the potential to erect an additional barrier to entry that had not existed even under the Act's previous licensing methods, comparative hearings and lotteries. As reflected in the House Committee Report, Congress was well aware of that possibility and wanted to ensure that competitive bidding should not exclude smaller entities from obtaining licenses. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  The inability of small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities to obtain adequate private financing creates a serious imbalance between these companies and large businesses in their prospects for competing successfully in narrowband PCS auctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;111 at 255. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20. We anticipate that the results of the narrowband regional auctions as well as the comments we seek in this Notice will be relevant to our final conclusion of whether an entrepreneurs' block is appropriate in narrowband PCS. We seek comments on what results in the regional auction would or would not justify the use of an entrepeneurs' block in subsequent narrowband auctions. The $125 million gross revenue/$500 million asset caps have the effect of excluding the large companies that would easily be able to outbid designated entries and frustrate Congress' goal of disseminating licenses among a diversity of licensees. At the same time, this restriction does not exclude many firms that, while not large in comparison with other telecommunications companies, nevertheless are likely to have the financial ability to provide sustained competition for the PCS licensees. For example, the $125 million gross revenue figure corresponds roughly to the Commission's definition of a Tier 2, or medium-sized, local exchange carrier, <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  and would include virtually all of the independently owned rural telephone companies, while excluding the largest incumbent paging licensees. Limiting the personal net worth of any individual investor or affiliate of the applicant to $100 million would prevent a very wealthy individual from leveraging his or her personal assets to allow the applicant to circumvent the size limitations of the entrepeneurs' blocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Local exchange carriers are categorized as Tier 1 and Tier 2 companies by applying the criterion that Sections 32.11(a) and 32.11(e) of the Commission's Rules use to distinguished Class A and Class B companies, respectively. Class A companies are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of $100 million or more; Class B companies are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of less than $100 million. The initial classification of a company is determined by its lowest annual operating revenues for the five immediately preceding years. A company's classification is changed when its annual operating revenue exceeds or is under the $100 million mark in each of five consecutive years. The Commission imposes more relaxes regulatory requirements on Tier 2 LECs than on Tier 1 LECs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Automated Reporting Requirements for Certain Class A and Tier 1 Telephone Companies, 2 FCC Rcd 5770, 5772 (1987), 52 FR 35918 (Sept. 24, 1987), Commission Requirements for Cost Support Material to be Filed with 1994 Annual Access Tariffs and for Other Cost Support Material, 9 FCC Rcd 1060 n. 3 (Comm.

In determining which of the blocks in each market should constitute the entrepreneurs' blocks, we seek to make sufficient opportunity available to businesses that would qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks and to those that would not. We seek comment on whether it would be appropriate to include all of those remaining blocks designated for bidding credits and to add one additional MTA block and one additional BTA block if we decide to adopt the proposal. We seek comment on the choice of blocks and the number of blocks that should be included in the entrepreneurs' blocks. We want to choose blocks to provide adequate amounts of spectrum and geographic territory necessary to ensure that the eligible bidders will be able to compete effectively. We believe that designating a variety of frequency blocks as entrepreneurs' blocks would satisfy the needs of those parties who believe they must have larger amounts of spectrum to compete effectively as well as the needs of other designated entities who require smaller blocks. Finally, it would not foreclose opportunities for other parties. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, incumbent paging licensees would have the opportunity to bed on 2,176 MTA and BTA response channel licenses reserved for existing paging licensees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 22.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Holding and Limited Transfer Period. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because we interpret the congressional goal of giving designated entities the opportunity to provide spectrum-based services to extend beyond merely obtaining a license, we seek comment on whether we should prohibit licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks from voluntarily assigning or transferring control of their licenses for a period of three years from the date of the license grant. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  We further ask commenters to address whether, for the next two to seven years of the license term, we should permit the licensee to assign or transfer control of its authorization only to an entity that satisfies the entrepreneurs' blocks entry criteria. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  Comments should address whether any restrictions of this type would accurately balance the goal of promoting access to capital by designated entities with the need to assure the integrity of our process. During this limited transfer period, licensees would continue to be bound by the financial eligibility requirements, as set forth below. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  In addition, a transferee or assignee who receives an entrepreneurs' block license during this period would remain subject to the transfer restrictions for the balance of the holding period. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  Should any of these proposals be adopted, the Commission would conduct random pre- and post-auction audits to ensure that applicants receiving preferences are in compliance with the FCC's rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We propose considering exceptions to this three-year holding period rule on a case-by-case basis in the event of a judicial order decreeing bankruptcy or a judicial foreclosure if the licensee proposes to assign or transfer its authorization to an entity that meets the financial thresholds for bidding in the entrepreneurs' blocks. In addition, we note that a transfer is considered ``involuntary'' if it is made pursuant to a court decree requiring the sale or transfer of the licensee's stock or assets.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Paramount Pictures, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 43 FCC 453 (1949);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Cf.

In addition, for purposes of the installment payment and bidding credit provisions set forth below, licensees will continue to be bound by the financial eligibility requirements throughout the term of the license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, if an entrepreneurs' block authorization is assigned to an eligible business in year four of the license term, it would be required to hold that license until the original holding period expires, subject to the same exceptions that applied to the original licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23. Our goals are to create significant opportunities for entrepreneurs, small businesses, and businesses owned by minorities and women to compete in auctions for licenses and attract sufficient capital to build-out those licenses and provide service. We recognize the critical need to attract capital, which requires flexibility. We are very concerned, however, that such flexibility not undermine our more fundamental objective, which is to ensure that designated entities retain  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de jure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> control of their companies. The holding and limited transfer period upon which we seek comment, may help promote this objective. We seek comment on the effect that any rules of this sort are likely to have on the achievement of our goals of meaningful long-term participation by designated entities and how such a rule would impact the ability to raise capital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

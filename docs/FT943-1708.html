			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: US airline may buy Bombardier jets American Airlines is considering buying up to 50 Canadair Regional Jets from Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transit equipment group, to re-equip three of its four fully-owned feeder lines, say US aircraft industry sources. The 50-seater RJ sells for about USDollars 20m. RJs are flying with Delta Airline's feeders Comair and Skywest. The RJ launch customer was Lufthansa's regional unit and several European airlines use the aircraft. American Airlines would not comment on the reports. In Montreal, Bombardier said it has had discussions with American Airlines but 'no active negotiations are on the way at present'. Avmark, the US aviation marketing and management group, said an American Airlines deal for the RJ has been rumoured for two months.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Police Assault Case Ends in Huizhou, </F> Troublemakers Arrested"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 4 Apr--According to an informed person  in Huizhou, no villagers from Bogang Village of Xiayong Town in  Huizhou's Daya Bay administrative area -- where a few days ago a  handful of ruffians incited villagers to hinder public security  personnel from arresting criminals according to the law -- have  gone to the city government today to make petitions or hold  demonstrations. The incident was limited to that day.    It has been learned that, at around 0500 on 1 April, 10  public security personnel from the Xiayong police substation of  the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau went to Bogang Village to  arrest blackmailers Chen Renshan and Chen Yonghui. These two  criminals committed four crimes last July and August, extorting  over 13,000 yuan. When the public security personnel were ready  to escort both criminals to the police substation, they were  intercepted by Chen Renshan's brothers and his wife, who were  armed with sticks and stones. Chen Renshan's elder brother Chen  Renchao hit the policeman walking in front on the head with a  brick, knocking him unconscious. In the chaos that ensued, Chen  Renshan was taken away. Unwilling to let the matter drop, Chen  Renchao picked up a 1.5 meter-long thick stick and gave chase to  special policeman Zhou Xinbao. The latter fired a warning shot,  but Chen kept on rushing at him. At the critical moment, when  his life was seriously threatened, Zhou opened fire and hit Chen  Renchao at the leg, forcing the mob to abandon their siege.    At approximately 0900 that day, at the instigation of Chen  Renshan and others, over 100 villagers went to the police  substation, called for the release of Chen Yonghui and tried to  force their way into the substation. The public security  personnel formed a human barricade to stop the villagers from  storming the substation. Finding it impossible to enter the  substation, Chen Renshan incited the villagers to smash the  substation signboard and attack the policemen. Eventually,  public security personnel arrived led by Zhang Xinde, chief of  the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau. While vigorously conducting  education on the need to observe the law, they rounded up the  chief troublemakers, including Chen Renshan, Chen Shaowen, Chen  Renhua, Chen Huijun, and Chen Qiaoling, and thus put an end to  the incident.</p>

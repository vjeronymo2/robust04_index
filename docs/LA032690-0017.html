			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BORDERLESS ECONOMY CALLS FOR NEW POLITICS;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE WORLD IS ON THE THRESHOLD OF A QUANTUM LEAP IN MATERIAL WEALTH, IF  IT'S NOT DERAILED BY NATIONALIST EMOTION.  </P> <P> When Sony purchased Columbia Studios and Mitsubishi bought a substantial  interest in Rockefeller Center, the opinion pages of American newspapers,  reflecting the political mood, warned of a "Japanese invasion." Japanese  commentators responded in their columns and on their front pages with charges  of "bashing" by the United States.  </P> <P> Yet the financial sections of these newspapers discussed the same events in  terms of "joint ventures" or "corporate tie-ups."  </P> <P> These divergent perceptions -- which are likely to be repeated with the latest  news that Japanese concerns plan to purchase Southland Corp. (7-Eleven stores)  and a major interest in Saks Fifth Avenue -- illustrate the conflict between  fact and myth that has led to so much acrimony between the United States and  Japan. The opinion pages reflect a fiction rooted in the 19th-Century notion of  the nation-state. The financial pages reflect the reality of today's borderless  economy.  </P> <P> Because of this borderless economy, the world stands at the threshold of a  quantum leap in material wealth -- if this promising future is not derailed by  nationalist emotion.  </P> <P> The economies of the great global triad -- America, Japan and Europe -- are so  interwoven that loosening a few threads could unravel the entire cloth and  expose us all to a depression.  </P> <P> We often hear about Japanese investments in America, but tend to forget that  the reverse situation also exists. IBM Japan has more than 1,000 corporate  affiliates and more than 19,000 employees in Japan. Texas Instruments is  Japan's strongest competitor in the production of semiconductors. Estee Lauder  is Japan's most successful cosmetics manufacturer. In 1989, the top 2,000  American companies operating in Japan had an annual production value greater  than that year's $49-billion U.S.-Japan trade deficit.  </P> <P> This transnationalism is particularly clear in the auto industry. Ford owns  about 25% of Mazda. General Motors, with 34% of the stock, is the largest  shareholder in Isuzu and owns 5% of Suzuki. Chrysler owns 25% of Mitsubishi.  </P> <P> Nissan and Toyota have established major auto plants in the United States.  Honda even exports cars back to Japan from its American plants.  </P> <P> In Europe, Ford and GM each share about 12% of the European market. Mitsubishi  and Daimler-Benz are negotiating a plan of intensive cooperation in automobile  technology, aerospace and microelectronics.  </P> <P> It is difficult to designate the nationality of these successful global  corporations. They fly the flag of their customers, not their country. They  thrive on the loyalty of denationalized consumers.  </P> <P> The key to enduring prosperity for any nation lies in recognizing the emergence  of the "triad marketplace" and actively participating in it. Insiders will  prosper and grow strong. Outsiders and protectionists will wither because they  will be unable to earn the allegiance of consumers who have plenty of choices.  </P> <P> The borderless economy has two key characteristics: global commonality and  regional differentiation.  </P> <P> As national boundaries lose significance for both consumers and corporations,  the commonalities of the triad become more important than national differences.  At the same time, regions within national boundaries have very distinct  attributes, tastes, needs and interests. This means, for example, that Osaka  might compete with Tokyo and Los Angeles with New York.  </P> <P> To be successful, corporations must adopt a strategy of "global localization,"  as Sony's Akio Morita has phrased it, or as I prefer, a strategy of  "insiderization" with a multilocal approach. This simply means that successful  companies will base their strategies on an appreciation of the unique character  and needs of regions within national borders.  </P> <P> Most Japanese companies have learned to differentiate their markets in the  United States by regional attributes. For example, they have seen that  subcompact cars sell best in the heavily urbanized regions while larger cars  seem to fit the tastes of consumers in the Midwest and South.  </P> <P> By contrast, most American businesses still view Japan from 12,000 miles away.  At that distance, Japan's regional consumer patterns are as indistinguishable  as individual stars in the Milky Way.  </P> <P> But the commonalities of the triad economy are far greater than the unique  attributes of localities. In our management consulting work, we have found that  80% of what applies in the United States also works in Germany. The consumer  desires of the Japanese shinjinrui -- the generation younger than 30 -- are far  more similar to the same generation in Los Angeles or Paris than they are  different.  </P> <P> As national borders continue to erode, what will emerge?  </P> <P> The future's winners will not be nations, but regions, such as Alsace-Lorraine,  Wales, Kansai or Orange County. The winning corporations will be those that  serve the global consumer well.  </P> <P> Politicians around the world will have to turn their energies away from  preservation of the status quo to the more important mission of creating a  political framework for the borderless economy.  </P> <P> The European vision does not extend beyond 1992. The Japanese vision is even  more shortsighted: We have been meekly hiding behind America's nuclear  umbrella, implementing the obsolescent assignments of Gen. Douglas MacArthur.  Meanwhile, the end of the Cold War has removed America's postwar sense of  mission.  </P> <P> A borderless economy inside a political vacuum spells peril. Without a workable  framework, the danger is great that new villains will be created to put flesh  on the old skeleton of nationalism. Without the Russians as archrivals, might  an America without a mission cast the Japanese or Germans in that role?  </P> <P> A xenophobic scenario such as this is what most threatens our full passage to  the borderless economy. Only the creation of a political culture that  reconciles the duality of citizen and consumer can clear the way.  </P></p>

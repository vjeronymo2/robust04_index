			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Hungary faces tough Fund talks INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund officials flew in to Budapest yesterday for crucial talks to bring Hungary's government finances under control. Earlier, the Hungarian finance ministry confirmed that recession and disappointing tax revenues would make the 1992 budget deficit overshoot targets agreed with the IMF by a factor of nearly three. Hungary's missing of its IMF targets sets the scene for the two sides' most difficult negotiations since democratic elections in 1990. It also puts at risk Hungary's reputation as eastern Europe's most sure-footed reformer. The overrun has forced the government to put together an emergency package of spending cuts, tightened tax collection and measures to raise revenue from the banks. The latter are expected to include a reduction in the interest rates paid for compulsory commercial bank deposits with the central bank and legislation to slow banks' provisioning for bad loans. Both changes are likely to destabilise the large state-owned commercial banks financially just as they are coping with a wave of bankruptcies among clients and preparing for privatisation. Details of the package are expected soon. Even so, the finance ministry said the 1992 deficit could not be held below Ft160bn-Ft180bn (Pounds 1.1bn-Pounds 1.23bn), far above the Ft70bn (Pounds 480m) target agreed with the IMF. The budget deficit is also placing the Hungarian government in an ever tighter bind domestically.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pedro Marta Santos] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Numbers </H5>   Although it is impossible to calculate exactly the total  volume of drugs circulating in Portugal annually, the yearly  figures on seizures have been increasing appreciably. Whereas,  during 1992, 6,400 kg of hashish were confiscated, in 1993 that  number rose to 49,000 kg. However, 19 of those 49 tons were  taken from containers discovered at sea, near the port of Ponta  Delgada, on Ilha de Sao Miguel, in the Azores.    As for marijuana, the seizures tripled from one year to the  next: from 8.5 kg in 1992 to 24 kg last year. The figures on  cocaine declined, but this is nearly all explained by the fact  that the confiscation of 1,800 of the 1,886 kg of cocaine seized  in 1992 was due to a single operation to combat the  international traffic. During 1993, the volume of cocaine seized  was approximately 167 kg. In the case of heroin, the figure  rose: 87 kg last year, versus 53 kg in 1992. As for  barbiturates, narcotics, and tranquillizers/hypnotics, the  annual confiscation numbers have not even exceeded hundreds of  grams. It should be noted that the 1993 statistics for all drugs  relate to the amounts tallied from January to November.  <H5>  Major Confiscations </H5>   The largest of the cocaine seizure operations resulted in  the  discovery of nearly 2 tons of the white powder in June 1992,  when the PJ [Criminal Investigations Police] dismantled an  international drug trafficking network in cooperation with  several European police forces. This occurred along Cabo de Sao  Vicente.    During one week of February 1993, the Criminal  Investigations  Police conducted two operations leading to the confiscation of a  total of 26 kg of heroin in the Greater Lisbon area. This was  the largest store of heroin seized last year.    During 1993, many hashish confiscations were made south of  Setubal. In just nine operations, an equal number of tons was  seized. In October of that year, the PJ in Setubal seized 8.5  tons of hashish being transported on two TIR [International Road  Transport] trucks on the Aguas de Moura-Pegoes highway. This was  the largest hashish confiscation ever made on continental  territory.  <H5>  Red Zones </H5>   In other words, these are districts overrun with vice and  addiction. In Lisbon, the notorious Casal Ventoso should be  carefully avoided. This claim is made by one who knows: Jacinto  Meca, an ex-officer in charge of the PJ's Central Directorate  for Drug Trafficking Investigation: "We conduct operations there  almost every week. It's a difficult, complicated district,  because it has its own very special connections for protection  and complicity." It is also the area of the capital in which the  largest number of needles can be found per square kilometer of  roadways. Also in the capital area, Picheleira, Estoril's Fim do  Mundo district, Olivais, and the vicinity of Damaia de Baixo are  some of the convenient havens for drug addicts. In the north,  the Porto districts of Cerco and Se are not advisable for anyone  merely wishing to walk his little dog after 2200.  <H5>  Consumers and Traffickers </H5>   Prominent among the 1,899 consumers arrested in 1992 were  465  manual workers, 92 street vendors, 90 students, 40 female  domestics, 34 public servants, and 400 without occupations.  There were also musicians, paramedics, members of the military,  and teachers, as well as a theatrical performer who was arrested  for playing his part. Over half of those arrested lived in their  parents' homes; 43 percent were unemployed, without children;  and only 2 percent of the total lived in rural areas. Most of  the drug addicts were aged between 16 and 45 years, and only 7  percent of all those arrested were women.    There were all types among the 931 traffickers arrested in  1992. The most significant figures indicate 228 manual workers,  101 street vendors, and, once again, female domestics: 60 ladies  faithfully devoted to the drug traffic. Of this group of persons  arrested, 61 percent had received primary or preparatory  schooling, and only 1 percent had reached the university level.  There are foreigners for all tastes participating in the drug  traffic. The majority are Brazilians, Venezuelans, and  Spaniards, followed closely by Guineans, Cape Verdeans, and  Angolans.    By November of last year, 1,209 traffickers had already been  caught in the police trap, and 70 percent of them are in  preventive custody. The municipalities in which this breed  abounds are those of Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Loule, Faro, Porto,  Gondomar, Lisbon, Loures, Oeiras, and Sintra. Anyone desiring  drugs in Angra do Heroismo, Braganca, or Guarda has to sweat a  little. They are the national municipalities in which the  incidence of drug trafficking is slighter. However, crime  sometimes compensates for this: at least until the criminal is  caught. A few months ago, a female heroin trafficker operating  in Casal Ventoso, and considered the leading one in the  district, was arrested. This businesswoman's profits: 5,000  contos per day. As for "superstars" of the Portuguese-style drug  traffic, not many names are known; but there are enough to cause  headaches for the forces of order. During the 1980's, the  Galician clan of the Charlines and Laureano Oubina were the  precursors for the landing of hashish on Portuguese shores. The  Viriatos group, among those appearing in the newspapers, is the  owner of one of the largest establishments for landing and  transporting drugs to Galicia. Also known are sporadic links  between small-scale Portuguese from the forest area and Sito  Milanco's drug trafficking "super-gang." However, some months  ago, one of Casal Ventoso's major traffickers was arrested: aged  37, he was employed in the hotel business in his spare time, and  had the code name "O Aleman" [The German].  <H5>  Informants </H5>   The PJ has agents specializing in these activities, who  sometimes infiltrate the gang of criminals itself. "We also  receive anonymous reports, or information given in person. For  example, it may come from someone who knows in detail what is  going on in his district or area, and who considers it a good  idea to give valuable information to the police. There have been  instances in which the network of informants has crossed  borders. During an investigation that ended in February 1993,  the Criminal Investigations Police received the cooperation of  two infiltrated agents from the Bundescriminalamt [(German)  Federal Criminal Bureau]. As a result of the operation, over  seven kg of cocaine were seized."  <H5>  Shootings </H5>   The death of a trafficker during an operation occurred only  once in recent years. He drew his weapon, aiming at a policeman,  and had to be brought down. Homicides: "One case directly linked  to the drug traffic may have appeared within the past two  years." Another known shooting took place during the October  1993 operation: the one involving the 8.5 tons of hashish. In  order to halt the suspects, the Criminal Investigations Police  proceeded to fire a few shots, wounding a Galician  "narco"-criminal in the leg. However, "the methodical,  time-consuming manner in which our investigations are conducted  doesn't give rise to large-scale shootings." This is fortunate,  because seizures of hunting rifles, machine guns, and other  heavy-caliber weapons are common. In the drug underworld there  are "authentic weapons of war," as Jacinto Meca warns.  <H5>  Parallel Businesses </H5>   The most common is money laundering. There has been  legislation in Portugal to combat it only since February 1993.  The smuggling of gold or various types of equipment may also  occur. It should be remembered that many of the national drug  trafficking networks resulted from the reconversion of the  traditional contraband networks. Prostitution, not a parallel  business, is an old, faithful friend.</p>

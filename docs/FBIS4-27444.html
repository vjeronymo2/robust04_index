			<p>CSO     [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT]  will sponsor experiments on the nation's first high-volume  optical fiber circuit. A research council will be established  with representation from private computer and  communications-related firms such as Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone (NTT), NEC and Japan IBM to engage in the development  of technology to operate and utilize optical fiber circuits that  have a capacity about 100 times that of high-speed  communications networks currently in operation. The council will  establish technology designed to build a foundation for a  multimedia firm to integrate broadcasting and communications and  will embrace the goal of catching up with the United States  which currently leads in the move toward such a system.    The research council, which will operate under the  sponsorship of the MPT is called "G (the first letter of the  communications measurement unit, gigabit) Net Association." The  general meeting to inaugurate the council will be held in the  first part of June and, besides the three firms mentioned above,  will be attended by Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), NHK [Japan  Broadcasting Corporation], Fujitsu, Hitachi, Japan Digital  Equipment, Japan Sun Microsystems, and Japan Cray. Experiments  are scheduled to begin in September 1994.    NTT will link 10 cities, including Tokyo and Osaka,  throughout the nation with optical fiber cables capable of  transmitting data at the rate of 156 megabits per second and  offer their use free of charge for the experiments. Firms  participating in the experiments will link their firms' research  facilities with such cables and conduct tests in the area of  computer networks, television conferences, and remote medical  services.    The Telecommunications Council, an advisory organ of the  MPT,  will complete a report providing a blueprint for the  construction of an information infrastructure designed for a  sophisticated information society of the 21st century. The MOPT  will consider the G-Net Association experiments as a precursor  of the type of pioneering experimental projects sought by the  report and intends to offer low-interest loans in support of  such projects.    Since 1990, the United States has established a National  Research and Education Network (NREN) plan as one phase of the  National Information Infrastructure (NII). Already feasibility  experiments have been initiated at five sites throughout the  United States. NREN's budget for fiscal year 1994 totaled about  $170 million. MPT plans to develop the G-Net Association project  into a rival of the NREN plan.</p>

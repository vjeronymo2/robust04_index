			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Letter: Blind spot on the Dark Ages Sir, David Richardson, a tenant himself, appears to have a blind spot ('Tenant farmers fear return to Dark Ages', April 16). There is currently a massive subsidy in value terms from landlord to tenant. This is beyond doubt as the price of agricultural land subject to agricultural tenancy is generally half the value of the same land with vacant possession. The minister of agriculture is proposing freedom of contract (on new tenancies only). For would-be tenants to claim some further rights over a landowner's freehold property is impertinent and illogical. If the minister's proposals go through, it is likely that there will be considerable opportunities for new lettings on a freely agreed basis. One might even arrive at the position, as is the case in commercial lettings, where a farm let to a good tenant is worth as much as it would be if in hand. This point appears to have been missed by Mr Richardson and the tenant farming lobby which seeks a degree of influence over landowners' property completely unjustified by the circumstances.

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / People: Lay members for Revenue The Inland Revenue has announced the names of the two private sector members of its new management board, which was launched in April this year as part of a series of wider reforms. Lady Wilcox, chairman of the National Consumer Council, and Sheila Masters, a partner in KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, are joining as non-executive members. Masters, a chartered accountant, is no stranger to the challenges facing large organisations undergoing change. She was seconded from KPMG to the National Health Service as director of finance to the management executive and since her return, has helped co-ordinate the firm's internal reorganisation, called 20/20 vision. The chancellor of the exchequer announced in March that 'a number of members from the private sector' would be added to a new management board to provide expertise, experience and advice to the department. The existing seats on the management board are held by the five members of the board of the Inland Revenue, and a further six senior revenue officials. The Revenue expects to appoint a number of other private sector members over the next few months. ***** Pannell Kerr Forster Worldwide, the international accountancy firm network, has restructured its top management following the death of Claude Brown, the former executive chairman. Frank Hughes, currently chairman of the firm's Americas region, will become temporary international chairman for a second term. He will be replaced by Tim Richmond, managing partner of the UK firm, on July 1 next year. Eric Tait, currently director of European operations, becomes international executive director and will report to the chairman. Richmond - who becomes vice chairman until July 1 - will act in a non-executive role and continue as managing partner in the UK. Guillermo Williams of SAlles Sainz y Cia, the Mexican member firm, will chair the Americas region, and Ton Wallast of Wallast &amp; Stam, in the Netherlands, will chair for Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Rafael Caldera has said the bolivar  fluctuations will not affect the future of the Group of Three  [G-3] free trade agreement. He made this statement at a joint  news conference in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, where the G-3  countries are meeting and where the Fourth Ibero-American Summit  is taking place.    [Begin Caldera recording] Bolivar fluctuations will not  affect the G-3 free trade agreement, because there will always  be ways to prevent any eventuality from obstructing the basic  element: trade among sister nations. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria has said the  trade agreement will come into effect soon due to the rules  previously stipulated in the treaty signed by Venezuela,  Colombia, and Mexico. The first reaction to this treaty will  come from investors of the three countries.    [Begin Gaviria recording] Although an immediate deregulation  was included in the agreement, the G-3 free trade agreement is  of utmost importance for a number of products. We must bear in  mind the lifting of customs duties will take 10 years; this is  why free trade will be progressive. I believe, however, the  same thing that happened when Mexico signed a free trade  agreement with Chile will happen again: the doubling in trade  within a year, because the expectations and clear-cut rules have  made businessmen aware that there were regulations that would  control trade and make trade grow. We hope the agreement among  Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico will yield very significant  results soon. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has  said the prospects of this agreement regarding larger markets  and production are compelling mechanisms with which to defeat  poverty. The Aztec head of state was questioned about the G-3's  contribution to help fight poverty.    [Begin Salinas recording] We in Mexico are convinced the  only  way to permanently defeat poverty is to recover sustained  economic growth, because without well-paying jobs there are no  possibilities of permanently eradicating poverty.

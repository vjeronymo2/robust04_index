			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ARMSTRONG BEATS GIANTS, 5-2, FOR HIS 10TH WIN  </P> <P> Jack Armstrong gave up four hits in eight innings and Todd Benzinger hit a  three-run homer as the Cincinnati Reds defeated the San Francisco Giants, 5-2,  Monday night at Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Armstrong (10-3) continues to lead the National League in earned-run average at  2.12. The Reds' starter gave way in the ninth to Randy Myers, who got his 14th  save, and remained unbeaten in his six starts this season at Riverfront  Stadium.  </P> <P> "I had something to prove tonight," Armstrong said. "I'd been a little slack  the last three or four starts. I had to get back to the grindstone, to get  locked in again. I was glad to show my teammates I can still get them out."  </P> <P> Armstrong struck out six and walked one, giving up Kevin Mitchell's 18th homer  in the fourth and a run-scoring single to Brett Butler in the eighth.  </P> <P> "He had great stuff," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. "In the last five games  we have not hit the ball good. Tonight you face one of the best pitchers in the  league and you expect a low-scoring game. That's what happened."  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 5, Philadelphia 0 -- Rick Reed gave up four hits, retiring 20 of the  last 21 Phillies in his first 1990 start, and Jose Lind had a two-run triple as  the Pirates won at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Reed (1-0) also hit a sacrifice fly in the Pirates' three-run fourth inning. He  struck out a career-high nine and walked two. A right-hander who was 2-4 with a  4.70 ERA in nine previous major-league starts, Reed last won as a starter last  Aug. 20, beating Atlanta, 7-6.  </P> <P> The Pirates, winning their second in a row after five consecutive losses, got  only two hits in three-plus innings against Jose DeJesus. But Pittsburgh  benefited from five walks and two wild pitches while sending Philadelphia to  its fourth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Montreal 7, Chicago 3 -- Nelson Santovenia hit a two-run homer in the fourth  inning and added a run-scoring single in a five-run seventh to lead the Expos  past the Cubs at Chicago.  </P> <P> Tim Wallach singled in two runs in the seventh inning that included a  run-scoring single by Larry Walker and a run-scoring double by Mike Aldrete.  </P> <P> Mark Gardner (4-3) was the winner, giving up five hits in six innings. Bill  Sampen pitched the last three innings for his first career save, sending the  Cubs to their 11th loss in 14 games.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter Jerry Goff opened the seventh by drawing a walk and one out later  Spike Owen walked. Walker greeted reliever Paul Assenmacher with a single that  made the score 3-3. Les Lancaster relieved and got Andres Galarraga to fly out,  but Wallach singled in two runs and Aldrete and Santovenia followed with their  run-scoring hits.  </P> <P> Houston 5, San Diego 3 -- Mike Scott continued to control the Padres in the  Astrodome, improving his career record at home against them to 14-1.  </P> <P> Scott (5-7) worked 5 2/3 innings, giving up two runs on five hits and walking  two and striking out three. Dave Smith, the fourth Houston pitcher, worked the  ninth for his 15th save, giving up Fred Lynn's fifth homer.  </P> <P> New York 3, St. Louis 2 -- The winning run scored on an error by right fielder  Milt Thompson in the ninth inning as the Mets extended their winning streak to  seven by beating the Cardinals in St. Louis.  </P> <P> With two outs and a runner on first, Dave Magadan doubled off Lee Smith (1-2).  Thompson booted the ball into the corner as Mackey Sasser scored.  </P> <P> David Cone (4-4) gave up five hits in eight innings to beat the Cardinals for  the second time in a week. John Franco worked the ninth for his 13th save.  </P></p>

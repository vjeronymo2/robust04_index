			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / 20m on brink of starvation THE lives of 20m people in Africa are poised 'on a knife edge between life and death' and many will die without emergency aid, a group of seven leading British aid agencies warned yesterday. The London-based Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) which is co-ordinating an appeal for assistance, said at a press conference yesterday that war in 10 countries 'has left millions of people homeless, struggling to survive in appalling conditions where sickness and disease are rife. Many people are on the edge of starvation and in need of urgent help'. The committee said starvation threatened 2m people in southern Sudan and 1,000 people were dying every day in Angola. Other countries hit by war or caught in its aftermath are Zaire, Liberia, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sierra Leone and Rwanda. The agencies represented by the committee are: Actionaid, The British Red Cross, CAFOD, Christian Aid, Help the Aged, Oxfam and Save the Children.

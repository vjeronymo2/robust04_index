			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Efficiencies alone will not be enough Sir, Last year, Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, requested water companies to canvass customers' views on a big scale. They were asked what improvements they would like, for their own benefit and for the benefit of the environment. They were also told the likely impact on prices of the options put before them. It seems curious therefore that, to judge from your report of his recent speech ('Water companies told to cut costs', March 15), the regulator will not provide the water companies with the means, in his forthcoming review of price caps, to provide the quality of service customers desire. Criticising the high profits of water companies in recent years, the regulator makes no reference to the fact that two-thirds of them have been re-invested in the business. The companies will continue their already significant progress towards greater efficiency and cost cutting. But this alone will not square the circle. Janet Langdon, director, Water Services Association, 1 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9BT</p>

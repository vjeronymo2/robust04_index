			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Turbulent leasehold bill passes final hurdle THE controversial Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill passed its final parliamentary hurdle this week. It awaits royal assent. The turbulence of the bill's passage through parliament stems from the first of its three main provisions  - the right it gives leaseholders to buy their freeholds. The bill also gives local authority tenants the right to buy a share in their homes, and it sets up an urban regeneration agency to tackle dereliction. Opposition came from Conservatives who consider that forcing landlords to sell freeholds to leaseholders undermines property rights and the sanctity of contracts. According to the Duke of Westminster, who resigned from the Conservative party over the issue, the bill was 'an infringement of long-standing democratic principles'. The impact of the bill may be less than tenants hope and landlords fear, however. According to its Labour critics the bill is 'a damp squib on a dull day'. They believe that many of the 750,000 leaseholders who expect to benefit from the legislation will be disappointed. The House of Lords put forward nearly 300 amendments which went some way to reducing the impact of the legislation. Some amendments excluded particular groups from the legislation. People living in cathedral closes are excluded, for example. Other measures have a wider impact, such as the introduction of a residence test designed to stop speculators benefitting from the new legislation. Half the participating tenants have to be resident in a property to qualify, so the building must have been the tenant's only or principal home for at least a year, or for three out of the last 10 years. Sir George Young, the housing minister, says the measure 'will exorcise the spectre of control by an absent minority'. Critics argued that it would substantially reduce the number of leaseholders who could benefit from the legislation, particularly for flat owners in blocks where there was a highly mobile population. A far-reaching set of amendments in the Lords affects the 50,000 high-value houses (with a rateable value of more than Pounds 1,500) that were excluded from the leasehold enfranchisement measures of 1967. These will add considerably to the cost of enfranchisement by including several assumptions in the valuation of such freeholds: Leaseholders should not be assumed to have security of tenure. Landlords should receive at least half of any marriage value  - the extra value from combining landlords' and tenants' interests. Landlords should be compensated for 'injurious affection', meaning the loss which enfranchisement might inflict on a landlord's other property. The measures provoked dismay among leaseholders. Ms Joan South of the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association, a lobby group, said: 'We are terribly disappointed.'</p>

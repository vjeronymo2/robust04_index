			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ivory Coast concern underpins cocoa prices Cocoa prices moved higher yesterday as the market remained perturbed about a possible power struggle in the Ivory Coast - the world's biggest producer - following the death of president Felix Houphouet-Boigny on Tuesday. The price for the second position futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange rose by Pounds 8 a tonne to Pounds 1,050 a tonne. Reports that the republic could have problems meeting its December sales commitments despite the resumption of normal working also supported cocoa prices. 'It underlines the fact that any civil or political difficulties in a power struggle could make things worse,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, at GNI, the London commodities house. The speaker of the Ivory Coast parliament yesterday declared himself president, but the prime minister, who is backed by the army claimed this was not constitutional. Cocoa prices are expected to remain high until the succession in the Ivory Coast becomes apparent. The market has been rising on expectations of a shortfall in this year's crop as consumption continues to increase.</p>

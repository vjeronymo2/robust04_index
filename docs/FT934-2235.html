			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Tobacco advert to be dropped Imperial Tobacco, the Hanson subsidiary, is to scrap its current advertising campaign for Embassy Regal cigarettes, featuring a character called Reg, after a complaint from the Health Education Authority that the advertisements appeal to children. The Advertising Standards Authority said yesterday that the advertisements had passed its vetting process and had not contravened a code of practice on tobacco advertising, but it 'considered that further use of the campaign would be unwise and therefore requested that it be discontinued'. The authority's recommendation is likely to fuel debate about whether controls on tobacco advertising should remain voluntary, or whether all tobacco advertising should be banned, as the European Commission has argued. The government is expected to announce a tightening of voluntary controls, one aim of which would be to head off a private member's bill to ban tobacco advertising - except at point of sale - being tabled by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley. The Embassy Regal posters, which have appeared mainly in Scotland, Wales and northern England and have won advertising industry awards, feature Reg's views on life. An example is: 'Reg on party politics - If you drop ash on the carpet you won't get invited again.' Research by the Health Education Authority was said to have shown that the Reg character had become an 'icon' among children. The authority said surveys showed that 'children in Manchester no longer called each other a Wally to denote stupidity, they called each other a Reg'. Imperial Tobacco said yesterday it did not accept the Reg campaign had encouraged any children to start smoking, but it accepted the Advertising Standards Authority's role 'as the final arbiter on such matters'. It added that its own study had concluded that the Health Education Authority's research was 'highly selective' and 'highly misleading'.</p>

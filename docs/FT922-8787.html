			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (4): Benefits that work both ways / Discovering the spin-offs of seconding staff to local projects ALISON KETTERING has no regrets about the 100 hours during which she was seconded part-time from the Nationwide Anglia building society to Islington Voluntary Action Council. She has since been promoted from management trainee to branch manager at Rayners Lane in London. Her attachment over three months for a day each week provided a local community group with an analysis of how to improve its services. It also gave her - and indirectly her employer - the benefits of invaluable training in interviewing and report-writing, time management and a wholly different perspective on life and work. The role of secondment in the community has shifted sharply in the last few years. The image of companies handing over begrudging burnt-out executives to voluntary organisations as an act of charity has all but disappeared. In its place have come the best up-and-coming staff on loan for sound commercial reasons. The idea of loaning employees to an outside organisation - while normally keeping them on full salary and benefits - has been around for a long time. But its adoption is growing fast, and the reasons for doing so are more diverse and powerful than ever. A survey in 1989 estimated that there were 890 secondees from the private sector and 150 from government departments during the year, representing staffing costs of about Pounds 20m. The trend has continued. Nowhere is the pattern more clearly visible than at the Action Resource Centre, an organisation based in London and with offices around the country, which specialises in 'brokering' secondments by establishing links between companies and voluntary organisations. ARC's annual report, released at the start of this month,shows that it alone coordinated 425 secondments in the 12 months to the end of March. Mr David Hemsworth, director of communications, says: 'The proof of the pudding is in the figures.' Companies are sufficiently keen that they willingly pay the Pounds 500-Pounds 1,000 fee charged by ARC for each secondee placed. In fact, Mr Hemsworth says he now finds much of his marketing efforts target voluntary organisations, to ensure that he can generate sufficient quality placements each year to meet demand from businesses. Marks &amp; Spencer alone used ARC to arrange 62 secondments this year. Meanwhile, Alison Kettering at Nationwide Anglia found herself competing against an enthusiastic glut of trainees who were trying to be allowed to take part. ARC is not alone in arranging secondments. Accountancy firms are just one sector which has long seconded staff to public sector bodies such as the Stock Exchange and the Serious Fraud Office. The trade-off includes greater insight into the operation of government, training for those attached and potential business leads, and as well as altruism. But even where attachments to the voluntary sector are concerned and the pay-back is rather more personal, large numbers of secondees have been attracted from unsolicited applications from voluntary organisations to companies. Some - particularly those sought to work in the network of local enterprise agencies around the country - are handled through Business in the Community. A vast number of shorter attachments - for one or two weeks - are arranged by Understanding British Industry, which specialises in placing school teachers into industry for a limited period. 'Secondment has come a long way over the last two years,' says Mr Hemsworth. 'The stereotype was of a tired executive being put out to grass before retirement. Like all stereotypes it had some truth to it. But the more accurate image now is of the early or mid-career manager using a short placement as way of development.' Traditionally, he says, requests for secondees were dealt with by companies' community affairs departments. Attachments were typically for full-time for two years or more, often with unclear objectives. That sector remains important. But its growth has all but tailed off. In its place has come a range of shorter-term, often part-time attachments for bright young talent, normally arranged by the personnel or training department. In the time alloted, they may computerise the accounts, develop a marketing plan, or produce a feasibility study. 'They are taken out of the womb of their company and put in a different organisation in scale and ethos,' says Mr Hemsworth. 'They develop qualities of adaptability and hone soft management skills like negotiation, influence and communications.' Even in 1989, 41 per cent of companies offering secondments said they were designed for employees in mid-career. That proportion has grown sharply since, driven by the realisation that it provides clear returns to the company. Short secondments are proving valuable for both general training and to prepare staff for a transition to a different job within their company. As Heather Hubbard, training and development adviser at Marks &amp; Spencer, puts it: 'Secondment provides an opportunity to make not only a contribution to the community but also for personal development of staff. We think it's a very powerful method of developing management skills.' Voluntary organisations also benefit greatly. They are likely to get more energetic staff with a highly-focused project than through more traditional secondment programmes. Mr Hemsworth stresses a number of important points that should be respected if the secondment is to work effectively. Companies need to recognise the importance of the idea from the board-level downwards. Secondees must be genuinely committed to their attachments, and so should be fully prepared in advance and given a choice of possible assignments. They should also stay in regular touch with their employer. And voluntary organisations must accept fully management responsibility for their secondees, helping them integrate and devising a project which provides lasting benefit rather than a spare pair of hands.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Tax staff urged to accept 4.45% rise STAFF AT the Inland Revenue were urged by union leaders yesterday to accept a deal which would raise salaries by 4.45 per cent. The offer is the last in what has been an inflationary pay round in the civil service. Although the draft deal negotiated by the Inland Revenue Staff Federation is about the level already offered to other public sector unions, it comes at a sensitive time for the government. The latest reported inflation rate, for the year to June, was 3.9 per cent. Some Tory MPs have been arguing for a public sector pay freeze and the Confederation of British Industry wants the public sector to bear the brunt of government efforts to hold down public expenditure and accept rises below inflation. The proposed agreement covering 57,000 tax workers is also significant because it is the first in a large government department to be negotiated by departmental managers rather than by the Treasury. The government is encouraging the devolution of pay bargaining from the centre in the public sector as part of its Citizen's Charter. It is committed to keeping pay deals for more than 500,000 civil servants in the so-called 'interquartile range' - or middle 50 per cent - of private sector pay settlements for the previous 12 months. For agreements due to be implemented from August 1, as in the case of the Revenue, the interquartile range was 4 per cent to 6.2 per cent. Under the Revenue agreement, the range of rises will be 4 per cent to 6 per cent with the overall value at 4.45 per cent. That is similar to what specialist civil servants are being recommended to accept by the IPMS union in a deal also operable from August 1, and slightly above the 4.3 per cent offer made to middle-ranking civil servants in grades 4 to 7 which they are being advised to accept. Unlike other civil service agreements this year, the Revenue deal does not include provision for the extension of performance-related pay (PRP). However, the management has said it expects a PRP system to be in place by next year and the union is committed to continuing talks about it. The Revenue intends to start a performance management system, on which PRP assessments will be based, in October and wants a new pay and grading structure from April. Mr Clive Brooke, IRSF general secretary, said the pay offer represented a creditable outcome to negotiations. However, there is still a possibility that members will reject the deal, in part because of opposition to performance pay. The agreement was backed by 16 members of the IRSF executive in a vote, with seven members against. Meanwhile, members of the NUCPS, the 114,000-strong second largest civil service union, have voted to accept a 4.1 per cent pay rise deal but to reject an extension of the performance-related pay system associated with the deal. The vote raises the possibility that the government will implement the package without agreement.</p>

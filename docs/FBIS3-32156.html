			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Feb (NA) -- Vice Foreign Minister  Fernando Petrella today downplayed the importance of a U.S.  State Department report on the human rights situation in  Argentina because it "includes an assessment that is formulated  through the system" but "it is not a criticism of the system."    Petrella was referring to the document the U.S. Government  submits to Congress with a detailed report on each country, and  he believes that it "must be taken into account," although he  made it clear that "no institutional aspect has been criticized"  because "our country has made notable progress that is  noticeable in the management of the OAS' Human Rights  Commission."    In the chapter that refers to Argentina, the document  published today by a newspaper alludes to police executions,  torture, and disappearances, and it puts in doubt the  independent functioning of the judicial branch.    Petrella added that "there are several categories within the  mechanism of human rights," and he stressed: "Argentina is in a  good position."    Regarding the chapter that indicates that the Executive  Branch puts pressure on the Judicial Branch, the vice minister  explained that the report "takes up the opinion of the media,"  and he emphasized that "this type of opinion did not find an  echo within the Inter-American Human Rights Commission."    He also admitted that "without having fully read the  report,"  in Argentina "there are aspects that can be improved," although  he highlighted the fact that "if the U.S. Congress has to decide  on something related to our country, it will not necessarily  take the report into account."    "Regarding human rights, the fact is that since 1983,  Argentina's record has been a good one because our country is  not even mentioned in the Inter-American Human Rights Commission  report," the vice minister said.</p>

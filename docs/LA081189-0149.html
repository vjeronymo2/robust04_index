			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 GET 16-, 20-YEAR, LIFE SENTENCES FOR DEFACING BEIJING PORTRAIT OF MAO  </P> <P> A Chinese court imposed prison sentences of life, 20 years and 16 years on  three men who flung ink and paint on the giant portrait of the late ruler Mao  Zedong in Beijing's Tian An Men Square during anti-government unrest in May.  </P> <P> The Beijing Evening News said the capital's Intermediate Court found Yu  Zhijian, Yu Dongyue and Lu Decheng from south China's Hunan Province guilty of  "counterrevolutionary destruction and counterrevolutionary incitement."  </P> <P> The prison terms are among the few court sentences Chinese authorities have  announced since the bloody military crackdown June 3 and 4 and subsequent  arrests of thousands of anti-government protesters.  </P> <P> The three pasted "reactionary posters" on the Gate of Heavenly Peace at the  north end of the giant square before throwing paint-filled eggshells and an ink  bottle at Mao's portrait May 23, the paper said.  </P> <P> "They used the turmoil in Beijing as an opportunity to put up reactionary  posters, make reactionary speeches . . . and brazenly carried out  counterrevolutionary destruction on Tian An Men Square," it quoted the court as  saying.  </P> <P> "Their actions constitute . . . counterrevolutionary destruction and  counterrevolutionary incitement. They must be severely punished," it added.  </P> <P> The three, described in earlier reports as a primary schoolteacher, a newspaper  arts editor and a transport company worker, were seized by student democracy  activists then filling Tian An Men Square and handed over to police after  defacing the picture.  </P> <P> National television showed the three men standing impassively as court  officials read out their sentences. Yu Zhijian was jailed for life, Yu Dongyue  for 20 years and Lu 16.  </P> <P> Mao's portrait has hung since the 1950s from the Gate of Heavenly Peace at the  entrance to the Forbidden City, the ancient imperial palace complex in the  center of Beijing.  </P> <P> A sign reading, "This Was Not Done by Students or the People," appeared below  the defaced portrait and student leaders condemned the action.  </P> <P> Authorities quickly replaced the painting with an identical, undamaged one.  </P> <P> The attack went against the grain of a limited revival of Mao's memory during  the weeks of unrest, when some workers on protest marches carried his portrait  in the first such public display of devotion to him in the capital in a decade.  </P></p>

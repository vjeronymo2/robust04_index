			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Investors back Lorenzo plans for US airline Mr Frank Lorenzo, the former US airline chief, yesterday renewed his efforts to re-enter the industry by bringing in a group of investors to back his plans to launch a low-cost carrier serving the US east coast. He announced that Odyssey Partners, a private New York investment firm, and other private investors had agreed to put Dollars 12.5m into ATX, formed to promote his venture. His own stake would be diluted to less than 25 per cent. He also said ATX had chosen Mr Stephen Berger, an Odyssey partner, as its first chairman. He is a former executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. For months Mr Lorenzo has been trying to win a licence to start up a no-frills, low-fare airline serving the east coast. He says the carrier will offer unrestricted fares of Dollars 69 on the Baltimore-Boston and Washington-Boston routes, compared with the current average of Dollars 129. However, he is strongly opposed by the airline unions because of the bitter confrontations when Mr Lorenzo headed Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines in the 1980s. Both companies eventually went bankrupt.</p>

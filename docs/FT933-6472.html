			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: The Oslo Philharmonic - Promenade concerts During the past seven years or so, the Oslo Philharmonic has earned unstinting admiration over here. Undoubtedly it owes much to its conductor Mariss Jansons (not a Norwegian), but the playing - strong, musicianly, vitally responsive - speaks for itself. Yet for the Prom concerts on Monday and Tuesday, it took care to have international soloists as draws: first the Japanese phenomenon Midori in Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, and then Yuri Bashmet in the concerto Bartok was writing when he died. The orchestra need not have been so modest, being itself a grade-A draw. Still, Bashmet's extraordinary account of the Bartok was marvellous to hear. Aspersions are often cast upon Tibor Serly's posthumous 'completion' of the concerto. It has won a place in the repertoire only because violists desperately need something substantial by some major composer after Mozart, Berlioz and Walton. But if this 'Bartok' concerto cannot pretend to be just what the composer would have written had he lived, it is nonetheless a substantial piece. Serly's many Bartok arrangements prove him to be a scrupulous disciple; more important, the viola concerto has its own pungent, introspective consistency of tone, echt-Bartokian and yet distinct from any of his previous music. The piece can seem wan, fitful and episodic; not, however, in Bashmet's hands. He is a magnificent brooder. Even single notes may have a smouldering density. That is not a matter of throbbing timbre, but rather of expressive sense relentlessly pursued. Here, Bashmet's tempi were uncommonly deliberate, the better to fathom the world-weary gentleness of this last Bartok score. Without histrionics or overt virtuosity he gave it the scathing candour of an unedited testament. The OPO also played Stravinsky's 1919 Firebird suite, where Jansons engineered quite original balances - we heard some bold harmonic relations as if for the first time; and Dvorak's G major Symphony, darker and tauter than usual. It had begun with Ragnar Soderlind's Trauermusik, composed a quarter-century ago in response to the crushing of the Prague Spring: tough and terse (just 8 minutes long) but laden with complex feeling, rendered in sure orchestral strokes. Though Soderlind is no modernist, he sounds like a real composer whom we should know better. ***** On Monday the orchestra made Strauss's Alpine Symphony a continuously gripping and enjoyable experience, bursting with colour and energy - and this in spite of two handicaps that in other circumstances could well have proved onerous, or even insupportable. The first, of course, is that the work itself is twaddle virtually from beginning to end. The second is that the Oslo Philharmonic is not a 'native' Strauss orchestra. Yet so brightly enthusiastic was the Oslo attack, so unflagging the players' appetite, that even your reviewer, the most erratic of Straussians, was won over. The concert, which was televised live on BBC-2 and broadcast on Radio 3, opened with Alfred Schnittke's (K)ein Sommernachtstraum of 1983, a rather strenuous comic squib in the manner of Charles Ives. It then offered the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, with Midori, the Japanese Wunderkind, making her Proms debut. In the reflective passages she was lyrical, tender, velvety, exquisite; in the bravura ones rather effortful, unsparkling, as though diligently repeating a lesson carefully learned but incompletely absorbed.</p>

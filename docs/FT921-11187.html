			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Japan sees first net inflow of capital since 1980 THE net outflow of capital from Japan, which flooded world financial markets in the 1980s, last year turned into a net inflow for the first time since 1980, writes Stefan Wagstyl from Tokyo. The current account surplus was also heavily in credit, according to combined figures published yesterday by the Ministry of Finance. Taken together the two surpluses could put upward pressure on the yen on foreign currency markets. Mr Robert Feldman, an economist at the Tokyo office of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, forecast the yen would move towards Y110 against the US dollar against Y125 yesterday. According to the ministry's report, a net Dollars 36.6bn (Pounds 20bn) in long-term capital flowed into Japan in 1991, compared with a net outflow of Dollars 43.6bn in 1990 and Dollars 136bn in 1987, the peak year. Foreign investment by Japanese rose slightly form Dollars 120.8bn to Dollars 121.9bn, as Japanese portfolio fund managers, wary of the weakness in Tokyo's financial markets, bought foreign bonds. Direct investment overseas fell sharply from Dollars 48.0bn to Dollars 31.2bn, as industrial companies cut their expansion plans. Meanwhile, foreign investment in Japan soared to a record Dollars 158.5bn, more than double the previous year's Dollars 77.2bn, as foreign fund managers judged it was time to hunt bargains in the depressed Japanese stock and bond markets. Japan's current account surplus, bugbear of its international relations, doubled last year to Dollars 72.6bn, due to a sharp increase in the trade surplus. Japan's exports rose 9.4 per cent last year to Dollars 306.6bn and imports fell 6.2 per cent to Dollars 203.3bn. Housing starts for December, announced by the construction ministry, fell 19.7 per cent from a year ago, declining for the 14th consecutive month and reflecting sluggish demand, writes Emiko Terazono. These figures released yesterday indicated a further deceleration in economic growth. Overall housing starts for 1991 totalled 1,370,126 units, down 19.7 per cent year-on-year. The figure was the lowest since 1986, when 1,365,000 units were started.</p>

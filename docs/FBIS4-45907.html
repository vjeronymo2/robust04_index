			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 9 (AFP) - A former head of the Swiss  Red Cross's central laboratory, Alfred Haessig, 73, has been  charged with causing grievous bodily harm by distributing blood  contaminated by the AIDS virus, the Swiss news agency ATS  reported Sunday.    ATS, quoting examining magistrate Pierre Marquis, said  Haessig had been charged last Wednesday and denied the  accusations against him.    Judicial investigations into the spread of AIDS-contaminated  blood were launched two years ago. So far seven people,  including five haemophiliacs, have filed complaints that they  contracted the deadly virus through transfusions in 1985 and  1986.    Lawyer Jacques Barillon, head of an association for the  defence of infected haemophiliacs, told ATS the charging of  Haessig was "a considerable victory," following a "long and  careful inquiry."    Switzerland and Spain became in 1986 the first European  countries to introduce systematic tests of donated blood for  AIDS, but some slipped through. The following year, according to  a Swiss television report, the authorities decided on a cover-up  rather than track down contaminated batches of blood and warn  recipients.    But officials said in March after an investigation that a  total of 52 people had caught the virus from contaminated blood,  18 of whom died before the end of last year.    The investigation covering 315 suspect blood solutions  delivered to 70 hospitals between 1982 and 1992 revealed three  previously unknown people infected by the AIDS virus.    Barillon said the charging of Haessig would bring the affair  into the open and other trials could follow of national and  local public health officials.</p>

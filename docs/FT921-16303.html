			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The sweet taste of success NO MATTER how bad a recession, everyone has to eat. And two little businesses serving the human palate show that you can start out on your own at any age. Pensioners and retired school teachers, Arthur Davy and Kathleen Suchland-Smith started making chocolates for fun back in 1986 and gradually moved into commercial production. 'The past year has been fantastic, so busy it's absolute chaos,' says Davy. Producing chocolates using only natural ingredients, Clarke's of Loch Ewe is now selling 50 per cent more than it was doing at the beginning of last year. In December it had orders for up to 280 boxes a week, 12 large hand-wrapped chunks of confectionery per box. The enterprise will become a limited company this month and two younger people, with capital, are coming in to help run the operation. 'It's going to be a serious venture from now on,' Davy says. In the past six months, Clarke's outlets have grown to include two shops on London's Fulham Road and its mail order business has taken off. Working with just a few staff at its minuscule 'factory' in Coldstream on the England-Scotland border, the two founders continue to buy their dried apricots and raisins in Edinburgh and, from Glasgow, the ground almonds which they use to make their own marzipan. Prices of raw ingredients have changed little over the past 12 months and Clarke's has held the price of its broad range of sticky edibles. Its whisky-flavoured Glenlivet sells mail-order for Pounds 8.80. Clarke's is no threat to Cadbury, but it is giving the two pensioners a lot of fun. 'It's something to get out of bed for,' Suchland-Smith says. Fasta Pasta was started in 1990 by 27-year old Ben Fox. Last year, Fox was able to add a second home delivery outlet in London's Clapham to his existing one in Fulham, after an the injection of capital from two private investors. All deliveries of rigatoni, linguine and spaghetti are done by bicycle ('we want to make it the Body Shop of fast food') and turnover in the first full year was Pounds 127,000. The company's Fulham premises now act as a kind of centralised kitchen and Fasta Pasta has begun selling cold pasta and sauces to restaurants and pubs for reheating. With four full-time and 21 part-time staff, controlling labour costs is now one of Fox's headaches. People still eat in the recession, but they do not always want to fork out what they once did for a lunch time snack at the office or an easy meal at home in the evening. 'People are not spending quite as much now,' says Fox. 'They still want a nice pasta dish with a nice sauce but are not wanting to spend Pounds 4.50 on it.' As a result Fox has introduced a delivery pasta salad for Pounds 1.80 in competition with the ubiquitous sandwich.</p>

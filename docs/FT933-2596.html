			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (4): Fast mover across Europe - Profile: J P Morgan IN THE past few years, while many other banks have cut back their mergers and acquisitions teams, J P Morgan, the blue-chip US bank, has taken a contrary approach. 'We have increased the resources dedicated to the business, and maybe faster than some of our peers,' said Mr Rod Peacock, co-head of J P Morgan's European advisory group. The cross-border European M&amp;A business has relatively few big players. S G Warburg and Goldman Sachs are still considered the leaders of the pack, but J P Morgan is one of a small number of other participants that can claim to be genuinely pan-European: the bank has long-established bases in all the important European financial centres. But while it is considered a market-leader in the securities business, J P Morgan is still not one of the first names to spring to mind in the context of European M&amp;A activity. The team has been built up from 10 to 60 professionals in the past four years - still a drop in the ocean of 4,500 J P Morgan staff in Europe. The European M&amp;A team is based in London and staffed by pan-European industry specialists, with teams in all the main European centres. The aim is to 'combine a global or pan-European industry view with local market execution,' says Mr Peacock. While claiming not to focus on league tables, the bank has nevertheless risen from nowhere to rank fifth in the 1992 list of financial advisers on cross-border European deals compiled by Acquisitions Monthly, the M&amp;A trade magazine. Although J P Morgan has been involved in the M&amp;A market for many years, the bank was not a big hitter during the boom days of the 1980s. 'Our intent is to be a strategic adviser to our clients,' says Mr Walter Gubert, now head of corporate finance in Europe, who headed up the thrust in recent years. 'This is as true today as it was 10 years ago. J P Morgan's value-driven philosophy has not changed, but the evolution of the market and of shareholder attitudes has shifted the emphasis from the hostile deal to the complex industrially-driven transaction,' he explained. It is certainly true that J P Morgan has benefited from the greater emphasis on advisory work, and the virtual disappearance of the hostile takeover. 'I get professional, client-centred advice, and that is what I want,' says one company chairman. Current conditions - the emphasis on relationship banking, the need for industrial restructurings, the increase in international industrial competition, the focus on core businesses - favour that approach. 'It is a positive cycle for us,' says Mr Gubert. Mr Klaus Diederichs, co-head of European advisory, says the acquisition, in 1991, by Marzotto of Italy of the majority stake in Hugo Boss, the German fashion manufacturer, from a Japanese group, is typical of the multi-dimensional nature of the advisory business in the 1990s. It required the close co-ordination of the bank's network in Asia and across Europe. 'It was J P Morgan's relationship with the buyer and its knowledge of the needs of the players in the industry which enabled the bank to move faster than its competitors to secure the deal for its client,' says Mr Diederichs. In an unusual step, Mr Gubert was appointed to the board of Hugo Boss, following the acquisition, to help the transition to new ownership. 'This is an illustration of the client-focused nature of J P Morgan's advisory activity,' says Mr Diederichs. As an example of the firm's culture of putting the client first, Mr Gubert tells the story of going to see Sir Dennis Weatherstone, the bank's chairman, about a potential deal, and being cut short with a single question: 'If you were the client, would you do the deal?' The idea of such team-spirit in a bank culture, where staff are traditionally ruled by the annual bonus, is rather hard to credit. Mr Gubert insists that it is possible. 'We do pay bonuses on performance, but the most important measure of performance is the client's satisfaction. If a client is not happy that will affect your bonus,' he says. Among its peers, J P Morgan commands respect, but not awe. 'J P Morgan starts with a very good client base and a long-term orientation, both of which are needed in this business,' says one M&amp;A specialist. 'They are good at the bread and butter stuff, but there are some gaps in their capabilities.' For example, he adds, JP Morgan's historic exclusion from the equity business in the US meant that its equity distribution lagged other houses. Another M&amp;A specialist says that the most successful professionals in the market would not choose to work at J P Morgan. The more aggressive approach of other banks - and the larger pay packets - prove more attractive to many high-flyers. Although J P Morgan sees its lack of involvement in the area of hostile bids as a strength, some of its competitors say that its lack of experience in this area means the bank has a less thorough feel for the market as a whole. However, it is positively viewed by its largely blue-chip clients, many of which deal with the bank across a number of different areas. 'We have an ongoing relationship with J P Morgan, based on fact that they are more similar in character to us than other banks,' says Reto Domeniconi, executive vice-president of Nestle. The world's largest foods group was advised by J P Morgan in its recent acquisition of Italgel, the Italian ice-cream manufacturer sold as part of Italy's privatisation programme by state holding company IRI. 'One has to tread carefully in Italy. We were at ease that they were well established in Italy, and that is why every thing went well,' he adds. Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters, which was advised on its recent share buy-back by J P Morgan, says: 'They have given me distinguished advice on at least four or five occasions.' As chairman of the bank's UK advisory council, he is not now an unbiased witness, as he admits. However, he first came across J P Morgan in the late 1970s, when it proved 'steady and unflappable' during the restructuring of Courtaulds. Another client describes the bank as 'solid, but not overly aggressive'. Such a description, applied in the 1980s, would have perhaps been considered a slight. In 1993, it is intended as a compliment.</p>

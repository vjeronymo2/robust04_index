			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / New year grapes of wrath for Gonzalez: Spain's premier is being blamed for his country's political and economic malaise, writes Tom Burns Spaniards, either gathered round the television or crowding into the plaza before the clock of their local town hall, will tonight eat a grape with every midnight chime that rings in the new year. Tradition holds that downing a grape on each stroke, reflecting on the 12 months past with every mouthful, will bring luck in the year to come. As Mr Felipe Gonzalez performs the ritual he may be wishing that much of 1994 had never happened and conscious that he will need a lot of good fortune if he is to eat his grapes at the end of next year among the colonnades of the Moncloa Palace's main drawing room. Most Spaniards will share such thoughts. A bad year for the prime minister has left a widespread sense that an era marked by his 12 years in power is drawing to a close. Mr Gonzalez will reflect on the irony of his situation. There is a clear consolidation of Spain's economic recovery. GDP grew at 2.3 per cent a year in the third quarter compared to 1.7 per cent in the second quarter. The second half of 1995, when Spain holds the presidency of the European Union, promises him the full political spotlight he enjoys. But the international markets have bracketed Spain with Italy as high-risk countries of economic uncertainty and political instability. 1994 ends with the peseta at an historic low, with the Bolsa stock market index plummeting, and with confidence severely undermined. Triumphs on the European stage, such as Spain's entry, with Portugal, into the Common Fisheries Policy, have taken a back seat to a string of domestic scandals that increasingly rocked Mr Gonzalez as the year wore on. Mr Gonzalez will ruefully recall how corruption allegations (one involving his own brother-in-law) and sleaze charges (one of which put the former governor of the Bank of Spain in prison for two weeks) have overshadowed achievements that included a reform of a restrictive labour legislation, the deregulation of telecommunications and the reduction of the budget deficit. Two heroes of the Gonzalez years of economic bounty in the late 1980s, Mr Mario Conde, the former chairman of Banesto, and Mr Javier de la Rosa, the architect of multi-million-dollar investment in Spain by the Kuwait Investment Office, are in prison facing fraud charges. The scandals hit a new climax this week with highly sensitive and well publicised investigations into the Interior Ministry and the security services. The investigations allegedly point to government involvement in a dirty war against Eta Basque separatists during the 1980s and to considerable embezzlement of public funds within the Interior Ministry. In May the former head of the Guardia Civil, the 70,000 member paramilitary corps that forms the backbone of the domestic security services, became a fugitive of justice after being accused of illegally enriching himself. Just before Christmas three former security chiefs were formally accused of organising the anti-Eta death squad and remanded in custody. Business leaders dismayed by the corruption and political instability, compare Italy to Spain. 'There are two key differences,' said one captain of industry, 'In Italy business carries on regardless without a government and in Spain it grinds to a halt. In Spain Gonzalez has a replacement in (conservative opposition leader Mr Jose Maria Aznar) and in Italy it's (Mr Silvio) Berlusconi or the abyss.' On Thursday, Mr Gonzalez, breaking a week-long silence, said that he had no intention of resigning or of calling early elections and that his government bore no political responsibility for the dirty war. He had wanted to instil confidence and he failed; by the end of the afternoon the markets had taken a hammering for the fourth successive day. The prime minister had argued that his government enjoyed sufficient parliamentary support to remain in office. Elected for a fourth term in the summer of 1993, he does not have to dissolve parliament until 1997. Mr Gonzalez's contention was demonstrably true. There do not, for the time being, appear to be any cracks in an 18-month-long alliance between Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party, which lacks an overall majority, and the right-of-centre Catalan nationalist party whose 17 seats in the Cortes comfortably make up for the shortfall. But the markets seem to reflect a deep-rooted and ill-tempered malaise gripping Spanish society. Many Spaniards, not just business leaders, have come to view Mr Gonzalez as the source of all ills. Mr Gonzalez faces a serious popularity test just before Spain assumes the EU presidency. On May 28 municipal and regional elections are likely to result in a clear sweep for Mr Aznar's conservatives, the Partido Popular, and this in turn could cause the Catalan nationalists to rethink their support for the government. Mr Aznar, who has for the past two years been on a continual campaign trail, is now demanding that the general elections be brought forward to coincide with the mid-term polls in May. 'Gonzalez can no longer guarantee the necessary stability,' he said yesterday. 'The political crisis is costing Spain a fortune.' The conservative leader may not have to wait that long. As he gulps his grapes tonight Mr Gonzalez knows better than anyone else that the legal probes into death squads and backhanders will gather pace in the coming weeks and that any further indictments of senior officials are likely to force his resignation.</p>

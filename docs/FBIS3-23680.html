Awards Were Given Before the  State Commission Drew Its Conclusions"]    [Text] While the State Commission is still in session  investigating the recent incident in space in which Vasiliy  Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov, who had turned over the reins  to the new inhabitants of Mir, almost rammed their old living  quarters as they flew by it after undocking the transport craft  from the station, the cosmonauts have already been given high  state awards for the flight. It's the opinion of specialists  from the Control Center that it would have been more logical to  wait until the investigation ended: what if the main cause for  the incident was pilot error? The plan for time immemorial after  the transport craft undocks from Mir has been that it fly around  the station to inspect the exterior, says Viktor Blagov, the  deputy flight director. During the fly-around, the transport  craft got too close to the station. It seems that a light,  glancing blow occurred. The response of the crew of Vasiliy  Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov was adequate.    "Had it been otherwise, would the result of the collision  have been different?"    "It would have been about the same."    At worst, the station would have been punctured, which still  wouldn't have meant a tragic outcome. Orbital craft are designed  the way submarines are, that is, they're made up of sealed  compartments. The arguments of the specialists are, perhaps,  convincing, but also contradictory: according to the first  reports from the Control Center, the problem involved possible  damage to the docking assembly; then it was a glancing blow; and  finally the most recent version -- no collision occurred at all.  The most surprising thing about the story is that the people  directly involved in it have, to this day, no information at all.    "There are some interpretations of the telemetry, but  nobody's telling us anything about it," said Aleksandr Serebrov  in a telephone conversation.    At NPO Energiya, to this day there are several versions of  what happened. There was a collision, reports one specialist who  should know, but they haven't been able to determine exactly  where Mir was hit. In a fly-around the station by the new crew,  no damage was seen. But just to make sure, a plan is being drawn  up for the cosmonauts to make an EVA to make a careful  inspection of the exterior.    Technical problems, errors in planning, irresponsible  actions  by those executing tasks -- all those things are cropping up in  this country's spaceflight and are approaching critical mass.    Physician German Arzamazov, on the eve of the fifteenth  mission to the Mir orbital station, caused a scandal and quit  his job in the backup crew. The always emotionally reserved  mission director Vladimir Solovyev has announced that the  Control Center in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow is having to do  extra work because the most basic order is lacking at Baykonur.</p>

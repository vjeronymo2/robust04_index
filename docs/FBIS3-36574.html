This was declared by Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev at a meeting with the commanders and senior officers of  the Volga Region's Military District. The meeting took place in  Samara.    In Grachev's words, it is "the final figure," after which  the  reduction of the Russian army is to be stopped. The army  currently has 2.34 Mn men.    Grachev described the last army draft as "more or less  successful." In his words, the units are manned only at 60  percent today. The figure is to be raised to 70-75 percent by  the spring, and to 85-90 percent by the autumn.    He disclosed that Russia had withdrawn more than 270,000  troops, 3,100 tanks, 6,000 armored vehicles, and 1,500 aircraft  from CIS and other countries since 1992.    He also revealed that Russia planned to set up 28 military  bases in CIS states.    The minister spoke in favor of a territorial command scheme,  under which the headquarters of a district be responsible for  all the armed services on their territory. In his words, this  process will get under way next year, and until then, legal and  theoretical prerequisites should be created. In his opinion,  the new scheme will bolster defenses and improve troop  management.</p>

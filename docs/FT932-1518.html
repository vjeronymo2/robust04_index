			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: LPA declines to Pounds 18,000 Profits at LPA Industries, the USM-quoted industrial electrical connectors and accessories group, fell from Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 18,000 pre-tax for the half year ended March 31. Turnover declined to Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 3.18m). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.65p, uncovered by earnings of 0.2p (2.41p) per share. Although sales showed a reduction of 19.6 per cent and pre-tax profit was only slightly better than break even the directors confidently expected an improvement in those earnings ratios by the year-end. They pointed out that a cessation of certain contracts during the second half of last year was a main factor in the reduction in interim sales. The current forward order book stands at Pounds 2.65m, against less than Pounds 1m this time last year. However, some 70 per cent of these orders are not due for execution until 1994.</p>

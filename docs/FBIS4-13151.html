			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 18, IRNA -- A morning daily here  Monday called on the Saudi Government to prepare the necessary  facilities for the Muslims to enable them to fulfill their  religious obligations.    Referring to the 1991 agreement between Iran and Saudi  Arabia  according to which some 115,000 Iranians could go for hajj  pilgrimage each year, and holding of 'Bara'at' (deliverance from  pagans) rally was accepted, the `TEHRAN TIMES' said that Riyadh  has unilaterally canceled the agreement and reduced the number  to 61,600 for this year.    "The Saudi ruling family is governing a country that has a  special status in the Islamic world," noted the paper adding  that they should "understand the sentiments and philosophies of  one billion Muslims who are not Saudi citizens but believed that  the house of God belongs to all of them."    "It is in the Saudi's interest to facilitate Muslim's needs  and provide them with security and accommodations," the article  said. Muslims cannot sit idle and watch a government create  obstacles to prevent them from performing their religious  obligations, it added.    Pointing to the large number of the elderly Iranians who  were  in the waiting list to take a trip to Mecca and perform their  religious duties, the paper said Iran has been "forced" to  accept a reduced quota for this year's hajj.    It concluded by saying that to show good faith, the Saudi  Government should help Muslims perform their hajj duties,  including the Bara'at rally.</p>

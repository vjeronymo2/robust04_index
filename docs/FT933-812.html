			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Alcan Aluminium shuffles board MR JACQUES BOUGIE, 46, is taking over as chief executive of Alcan Aluminium in a major senior management shake-up. He succeeds Mr David Morton. Alcan is also reorganising its operations worldwide into five main groups headed by five new executive vice-presidents. Mr Allan Hodgson, who has been chief financial officer for 12 years and a director, is leaving the company, as is Mr Ian Rugeroni, president of Alcan Enterprises. Mr Bougie joined Alcan in 1979 and in 1989 was hand-picked by Mr Morton to be president and chief operating officer. Mr Morton then took over as chairman and chief executive officer following Mr David Culver's retirement. Mr Morton will continue as chairman of the board. The two men have led a company-wide retrenchment programme and have reduced Alcan Aluminium's annual cost base by about USDollars 500m over the past three years as world metal prices declined steadily with the North American recession and then heavy CIS exports. Alcan says it does not see any turnround in view and the organisational shake-up is clearly designed to cut costs further and improve profitability. 'Alcan can be an even lower-cost producer by focusing on businesses where it has the competitive edge,' said Mr Morton. Alcan is studying its worldwide operation and any cutbacks required to meet new goals will be made at the operating level. The new executive vice-presidents are: Robert Ball, 47, Northern American rolled products, Claude Chamberland, 53, smelting and power, Robert Fox, 57, raw materials, S. Bruce Heister, 55, Asia Pacific, and Everaldo Santos, 54, fabricated products. Reinhold Wagner, 61, will be executive vice-president, rolled products, Europe. Mr Hodgson is succeeded by Suresh Thadhani, 54, now controller.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Aid body set to lose funds THE GOVERNMENT is to end its aid funding for the Commonwealth Development Corporation, Britain's main agency for channelling aid to the private sector in the developing world. In figures about to be released under the Foreign Office's cash plans for next year, the current CDC funding of Pounds 49m will disappear next year. In part compensation, the CDC will not pay interest on outstanding loans. The total Overseas Development Administration budget is set to rise by 4 per cent from Pounds 2.27bn to Pounds 2.31bn, with the only significant increases being rises from Pounds 202m to Pounds 272m in funding for the European Development Fund, and from Pounds 131m to Pounds 187m in EC funding for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The CDC is the main casualty of a 35 per cent increase in funding for European Community aid efforts - a shift that has occurred in spite of criticisms by ministers and members of parliament about inefficiencies in the way aid from the EDF is disbursed. That shift will raise the EC share of Britain's gross aid budget from less than 15 per cent this year to 20 per cent in 1994. The decision will cut the projects it supports from more than 300 last year, to about 200 in 1994, the CDC says. The cut comes in spite of a recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report, which commended the CDC as providing 'a highly effective form of aid' that 'fits well with the trend of international thinking on development assistance.' The decision will 'take the growth out of the CDC, and make us sweat a bit more', Mr John Eccles, CDC chief executive, said yesterday. He emphasised that net funding averaging Pounds 20m a year over the past five years had enabled the CDC to disburse more than Pounds 150m. He said that the shift towards aid funding from Brussels would force the CDC to look more in the future to the EC for support.</p>

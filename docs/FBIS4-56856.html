			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Colombia Government has replied to the U.S.  State Department letter in accordance to its duty: to defend the  honesty of the institutions and judicial authorities."  Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana has made this statement  as he expressed his support for the Colombian response to the 18  April U.S. letter questioning Prosecutor General Gustavo de  Greiff's attitude.    Pastrana said: "It is worrisome that as policies of  submission are enforced, certain self-confessed criminals  tarnish the names of other parties and even the image of an  entire country so as to have their sentences reduced for  allegedly collaborating with authorities."    Pastrana also urged the two governments to reestablish the  lines of communication, to normalize bilateral relations, and to  reactivate the mechanisms of judicial collaboration to fight  international drug trafficking.    Meanwhile, Pastrana reiterated his opposition to the  legalization of drugs, saying: "Should Senator Kerry or any  other U.S. authority have substantial information that will  contribute to preventing drug trafficking from interfering with  Colombian politics, he must say so immediately by providing the  details he knows."</p>

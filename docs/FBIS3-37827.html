This was announced  today at a news conference by Baiba Petersone, deputy chairman  of the LNNK board.    The Union of National Forces calls on the Latvian government  delegation, the Saeima, and the state president not to accept a  treaty with Russia if it even partly legitimizes Russia's  military presence in Latvia. Otherwise, the statement says, the  Union of National Forces envisages using the forms of direct  democracy and the experience of non-violent resistance until the  full withdrawal of a foreign country's troops.</p>

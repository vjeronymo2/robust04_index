			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CENTRO  </P> <P> About two dozen Salvadorans awaiting deportation at the El Centro detention  center staged a short-lived hunger strike to urge immigration officials to send  them home, Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The detainees, who officials said were all convicted felons, stopped eating  their meals Tuesday afternoon, INS spokesman Rudy Murillo said. But most of  them ended the strike Wednesday night after authorities agreed to book them  flights to San Salvador on a Salvadoran airline.  </P> <P> American air carriers, which normally transport deportees for the INS, stopped  flying into San Salvador after recent heavy fighting closed the airport.  </P> <P> Two of the hunger strikers wanted to stay in the United States, and had applied  for political asylum, but both were rejected. All of the detainees will be  flown to El Salvador by Friday, Murillo said.  </P></p>

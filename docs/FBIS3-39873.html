			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Andreas </F> Unterberger; place and date not given: "`Somebody Will Always  Have To Work for Europe'"]    [Text] [Unterberger] What is the absolute condition  without which Austria cannot join the European Union [EU]?    [Mock] Things like the agricultural quota and reference  quantities, price adjustments, transition periods, farmers in  mountainous regions. Something will certainly have to be done  in these fields.    [Unterberger] Will you resign if the negotiations fail or  the referendum produces a negative result?    [Mock] I will resign if I make a serious mistake, if I come  into conflict with legal rules, or if I do something that is  against the interests of the Republic. But as long as I have  the opportunity to work for the idea of Europe, I will do  everything I can to implement the idea.    [Unterberger] But in the event of a no in the referendum,  this opportunity will no longer be there.    [Mock] Still, there will be some people who will continue to  work for the idea. It is right that those who think there will  be another chance to join the EU in a year's time are taking a  very unlikely position. The fact is that such a chance will not  be there for the next five to 20 years.    Two or three years ago saw the beginning of a period in  which  the climate for European integration seems to have worsened.  You can see this in France, Germany, England. The disappearing  of the danger from the East seems to have resulted in a  resurgence of nationalism. This means that the chance of 1996  seeing a deepening of Europe is slim. Then those who take  integration seriously, such as the Benelux countries, will say:  We cannot force a deepening, but we can prevent a widening.  Those that are outside then will have to wait until the former  communist countries are accepted as well.    [Unterberger] How do you explain to the average Austrian why  Austria should join the EU?    [Mock] First, because integration is the first practical  experience of a peace construction in Europe that stands a  chance of becoming reality if it is practiced by one or two  generations -- everybody should remember their own family's fate  during World War II.    Second, because it provides a higher degree of security --  one can see what happens from Zhirinovskiy to the Balkans.    And third, because Austria should be able to have an equal  say in this unique construction. I do not want to have a  second-class country. I want equal opportunities for the  country, security for the country, and peace for Europe.    [Unterberger] Economic arguments are less important?    [Mock] They are very important, but they take second place.    [Unterberger] Following the events of the past few weeks,  will the federal president still be playing the same role in  European integration as he did in the past?    [Mock] I think that he has kept his political weight, which  is based on his experience and his political talent, even if  some people criticize the tragic development of events. But the  majority of Austrians can distinguish between the president's  private problems and his political activities.    [Unterberger] How deep is the rift between you and Vice  Chancellor Busek? He no longer seems to believe that the EU  negotiations will be completed by the end of March; he has  suggested establishing a Ministry for European Affairs; there  were similar differences of opinion during the days of the  crisis around the president and on the position toward the  Freedom Party [FPOe].    [Mock] For my part the relationship is tension free. But  there is certainly a political difference: I have always been  opposed to excluding the FPOe. As long as a member of the  opposition plays by the rules of democracy -- with however much  demagogy -- he has a right to be treated as a democrat.    This is an old Socialist trick: If the Freedom Party  cooperates with us, they are old Nazis; if, however, they  cooperate with the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe],  they are converted democrats. I do not really blame them for  playing this trick, because politics is a bit primitive. It is  when I let myself be conned that I am annoyed. But still, I  formed this grand coalition, and I think that it has addressed  many fundamental matters over the past two years:  privatization, reform of the railroads, tax reform. This  justifies its existence.    [Unterberger] You are sometimes said to be aiming higher,  such as the office of federal president.    [Mock] There is no truth in these speculations. I was  repeatedly asked that question before the last elections, and I  always said no.    [Unterberger] There are fresh discussions about arms exports  to Saudi Arabia.    [Mock] It is not so much a matter of arms deals as a matter  of no longer rating the country as a tension zone. The  situation was judged differently within the government a year  and a half ago. This has now been brought up again by the Saudis.    [Unterberger] Is it not also a matter of human rights?    [Mock] There are two issues involved: a tension zone and  human rights. The situation of human rights has always been the  same there; it is an authoritarian-feudal state. I am having  all this examined now. I think, however, that the tensions have  been decreased since Iraq has been keeping to the rules of the  UN Security Council and since the agreement between 'Arafat and  Israel has come into existence.</p>

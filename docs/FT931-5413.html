			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (2): Triumph for design-and-build - The method used to build Terminal 2 IN SPITE of its size and complexity, Manchester Airport's Terminal 2 was not only completed on time, but sufficiently under budget for two optional extras to be added at no extra cost - a new short-term car park and a steel and glass canopy along the length of the terminal's set-down area. The outcome is being seen as a vindication of design-and-build management techniques. Increasingly, these are challenging the traditional way in which large construction projects have been run in Europe - and in Britain in particular. Traditionally, buildings are designed by architects for clients and built by contractors. There is clear demarcation of functions and responsibility, with many potential areas where communications can break down. Design-and-build puts all three parties - designers, client and contractors  -into a single, interacting team. In this case the architects were Scott Brownrigg &amp; Turner, the client was the airport and the contractors were managed by Amec. Once broad specifications have been agreed, construction can begin before detailed design is completed. As building progresses, practical factors concerning how best to do the various jobs involved can be fed back to the designers. Designs can therefore be improved as the job proceeds. If the technology of some particular equipment is in a state of flux, plans can be varied to ensure only the very latest is incorporated. Terminal 2's baggage handling systems were a case in point. Above all, however, design-and-build means that costs can be controlled on a day-to-day basis. In this case, Amec, the civil engineering and construction group headed by Sir Alan Cockshaw, was in charge, managing the project for Manchester Airport, which was always closely involved in design and specification. Amec was not allowed to use its own contracting subsidiaries on the work, thus leaving the company free to concentrate on managing the project without any risk of conflict of interest. The triumph involved in keeping such a complicated undertaking to time and under budget is therefore Amec's. The company already had a good name for reconstructing Terminal 3 at London Heathrow. Sir Alan now hopes the Manchester showpiece will lead to much more airport business for the group worldwide. Mr Howard Shiplee, Amec's man responsible on the ground, had 110 colleagues from the group to help him manage a total site workforce of about 1,500 people employed by 130 contractors. He reckons three times that number were engaged off-site in prefabrication of things such as steelwork and components of all sizes - from heating and ventilating plant to hundreds of thousands of square metres of carpet. 'Our job was to procure, organise and control those 130 contractors in every respect. We are very pleased that only three have gone down in the recession. 'The reason is we worked hard in selecting them, making sure we had the right price, the right programme, the right value for money and the right people. 'We interviewed about 700 companies. We met the directors, the people who were going to actually do the job and went deeply into everything. All this has paid dividends,' Mr Shiplee added. Design-and-build meant that the shell of the building was built long before the interior was designed. Sir Alan says: 'What people don't realise about a modern airport terminal building is that it isn't really a building. 'Only 20 per cent of the cost is in the building. The real money - and what makes the place work - is in the sophisticated information systems, security systems, heating, ventilating, all the mechanical and electrical engineering that goes into these things.' An example of design-and-build at work was the method of attaching tens of thousands of wall panels, which the contractors worked out could be done at a third of the cost by changing the design. 'It's saving on lots of small things like this that brings you in under budget in the end,' Sir Alan adds. The management process itself becomes complex, however, as the project almost assumes a life of its own, as Mr Shiplee points out. 'The design team undertook the overall design, but much detail was done by our contractors,' he says. 'To put that into context, we have had more than 750,000 drawings in circulation over the last four years. One of the biggest challenges has been to control the paper and the logistics. All our planning has been computer-based.' But he never underestimates the human factor. 'At the end of the day, you still get down to the guys doing the job on site. We have been very fortunate here because very many of them are going to use this terminal as passengers. 'This has made a difference to attitudes. They are very proud of their work and want to feel people will appreciate the quality. They will show their kids what they did when they pass through the terminal on their holidays. They will have a right to feel very pleased with themselves,' Mr Shiplee adds. Sir Alan is also pleased that most of 130 contractors were based in the UK and most from north-west England. 'It's a tremendous advertisement for what the north can do for itself,' he says. Tenders were open to all-comers and some were won by overseas companies, but there was no sudden lurch in the UK's negative trade balances because someone specified a fancy type of cladding that could only be bought abroad. Sir Alan says: 'We have had no major hitches. There have been arguments, as with any project, but everyone has worked to common objectives. I see Terminal 2 as a tremendous advertisement for UK plc and the north-west in particular. It reflects well on everyone who has had anything to do with it.' His unstinting praise, however, goes to Amec's client, Manchester Airport. 'The vision of the airport, for having the guts to commit to the terminal when times were not good, can only be admired. At a time when everyone was switching capital expenditure off, these fellows were saying go, go. 'We have come in within budget and we handed over the building four years to the day after we started on it, as we contracted to do. We have shown what can be done. 'What people are increasingly realising is that you can't separate the design and construction processes. If you want the most cost-effective and time-effective high quality product, you have got to get the designers and constructors working closer together. That's the way you save time and money.' Terminal 2 is now likely to be Amec's testimonial when it bids for other airport contracts around the world. Sir Alan hopes to be able to take a lot of UK contractors with him.</p>

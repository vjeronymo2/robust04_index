			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: IBM and Apple offer cheaper ranges of personal computers INTERNATIONAL Business Machines and Apple Computer are launching inexpensive personal computers aimed at individual and small business buyers in an effort to reclaim ground lost to 'clones'. IBM made the first move with the introduction this week of 21 models incorporating different combinations of standard hardware and popular software. All are expected to sell in the US for under Dollars 2500 (Pounds 1250). Apple will follow next week with the announcement of long anticipated 'consumer' versions of its Macintosh personal computer, with prices expected to start at under Dollars 1000. Slow growth in the corporate PC market has forced the companies to target PC buyers who pay out of their own pockets including home office professionals and small business proprietors. The PC makers are broadening their distribution channels to include more retailers to reach these customers. IBM is also expected to follow Compaq Computer by adopting the 'direct' sales approach , by phone and mail. Smaller manufacturers such as Dell Computer have found this method successful. IBM's new PS/1 desktop models and PS/note portables are the first to come from the its newly autonomous PC division, announced last week, called the IBM Personal Computer Company. The new PS/1s are grouped into three areas aimed at different types of users. This is in line with the increasing segmentation of the PC market. IBM's Essential line is aimed at the person who buys for a small business. It will be sold in the US through office warehouse stores that sell a range of office supplies at discount prices. The PS/1 Expert line is for the more sophisticated buyer who may already own a PC. It will make its debut in the special superstores selling computer equipment and accessories. The PS/1 Consultant line, for people who work at home, will be sold in department stores such as Sears and Montgomery Ward. IBM's expansion into retail distribution follows a similar move this week by Compaq Computer, which announced that its budget-priced computers, introduced in June, will be available in US superstore chains. Similarly, Apple Computer is renewing its efforts in the retail channel. For IBM, the PS/1s are the first step in an overhaul of its PC products. Later this month it will unveil new Premium systems, updating its current PS/2 product line for corporate customers. Also planned is a Value Point line of PCs to be sold through direct mail as well as an expanded line of portable computers. IBM's competitors, however, are not standing still. Dell Computer plans to expand its mail order services to include a broad range of products from other manufacturers. Everex Computer, another US PC maker, in a move that indicates that the PC price war is far from over, slashed its prices this week by up to 50 per cent on some models.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Frankfurt (DPA)--The navigational system PRARE  (Precise Range and Rate Equipment), which makes it possible to  measure the earth with centimeter accuracy, has been introduced  at the Geo-Research Center (GFZ) in Potsdam. A German computer  is working with PRARE together with a laser situated on board  the Russian satellite Meteor 3. Among other things, it can make  an exact determination of continental drift, of the "tides" of  the earth as a solid body, and of earth's gravitational field.  The data is evaluated at the GFZ and also yield the flight path  of the satellite with an accuracy of within 10 to 20 centimeters.    It is reported that PRARE has several advantages in  comparison to other laser systems: it operates in all weathers,  by night as well as by day, with approximately equal accuracy.  Data is stored in the satellite and transmitted to the GFZ field  office in Oberpfaffenhofen on every pass.    This earth-measuring project is the result of close  cooperation between the German and Russian partners. On the  German side, participants include the GFZ, the German Agency for  Air and Space Affairs (DARA) and Stuttgart University. The  satellite was manufactured in Russia by the Research Institute  for Electro-Mechanics in Istra (Moscow district), while the  flight is monitored by mission control centers in Kaliningrad.</p>

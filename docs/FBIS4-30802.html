			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 27 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the Srpska republic's national assembly, said that  the participants in the Talloires meeting examined the positions  and stands of the sides in the Bosnian conflict and noted the  problems, that opinions were exchanged, and that "the complete  material will nevertheless, be reviewed at the conference on  former Yugoslavia, also attended by cochairmen Owen and  Stoltenberg."    Summing up the two-day talks in Talloires at this evening's  news conference for domestic reporters, Krajisnik also said: "We  specifically discussed western and eastern Bosnia and the  Posavina issue, and we elaborated on the vital importance of  these regions for the Serb population in Bosnia."    "The fact that the Muslims want to acquire huge chunks of  western Bosnia and the entire Posavina region remains a bone of  contention. They want to include the Sanski Most, Prijedor,  Kljuc, Doboj, Brcko, Zvornik, and Visegrad areas in the  so-called gray zone that will be undefined and whose status will  be resolved sometime in the future," Krajisnik said, and added:  "We objected that sheer quantity meant nothing and that 1  percent of Tuzla or Sarajevo was worth more than 3 percent of  some other territory. There were no definitive conclusions, so  the Contact Group will have a hard time finding adequate  solutions," he believes.    Krajisnik believes that the most important effect of the  negotiations was produced by the Contact Group's genuine desire  to broker a lasting cessation of hostilities, although he voiced  his skepticism regarding the finding of a political solution by  the present participants represented in the Contact Group.    "We were informed that the Muslim delegation was rejecting  all offers, demanding a large percentage of the territory, and  constantly laying claims to the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  which only makes chances for a peaceful resolution more remote,"  Krajisnik said.    "We clearly said and explained that we had vital interests  in  the regions of eastern Bosnia, Posavina, and parts of Sarajevo  and I think that our position was fully appreciated, so I could  say that the Talloires meeting was successful, because we also  had a series of individual meetings with members of the Contact  Group," Krajisnik said.    "The Contact Group members did not bring a map to the  meeting, so we worked on territorial issues in segments,  although the Muslim demands were perfectly clear to us. I do  not know whether any solutions will be imposed, but we  unambiguously made it known that we will not accept any imposed  solutions. It should be determined in the case of disputed  territories whose interests are greater in relation to the  disputed territory," Krajisnik said, stressing that no pressure  had been exerted on the Serb delegation this time.    The Srpska republic's national assembly president underlined  that the Serb delegation had informed the Contact group about  the current Muslim offensive, emphasizing that the Muslim side  was warned that the Serbs will defend themselves and respond to  attacks by launching counteroffensives, but the lasting  orientation of the Bosnian Serbs was the establishment of a  cessation of hostilities.    "The international community, however, is not unanimous in  the desire to stop the conflict in former Bosnia-Herzegovina,"  Krajisnik said. ``They forced themselves into adopting a  unified stand, but this has already proved to be a sham because  certain important factors are not in favor of the peace option,  although there are countries strongly advocating an end to the  war. The Muslims are exploiting this, they are behaving  arrogantly, completely unrealistically, and they are resorting  to blackmail as if the entire international community was on  their side.    "My impression is that the Muslims do not want the war to  end, which could certainly result in an escalation of the  conflict," Momcilo Krajisnik concluded at this evening's news  conference for domestic reporters.</p>

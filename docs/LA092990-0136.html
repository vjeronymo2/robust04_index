			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EGGPLANT PICKS FIRM GROUND;  </P> <P> REVIEW: DESPITE THE STARS ON THEIR ALBUM, MEMBERS OF THE BAND DECIDE TO STAY  TRUE TO THEIR NAMESAKE.  </P> <P> Could it be that Eggplant -- a rock band whose collective personality is as  quiet, unassuming and unflamboyant as its vegetative namesake -- is starting to  see stars?  </P> <P> Not quite. It's true that stars appear all over the front and back covers of  the Huntington Beach band's new album, "Sad Astrology." But they shine with a  wry twinkle: The front cover looks like a still from "The Jetsons," and the  back-cover painting illustrates the calamity that would ensue if every phony  romantic pledge to love somebody "till the stars fall from the sky" were, up in  the heavens, to be taken literally.  </P> <P> Here on earth, Eggplant's members shrug at the idea of projecting themselves  into the pop firmament. Aside from drummer Dave Tabone, who is the somewhat  rambunctious contrarian of the band, bassist John Kelly and  singer-songwriter-guitarists Jeff Beals and Jon Melkerson are some of the  quietest, humblest, least presumptuous people ever to strap on an instrument  and plug it into an amplifier.  </P> <P> While other bands in Eggplant's alternative-rock, college radio-oriented  bailiwick tend to mock the conventions of pop stardom, they still try to  cultivate some sort of image, usually as anti-stars. Eggplant's members come  off as pleasant but retiring innocents, possessed of a quirky sense of humor,  and passive in the face of the demanding pop career-ladder that others climb  with all limbs flailing.  </P> <P> The thing is, most of those climbers probably would give a limb or two to make  an album as strong as "Sad Astrology." Coming after "Monkeybars," the  rough-hewn but vibrant debut album the band released last year, "Sad Astrology"  signals that Eggplant, humble or not, is a genuine alternative rock contender.  (Review, F4)  </P> <P> The question is whether Eggplant will be able to do the sorts of things that  potential contenders do to pull themselves up that ladder to greater  visibility. Gathered over pizza last week at an Italian restaurant in  Huntington Beach (nobody would order the eggplant, a dish that none of the four  members ever touches -- "A handful of dirt would be better. It's good to  throw," pronounced Tabone -- the band members were keeping their expectations  low.  </P> <P> Successful alternative rock bands usually build an audience via incessant  touring. That isn't in the cards for Eggplant, whose members either don't want  to quit steady jobs or, in Beals' case, can't even think of quitting because he  has two children to support, a newborn daughter and a 2-year-old son he named  after the whimsical rock hero, Jonathan Richman.  </P> <P> "If the record does really well, we'll consider touring, but right now it's not  feasible," said Beals, at 27 the oldest member of Eggplant. "It doesn't matter  whether you tour unless your record's a higher-profile record."  </P> <P> Limited touring in California and the Southwest after the release of  "Monkeybars" didn't make much difference in spurring album sales, Beals said,  and he doesn't expect it would have an impact on the new album, either --  although a fall tour of California and the Northwest is in the works.  </P> <P> "We were totally unknown. Now we're just partially unknown," Beals said.  </P> <P> "A lot of people who (tour extensively) have this unrealistic thing about  stardom," said Melkerson, whose almost diffident manner contrasts with his  striking ability as a guitarist and songwriter. "You have to be realistic."  </P> <P> It isn't that Eggplant doesn't want to be well-known, Beals said. That desire  "is there, but it's just so rare to be able to do that. For the amount of bands  out there, you're foolish to ever think you're going to be a star. You might as  well expect the least and have fun with it."  </P> <P> The dissenting voice is Tabone, the only compactly built member in a band of  6-footers. "I don't want to be greedy about it, but I want more," he said,  adding that he'd be delighted to go on tour for months on end. "I just want it  all."  </P> <P> "That's why he drums so hard-core," Melkerson noted with a smile.  </P> <P> It's hardly a surprise that the question of how avidly one should pursue a  dream, or any course of action, crops up often in Eggplant's songs. Beals'  humorous but wistful "If You See the Real World Coming" laments how hostile  real life is toward our dreams.  </P> <P> The real world is for the sad, sad people who gave up their dream long ago,  </P> <P>  Who once wanted something, but now go to work  </P> <P>  'Cause they ran out of places to go.  </P> <P> In such Melkerson songs as "Confidant" (a more polished version of the ballad  that graced "Monkeybars") and "Animal Song," there are recurring references to  a struggle to overcome inertia and gain the confidence or determination to act.  </P> <P> "I want to take a step, but I don't want to fall," Melkerson intones on "Animal  Song," a fine parable that seems to be about the importance of acting in the  face of doubts about one's own adequacy.  </P> <P> "I couldn't tell you what it was about," said Melkerson, who says his lyrical  method is to tuck away images and phrases that he runs into by accident, then  weave them into songs. "But there's enough information there for somebody to  get a mood out of it, or draw some conclusion. Subconsciously, I probably  inflict my own ideas on it, even though I'm trying to stay a distance from it."  </P> <P> Melkerson said he always thought his songwriting method was strange, and maybe  just plain incorrect. When he recently took a songwriting class at Golden West  College, he was happy to learn that it's a recommended practice to filter odd  fragments and chance encounters into songs.  </P> <P> Beals' material tends to be more whimsical, with easier-to-follow story lines.  But he, too, mines his encounters with the real world. "The Wild Ones (Cycle on  the Lawn)" began in Laguna Beach traffic where Beals glimpsed an  androgynous-looking couple on a beat up Harley-Davidson. Using Ray Davies'  quirky but respectful character sketches as a model, Beals translated that into  his song's strange but warm, sweet tale of a butch biker girl and a  cross-dressing boy who fall deeply in love.  </P> <P> After spending all of $800 on their do-it-yourself debut album, Eggplant had  about 10 times that budget to record "Sad Astrology." For the first time, they  worked with a producer, Russ Tolman, instead of just plugging their instruments  in, setting the dials and letting fly.  </P> <P> "He came up with a lot of ideas we wouldn't have thought of, to keep the record  interesting," said a typically modest Melkerson.  </P> <P> Beals said that in the early stages of recording, "I was totally worried" that  Eggplant would emerge with a too-glossy package. "The process of recording it  seemed so structured, I thought it was going to take away all our originality.  But the last few days in the studio, as the songs were being finished, it began  to sound the way we play live."  </P> <P> Melkerson permitted himself just a bit of well-justified, though quietly  stated, self-congratulation. "In the end," he said, "I don't think we could  have made a better record."  </P> <P> Eggplant plays a free concert Sunday at 4 p.m. at the Balboa Pier gazebo on  Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach. The band also will play at a record release  party Wednesday at 9 p.m. at Club Lingerie, 6507 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood.

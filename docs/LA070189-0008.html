			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN DREAMERS GROW OLD;  </P> <P> LOST CAUSES OF YOUTH ARE CYCLICAL IN MODERN CHINA  </P> <P> "When I was young I, too, had many dreams." This confession of despair by Lu  Xun, China's foremost 20th-Century author, could speak for countless Chinese in  this tragic century. The Beijing massacre is simply the latest brutal death of  a youthful dream. It is the death not only of the specific dream of "democracy  and freedom" but, for many, of the possibility for dreams. One of the tragic  patterns of 20th-Century China is the recurring nightmare of hope dashed to  despair, of dreams shattered by violence and repression.  </P> <P> The dream of national wealth and power in the first year of the century seemed  to be realized by the revolution in 1911, which overthrew the Manchu monarchy  and established a republic. Instrumental in the revolution were students  returning from study in Japan where they had drunk the heady wine of modern  progress and nationalism and seen the fruits of the Meiji restoration. But the  promise of the revolution was snuffed out by the authoritarian leadership of  President Yuan Shih-kai and, after his death in 1916, by the dismal plunge into  warlordism.  </P> <P> The twin dreams of the May 4 Movement in the late 1910s and early '20s  similarly failed to come to fruition. One goal was to attain greater individual  freedom from traditional social and political structures. That was, however,  swallowed up in the repressive statism and reactionary traditionalism of Chiang  Kai-shek's Nationalist government. The second dream was to build a nation freed  from imperialist control and operating through self-determination. That hope  faded in the face of Japan's military campaigns and control of much of China in  the 1930s and '40s.  </P> <P> In both efforts it was China's young people who were in the forefront, who bore  the brunt of repression in pre-dawn raids on universities by government police  and of violence and death engineered by the state.  </P> <P> The Communist victory and the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949  brought the reality of a nation freed from the depredations of outsiders. With  it came the hope of a new China, energized by a popular will, modernized and  ready to take its place in the international community. But the initial  economic success was buried in the calamitous Great Leap Forward (1958-59), and  the dream of a more open and tolerant system suggested in Mao's Hundred Flowers  Movement was destroyed in the ferocity of the anti-rightist campaign of 1957.  The insanity of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) came when Mao tried to infuse  the youth of the 1960s with his own utopian revolutionary dream.  </P> <P> Now, once again, the hopes of China's young, symbolized by the Goddess of  Democracy, are being destroyed by old men who once had their own dreams of  change. It is a tragically ironic pattern repeated with depressing consistency.  Many of the revolutionaries of 1911 became conservative statists and paranoid  preservers of their own power in the '20s and '30s. Many of the revolutionaries  of the May 4, Long March and Yenan periods have become the inflexible old guard  of 1989, fearful of losing control, unwilling to admit that the dreams of their  youth no longer match reality.  </P> <P> If the repeating cycles of hope and despair continue, then we may expect that  hope will again revive, that dreams will again flourish. What is not hopeful is  that China has not been able to break out of this self-destructive pattern in  order to achieve long-term stability through an equilibrium between state power  and popular will.  </P> <P> The unanswerable question now is what sort of reaction there will be among the  Chinese people to the dashed dream of the students and their intellectual and  proletarian comrades for a more open political system. Many in the vast country  will likely never learn of the actual events of June 4. Among the peasants, the  majority may well share the spirit of the Beijing-area farmer whose only  complaint was that the demonstrations and martial law prevented him from  selling his melons.  </P> <P> What is crucial to the country's future is the response of those in China's  cities and elsewhere who have been engaged by the recent demonstrations and the  Tian An Men assault. Will they respond to repression with a cowed sense of  frustration and futility, submitting to the forces in charge, like Lu Xun's  erstwhile revolutionary character, who for his survival resignedly and  hopelessly returned to teaching the discredited classics? Or will a massive  purge of the intelligentsia bring a rapid rebirth of anti-government activity,  perhaps marked by violence instead of peaceful protest?  </P> <P> For now, Lu Xun's own prescription sums up the situation: "Hope cannot be said  to exist nor can it be said not to exist." The open expression of the dreams  for basic change may be long in reappearing. But the willful efforts of many  will almost certainly once again make the dream alive. Lu continues: "(Hope) is  just like roads across the Earth. For actually the Earth had no roads to begin  with, but when many men pass one way, a road is made."  </P> <P> The young will again make a road, will again dream their dreams. But when will  those dreams stop turning to nightmares and awake finally to a new reality?  </P></p>

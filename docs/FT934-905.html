			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Abolishing the gas monopoly The British government yesterday took an important step towards introducing greater competition in the gas industry. The decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to abolish British Gas's monopoly to supply domestic customers over two years from 1996 should, in time, deliver substantial benefits. For customers, there is a prospect of lower prices, more choice and better service. Meanwhile, the pressures of competition will give British Gas a spur to turn itself into a more dynamic and efficient company - building on the success already achieved since its privatisation in 1986. Mr Heseltine's other principal decision was to reject a recommendation from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that British Gas should be forced to divest its trading business from its pipeline operations. The commission felt there was an inherent conflict of interest between British Gas competing in the trading business while owning the pipelines that its rivals needed to use. The failure to break the company up is regrettable, but not disastrous. The prospects for fair and effective competition would have been enhanced by a total separation of the two businesses. On the other hand, the plan to put a reinforced 'Chinese wall' between the two units should achieve many of the benefits of break-up without some of the disruption. The snag is that it will also require extra regulatory oversight to ensure that the Chinese walls are not porous. While perhaps not ideal, Mr Heseltine's decision at least has the virtue of pragmatism. Apart from the commission, few were clamouring for a break-up. The irony is that British Gas, which was initially hostile to the idea, eventually came to see that a break-up could boost shareholder value. Its board of directors could still take that step voluntarily. Much work remains to be done to turn the government's vision of a competitive gas market into reality. That task largely falls to Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the new director-general of gas supply. In particular, she will need to determine how much competitors will have to pay to get access to British Gas's pipelines and what obligations they will have to fulfil. Though the level of access charges will to a large extent determine the size both of gas bills and of the dividends enjoyed by British Gas's shareholders, fixing them should not be too tricky. The monopolies commission's recommendations on what constitutes a reasonable rate of return will provide a useful starting point. Fixing obligations for new competitors could be more controversial. On the one hand, ministers do not feel confident enough to allow a complete free-for-all. They fear that the poor, the elderly and other groups of consumers - who are currently protected by a requirement on British Gas to supply all on non-discriminatory terms - might prove unattractive to suppliers in a free market. On the other hand, ministers think it would be wrong to maintain obligations on British Gas, while allowing competitors to 'cherry-pick' the most attractive customers. The challenge for Ms Spottiswoode is to resolve this conflict while avoiding the heavy-handed regulation that would stifle the growth of competition.</p>

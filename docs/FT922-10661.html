			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Letter: When aid acts as a deterrent to foreign investment Sir, I read with great interest your survey 'Latin American Finance and Investment' (April 6). I would like to see a similar survey on how foreign aid interacts with financial change in Latin America. In small countries like Guatemala, the amount of hard currency dumped on the economy, through an array of foreign-aid programmes, sometimes exceeds 10 per cent of public spending. Many authors have denounced the high levels of waste and corruption associated with foreign-aid grants. However, little has been said on how foreign aid distorts the exchange rate in the recipient countries. I contend that foreign aid creates an exchange rate equilibrium through which the value of the local currency increases vis-a-vis the US dollar (one dollar buys less local currency units). This reduces the incentive for private capital inflow and therefore the greater the amounts of foreign aid as a percentage of GDP, the smaller the amounts of private foreign capital that flow into the country. It is interesting to note that the countries in Latin America which are attracting greater amounts of private capital are the ones that have received relatively small amounts of foreign-aid dollars as a percentage of their GDP. Perhaps Guatemala, El Salvador, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic and other small Latin American countries would do better in the 21st century if Africa became the sole target for the charitable sentiments of rich foreign governments.

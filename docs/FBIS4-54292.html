			<p>CSO     [Text] NEC will boost the sales amount of semiconductors  for fiscal 1994 in Southeast Asia to 110 billion yen, a 22  percent increase over the previous year. It is to deal  aggressively with rapidly increasing demand due to the  production shift by home electronics manufacturers and others,  and in addition to expanding the production volume of their  Singapore and Malaysian subsidiaries, they will also increase  exports from Japan. With the high yen in the background,  semiconductor costs are ballooning in the Southeast Asian  market, but it seems that domestic manufacturers are  intensifying a battle for market share, with the same area as  the stage, due to the largest manufacturer NEC working out  measures to strengthen sales.    Along with this sales plan, the company will boost monthly  production in Singapore for 4-megabyte DRAM [dynamic  random-access memory] (dynamic read and write memory necessary  for memory storage operations) and microcomputer ASIC  (application-specific integrated circuits) from 78 million in  the previous fiscal year to 80 million units.    Moreover, they also will expand monthly production for  transistors that are being produced in Malaysia from 2.52  billion in the previous fiscal year to 2.82 billion units in  fiscal year 1994. In either case, they anticipate use for  equipment for the general public produced by home electronics  manufacturers, etc., in Southeast Asia. However, they will  handle it by improving the yield rate at both plants, and the  policy is not to carry out new facilities investment.    NEC is undertaking provision of a semiconductor business  system in Southeast Asia such as establishment of a sales  company in Singapore.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME TIPS FOR THE TRAVELING FAMILY  </P> <P> Some family traveling tips from the Automobile Assn. of America:  </P> <P> Suggested budget for a family of four -- two adults and two children -- is $168  a day for lodging and meals, plus $8 per 100 miles for gas, oil, tires and  maintenance (with a car averaging 23 miles a gallon).  </P> <P> The average cost for lodging is $78 a night, based on the rates charged by  approved accommodations listed in AAA TourBooks. This rate includes $5 nightly  per child. However, if children are within an age limit set by the management,  usually up to 14, there may not be an extra charge.  </P> <P> Families traveling in Southern California probably will spend a little more  than the national average, according to AAA figures. The average cost of  lodging will be $10 to $15 more and gas prices probably will be about $5 more.  This adds up to an average daily cost of $188 for a family of four traveling in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Vacation spending depends on a family's preferences and means, but costs vary  by area. Higher rates can be expected in large metropolitan areas and at  resorts in season.  </P></p>

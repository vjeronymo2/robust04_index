The organizations, which include Care  International and Medecins Sans Frontieres [Doctors Without  Borders], have evacuated 14 of their workers. Menongue, which  is government-controlled, has been under siege by the UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels for  more than one year. They control most of the surrounding  countryside. The attacks were largely ineffective, but  intensified at the end of last week.</p>

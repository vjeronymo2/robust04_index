			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHELDON TAKES OVER AS MAYOR  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach got a new mayor this week, as City Councilman Chuck Sheldon took  the gavel for a nine-month stint in the largely ceremonial post.  </P> <P> Sheldon, who has been a councilman for three years, was next in line for the  rotating position, which until Tuesday was held by his fellow council member,  Roger Creighton.  </P> <P> Congratulating Creighton for for having "conducted himself as mayor with  tremendous eclat," Sheldon promised to keep the interests of the city as a  whole in mind.  </P> <P> In an interview later, Sheldon also said he will stress "manners" during his  mayoral stint. In the past, residents at odds with the council on various  issues have accused council members of contentiousness and rudeness and have  complained that the council discourages public input by limiting time at the  podium.  </P> <P> "I will have no place in my administration for disorderly conduct and poor  manners," Sheldon said. "There's a gracious way to move meetings along such  that you don't aggravate heated situations and stimulate negative comment."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS;  </P> <P> LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION EXAMINES DFG'S EFFECTIVENESS  </P> <P> California's Little Hoover Commission, which monitors the efficiency of the  state's governmental agencies, is examining the performance of the Department  of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> The investigation, which was requested by a Northern California Assemblyman  Stan Statham (R-Oak Run), started Monday at a hearing in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> DFG Director Pete Bontadelli, recovering from a back injury, was unable to  attend, and his assistant, Paul Jensen, represented the department. Harold  Cribbs, executive secretary of the DFG Commission, represented his group, which  is appointed by the governor to set DFG policy.  </P> <P> Hoover Commission Chairman Nathan Shapell said he wants DFG Commission  President Bob Bryant of Yuba City to testify at the next hearing June 27 in  Sacramento.  </P> <P> "We will send him a very nice letter," Shapell said. "We do not like to issue  subpoenas."  </P> <P> During Monday's session, the Hoover panel was primarily interested in how the  DFG deals with commercial developments that it perceives to affect fish and  wildlife. The first witness was housing developer Devere Anderson, who  complained that "in recent years . . . there's been a dramatic change in  policies and procedures of Fish and Game, and it seems as though there's been a  new-found power that they're exerting to accomplish their goals and objectives.  And I think that's what is causing some problems."  </P> <P> But the probing quickly turned to how the Fish and Game Commission, which sets  DFG policy, correlates with the department, which implements policy.  </P> <P> Vice Chairman Haig Mardikian said he found it strange that Bontadelli's job is  to follow the lead of a commission that has no power to fire him. The DFG  director is appointed by the governor, as are the commissioners.  </P> <P> The Hoover members were suspicious that the commission, rather than determining  policy, merely reacted to department recommendations. Mary Ann Chalker  challenged Cribbs' testimony that the commission, with seven full-time  employees, is able to monitor the 1,568 DFG employees around the state.  </P> <P> Asked about the commission's budget, Cribbs speculated that it was about  $200,000 a year. Jeannine English, executive director of the Hoover panel, told  Cribbs that it was $429,000, according to her information. Cribbs didn't  dispute the figure.  </P> <P> Albert Gersten told Cribbs: "You say that on a day-to-day basis you keep track  of all correspondence and what's going on in the state, yet you don't know your  own budget."  </P> <P> The June 27 hearing will primarily focus on sportsmen's issues. The Hoover  panel will then issue its report and recommendations to Gov. George Deukmejian  and the state legislature.  </P> <P> Frank LoPreste couldn't find any yellowfin tuna to speak of at Clipperton  Island off Costa Rica, and he met with only marginal success at the  Revillagigedo Islands off mainland Mexico.  </P> <P> But two Orange County couples, fishing just off the coast of Mexico's  Zihuatanejo, had little trouble locating the big yellowfins so popular among  long-range fishermen.  </P> <P> "We caught six over a hundred pounds," said Linda Knowles of Costa Mesa, adding  that 26 fish were caught throughout last week.  </P> <P> The biggest was a 187-pound yellowfin taken last Saturday after just an hour's  boat ride. The smallest fish were in the 40-pound class.  </P> <P> LoPreste, meanwhile, on a 23-day trip aboard his Royal Polaris, found  conditions at Clipperton to be "tough, tough, tough, with few fish and several  sharks," according to a report he made to a fishing information telephone line.  </P> <P> Conditions weren't much better at the Revillagigedos, where his passengers will  wind up what so far has been a less-than-memorable trip.  </P> <P> The State Fish and Game Commission recently adopted the 1989 hunting  regulations and license forms should be available by June 1.  </P> <P> New hunts include:  </P> <P>  -- The Camp Roberts antlerless deer hunt in Monterey County (Zone S-5, Aug.  28-Sept. 4).  </P> <P>  -- Camp Pendleton either-sex deer hunt in San Diego County (S-10, Aug. 5-Sept.  24).  </P> <P>  -- Santa Catalina Island either-sex deer hunt (S-29, Oct. 14-Jan. 31).  </P> <P> Changes in deer hunting regulations are few and indicated in the 1989  California Hunting Regulations, also due by June.  </P> <P> Citing concerns about the condition of pronghorn antelope herds, the number of  tags has been cut from 645 to 355 and doe permits from 100 to 50.  </P> <P> Tule elk hunts, canceled by court order last year, will offer 40 permits for  Bishop, 40 for Lone Pine and 15 for Cache Creek.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> The American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists and Cabrillo Marine  Museum are sponsoring a halibut symposium -- convened by the Department of Fish  and Game -- to gather information on the species May 23-24 at the Cabrillo  museum in San Pedro. . . . Robert Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn.  of California (SAC) and former DFG deputy director, has been elected to the San  Diego Oceans Foundation's board of directors.  </P> <P> Raahauge's seventh annual Shooting and Fishing Sports Fair, featuring clinics,  exhibitions and seminars, will be held Friday through Sunday in Norco. For  details, call: (714) 735-2361. . . . Climber-writer Kurt Diemberger, one of two  persons to survive a blizzard that killed six climbers in August of 1986 at  26,250 feet on K-2, the world's second-highest mountain, will speak Saturday at  7 p.m. at JPL's von Karman Auditorium in Pasadena. . . . The Angler's Tackle  Box in Seal Beach is conducting a seminar on catching mako sharks June 1 at 7  p.m.  </P> <P> Fly fishing expert Gary Borger will present fly tying classes May 24 at  Marriott's Fly Fishing Center in Fullerton at 10 a.m. and again at 2 p.m.,  followed by a slide show "Alaska: Big Fish On a Small Budget," at 6:30, all  free. . . . Dr. Dave Engerbretson of Moscow, Ida., a fly fishing guide and  author-editor, will speak to the Sierra Pacific Flyfishers' monthly dinner  meeting Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at the Odyssey Restaurant in Mission Hills.

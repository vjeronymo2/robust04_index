			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Buy-out teams could push bids past Dollars 1bn - Western Union The final round of bidding in the auction of Western Union this Friday could well elicit an offer of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) for the world's biggest non-bank money-transfer company - more than twice the first bid made in June. Three bidders remain in the ring: First Financial Management, a data processing company, First Data, a credit card processing company, and Forstmann Little, a leveraged buy-out firm. Western Union, which handled 18.5m payment transactions last year, was put up for auction by a US bankruptcy judge in June. The company, though not itself in bankruptcy, is owned by New Valley, which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since March. First Financial, which was the last of the bidders to declare an interest in Western Union, appears to have made the most attractive offer so far. In the first round of formal bidding, which closed 10 days ago, the data processing company offered to pay Dollars 800m. This compares with Dollars 970m from Forstmann Little - though unlike First Financial, it has said it will not assume the company's unfunded pension liability, put at Dollars 265m. First Data, seems to have dropped out of contention by refusing to raise its earlier offer of Dollars 660m (plus assumption of the pension liability).</p>

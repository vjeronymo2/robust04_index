			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> POLAND DEBATES REFORMS  </P> <P> Poland's Parliament began debate on a reform package that would, among other  things, legalize the banned Solidarity trade union and provide for important  political freedoms. The six bills embody reforms agreed to in talks between the  government and the Solidarity-led opposition. One bill would liberalize  elections to Parliament, including a deal by which the opposition would take  35% of the seats and the Communists would give up their absolute majority.  Another bill would create an upper house, with elections to be held in June.  The package, which would also give greater freedom to form associations and  political clubs but no new political parties, is expected to be approved in  about two weeks.  </P></p>

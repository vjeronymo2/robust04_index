			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (9): Double decker glories - The arts dance onwards THEY SAY that Americans seeking a weekend's cultural refreshment go increasingly to Toronto rather than New York. It is not hard to see why. There is a good feel to Toronto, purposeful without being pressured. The downtown streets and subway are clean and safe to walk of an evening - and a Toronto winter's night is generally more benign than Europeans imagine. There is nothing, then, to inhibit a visitor in search of the cultural life of the city. Cats and Miss Saigon are both showing in Toronto. However, with some 40 other theatres and 140 professional theatre companies, Toronto is the capital - after New York and London - of English language theatre. On Yonge Street, close to record stores where Europeans greedily swallow up CDs for CDollars 18 or less, theatregoers will discover a jewel: the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres. This complex is the last surviving example of the double-decker theatres which flourished in the heyday of vaudeville. Opened in 1913 the Winter Garden transported its audience into an English country garden, with trompe l'oeil paintings of stone walls, flowers and butterflies. After only 14 years the Winter Garden was shut up and forgotten while the Elgin became a sleazy cinema. Five years ago this last gasp of Edwardiana was restored at a cost of CDollars 30m and reopened (telephone (416) 963-3571 for theatre bookings). Down at the Harbourfront Centre on the shore of Lake Ontario, the Du Maurier Theatre is hosting a world drama festival. At the nearby Dance Centre, dance groups from all over the world are taking part in the CIBC Dance Season. Out of town, the noted Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake, 40 years old this year, with three stages, is the largest repertory company in north America. This year's programme starts on April 21 and includes Shaw's Saint Joan and Coward's Blithe Spirit (telephone (416) 468-2172). A sunset view of Toronto's financial centre is a memorable sight. The Toronto Dominion Centre was designed by Mies Van der Rohe and built after his death. The springing palm-tree vaults of Calatrava's Galeria at BCE Place, and a magnificent 1930s bank in Egypto-Celtic style, are other highlights. (To book an architectural walking tour, telephone (416) 922-7606.) The Royal Ontario Museum opened in 1914, is a place of enchantment, splendidly Victorian in its heterogeneity, with art and natural sciences under one roof. Perhaps its chief glory is the Chinese collection, one of the most magnificent in the world. The fine arts scene is lively. At the Harbourfront, the Powerhouse gallery hosts travelling shows of Canadian and foreign artists. The Art Gallery of Ontario reopened last month; now literally twice the place it was. Designed by Barton Myers Architects Inc and built in association with the local partnership of Kuwabara, Payne, McKenna, Blumberg, the gallery is now one of the largest in north America. Many Toronto visitors count discovery of the Group of Seven, the famous nationalistic movement in landscape painting founded in the 1920s, as one of the city's great resources. A half hour from Toronto in the wooded hills of the Humber Valley, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection is a shrine to these artists and their contemporaries. In September, Toronto's Festival of Festivals is the best-attended film festival in the world. The city is also home to the Canadian Opera Company. Brian Dickie, its director, was formerly general administrator at Glyndebourne, and standards are high. Thus far without its own opera theatre, the company uses the enormous O'Keefe Centre - or the Elgin Theatre for more intimate works. The year's opera programme includes new productions of Smetana's Bartered Bride and Mozart's Don Giovanni. The Toronto Symphony Orchestra also uses the O'Keefe Centre.

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CAVETT TONGUE-TIED IN JAPANESE  </P> <P> Talk show host Dick Cavett needed 35 tries to get it right while making a  videotape to promote West Virginia.  </P> <P> But give him break: He was doing it in Japanese.  </P> <P> Gov. Gaston Caperton, scheduled to go to Japan Saturday for a nine-day visit,  will take with him the promotional videotape in which Cavett extols the state's  virtues.  </P> <P> "We in America are quite proud of West Virginia," the translated text of  Cavett's remarks show. Cavett says Japan and West Virginia have mountain  ranges, a proud history and eyes on the future. The governor's office said  Cavett has done three documentaries for Japanese television.  </P></p>

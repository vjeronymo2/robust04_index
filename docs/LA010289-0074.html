			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAIL OF AGELESS ART IS NOGUCHI LEGACY  </P> <P> A biological theory known as hybrid vigor holds that a child born of parents of  different races will possess greater intelligence and physical health than  either of them. Metaphorically, at least, the productive and long-lived  sculptor Isamu Noguchi with his Japanese-poet father and Caucasian-American  mother seemed animated by this force. Born in Los Angeles in 1904 under the  sign of Scorpio, he died last Friday in New York at 84.  </P> <P> It came as something of a surprise to realize that when Noguchi's ledger was  closed he had left a protean legacy of artworks scattered across three  continents and had attained the status of the modern art world's leading  sculptural patriarch. And not just because he had outlived the competition. The  quality of his work had never faltered into commercial decoration or  self-caricature as it has with so many long-lived modern masters. There was an  incredible steadiness about Noguchi's work, as if it were produced by someone  -- or something -- ageless, like a mountain stream patiently sculpting its  rocks. Noguchi's career added up to a fairly vivid endorsement of  miscegenation.  </P> <P> Hiroshima mon amour.  </P> <P> There is a socio-psychological theory which holds that people born of mixed  race will be more troubled than their parents, suffering feelings of not quite  belonging anywhere and never being exactly sure of who they are. Some evidence  suggests that Noguchi sensed himself as this Marginal Man. Little of the  autobiographical turns up in accounts of his career. He was married once,  briefly. He moved about somewhat restlessly, widening his geographical circuit  until in recent years he divided his time between homes in New York, Japan's  Shikoko Island and junkets to other countries to work on an ever-expanding  roster of commissions. He liked Pietrasanta, Italy, and recently caught a cold  there, which eventually led to his death.  </P> <P> If Noguchi felt displaced, he certainly identified with both poles of his  alienation. During the Japanese-American internment of World War II, he  voluntarily had himself confined to one of the camps. It was a wonderfully  subtle affirmation of his roots and a truly aristocratic gesture of contempt  toward the American establishment. After that he always looked a bit like a  prisoner, keeping the top button of his shirt closed without wearing a tie. He  looked at once like a convict, a Zen priest and a Eurasian polo fancier played  by Toshiro Mifune.  </P> <P> For many of the decades he was around one was barely aware of him. His image  lacked the dramatic presence of the volcanic Picasso, the bear-like charm of  David Smith or the trendiness and wit of Claes Oldenburg. Noguchi was like a  shadow cast on the floor through the light from an open door, enigmatic and  without substance.  </P> <P> What was he up to?  </P> <P> In 1978, Minneapolis' Walker Art Center organized an exhibition whose travels  brought it to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. For many adults it was  the first opportunity to have a focused look at a possibly minor artist from,  when was it exactly, the '20s or '40s or sometime and is he still alive?  </P> <P> The show was an authentic revelation. Noguchi had studied with the great  Brancusi but by the '40s, he was making works like "Avatar," whose forms  resembled the biomorphic surrealism of Miro while retaining the sensuous  material elegance of Brancusi. Noguchi seemed to be moving like a vacuum-fish,  absorbing everything in his wake. In the early '60s, he made forms like  unshelled snails before anyone heard of Funk.  </P> <P> And so it went. Long before Robert Rauschenberg collaborated with Merce  Cunningham, Noguchi did sets for Martha Graham's dances, for "Appalachian  Spring" and "Frontier." They had the skeletal spareness of Giacometti's "The  Palace at 3 A.M." Decades before art developed a social conscience or an  awareness that real light and space were sculptural materials, Noguchi designed  playgrounds. When artists furniture was not even a glimmer in the aesthetic  eye, Noguchi made lamps.  </P> <P> The years rolled on and Noguchi began to receive larger and more prominent  commissions. They made it clear that his originality consisted less of pure  invention and more of hybrid vigor. Squint at a sunken garden at Yale's  Beinecke Library and it is clearly a minimalist paraphrase of Japanese Zen  gardens with their raked sand and huge boulders.  </P> <P> Noguchi's work tells us that the individualism and inventiveness of the  Occident was anticipated in the collectivism and tradition of the Orient, where  nature itself is regarded as a huge artwork. The artist does not dictate to  nature. He listens to it and does its bidding. Just set the boulder on edge,  give it a few taps and it is a sculpture. And we thought it was so  revolutionary when Duchamp told us the art is found rather than made.  </P> <P> Noguchi came to Los Angeles to work on his plaza for the Japanese American  Cultural and Community Center and his spectacularly calm "California Scenario"  in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza. He did not think highly of his hometown and  was not a pleasant man to meet. He answered questions with contemptuous  casualness and seemed to wish to be elsewhere.  </P> <P> He came across as a man so aware of his absolute aloneness that the only way to  survive was to convince himself he had chosen it out of obligation to a greater  mission.  </P> <P> If one is going to fuse oneself with nature -- to take on the personality of  the relentless wind or the tireless stream -- it requires a certain  ruthlessness, an austere humility that can play out as arrogance.  </P> <P> What does it mean that Noguchi made the monomaniacal gesture of establishing a  museum to himself but then placed it in an obscure section of Long Island City,  N.Y.?  </P> <P> Noguchi set himself the superhuman task of fusing time and space into an art  that makes Stonehenge modern and subsumes the idea of modernism to man's most  primitive impulses, delivering him back -- truly civilized -- to the endless  cycled rhythms of nature.  </P></p>

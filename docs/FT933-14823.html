			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / German insider traders may get 5 years: Draft law aims to enhance country's standing as a financial centre GERMAN insider traders will face a jail term of up to five years, according to a draft law published by the German finance ministry yesterday. The law is designed to enhance the competitiveness of Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - by bringing the regulatory environment for the German securities industry up to international standards. Central to this is the criminalisation of insider dealing, a practice which is treated as a form of theft in the UK, the US and other major industrial countries, but remains legal, though increasingly frowned-upon in Germany. Other measures include: Companies will be obliged to disclose shareholdings in other companies when they reach 5 per cent, rather than at 25 per cent at present. Failure to make the disclosure will be subject to a fine of DM500,000 (Pounds 196,850) and could result in loss of the right to exercise voting control over the shares. It will create a German equivalent of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, the centralised supervisory body for the US securities industry. It will set the minimal nominal value of German shares at DM5 rather than the current DM50 in a deliberate bid to make German shares more attractive to international investors who, the draft law argues, are deterred from investing in German equities because of prices ranging from DM500 to DM1000 per share. The law, likely to be enacted in the first half of next year, divides insider dealing into two categories. Primary violators will be those have direct access to sensitive information because of their position, for example within company management, or as a shareholder or member of a supervisory board. Secondary violators will be those who deal on sensitive information obtained from primary sources, for which the jail term will be three years. The law is based on draft proposals floated by the finance ministry in January of last year. The delay, which in part reflects the technical and political difficulties of devising a regulatory structure for the German markets, has more recently become an embarrassment for Germany in the wake of controversial share purchases by Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the former head of the IG Metall Union. Mr Steinkuhler denied dealing in insider information gained from his position on the supervisory board of Daimler when he bought shares in Mercedes Holding (MAH), a Daimler-Benz holding company, shortly before an announcement which led to a sharp rise in MAH's share price. The dealings served to expose the inadequacies of the regulatory environment in Germany and senior bankers called for an acceleration in the pace of reforms.</p>

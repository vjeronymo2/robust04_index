He told a press conference that "we expect very fruitful  dialogue at the meeting", which "will cover the issue of  maintaining growth, the issue of external finance and the issues  connective with domestic capital market development."    However, Summers said that the goal is not "to reach any  dramatic new agreement, but rather for the ministers to gain an  understanding of each other's problems and each other's needs."    "This is not a form for discussion of financial services  issues, the exchange rate or current account issues," he added.    Summers is here with Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen  to attend the first APEC finance ministers meeting.    Before his departure for Honolulu yesterday Bentsen also  stressed that the meeting is "an important precedent, because  we've never all been in the same room at the same time."    However, during bilateral talks prior to the official  meeting, some APEC ministers said they don't want to see the  meeting formalized due to the diversity of development in the  region.    This conference of APEC finance ministers is an outcome of  the APEC leadership meeting in Seattle last November, hosted by  U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Finance ministers participating include those from  Australia,  Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic  of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the  Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United  States. Chile has been invited as an observer pending APEC  membership in 1995.</p>

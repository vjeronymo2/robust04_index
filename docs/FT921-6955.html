			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Letter: More a grande dame than a woman down at heel Sir, Joe Rogaly, in his column 'Beurre Heseltine' (February 21), describes Mrs Margaret Thatcher as 'She who regarded herself as the sole bonne femme'. I cannot believe this to be true. Une bonne femme denotes a total lack of sophistication, namely a woman down at heel and rather vulgar. Mrs Thatcher may well have seen herself as the sole grande dame as she assumed the airs of an absolutist monarch. I suggest that He who regards himself as un homme du monde should first check his French. Helene Seppain, 174 Huntingdon Road, Cambridge CB3 0LB</p>

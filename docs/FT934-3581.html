			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Smith New Court up 400% Buoyant equity markets in London and overseas helped Smith New Court raise interim profits to Pounds 31.3m, against Pounds 6.7m, the securities house disclosed yesterday. The rise, confirmation of the exceptional profits generated by securities houses this year, prompted a doubling of the interim dividend to 2p despite the firm's policy of only adjusting the dividend at the year end. Diluted earnings per share rose to 25p, against 6.1p. Sir Michael Richardson, chairman, said the opening few weeks of the second half had shown a continuation of business levels. The disclosure of Smith New Court's profits coincided with figures from the stock exchange showing that November was the busiest month ever for equity trading in London, with a stock turnover value of Pounds 110.5bn. Smith New Court's short-term borrowings to finance equity marketmaking positions were reduced by the firm's access to extra capital. It completed a Pounds 45.1m rights issue in August to finance expansion. Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, said that earnings had been evenly split between marketmaking, its core business from its roots as a jobber, and fees from corporate and institutional broking into which it had diversified. He said that more than 60 per cent of revenues had come from overseas, including broking and marketmaking in Asia Pacific and New York. The firm saw 'huge opportunities' in India, China and Latin America. Despite the increase in bonuses expected at securities houses, he said that expenses from existing staff had 'risen like everything else, but not exploded'. The company has recruited 60 more staff since last year, bringing it to 1,360. Capital and reserves rose from Pounds 92.3m to Pounds 175.3m, helping to finance the sharp rise in assets held on the balance sheet of Pounds 4.62bn, against Pounds 2.66bn. Current liabilities to fund the equity book positions rose from Pounds 4.43bn to Pounds 2.55bn. The firm expects an appeal in a legal dispute with Citicorp about the sale of Ferranti to be resolved 'shortly'. It is holding the principal and interest involved as a result of the original judgement, and could benefit by Pounds 14m. Shares closed 11p down at 411p. The two for seven rights issue price in June was 210p. Lex, Page 24</p>

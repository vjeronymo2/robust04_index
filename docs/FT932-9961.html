			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK INDEX futures moved sharply ahead on the first day of the new equity account on hopes of a cut in UK base rates and on the release of encouraging economic data, writes Joel Kibazo. Initial selling of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index saw it relinquish 4 points to 2,797 in the first half-hour of trading. But a more positive mood on interest rates drew the buyers off the sidelines, causing a turnround in the fortunes of the contract and sending it sharply ahead. Further demand was encouraged by the release towards midday of official statistics showing a rise in consumer credit but only a slight increase in producer prices. However this led to a squeeze in the June future contract. That squeeze continued in the afternoon as UK traders focused on the strong performance of Wall Street, the June contract finishing at the day's high of 2,843, a jump of 44 from Friday's finish. However, turnover was modest at 8,488 lots by the official close. Most of the activity in the traded options sector was in the two index options. A total of 29,032 contracts had been dealt by the finish, of which some 8,871 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,118 in the Euro FT-SE option. Lonrho was the most active of the stock options, with a total of 1,535 lots dealt, followed by BP with 1,124 traded. Fisons, Ladbroke and Glaxo were also busy.</p>

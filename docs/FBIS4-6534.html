			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 22 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In his speech in Tokyo on 21 April, Koichiro  Matsuura, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs until  recently, commented on the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister  and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR) Mickey Kantor on 15 April. He said, "Although prospects  remain uncertain for resuming the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks, the minutes of the meeting show that at various points in  his remarks, Mr. Kantor showed his willingness to work for  setting the framework talks in order." He thus indicated that  there has been a change in the U.S. position.    With regard to the resumption of the talks, he said, "Both  Japan and the United States have to come up with ideas on how to  formulate the objective criteria. They should narrow their gap  through behind-the-scenes contacts." He stressed the need to  come up with points of compromise through unofficial discussions.    On the issue of reducing Japan's current accounts surplus,  Matsuura reiterated that "Japan should not set a numerical  target." He pointed out that "what is important is to adopt  policies which will produce actual results in reducing the  surplus in each quarter of the year."    As to the microeconomic sectors, he said, "If possible,  measures, even in the financial services and other non-priority  sectors, should be compiled before July."</p>

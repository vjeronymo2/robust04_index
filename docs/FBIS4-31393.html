			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "How Do the Programs of Future </F> Coalition Parties Differ?"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted]    On Privatization:    The experts agree that privatization has become an  irreversible process, one that must also be continued in the  future. However, there are some differences of views regarding  the speed of this process. The Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] are urging the reduction of state property to a minimum  and, thus, they want to get rid of the state property as soon as  possible. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] however, thinks  that it is necessary to thoroughly consider the pace at which  the state property is reduced. The MSZP also thinks that the  number of factories, banks, and other enterprises owned by the  state should be reduced to below the level set out by the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. [passage omitted]    On the Fate of Privatization Income:    While the MSZP argues in favor of reviving enterprises,  creating jobs, and covering the debts accumulated by state  enterprises, the SZDSZ prefers quick privatization to "renewal  and selling," but privatization to new owners capable of  accumulating capital, of modernizing, and of saving jobs.    On Economic Progress:    There are differences of emphasis between the economic  programs. Both parties say that, contrary to what the current  government claims, the conditions for economic revival will have  to be created now. Both parties see possibilities of a small  economic growth around 1996, but this will hardly be noticeable  in the people's standard of living. The first goal is to  restore the upset economic balance and to halt the tremendous  foreign economic deficit and the increase in the budget deficit.  Both parties find it important to make use of the economic  contacts with the European Union and to gain new markets.  However, the MSZP thinks that Hungary will have little chance  of a large-scale increase in exports because of the economic  recession prevailing in the West and the internal market defense  in the West. Therefore, the MSZP would like to regain the  Eastern markets, the markets of the former Soviet member states.  The MSZP admits that we can only think of barter trade because  of the financial difficulties and lack of capital there.  Because of the bad experiences of previous years, the SZDSZ  does not agree with this idea. [passage omitted]    On the Budget:    According to the MSZP, the most important task is to halt  state waste and avoid the unpredictable growth of our foreign  and domestic debt. The goal of the MSZP is to reduce expenses,  the deficit, and also the withdrawals first of all by reducing  expenses on state administration and other low-efficiency  expenses.    The SZDSZ wants to reduce the budget deficit by streamlining  the executive state apparatus, reforming the army, reducing  management expenses, and cutting social payments to people who  are not in need.    On the Tax System:    Both parties promise a stabilization of the tax system. The  MSZP would try to achieve this by considerably reducing the  corporation taxes, eliminating the taxes on forint and hard  currency interest and the minimal tax, restoring the advantages  of foreign investors, making investment incomes free of tax, and  taxing property accumulation. Reducing the weight of income tax  and increasing the role of consumer taxes also appears in their  program.    The SZDSZ: Investment tax benefits for Hungarian and foreign  entrepreneurs; taking over wage costs from entrepreneurs who  create jobs; restoring the contract tax of small entrepreneurs;  increasing the role of local governments in taxation at the  detriment of central withdrawals. [passage omitted]    On Trade Unions:    The SZDSZ does not regard as fortunate that the chairman of  the largest trade union in the country is sitting in Parliament  as a government party deputy. The SZDSZ thinks that this mixes  up the role of employee interest representation with the task of  the executive power. This is mostly a political difference of  views between the two parties. According to the MSZP, the  so-called tripartite talks between the trade unions and the  government [government-employers-employees] are the guarantee  that no essential decisions in the economic and social sphere  are made without a broad consensus. [passage omitted]    On Hungary's Neighbors:    According to the MSZP, Hungary needs rapprochement and  bilateral and regional cooperation with its neighbors. "We want  to trade, rather than engage in litigations." The MSZP promises  the confirmation of open borders and full assertion of national  minority rights by international law, and they are urging the  creation of an efficient international system of national  minority protection.    According to the SZDSZ, economic and political cooperation  is  the basic guarantee for Hungary's security. Bilateral  agreements should guarantee (traversable) borders and the  assertion of national minority rights. National minority  protection goals should be formulated in which we can find  partners among the international organizations and the majority  democratic forces in our neighbors.    On NATO and the European Union:    The MSZP says that the conditions of joining the European  Union must be created as soon as possible. Hungary's relations  with NATO should be further developed, but NATO membership is  not the only guarantee for Hungary's security. A referendum  should decide on joining both organizations.    The SZDSZ says that we should not force a deadline for  preparations for integration; instead, we should set out our own  pace so that Hungary becomes suitable to join the Union as soon  as possible. According to the SZDSZ, a broad social consensus  must be achieved regarding the issue of integration. [passage  omitted]</p>

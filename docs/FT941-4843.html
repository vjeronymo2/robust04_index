			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Valves division disposal boosts Suter to Pounds 38.2m A sharp fall in interest payments helped Suter, the industrial conglomerate, to increase 1993 profitability in spite of continuing tough trading conditions in its main markets. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 15.2m, adjusted for FRS 3, to Pounds 38.2m, which included a Pounds 19.1m gain on the disposal of the group's industrial valves division for Pounds 36m last April. In 1992 there was a Pounds 1.1m exceptional charge relating to a provision against the value of an associate undertaking. Stripping out exceptional items left pre-tax profits up by 17 per cent to Pounds 19.1m. The disposal cut gearing from 70 per cent to 11 per cent and interest payments fell from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 1.4m. In January, the group completed a sale and leaseback of an industrial estate in Staffordshire and eliminating borrowings. Group sales fell to Pounds 186.9m (Pounds 196m) including Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 23.5m) from discontinued activities. Continuing businesses grew by 4 per cent to Pounds 180m, while trading profits, excluding the industrial valves division, rose by 20 per cent from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 19.5m. In spite of competitive pressures on margins, the return on sales, excluding discontinued businesses, rose from 9.4 to 10.8 per cent. Mr David Abell, chairman, said: 'I expect to see a continuation of the overall gradual but uneven improvement we have experienced in 1993.' He added that no decision had been made regarding James Wilkes, the Sheffield engineer in which Suter recently raised its stake to 29.5 per cent. However, the chairman could not resist saying that the two groups offered 'a fit as near perfect as you would get'. Suter announced a further bonus issue of warrants of one for every 10 ordinary shares held. Mr Abell said terms would be structured so as not to conflict with last year's warrant issue. Earnings per share grew to 22.7p (8.7p) or 21p (8.6p) fully diluted. Stripping out the exceptional, earnings rose by 18 per cent to 11.5p (9.7p) or 11.3p (9.6p) fully diluted. A recommended final dividend of 5.8p gives a total of 9.2p (8.8p), a rise of 4.5 per cent.</p>

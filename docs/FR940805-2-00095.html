Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this Statement of Principles and Policy is to clearly describe the respective roles and responsibilities of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and States in the administration of programs carried out under Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Section 274 provides broad authority for the NRC to establish Federal and State cooperation in the administration of regulatory programs for the protection of public health and safety in the industrial, medical, and research uses of nuclear materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy statement addresses the Federal-State interaction under the Atomic Energy Act to: (1) establish and maintain agreements with States under section 274(b) to provide for discontinuance by the NRC, and the assumption by the State, of responsibility for administration of a regulatory program for the use of byproduct, source, and small quantities of special nuclear material; and (2) guide post-agreement interactions to ensure that NRC and Agreement State radiation control programs are coordinated and compatible and that Agreement State programs continue to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This policy statement establishes principles, objectives, and goals that should be reflected in the implementing guidance and programs of the NRC and Agreement States to meet their respective program responsibilities and which should be achieved in the administration of these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Statement of Legislative Intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 did not specify a role for the States in regulating the use of nuclear materials. Many States were concerned as to what their responsibilities in this area might be and expressed interest in seeing that the boundaries of Federal and State authority were clearly defined. This need for clarification was particularly important in view of the fact that although the Federal government retained sole responsibility for protecting the public health and safety from the radiation hazards of byproduct, source, and special nuclear material, the responsibility for protecting the public from the radiation hazards of other sources such as x-ray machines and radium had for many years been borne by the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, in 1959 Congress enacted Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act to establish a statutory framework under which States could assume certain regulatory jurisdiction over byproduct, source, and special nuclear material in quantities less than a critical mass. The primary purpose of the legislation was to authorize the Commission to relinquish to the States its regulatory authority over the use of these materials. The Commission retained regulatory authority over the licensing of certain facilities and activities such as nuclear reactors, larger quantities of special nuclear material, and the export and import of nuclear materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering the legislation, Congress recognized that the Federal government would need to assist the States to ensure that they developed the capability to exercise their regulatory authority in a competent and effective manner. Accordingly, the legislation authorized the Commission to provide training and other services to State officials and employees. However, in rendering this assistance, the Congress did not intend that the Commission would provide any grants to a State for the administration of a State regulatory program. This was fully consistent with the objectives of Section 274 to qualify States to assume independent regulatory authority over certain defined areas of regulatory jurisdiction and to permit the Commission to discontinue its regulatory responsibilities in those areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to relinquish its authority to a particular State, the Commission must find that the program is compatible with the Commission's program for the regulation of radioactive materials and that the State program is adequate to protect the public health and safety. In addition, the Commission has an obligation to review existing Agreement State programs to ensure continued adequacy and compatibility. Section 274(j) of the Act provides that the NRC may terminate or suspend all or part of its agreement with a State if the Commission finds that such termination is necessary to protect the public health and safety or the State has not complied with the provisions of Section 274(j). In these cases, the Commission must offer the State reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing. In addition, the Commission may temporarily suspend all or part of an agreement in the case of an emergency situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

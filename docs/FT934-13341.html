			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Steady as she goes in Smith's reshuffle: Labour's leader missed a chance to strengthen his team IT WAS what you might call a Majorite reshuffle: cautious, unambitious, and carefully calculated not to upset the competing interests of different wings of the party. So the new line-up for Labour's shadow cabinet announced by Mr John Smith will not signal any significant tilt in the balance of advantage between government and opposition front benches in the House of Commons. Neither anyway claims to be overflowing with talent. Mr Smith can plead of course that, unlike the prime minister, a Labour leader in opposition cannot choose his own team. The membership of the shadow cabinet was decided earlier this week by the votes and vicissitudes of Labour MPs. All Mr Smith was left to do was re-allocate the portfolios. As expected the pugnacious Mr John Prescott - credited with rescuing the leadership during last month's party conference confrontation with the unions over internal democracy - got his reward. Placed third in the shadow cabinet elections, his transfer to employment gave him the economic portfolio he wanted. Mr Frank Dobson was compensated for his switch to transport with the additional responsibility for policy towards London. But beyond repaying his debt to the (generally underrated) Mr Prescott, Mr Smith was anxious not to rock too many boats. As expected Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, the two leading 'modernisers', kept their portfolios as shadow chancellor and shadow home secretary respectively. Mr Robin Cook remains at trade and industry. By common consent at Westminster the shadow cabinet has had three crucial weaknesses since the general election - in the posts of foreign affairs, education and chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Smith has decided against remedying them. Mr Jack Cunningham, scarcely visible since the general election as shadow foreign secretary, retains his post in spite of a slump in his vote in this week's elect-ions. In the words of one of their colleagues, Mr Smith and Mr Cunningham 'go back a long way'. Ms Harriet Harman's televisual skills were not enough to keep her place on the shadow cabinet. She is judged by her peers as no match for Mr Michael Portillo as the shadow to the chief secretary to the Treasury. But Mr Smith exercised his prerogative to keep her in place anyway, although without a seat at the shadow cabinet table. His officials said it was a mark of Mr Smith's political authority that he was prepared to override the views of the parliamentary party. Others were far from convinced, arguing that the pivotal job of shaping Labour's approach to public spending demanded a political heavyweight. Mr Chris Smith, wasted as the party's environment spokesman, would have been an ideal replace-ment. At education Mrs Ann Taylor has been similarly at sea, in spite of the open goal offered by Mr John Patten's battles over the schools curriculum and testing. She remains in place. There were other curious decisions. Ms Marjorie Mowlam is deemed one of the more effective members of the frontbench team. But even though she same fifth in this week's poll she was moved sideways from science and the civil service to national heritage. Nor did Mr Smith take full advantage of Mr George Robertson's long-overdue elevation to Labour's senior frontbench team. The former European affairs spokesman masterminded Labour's tactics during the protracted struggle over ratification of the Maastricht treaty. He will be an effective shadow for Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary. But many in his party believe Mr Robertson's talents would have been better employed in a more wide-ranging job. Overall, the election results and Mr Smith's limited musical chairs reinforced the mood at the Brighton conference which put Labour's modernisers on the defensive. In internal debates over economic policy Mr Prescott will join Mr Cook as a critic of Mr Brown's efforts to dump the party's remaining ideological baggage. The new employment spokesman is one of the most outspoken of what he terms his party's 'beautiful people'. The modernisers will draw from Mr Smith's approach the message that he prefers caution to boldness. For the time being the party's 'one-more-heave' tendency are back in Labour's driving seat.</p>

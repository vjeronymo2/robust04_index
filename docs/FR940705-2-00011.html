Name of Standard. Application Profile for the Government Information Locator Service (GILS). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Information Interchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Explanation. This standard describes an application profile for the Government Information Locator Service (GILS). This application profile is based primarily on the American National Standard for Information Retrieval Application Service Definition and Protocol Specification for Open Systems Interconnection (ANSI/NISO Z39.50&hyph;1992), developed by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The Government Information Locator Service (GILS) is a decentralized collection of servers and associated information services that will be used by the public either directly or through intermediaries to find public information throughout the Federal government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This GILS Profile specifies the use of ANSI/NISO Z39.50&hyph;1992 in information service applications and provides specifications for the overall GILS application, including the GILS Core and other aspect of a GILS server operating in the Internet environment. This GILS profile will enable GILS client systems to interconnect and to interoperate with any GILS server. This profile addresses intersystem interactions and information interchange for the GILS, but does not specify user interface requirements, the internal structure of databases that contain GILS Locator Records, or search engine functionality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GILS servers will support search and retrieval by accepting a search query and returning a result set or diagnostic messages. GILS servers may also support browsing by accepting a well-known search query and returning a list of Locator Records in brief display format. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the information resources pointed to by GILS Locator Records, as well as the GILS server itself, may be available electronically through other communications protocols including the common Internet protocols that facilitate electronic information transfer such as remote login (Telnet), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and electronic mail. The use of SMTP and MIME protocols or other communications paths is outside the scope of the GILS Profile. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The GILS Profile was developed by a group of industry and government experts in ANSI/NISO Z39.50&hyph;1992 implementations, system implementations, and the organization of information. The specifications included in the GILS Profile reflect the consensus of this group based on its work and input from a range of stakeholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

Users of this standard who need to be notified or changes that occur prior to the next publication of the standard should complete the Change Request Form provided in this publication and send it to: Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), Computer Systems Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. The NIST will issue Change Notices on an as-needed basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

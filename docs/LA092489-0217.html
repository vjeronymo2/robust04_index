			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD DEFENSE PAVES WAY  </P> <P> Oxnard High went into Saturday night's nonleague game with an offense as  powerful as Hurricane Hugo, but it was a stingy defense that swept Channel  Islands off its feet.  </P> <P> Oxnard (3-0) limited Channel Islands, which had averaged more than 350 yards in  its first two games, to 168 rushing yards during its 26-12 win at Hueneme High.  </P> <P> Channel Islands (2-1) didn't score until the fourth quarter and hurt itself  with six fumbles and personal fouls that ended two drives deep in Oxnard  territory. Running back Renard Carn had a successful evening, rushing for 142  yards in 16 carries, but fullback Pharoh Milner -- who, like Carn, was  averaging more than 100 yards rushing a game -- was held to 26 in seven  carries.  </P> <P> Oxnard scored two touchdowns in a four-minute span in the first quarter.  Quarterback Johnel Turner gave Oxnard a 6-0 lead with a four-yard run at the  5:34 mark. After Channel Islands fumbled on its next drive, Turner found Mitch  Watkins in the end zone with a pass on a third-and-30 play from the 50.  </P> <P> The main gun was Turner, though. The quick senior scored from four yards out  with 1:26 left in the third quarter to give Oxnard a 20-0 lead and added a  two-yard score with 2:33 left.  </P></p>

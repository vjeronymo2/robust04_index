			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Superleague threatens to flatten second tier - The possible consequences of a trend towards passive investment A TREND towards passive investment combined with a boom in new equity issues in the 1990s could make it more difficult for some companies to raise fresh capital, a recent report warns. The report*, by Mr Michael Howell of Salomon Brothers, predicts that aggregate gross equity issues worldwide could spiral to Dollars 375bn (Pounds 221bn) by 1995 - equivalent to 3.5 per cent of current world equity market capitalisation - from Dollars 194.7bn (Pounds 115bn) or 1.8 per cent estimated for 1990. Prospective issues from US companies - many of which need to reduce their gearing - could represent up to 28 per cent of this total. About half of the global new issues are expected to be bought by foreign investors, and nearly a third by so-called passive investors - in other words, investors whose portfolios reflect a stock market index. The remaining 18 per cent would probably be bought by active domestic investors. Investors such as life insurance and pension funds place considerable emphasis on risk management. There are two main ways to manage risk - by using derivative instruments and by diversifying the portfolio to include a broad range of domestic and foreign equities. Many large investors use derivatives such as index futures to hedge risks. These have the advantage of being cheaper and more liquid: for example, index futures represent a more convenient and liquid way of trading an index basket than if the investor were to buy the underlying securities. Mr Howell points out that a truly global fund would only need to hold around 1,000 major international stocks in a virtually passive portfolio, making only a few transactions in the cash equity market in order to rebalance the portfolio in line with adjustments to the main indices. As more investors shift towards a passive investment strategy, this could result in the formation of a two-tier capital market, according to Mr Howell. The upper tier would consist of the 'thundering thousand' superleague of global stocks, while the lower tier would include smaller, non-index stocks. 'The problem of a two-tier capital market could be serious, because those companies that may need fresh equity the most are also likely to have already been shunned by stock market investors to such an extent that the cost of equity raising is already high,' says Mr Howell. In the past, companies have tended to chase investors' funds, seeking listings in those markets where they believe it will be easy to raise money. However, in the future, as more and more investors aim to reduce risk by holding portfolios which reflect the composition of stock market indices, the shoe will be on the other foot: investors will have to seek those companies which are included in the index. 'A passive or quasi-passive fund will unconsciously take up a rights issue from an index constituent simply to maintain a balanced index weighting,' says Mr Howell. Similarly, as multinationals decide to unbundle in the future, they may consider floating off significant business areas, for example in Japan or in Europe. If these separately listed companies are large enough to be included in a market index, passive investors will have to buy the shares in order to adjust their portfolios to the index. *The Forthcoming 1990s New Issue Boom: Will Smart Money Head to the US?

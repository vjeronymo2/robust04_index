			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Small businesses brace for impact of 'horrific' rise MR CHRIS TUBBS, managing director of Tubbs Elastics, a family business with turnover of nearly Pounds 8m and 200 employees, reacted swiftly to the two-stage increase in interest rates. He postponed the purchase of three new directors' cars, put off upgrading of the company's computer system and cancelled a photocopier machine contract. A more expensive project to refurbish a factory will go ahead, since that is a longer-term commitment. Mr Tubbs may have reacted more rapidly than most small companies, but his concern at what proved to be a shortlived rise to 15 per cent was not untypical. Mr David Richardson, a Leeds partner of chartered surveyors Weatherall, Green &amp; Smith, said: 'I don't want to speak of shock and horror . . .but a hike of 50 per cent in interest charges is horrific. Businesses cannot sustain interest rates at that level given present rates of economic activity.' Small businesses are more sensitive to interest-rate movements because they depend to a greater extent than large companies on borrowed funds. They are often less sophisticated in financial management techniques and lack negotiating muscle. The banks calculate that only half their small business customers have borrowings at any one time, but tend to use variable rate loans and are often reluctant to take out fixed-interest term borrowings. The Forum of Private Business calculates that 37 per cent of its members have fixed-interest loans. Small businesses are also very dependent on short-term overdraft finance. The Federation of Small Businesses calculated that if yesterday's 5 percentage point increase in official interest rates fed through into base rates it would add Pounds 1bn a year to small businesses' interest charges. Mr Stephen Alambritis, federation spokesman, said: 'Our members are stunned. We had been expecting a cut in interest rates.' With Quarter Day - when companies pay their bank charges - less than two weeks away on September 29, business owners do not have to wait long to see the impact of interest-rate increases. But higher bank charges are only the most immediate result of the increase. Mr Stuart White, enterprise director of Midland Bank, said it could be expected to have a knock-on effect on the payments behaviour of businesses of all sizes, with the result that bills would be paid even more tardily. The optimistic view was that this was a short-term measure that could be relaxed if the French voted 'Yes'. Mr Richard Brown, policy director of British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'I can understand the despair among small businesses but they should not panic and lay staff off or close down operations.'</p>

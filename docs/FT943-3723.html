			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Swans receivers reprieve designers Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, was given a last chance of survival yesterday when Price Waterhouse, the receivers, postponed making the yard's design team redundant, Chris Tighe writes. The remaining 103 team members were reprieved after more than two hours of hard negotiation between the receivers and union officials. Loss of the design team would have made it impossible for Swan Hunter to tender for more work, in effect ensuring its demise by ending prospects of its sale as a going concern. Nearly all the 103 will now go on September 30 unless, against great odds, a going-concern sale can be finalised. Mr Ed James, joint receiver, said: 'It's allowing a little bit more time for these discussions to progress but not in a real expectation that a successful conclusion will be reached.' Further redundancies, he warned, seemed inevitable. The decision to defer the redundancies means an additional wage bill of around Pounds 100,000. Previous deadlines of August 31 and September 9 were waived because of proposals, since withdrawn, for bids from Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie. At a meeting tomorrow with Mr Roger Freeman, the defence procurement minister, Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, and Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East, will press the government to place design work with the yard.</p>

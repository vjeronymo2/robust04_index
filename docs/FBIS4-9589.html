			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vlado Babic: "The European Race Was Begotten by </F> the Serbs"]    [Text] The first Serbian rebellion against  civilization; nationalism that could be realized.    The first Serbian rebellion against civilization, as  publicist Milomir Maric beautifully described the absurdity of  the current implementation of the Serbian national program, has  had many predecessors, ideologues, and executors. Let us start  with Olga Lukovic-Pjanovic, author of the book The Serbs:  The Oldest People, who stated that Jesus Christ was a Serb  and that all the European peoples were derived from Serbs. The  painter Milic of Macva stole the discovery of the Sorabs as the  ancestral people from the above-mentioned author, and he himself  "ascertained" that the Serbs were the center of the  world--territorially, linguistically, and by destiny. Among the  older authors, Dr. Milovan Grba, in 1920, published a discussion  of the Serbs as a special race that differed from others. Vuk  Karadzic was also surprised that "the Croats do not want to be  Serbs, just because of Roman law and the Catholic religion."  Geographer Jovan Cvijic thought that the Croats are "only an  appendage of the Serbian people." Maric follows that the red  thread of Greater-Serbian nationalism goes from the "plans" of  Ilija Garasanin, through the partially fulfilled plan of Vasa  Cubrilovic for resettling Albanians from Kosovo to Turkey, to  the Serbian Academy of Science and Art memorandum.    Since the moment when that notorious program was proclaimed  their own by the victors at the eighth session and by the SPS  [Serbian Socialist Party] party and state apparatus, the war for  territory began. The implementation of the program has been  taken over by the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] and the  new "Serbian defenders." Let us look at how General Mladic spoke  out. "During the war I broke down as a Communist and a Yugoslav,  and I became the biggest Serb. It is only a question of time  when I will liberate the Serbian city of Zadar, which the  traitorous supreme command of the JNA already prevented me from  doing some time ago. Trieste is also an old Serbian city, which  will fall into our hands once again. The Serbian army will end  the war at the Trieste-Vienna line, like the previous two as  well." The justifiably celebrated Dr. Vojislav Seselj, in  contrast to Mladic, would satisfy himself with a western border  on the Karlobeg-Virovitica line. When the United States  threatened to bomb bridges and airports in the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia [FRY], a joke arose precisely on that subject,  according to which Zemun and New Belgrade, in the future, will  be named Karlobag and Virovitica.    Zeljko "Arkan" Raznjatovic, still one of the tiresomely  large  number of candidates for the title of the most important Serb,  is promising that Jasenovac will not be repeated. "We will no  longer be sheep, but rather wolves, or even better, tigers. The  blood of Obilic, which does not permit me to possess a house,  flows through my veins. With the aid of all our enemies, a  Greater Albania in Serbian Kosovo, a Greater Croatia in the  Serbian Krajina, and a Greater Bulgaria in Serbian Macedonia are  appearing before our very eyes. The Muslims, who are actually  Serbian martyrs who are not aware that they are Serbs, have  become vampires in Bosnia. Zadar, Sibenik, Dubrovnik, and Split  are Serbian cities, where the Catholics moved in by force, and  it is high time for us to drive them away from there. We are  fighting to restore the borders of the former Yugoslavia, up to  Sezana, since those are the Serbian borders. Slovenia will be  Serbian Slovenia again, Croatia will be Serbian Croatia, Bosnia  will be Serbian Bosnia, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] will be Serbian Macedonia again.  Slovenia is Serbian because I was born in it, and because the  Slovenes had sex with our enemies the Ustase. That is why my  battle cry is `F... their mothers and fathers!'" The fact that  Arkan has supporters on whom he can rely is also confirmed by a  statement by his "Colonel" Mile Ulemek, who, in his cafe in  Pazova, strictly forbids serving non-Serbs. It follows from his  geopolitical views that "the Croats received a lot of money from  abroad in order to do a dirty job on the Serbs." "Since they  have not done it yet, they will have to engage in conflict  again. They will also try to involve the Hungarians in their  work. Then there will also be an explosion in Kosovo. We are  just waiting for it! The Albanians are fortunately concentrated  in one city, so we will be able to flatten them with the air  force in just three hours. Only then will there be a final  settling of accounts in Serbia itself. The hungry will attack  the rich, who have enriched themselves disgracefully in this war  at the expense of the populace. Of course, Arkan and I will  defend the exhausted Serbs. We will fight against the rich on  the side of the poor until we subjugate Belgrade, the last nest  of traitors in the heart of Serbia."    The most serious candidate for the most important Serbian  woman is Dr. Biljana Plavsic, vice president of the republic of  Srpska. Her racist statements, especially the claim that it  would even be worthwhile to sacrifice 6 million Serbs to  establish a unified state, in fact, have even been condemned by  Milosevic. In view of its life to date and some recent actions,  we can justifiably suspect the ethnic purity of "her" state.    In the "world conspiracy" against the "celestial Serbs,"  only  the Greeks and the Russians have proven to be friends, and from  time to time it has also been possible to observe signs of  Serbian-Jewish friendship. The news that they are preparing to  issue the notorious "Protocol of the Elders of Zion" indicates  that the paranoia about the world conspiracy is approaching its  logical conclusion--anti-Semitism. Does that mean that there has  been a lack of claims and evidence about genocide against  Albanians, Croats, and Muslims, and that the hostility toward  Macedonians, Hungarians, and Slovenes is melting away? Is it  only a question of introducing new melodies on the Serbian  political scene that are compatible with the new orientation on  the Russian political scene?    With Mladic's help, Dr. Radovan Karadzic has gone furthest  in  carrying out the plan. In order to fulfill Karadjordje's dream,  which in Karadzic's opinion is of divine origin, and erase the  border on the Drina, the Sarajevo psychiatrist has used all  means available. Whether all means will also be permitted in  carrying out the Serbian plan for the unification of all Serbs  into a single state, however, does not depend solely on the  Serbs, although in various stages of its development and  implementation it has already been supported by almost all the  political parties, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Serbian  Academy of Science and Art, almost the entire intellectual  "elite," and the vast majority of Serbian protesters and  citizens inside Serbia, and even more outside it. Now others,  primarily the great powers, are deciding on the Serbian national  program. It will be shown in the very near future whether  conclusive action will prevail over verbal support for the  generally accepted principles of the UN Charter and the Helsinki  Declaration.    The assertion that this moment is the decisive one is also  supported by the new mobilization of the Greater-Serbian  intellectual elite. A second congress of Serbian intellectuals  has been scheduled for the second half of April, at which they  are to discuss the Serbian people's right to self-determination  and to life in a common state. The meeting has been envisioned  as "patriotic resistance to the demonization that has encircled  us and is encircling us on all sides." Milosevic, however, is  allowing all the above-mentioned people to work for him, while  he himself is preparing for various results of the  implementation of the Serbian national program. If the  international situation allows him, he will, of course, assume  the laurels of the unifier of all the Serbian states. Since he  would rather have power than citizens, we can believe that with  respect to his noticeably more peace-loving and calmer  statements, he will certainly not sign anything that could later  be used against him, while he is also preparing for other--less  comfortable--possibilities.</p>

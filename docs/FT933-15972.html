			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Reforms confuse investor equation - Political factors make calculations tricky THE PRICE set yesterday by Rhone-Poulenc for the shares it owns in Roussel-Uclaf sets a tricky problem for investors. At FFr563 per share, the price is a little below the all-time peak of FFr575, but nonetheless up 30 per cent since January. Investors must decide whether the price for France's third-largest pharmaceuticals group is fair. The decision by Rhone-Poulenc to sell its 35 per cent stake should improve both liquidity and investor interest in Roussel. Hoechst, the German group, controls 54.5 per cent of Roussel, which last year generated pre-tax profits of FFr722m (Dollars 126.66m) on sales of FFr14.812bn. Roussel, whose operations involve pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, agrochemicals and veterinary products, has been lightly followed by the investment community. Only 0.5 per cent of shares were quoted. Analysts' calculations have been complicated by the increasingly stormy environment for the drugs industry. All pharmaceuticals groups are struggling after a series of government cost-containment measures which are reducing sales volumes and prices around the globe. In Europe, for example, during the first four months this year, sales in the top seven drugs markets increased only 1.4 per cent, according to IMS International, the specialist market research company. The industry is likely to be further destabilised by reforms in the US, the world's biggest market, and France, the third-largest. The US reforms represent the industry's most significant worry, but any changes announced by President Bill Clinton are likely to have a minimal impact on Roussel, says Mr Edouard Sakiz, the group's president. He says 4 per cent of healthcare's FFr8.5bn sales are in North America. Meanwhile, the German reforms introduced in January have hit the company, admits Mr Sakiz. Broker JP Morgan, which is advising during the sale, estimates about 4 per cent of drugs sales are in Germany. In contrast, the healthcare reforms in Italy, where Roussel-Uclaf generates about 12 per cent of its turnover, have hit both turnover and profitability, admits Mr Sakiz. However, he says cost-reduction measures should allow it to achieve the same profits next year as last. But it is in France, where 37 per cent of Roussel's healthcare sales are located, that the company is probably most vulnerable to reforms. Since the sale was announced, the French government has revealed a healthcare package designed to save FFr32. bn. The first stage includes a decision to cut the amount the government reimburses patients for their medicines. Mr Sakiz promises the group will generate sales growth of between 5 and 8 per cent this year, in spite of healthcare reforms. JP Morgan predicts the group will generate earnings of FFr908m this year, FFr1.04bn next year, FFr1.2bn in 1995, and FFr1.38bn in 1996. The growth will not be generated by Roussel's best-known product, its controversial abortion pill, RU-486. Mr Sakiz says the product will never be a money-spinner as an abortion treatment. He does not want the company to make money out of abortions and, besides, the potential market is small. The treatment could be used for other uses, however, such as during labour and for breast cancer. Rather, the therapeutic areas that will drive growth will include antibiotics. Mr Sakiz stresses the innovative nature of Roussel's products and its pipeline in development in antibiotics, cardiovascular and endocrinology. Earnings growth will also be helped by the group's efforts to cut costs. A rationalisation programme launched in 1988 is 80 per cent complete and should end in 1995. The company believes it should contribute pre-tax savings of FFr500m a year from 1995 onwards. Investors' difficulties in valuing the company are exacerbated by changes in the group's structure. Roussel is acquiring Hoechst's French and German pharmaceuticals sales operations. The two companies' Italian and British businesses may also be merged.</p>

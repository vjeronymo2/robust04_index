			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, May 25 (TANJUG) -- One woman was killed  and 13 people were wounded in a Moslem artillery attack on the  Sarajevo front on Tuesday [24 May] which grossly violated the  truce, Bosnian Serb military sources have said. The command of  the Sarajevo-Romanija corps of the Bosnian Serb army specified  that Moslem forces fired 13 82mm-calibre mortar shells on the  Srednje district on the Sarajevo-Olovo road and that one shell  fell near a bus. The shell explosion killed one woman and  injured 13 passengers, two of them seriously.    The woman was the 32nd victim in Serb-controlled areas of  Sarajevo since a truce for Sarajevo was signed on February 9  this year and the city was proclaimed an exclusion zone under  protection of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR),  the Bosnian Serb military sources said. The sources also said  that 79 people were wounded in Moslem attacks, mostly from small  arms, rifles with telescopic sights, and grenade launchers. The  Moslem side is constantly violating the truce, primarily as a  result of the complete lack of action by UNPROFOR who have not  once reacted to warnings sent by the command of the  Sarajevo-Romanija Corps of the Bosnian Serb army, the command  said.</p>

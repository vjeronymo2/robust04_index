			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Emily R. Pena] </F>   [Text] The Department of Interior and Local Government  (DILG) announced yesterday the implementation of infrastructure  projects, worth P [Philippine peso] 21.621 million, in five  provinces in the Cordillera Autonomous Region (CAR).    In a report submitted by the Department of Public Works and  Highways (DPWH) to the DILG, it was noted that the multi-million  project enrolled by DPWH under the Kabuhayan [Livelihood] 2000  program of President Ramos is designed to increase agricultural  productivity in the region.    Among those provinces which will benefit from the project  are  Abra, Kalinga-Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao and Mt. Province.    Engineer Jose C. Guanzon, DPWH project manager, said the  improvement of roads and water supply construction projects  using labor-based/equipment-supported (LB/ES) methods will  accelerate development in CAR areas specifically, in terms of  generating more employment among the people here.    In Abra, the Pigidian-Abra-Ilocos Sur road is being  concreted  while water supply structure will be constructed in  Villaviciosa, Laplapog, and in Lagayan, Pang-ot and in other  selected municipalities in Benguet.    Improvement of drainage and road concreting will also be  undertaken in Bokod, Benguet-Viscaya road, and in Mankayan,  Abatan, and Mankayan-Cervantes in Benguet.    Meanwhile, the DPWH has also identified municipalities in  Kalinga-Apayao, Ifugao and Mt. Province that will be included in  its infrastructure program under Kabuhayan 2000.    DILG heads the steering committee of Kabuhayan 2000, a  program of the government which aims to generate more job  employment and opportunities in the countryside within three  years.</p>

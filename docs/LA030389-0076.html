			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: NEW PLAYS SPROUTING AS SPRING  APPROACHES  </P> <P> Spring is coming, and with it the inky aroma of new plays. Some will venture  forth in the Old Globe Theatre's Play Discovery Series -- a farm club for Globe  shows -- which continues Monday with a reading of Mark Lee's "Paradise," and  Teatro Meta's Latino Play Discovery Series, which presents a workshop of "The  Granny" at the Progressive Stage Company March 10-12.  </P> <P> Terrence McNally's "Up in Saratoga" will bypass early developmental stages when  it springs up as a full production Thursday at the Globe. And even Edward Albee  will get into the act when he comes to town to tape an introduction to the  California Young Playwrights Project winner, "Simply Maria, or the American  Dream," to be shown on KPBS-TV. Albee will read from his latest work, "Marriage  Play," Sunday morning at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre. The show is already  scheduled for Broadway and London engagements.  </P> <P> But the big news at the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre is that contracts have been  signed and money has exchanged hands on "The Debutante," a twist on the  "Pygmalion" story that re-imagines the tale in upper-class black society in the  1920s.  </P> <P> It is not the nonprofit Gaslamp that commissioned the play but a new,  for-profit company, Debutante Inc., set up by Gaslamp managing director Kit  Goldman. The company plans to hire the Gaslamp to produce the play early next  year. This doesn't mean Goldman, president of Debutante, has yet signed her  hoped-for star, Cleavon Little, or director, Oz Scott, both of whom now have  the script. It means she fell in love with the writing by Elmo Terry-Morgan and  decided to go with her instincts, which told her she has a hot property on her  hands.  </P> <P> "I work on the Cortez theory of doing business," Goldman said. "They came on  shore and burned the ships so there was no choice but to go ahead and conquer.  I went ahead and burned the ships. This is new territory for me. I have never  commissioned a script. But I'm very excited. The characters are wonderful and  the story is excellent. Mark Loigman, production manager at La Jolla Playhouse  for two years, is working with me to make up budgets and sell shares."  </P> <P> Goldman said the Gaslamp's financial struggles this year only fueled her  determination to press ahead with the project. Like other theater directors  taking a gamble on new plays, she knows that launching an untested project may  prove to be a disastrous expense, but she is buoyed by the hope that, if the  show takes off, the Gaslamp may reap heaps of critical and financial rewards.  </P> <P> "This project had a life and schedule of its own. I hope I'm never so  distracted by the present that I miss entrepreneurial opportunities," Goldman  said. "We have a plan for financial stability and stature, and part of the plan  is 'The Debutante.' "  </P> <P> The audience may not be captive, but the performers certainly will be when  seven minimum-security inmates from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional  Facility in Otay Mesa will present three one-act plays at the Lyceum Space in  Horton Plaza April 15-16.  </P> <P> The warden and a handful of guards have already made their reservations.  </P> <P> This outside venture is a first for California prisoners, according to Spike  Sorrentino, a local director and actor who has been directing the inmates  toward this goal for four months.  </P> <P> Sorrentino voiced a familiar directorial complaint about the job: "It was hard  to get good talent and hard to hold onto it."  </P> <P> While other directors lose actors to the competition, he lost his as they  finished their jail sentences.  </P> <P> Another challenge, he said, was building trust.  </P> <P> "The guys in minimum figure they aren't going to be in there that long, so they  wonder why they should put their faces out there and show everyone they're  prisoners."  </P> <P> One powerful motivation for them, he said, is that ticket sales from "The Actor  and the Invader," by Robert Patrick, "Rats," by Israel Horovitz, and "The  Scam," by local playwright Christopher R, will benefit the San Diego Crime  Victims Fund.  </P> <P> Allan Havis, a professor of playwrighting at UC San Diego, was one of six  playwrights to win the McKnight Fellowship in Playwrighting, a national award  given by the Minneapolis Playwrights' Center to writers who are judged to have  had a significant impact on the field of theater. Havis, who received his MFA  from the Yale School of Drama, has had his plays produced in a variety of  theaters across the country from the American Repertory Theatre to the WPA to  the South Coast Repertory Theatre, which most recently produced his works "Haut  Gout" and "Morocco."  </P> <P> Local actors David Novak, Courtney Flanagan and Philip Sneed will tour "The  Kingdom of Midas," a new one-act children's play written by Novak and Flanagan,  to several San Diego schools March 16-May 24. Under the auspices of the San  Diego Institute for Arts Education, the actors will assign the students to the  supporting roles of courtiers, farmers and attendants in the story of the king  who wanted everything he touched turn to gold -- until his wish was granted.  Call Ann Chase, program director, at (619)452-3840 for further information.  </P> <P> PROGRAM NOTES: Nearly half the 25 recipients of the semiannual COMBO (Combined  Arts and Education Council of San Diego County) awards went to theaters this  year. Some of the much-needed pennies from heaven went to the Bowery Theatre,  which is planning on a June opening for its new Gaslamp-area space and  Diversionary Theatre, which received backing for a production of Charles  Ludlam's "Reverse Psychology." . . . The San Diego Actors Co-Op will hold its  second annual All-City Audition March 6-7 and 13-14 at the San Diego Repertory  Theatre's Lyceum Space, where they will do their monologues on the set of  "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You." . . . The North Coast Repertory  Theatre will follow up "The Mandrake" with "Cat's Paw," a story about  terrorism, in its two-play summer series. . . . The Marquis Public Theatre,  which had to cancel plans for "Waiting for Godot" when it learned that the Old  Globe had the rights and "The Marriage of Bette and Boo" when it found out the  San Diego Repertory Theatre had the rights, is trying again with August  Strindberg's "A Dream Play," opening April 13.  </P></p>

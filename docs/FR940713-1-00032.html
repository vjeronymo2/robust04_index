			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission may make a determination that a toy or children's article presents a mechanical hazard by issuance of a regulation in accordance with provisions of sections 3(e) through (i) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1262(e)&hyph;(i)). A toy or children's article which is the subject of a rule issued in accordance with provisions of sections 3(e) through (i) and which fails to comply with all requirements of such a rule is a ``banned hazardous substance'' as that term is defined by section 2(q)(1)(A) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(A)). The introduction into interstate commerce of a banned hazardous substance is prohibited by section 4 of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1263).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3(f) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1262(f)) requires publication of an ANPR to begin a proceeding for issuance of a rule in accordance with sections 3(e) through (i) to make a determination that a toy or children's article presents a ``mechanical hazard.'' Section 3(f) also sets forth requirements for the content of the ANPR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 3(f) of the FHSA, the ANPR for crib toys identified the products and the risk of injury which are the subject of the rulemaking proceeding, and set forth the regulatory options under consideration by the Commission. The ANPR stated that the Commission was considering issuance of any or all of the requirements requested by the petition. The ANPR also summarized provisions applicable to crib toys in a voluntary standard published by ASTM (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials), designated F963&hyph;86, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety. In addition, the ANPR stated that the Commission was also considering the possibility that this voluntary standard could be revised to address additional hazards associated with crib toys, or that a new voluntary standard could be developed to address those hazards (2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by section 3(f) of the FHSA, the ANPR solicited comments from interested persons about the products and risk of injury under consideration; invited interested persons to submit an existing standard as the proposed regulation; and invited interested persons to submit a statement of intention to develop or modify a voluntary standard to address risks of strangulation death and injury associated with crib toys. (2) In response to the ANPR, the Commission received comments from 17 organizations and individuals (3&hyph;19). The Commission also received a joint-communication from six organizations concerning the proceeding for crib toys after the close of the comment period for the ANPR (20).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 21, 1993, the Commission staff transmitted to the Commissioners a briefing package of information concerning the development of requirements to address strangulation hazards associated with crib toys (21). On October 22, 1993, the staff presented an oral briefing to the Commission concerning this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Action by the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 26, 1993, the Commission voted to terminate the rulemaking proceeding applicable to crib toys and to withdraw the ANPR published on October 19, 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To make a determination that a product presents an ``unreasonable risk of injury'' under the FHSA, the Commission considers:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;The nature and severity of the risk of injury associated with the product;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;The potential of mandatory requirements for the product to reduce the frequency and severity of the injury; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;The effect of mandatory requirements on the cost, utility, or availability of the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, section 3(i) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1262(i)) provides that in order to issue a final rule expressing the Commission's determination that a toy presents a ``mechanical hazard,'' the Commission must prepare a regulatory analysis which includes a description of potential benefits and potential costs of the rule and identifies those parties likely to receive the benefits and to bear the costs. Section 3(i) provides further that the Commission may not issue a final rule unless it makes a finding that ``the benefits expected from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applying the factors involved in the determination of an unreasonable risk of injury to the information developed during this proceeding, the Commission finds the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Nature and Severity of the Risk of Injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The nature of the risk of injury associated with crib toys is strangulation on the product. Strangulation injuries may result in death or permanent brain damage. For this reason, strangulation injuries have the potential to be of the utmost severity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the likelihood of a strangulation incident involving a crib toy is relatively small. During the period from January, 1973, through February, 1993, 28 children died in strangulation accidents associated with crib toys, an average of three deaths every two years (22). During the same period, one child sustained permanent brain damage from a strangulation accident associated with a crib toy (22). At the same time, however, an estimated 10 to 25 million crib toys were sold each year, and an estimated 50 million crib toys were in use on any given date (23).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Inflation Drops Below 4 Percent"] </F>   [Excerpts] (ANSA) Rome, June 21 -- Inflation rates in eight  major cities fell in June to an average of 3.7-3.8 percent,  according to provisional figures released Tuesday [21 June] by  the statistics institute Istat [Central Statistics Institute].    This is the first time in 25 years that the average rate has  fallen below 4 percent.    Food prices bucked the trend, rising higher than the average  in June while clothing prices remained stable and electricity  and heating costs varied greatly, falling in Bologna, Milan,  Florence and Trieste but rising in Venice, Genoa and Naples.  [passage omitted]    Premier Silvio Berlusconi and Labour Minister Clemente  Mastella were amongst those who welcomed the low inflation  figures after they were announced on Tuesday. "I hope this news  does the markets good," said Berlusconi, "but often money  markets have a logic all of their own, which is frequently far  from reality."    For Mastella, the inflation figures could have positive  repercussions for the labour market: "I hope these figures help.  Falling consumer prices make it possible to proceed rapidly in  the contract negotiation field."    Unionists, who met with government ministers for cost of  labour talks this morning, saw the latest provisional inflation  figures as a sign that a mini-budget promised by Treasury  Minister Lamberto Dini yesterday would not be necessary.    "The fall in inflation shows that no corrective measures are  necessary," said Sergio Cofferati of the CGIL [Italian General  Confederation of Labor] union. "These conditions are right for  reducing interest rates and thus keep the borrowing requirement  under control."</p>

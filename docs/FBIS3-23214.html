			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] Official spokespersons for the Army Information  and Press Department [DIDE] have blamed the URNG [Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity) for a terrorist attack early  Sunday morning on the route to the Atlantic area.    [Begin recording] Reporter: What information do  you have on the explosion at the bridge over the San Juan River?    Unidentified DIDE spokesperson: Once more the URNG  has attacked Guatemalan society. This time they have blown up  the San Juan Bridge located at the 20-kilometer marker on the  highway to the Atlantic area.    For the time being, the Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers  is  working in the area to put a Bailey bridge in place. This  Bailey bridge costs 2,530,562 quetzales, and repairs to the  bridge that was blown up will cost approximately 5 million  quetzales. This ungrateful action by the URNG will cost  Guatemalans 7,530,652 quetzales.    In addition, the action involves costs in the economic,  business, and transportation sectors, as well as the threat and  danger posed to the Guatemalan people at the time of the  explosion. The Guatemalan people are still running a risk while  the bridge is being repaired.    Reporter: What type of explosives were used this  time?    DIDE spokesperson: The information we have is that  strong dynamite charges were used.    Reporter: How long will it take the Army engineers  to repair the damage?    DIDE spokesperson: In this case, the URNG destroys  while the Army builds. The Guatemalan Army Corps of Engineers  is setting up the Bailey bridge at this time. Traffic will be  restored at approximately 1700 today, but it will take another  48 hours for the bridge to be fully operational.    Reporter: Why did the URNG blow up this bridge?    DIDE spokesperson: Right now we don't know. I  don't think that is really important. What is important is  that with this action, the URNG is showing how much respect it  has for Guatemalans' human rights.    Reporter: What do you think of the URNG blowing up  this bridge in Guatemala while holding peace talks in Mexico?    DIDE spokesperson: This is very contradictory.  While it is attending negotiations and holding talks for the  benefit of all Guatemalans, at the same time it is acting  against our society. The truth is that it is very regrettable.  Guatemala is no longer willing to tolerate such actions.  Actually, the damage to our country goes beyond all estimates.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Canadians to vote on changes to constitution CANADA'S prime minister, Mr Brian Mulroney, is expected to call a national referendum in the next few days, in the hope of speeding ratification of proposals for a new national-unity constitution. The constitutional proposals, the most sweeping since the formation of Canada 125 years ago, have recently received two important endorsements. Quebec's ruling Liberal party gave its overwhelming support to the package at a special convention in Quebec City. In addition, the federal New Democratic party, one of two national opposition parties, has decided to campaign in favour of the proposals. The most likely date for the referendum, which would be the third in Canadian history, is October 26. The only strident opposition to the constitutional package so far has come from Quebec separatists. Before last weekend's Liberal party convention, opinion polls showed Quebecois split almost evenly between supporters and opponents of the deal, but with a large pool of undecided voters. The constitutional proposals, settled at a meeting of federal and provincial leaders on Prince Edward Island late last week, are a careful compromise between Quebec and the rest of the country. No region or population group has been able to claim that it is either an outright winner or loser. Key elements of the package include converting the Senate, the upper house of parliament, from an appointed to an elected body; guaranteeing Quebec at least 25 per cent of seats in the House of Commons; granting a limited form of self-government to aboriginal people; and transferring various powers from federal to provincial jurisdiction. Speculation is mounting that Mr Mulroney, prime minister since 1984, may resign if he succeeds in pushing the constitutional package through a referendum and ratification by the provincial legislatures.</p>

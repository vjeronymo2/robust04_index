			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut hope fades IT WAS an expensive day in the UK money markets yesterday, as dealers became increasingly pessimistic about an imminent cut in interest rates. However, the betting is still on for a reduction before the forthcoming general election. Furthermore, the relatively small size of the Bank of England's recent repurchase agreements - which have been running until the beginning of March  -has been fanning the market's hopes of a rate cut in the near future. There was a certain amount of speculation that the Bank of England could cut rates by less than the traditional  1/2 point. The March short sterling contract firmed just one basis point to 89.80, implying an interest rate of 10.2 per cent by the middle of March. The short end of the money market was tight, as the Bank offered assistance in small tranches until the afternoon. Overnight rates jumped as high as 12 per cent during the day, although they fell back to close at 10 5/8 - 9/16 per cent. One week money held steady at 10- 9/16 per cent. The key three months interbank rate was a touch below current 10 1/2 per cent interest rates at 10 7/16 - 5/16 per cent. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn, with bills falling due accounting for Pounds 921m. Treasury paper and maturing assistance accounted for a further Pounds 713m of the shortfall, while exchequer transactions fed Pounds 610m back into the market. Bankers' balances below target and note circulation drained Pounds 115m. The Bank gave early indications that it expected no changes in UK interest rates, with a mere Pounds 171m in assistance at a cost of 10 7/16 per cent, in the morning. The rate hovered around that mark for the rest of the day, with a further Pounds 578m in assistance at 10 3/8 and 10 7/16 per cent. The injections included bills for resale on March 3, 4 and 5, and band one bank and treasury paper. Late assistance totalled Pounds 505m, leaving the market only Pounds 46m short. Call money was unchanged in Germany at 9.50/60 per cent, still benefiting from the generous Bundesbank injection on Wednesday. However, the rate could rise in the next few days, said dealers, as a DM1.22bn four-year note falls due. The US Federal Reserve signalled no change in the funds rate with a matched sale-purchase agreement at 3 15/16 per cent. The presumed Fed target is 4 per cent.</p>

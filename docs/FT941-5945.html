			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Spanish interest rate surprise The Bank of Spain yesterday ignored the caution of other central banks and cut its benchmark intervention rate from 8.5 per cent to 8 per cent, writes Tom Burns from Madrid. The early morning cut surprised analysts, but reaction was positive. Bond yields which had risen to above 9.6 per cent fell to 8.8 per cent, the 3-month Mibor came down from 8.7 per cent to 8.3 per cent, Ibex-35, the index of the Madrid market's most traded equities, rose 2.4 per cent and the peseta held steady. Meanwhile, figures released yesterday revealed that GDP was down 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993 against a year earlier, but up by 0.1 per cent on the third quarter of 1993.</p>

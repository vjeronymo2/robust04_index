			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ashtead rights to raise Pounds 20.4m ASHTEAD, the plant and machinery hire group, has announced a rights issue to raise Pounds 20.4m to fund expansion. Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, explained that the board had seen a 'window of opportunity. The recession has shaken the plant hire sector to bits' and, as a result, 'there is no shortage of businesses to buy'. With the bulk of the money raised, he foresaw 'a series of acquisitions' in the UK. The group had waited until now, he said, when vendors were becoming more realistic about the value of their businesses. A-Plant, the core business, currently has 57 outlets, or 'profit centres', and Mr Lewis estimates it needs 130 for full national coverage. Some Pounds 4m of the rights money has been earmarked to broaden the group's Sunbelt Rentals operations in the south-eastern states of the US. So far, expanding Sunbelt to six profit centres had been cautious, Mr Lewis said, but the business had now reached critical mass. Ashtead planned to double the six to 12 by April 1995. About Pounds 500,000 of the cash raised will go towards the opening of an office of Ashtead Technology, the offshore services arm, in Singapore, to complement the operations in Aberdeen and Dubai. Ashtead said that trading conditions had improved in the current year. In the five months to September, turnover rose by 24 per cent, mostly through volume growth. The group is highly operationally geared, so profits should respond sharply. A BZW research note has lifted the profits forecast for the current year from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 5.2m. Last time profits were Pounds 2.76m. The rights is on a 1-for-3 basis at a price of 280p per new ordinary. It is underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The shares closed at 324p, up 1p on the day.</p>

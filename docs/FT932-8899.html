			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Franc fort policy wins the battle but not yet the war SO THE French franc has survived. Last week's devaluations of the peseta and escudo within the European exchange rate mechanism confirm both the emerging two-tier structure of monetary relations in Europe and France's membership of the northern core of hard currencies which cluster around the D-Mark. But French industry will continue to pay a high price for some time yet before the franc fort policy can finally be declared triumphant. French monetary policy has eased markedly in recent weeks as the pressure on the franc has eased. Official interest rates have been cut six times in six weeks: the latest  1/4 point cut in the influential 5-10 day intervention rate to 7.75 per cent last Thursday brings the cumulative fall in official short rates to 1.85 percentage points since peaking in autumn. The more important three-month money market rate has fallen by nearly 5 percentage points since then, from its 12 per cent high. Yet the real interest rate squeeze remains viciously tight. With annual consumer price inflation now barely above 2 per cent, short-term real interest rates are still well over 5 per cent, as the left-hand chart shows. They remain at least 2 percentage points higher than in Britain. Nor are long-term real interest rates, more important for French fixed-rate borrowers, significantly less severe. Ten-year French bond yields are a little above 7 per cent, only half a point above German long rates. But if France's newly independent central bank is going to deliver German-style inflation rates over the next 10 years, then long-term French real rates are still very high. Nominal French long-term rates are now half a point lower than UK rates, but few investors are expecting a similar inflation performance from the dependent Bank of England. French and German interest rates should fall further. But the loss of French trade competitiveness within Europe as a result of repeated devaluations by competitor currencies both within and outside the ERM will remain. More than 60 per cent of French exports are sold in European markets, of which half are sold outside the ERM's northern core. But, against a basket of European currencies, weighted by their share of French trade in Europe, the French franc has appreciated by 8.6 per cent since last September. This blow to export competitiveness is partially softened by the slow pace of French inflation relative to the rest of Europe. But the French real exchange rate, which measures trends in export price competitiveness by adjusting for relative inflation rates, has still appreciated since last September by 4 1/2 per cent within Europe, as the right-hand chart shows. The assorted realignments in the ERM since last autumn have, as a result, reversed the hard-won gains in competitiveness that the franc fort policy had accumulated. Between the beginning of 1987 and last summer, French competitiveness in Europe had risen by nearly 4 per cent. This occurred almost entirely because France had managed to maintain lower inflation than its European competitors, albeit at the cost of slower growth and rising unemployment. But the trade-weighted appreciation of the franc since then has more than wiped out these gains. These sacrifices have not necessarily been in vain. France does appear to have emerged from the ERM's recent turbulence with its inflation-fighting reputation substantially enhanced, in marked contrast to the UK. If the newly independent French central bank is able permanently to lock-in to inflation rates below 3 per cent, then this lost competitiveness can be quickly regained. But that implies more months of pain for French industry while economic growth in the UK, and in the other more inflation-prone countries of southern Europe, accelerates. The real test of the French political commitment to the franc fort policy begins now. CORRECTION. In the chart that accompanied international economic indicators on May 10, 1993, the label 'national investment' in the top section should have read 'national saving'.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS URGE CAUTION IN HOME EQUITY LOANS;  </P> <P> FINANCE: THE RATES ARE APPEALING, BUT SOME LOANS CALL FOR BALLOON PAYMENTS OR  HAVE HIDDEN COSTS THAT COULD CAUSE AN OWNER TO LOSE THE PROPERTY.  </P> <P> Home equity loans have developed a fast following in these troubled economic  times as more homeowners find themselves debt-ridden and cash-strapped.  </P> <P> Loans based on home values can give consumers tens of thousands of dollars at  relatively low interest rates. And unlike other loans, the interest in many  cases is tax deductible.  </P> <P> But experts warn that homeowners should exercise a great deal of caution before  using their most valuable possession as collateral.  </P> <P> "The house is the last major remaining asset folks have, and banks are all too  willing to loan against the house because the loans are fully collateralized,"  said Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a weekly newsletter based  in North Palm Beach, Fla.  </P> <P> Experts say the appeal of home equity loans -- with interest rates hovering one  to three percentage points above banks' prime rate -- should grow as rates  continue to decline. The prime rate for most major banks stands at 10%,  however, a few institutions recently lowered their rates to 9.75%.  </P> <P> Rates remain much higher on unsecured bank loans. The average interest rate  charged on a bank credit card was 18.83% in December, up from 18.60% at the  start of the year, according to Bank Rate Monitor. The average rate for a bank  personal loan was 17.34%, up from 17.19% in January, the publication said.  </P> <P> For home equity loans, banks typically lend up to 80% of a home's appraised  market value minus the amount owners owe on their mortgage.  </P> <P> More than $50 billion was lent out through home equity lines of credit in 1989,  and that figure is expected to grow 15% to 20% in 1990, according to the  American Bankers Assn.  </P> <P> Despite their growing popularity, experts warn, these loans can contain many  hidden costs that could run into hundreds of dollars, such as closing costs,  application fees and appraisal fees.  </P> <P> Also, if the prime rate rises, consumers with variable rates tied to the prime  can be hit with a big jump in their monthly payments.  </P> <P> Particularly risky is a so-called balloon note -- a loan that calls for  payments only on the interest for the first several years. After that, the  borrower must cough up payments on a big principal.  </P> <P> For those homeowners who don't need cash right away but want the flexibility of  long-term loan access, the option of choice is taking out an extended line of  credit against their home's value.  </P> <P> However, a few banks penalize consumers who don't borrow money from the credit  line, charging them an annual "non-usage" fee that can be about $50, Heady  said.  </P></p>

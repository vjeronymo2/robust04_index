			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Besedovskaya (NK-Press), Vladimir </F> Zarovskiy, staff reporter]    [Text] A high level of scabies and diphtheria incidence has  been reported in St. Petersburg. We should state though that the  chief expert of the St. Petersburg Sanitary-Epidemiological  Oversight, Oleg Parkov, denied in an interview with the NK-Press  Agency rumors about an epidemic allegedly breaking out in the  city. At the same time, he stated that in July 1993 alone, 333  scabies patients were recorded in the city. Of these, 74 are  children under the age of 14. The situation is further  complicated in that there is a catastrophic shortage of drugs in  the city.    As for diphtheria, St. Petersburg is ahead in the number of  patients and morbidity among Russian cities. In July alone, 158  cases of diphtheria were recorded; of these, eight patients have  died.    The first cases of diphtheria were recorded in Lithuania  this  year. A mother and daughter from Kaunas became ill on 2 Aug but  sought a physician's help only four days later. The girl who is  in a critical condition is in the resuscitation department.  There are speculations that she was infected by relatives from  St. Petersburg.</p>

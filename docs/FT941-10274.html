			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / People: Kate Barker follows up a hint Kate Barker, the new chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, says the first time she thought of applying for the job was when she was tipped for the spot in the Observer column of the FT. Barker, who is the first woman to be appointed to the post, is currently head of economics at Ford of Europe, the company which produced a former CBI director-general in Sir Terence Beckett. She says that, although she will miss the motor industry, she is looking forward to 'getting involved in the policy area'. Although Barker is replacing Andrew Sentance, who was director of economic affairs, she will take the title of chief economic adviser; this has been in abeyance since the departure of Douglas McWilliams. A further change in nomenclature sees Sudhir Junankar, previously deputy director of economic affairs, promoted to the post of associate director, economic analysis. Barker should not expect to replace Sentance in the Treasury's panel of seven 'wise men', however, which seems set to continue with six, now that Sentance has joined the London Business School. Nevertheless, Barker has some experience of advising the Treasury; she has been sitting on its panel of industrial economists, which meets three times a year. Barker, who obtained a first in PPE at Oxford and describes herself as 'very broadly a neo-Keynesian', takes up her appointment in March.</p>

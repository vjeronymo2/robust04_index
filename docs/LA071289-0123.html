			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Merger Postponed: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco granted the  California attorney general's request to postpone for 30 days the merger of  American Stores' Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains, according to Sanford  N. Gruskin, an assistant attorney general. The delay was granted so that the  attorney general's office could appeal to the Supreme Court in the hope of  permanently blocking the merger, which it claims will result in higher food  prices. Gruskin said that for the postponement to take effect the attorney  general's office must post a bond to cover any losses that American Stores  might incur should the Supreme Court turn down the appeal. The size of that  bond is to be determined by the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

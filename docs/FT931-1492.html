			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Troubled times at Timex VIOLENCE ON the picket line at Timex, and a rash of strikes and strike threats on the railways, in the coal industry and at Ford, smack of an old-fashioned bout of British labour militancy. Appearances, however, are deceptive. All of these actions are defensive, about job security rather than pay, and all, apart from Timex, are limited in duration, designed primarily to provide a focal point for media campaigns. Elsewhere there is no sign of a general pick-up in strike action. Indeed, at a time of very high unemployment, employers are finding it increasingly easy to push through pay freezes, especially in manufacturing. Nevertheless, the Timex dispute does raise some questions about Britain's labour laws. The conflict has little to do with the employment legislation of the 1980s, except for the question of how far a trade union can support its members in a dispute without exposing itself to legal attack. But it does show that the law can be clumsy, and possibly unhelpful to both sides, when dealing with the changes to employees' pay and conditions increasingly demanded by competitive product markets. The Timex dispute was originally about lay-offs. The company wanted to shed a group of workers. The workforce suggested laying off different groups in rotation and struck to support that position. The workers eventually decided to return to work but refused to accept the less favourable terms and conditions which the company had meanwhile decided to impose. The company therefore sacked the whole workforce, including those who had worked through the original dispute. This story illustrates two facts of British labour law. First, it is often difficult for employers to change an employment contract without consent, even when they have good grounds. Second, since British workers have no right to strike, employees can be sacked for breach of contract even if a proper ballot has taken place. The result is that employers can be tempted to use strikes about one problem to sort out another. Timex said it was forced to sack its employees in order to change their contracts of employment; otherwise each individual could have taken it to court. Employers can give notice of termination of existing contracts and provide new ones, but anyone not accepting the new contract can claim unfair dismissal. In defending itself against such claims, the company would have to show that the changes were necessary and that they were fairly introduced. It is in the interests of employers and trade unions that the framework of employment contract law should be as clear as possible and that everyone should respect lawfully agreed contracts. Labour law reformers should focus on this objective.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (11): A new set of challenges - Derivatives The growing use of derivative instruments by fund managers has created a new set of challenges for global custodians - challenges which only a relatively small number of custodians are meeting, according to some of their clients. So far, European fund managers have been slower to jump on the derivatives bandwagon than their US counterparts. Those who do use derivative instruments tend to limit themselves to standardised futures and options traded on exchanges. Few have started to use over-the-counter instruments specially designed and sold by banks, such as swaps, which can be extremely complex and esoteric. But the use of derivatives is expected to become more widespread in the next few years, so there is likely to be growing demand for custodial services which are designed to suit the special requirements of derivative as well as cash instruments. For example, Bankers Trust, which is custodian of Dollars 1,000bn of assets worldwide, estimates that 30-50 per cent of fund managers with more than Dollars 500m under management are using or reviewing the use of derivatives. 'Traditional custodians provide custody for physical securities,' says Mr Alex Over, head of sales for UK pension funds, Global Securities Services at Bankers Trust in London. 'Their systems are only geared to physical assets, and have to be tweaked to handle derivatives.' According to Mr Aidan Dennis, product development manager at Chase Global Securities Services, the needs of clients have not changed fundamentally. 'They still want to hear about their positions on a daily and weekly basis,' he says. But the advent of more complex instruments has meant that a straightforward listing of assets may no longer be considered adequate. In fact, a frequent complaint of fund managers using derivatives is that the reports they get from custodians are extremely difficult to understand. These days, Chase provides some clients with three different reports: a list of assets, a valuation of assets and a calculation of net exposure. According to Mr Over of Bankers Trust, custody is 'rapidly becoming an information business'. Increasingly, clients rate valuation and accounting services as highly as custody and settlement services. The custodians at the forefront of derivatives custody tend to be those with a strong in-house derivatives capability on the investment banking side of their business, which gives them a competitive advantage. 'Our systems are developed by investment banking. The growth in the number of (derivative) instruments is phenomenal. Without their input, we would not be able to develop quickly enough to keep with the changes in the market,' said Mr Dennis of Chase. While the majority of fund managers using derivatives limit themselves to futures, where their main demand is for custodians to deal with margin requirements, some clients have more sophisticated needs. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) recently farmed out ECU260m (USDollars 296m) of assets (of its total liquidity of more than ECU1bn) to six fund managers, and appointed Bankers Trust to act as custodian for the funds. One of the key issues for the EBRD in choosing a custodian was the ability to handle the reporting and settlement of complex derivative instruments. Unlike most pension or insurance funds, the EBRD funds can be invested only in fixed income assets, but a wide range of derivative instruments are allowed, including over-the-counter instruments, such as swaps, caps and floors. 'Typically the clients of custodians in Europe have been pension funds, with broad asset class allocations between equities, bonds and cash,' said Mr Andrew Donaldson, a treasury official at the EBRD. Unlike derivatives, the reporting of these instruments is very straightforward, he says. 'When you look at what different custodians do there is a huge range in their abilities. Many pension fund custodians can handle equities very well but get tripped up by more complex instruments. They are not set up to handle derivatives.' Bankers Trust has drawn on skills from the W M Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary which specialises in performance measurement and portfolio valuation and accounting, as well as from the investment banking side of its business, it is a market leader in derivatives engineering. Because the W M Company has 80 data feeds from different sources, Bankers Trust can offer cost effective and accurate marking to market. 'We can do it because we can leverage off an existing capability,' says Mr Over. The issue of valuation is rather a grey area, partly because fund managers are themselves still coming to grips with it. There are no set accounting standards for derivatives, as there are for physical assets. A year ago, Mr Glyn Pete, a director of Lazard Investors, chaired a committee of the Pensions Research Accountants Group (Prag), an association of 200 UK pension fund practitioners, which published guidelines on the use of futures and options by pension funds concentrating on how best to meet reporting, control and performance measurement demands. The report, according to Mr Pete, has not been welcomed with open arms. 'Many of the people I talk to are aware of the report, and when they sit down and decide how to incorporate derivatives into their portfolios they look at it, but it has not been accepted across the board,' said Mr Pete. He added that a number of global custodians are looking at the standards and working on implementing them into their derivatives services. Global custodians make money by charging relatively small fees for handling massive amounts of money. Although extra charges are made for dealing with derivatives, they are generally small. Nevertheless, the ability to offer custody services which deal with derivatives as well as cash instruments is likely to become an increasingly important marketing ploy for custodians. Mr Dennis thinks that this ultimately means that 'those that can't play in the derivatives market will not be able to play in the custody markets'.</p>

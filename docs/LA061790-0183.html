			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOOD COVERAGE TO SPARE  </P> <P> I would just like to thank ESPN for its fine coverage of the Masters Bowling  Tournament on May 19.  </P> <P> ESPN allowed the bowlers to finish out their games while we watched rather than  going to commercials, and the last game was played without commercial  interruption. It was so different from watching ABC, which is continually going  to commercials while the competitors bowl through their frames, and then  apprises viewers of the scores afterward. I don't know of any other sports  where that sort of thing is allowed to happen. If it did, the fans would be  irate, but even now in bowling it is allowed to continue this way.  </P> <P> Toni Jacobson, Monterey Park  </P></p>

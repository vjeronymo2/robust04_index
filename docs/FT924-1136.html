			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / International Company News: Kerkorian group files fraud lawsuit A GROUP led by Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the investor who in 1990 sold Hollywood's MGM to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier, yesterday filed a lawsuit alleging fraud and conspiracy by Credit Lyonnais, the French state bank that backed Mr Parretti. The California legal action, which seeks Dollars 675m plus damages from Credit Lyonnais, is a countersuit which follows a recent Dollars 500m action against Mr Kerkorian by Credit Lyonnais. The French bank provided loans that helped Mr Parretti to buy MGM for Dollars 1.3bn from Mr Kerkorian in 1990. But last year the Italian financier was forced out of the studio and Credit Lyonnais took control of MGM.</p>

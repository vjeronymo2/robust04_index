			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Accountancy rules relief attacked Plans to release 90 per cent of companies from compliance with most accounting standards were attacked yesterday by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. The accountancy profession's working party on standards, commissioned by the Accounting Standards Board, has said that small companies should be exempt from most of the rules. The working party said complicated accounting standards were an inefficient burden and could lead to the loss of a competitive advantage when private information was disclosed. It proposed that small companies, as defined by the Companies Act, should be exempt from most standards and all new ones unless a special case was made by the standards board. But Mr Peter Langard, vice-president of the chartered association, said the proposals - which are out for public consultation - could reduce the comparability of accounts for companies 'which form the backbone of British industry'. The chartered association said the cost of compliance with standards would not be removed by the proposals because as the main burden for companies was meeting the requirements of the Companies Act. Mr Langard said: 'Accounting standards help both preparers and users to make sense of existing rules, which often fail to prescribe an appropriate accounting base. 'Exemption could be made on a case-by-case basis only, when it can be demonstrated that there are significant cost burdens arising from the application of a particular standard.'</p>

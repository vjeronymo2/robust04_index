			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Tetsu Miyazawa] </F>   [Text] Nissan Motor has decided to increase four or five  times the amount of sun visor imports from the U.S. Prince  Company within two years. At present, it is installing them only  on some high-class cars such as the "Leopard J Ferry" and  "Cima," but they are expanding use to compact cars. In addition  to the price being two to three times cheaper than Japanese  products, the design is superior and the response to small  design changes is said to be quick, on a par with Japanese  manufacturers. It is not the result of outside pressure for  purchase of U.S. products, but that the Nissan design team is  charmed and praises them, saying "Prince Company potential is  wonderful" (Masatomo Okahara, deputy manager, International  Procurement Department).    Nissan has worked out a voluntary plan to purchase U.S.  products in the amount of $4.3 billion (80-percent increase over  actual amount in fiscal 1992) in fiscal 1997. Moreover, as a  trump card to survive in the low price competition era, they  recently have put on sale the "Sunny Lukino" which falls greatly  below 1 million yen without an air conditioner. The profit  margin simply becomes smaller the more the price is lowered.  There is no wait to use overseas parts which have the advantage  in cost.    "We are scouting excellent companies like Prince and drawing  out their best" (Masaaki Machida, chief officer, International  Procurement Department). Nissan's purchase policy on overseas  parts manufacturers is strict control of local manufacturers on  cost, differing somewhat from the Toyota Motor style which does  basic retraining.    That position can be perceived in the MIG (manufacturing  improvement group) activities which U.S. Nissan Motor  Manufacturing Co. (NMMC; Tennessee), the U.S. base for Nissan  Motor, has been implementing at targeted parts manufacturers  with whom they do business locally since 1993. The main details  are that MIG's divide those with whom they do business into  groups by region and each group voluntarily holds field trips to  superior plants and they mutually hold study groups to propose  cost reductions to each other.    MIG's have already been formed in the three regions of  Tennessee, Michigan, and Kentucky. Five to seven companies  participate in the respective groups and they anticipate further  expansion of the number of companies and regions in the future.  Although NMMC takes the lead in activities such as the study  groups, "Basically, the main body is spontaneous activities by  the local parts manufacturers" (Deputy Manager Okahara).    One result is that the U.S. Davis Company, a major  manufacturer of pressed parts such as oil pans, voluntarily  prepared a manual on rationalization suiting its own company  based on the rationalization methods learned in the study group  with Nissan Motor. As a result of applying this to subsidiary  secondary and tertiary manufacturers, its has realized a large  overall cost reduction.    Moreover, "The places permanently stationing businessmen who  can speak Japanese have increased among U.S. manufacturers with  whom we do business," and that effect seems to be spreading.    It is said that Toyota and Nissan have traditionally  differed  greatly in methods of demanding rationalization. The person in  charge of the auto industry at a certain think tank says,  "Toyota gets into the management of parts companies and finds  and implements types of fine cost reductions. With Nissan, there  are many examples where they leave it voluntarily up to the  parts company after they have indicated goals." The difference  in posture of both companies domestically can also be perceived  in overseas purchase policy.    Insofar as viewing the settlement of accounts of the parts  manufacturers affiliated with both companies in the past few  years in Japan, the Toyota style wins. The answers to how the  differentiation will be in the future overseas and how much  overseas parts can be managed are yet to come.</p>

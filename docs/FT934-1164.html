			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Technology: Teddy gets interactive - Manufacturers are seeking to produce cost-effective high-tech toys High-tech toys may seem a contradiction to many people, but toy manufacturers keep trying. Barbies with holographed ball gowns, teddy bears which converse with television characters and interactive Sesame Street CDs are a few of the futuristic playthings which have made their way onto store shelves this Christmas. Although novelties like these can offer a big payback at the cash register, they can also be risky for manufacturers. High technology often implies high cost, and toys are a low-cost industry. 'Most parents won't spend that much on a toy,' says John Handy, vice-president in charge of design for Mattel toys, a leading US toy maker. 'The vast majority of toys retail in the Dollars 5 to Dollars 30 range, so we have to spin our magic with relatively low-cost technology.' Many manufacturers stumble on this point. The toy company, Worlds of Wonder, for instance, thought it had hit the jackpot when it developed the 'Julie Doll'. 'Julie' used advanced voice recognition techniques. For instance, if a child expressed fatigue, the doll would recognise the word 'tired' and respond 'I'm tired too; let's go to bed.' Although an enchanting plaything, the project was scuppered by exorbitant production costs. To make matters worse, children can be exacting customers. 'Children lose interest easily, so the toys have to be extremely entertaining,' Handy continues. 'They also have to be sturdy, able to withstand a lot of play, and they have to meet very strict safety standards. Materials must be non-toxic, and incapable of inflicting damage to small children.' To meet the considerable challenge of designing high-tech toys, manufacturers have developed various strategies. Yes] Entertainment Corporation, a US toy maker, follows the maxim: 'Keep it simple'. Yes] is putting out a product called TV Teddy, which interacts with personalities on the television screen. Consumers receive video tapes when they purchase the stuffed bear. The star of one of the tapes is Anthony, a kindly gentleman with an affection for attics. TV Teddy works through a radio signal sent out from the TV screen. 'We've encoded extra audio information into a standard TV signal,' explains Lawrence McKracken, director of engineering for the group. 'Most video information contains a visual track and an audio track. Our third audio track is picked up by the teddy bear.' The technology is deceptively simple, yet the company says it can be adapted to a number of different products. 'The most important thing is that there's no limit to what Teddy can say,' says chairman and chief executive office Donald Kingsboro. 'Is this the most sophisticated interactive technology around? No. But the point is that it's available now, and it's cheap.' TV Teddy retails for about Dollars 69 (Pounds 46). Over the next few years, the company plans to launch what it calls a 'new generation of multi-media toys'. TV Teddy will soon be able to interact with regularly scheduled network programmes. Yes] has signed an agreement to have the stuffed bear interact with an ABC Children's special sometime in early 1994, and says similar deals are in the pipeline. 'The next step is to have the child interact with the programme directly,' says Kingsboro. 'We may provide a hand-held piece of plastic which kids could enter answers on during children's game shows. Or promote a 'draw on the screen' concept. Maybe not directly on the screen, because not many parents want their children that close to the set. But on a hand-held video picture which would also appear on the television screen.' 'Interactive' is a buzz word for toys this season, and Yes] is not the only company capitalising on the new craze. Philips, the Dutch electronics group, hopes for Christmas success with interactive CD/videos for children. Philips has a very different formula than Yes] for keeping costs down. 'Our philosophy is that if the parents buy the hardware for themselves, they'll invest in extra software for the kids,' said David McElhatten, president of the games division for Philips. In October , Philips began putting out a sophisticated product which connects CDs' audio capabilities with video technology. Dubbed 'CD-I' for 'compact disc-interactive', Philips's new CDs hold video games, and feature-length films. The technology is designed to give viewers more control over viewing and listening habits. For instance, a work-out tape can be programmed individually to play the music the consumer wants and the specific exercises the consumer wants. Music CDs can be modified to exclude songs the listener does not like, and Philips claims its videos and films are far more durable than anything available in tape form. Despite the technology's obvious appeal to adults, Philips says nearly 30 per cent of its software sales in CD-I are in children's entertainment. The group is even selling large volumes of its hardware in toy stores like FAO Schwarz. Children are offered a wide variety of video games to choose from, with popular characters like the Sesame Street muppets and the Berenstain Bears. US toy manufacturers Hasbro and Mattel are treading yet another path to cost-effective high-tech toys. Mattel has applied its colour-changing technology to as many toys as possible in an attempt to lower development costs. The manufacturer incorporates a temperature-sensitive paint into everything from dolls to paints. Li'l Miss Candi Stripes, for instance, sports a white bathing suit that turns pink in cold water. Her blonde hair and lips also turn pink and orange in the cold. Mattel has just expanded its colour-changing repertoire with a new product, Solar Gak, a dough-like substance, which changes colour when exposed to ultraviolet light (ie the sun). Keeping an eye on the shrinking cost of various technologies is also important, say toy manufacturers. Computer chips, for instance, were once formidably expensive, but have now become so cheap that they can be widely used in children's products. Hasbro has capitalised on low-cost, high-memory chips to produce Talking Barney, a stuffed green dinosaur which says 500 different phrases at random. 'Before, six or seven sayings were considered a lot,' says Sharon Hartley, vice president of marketing for Playskool, the Hasbro division that makes Talking Barney. 'But additional memory has become so cheap now that we've been able to use it in a number of toys.' With the cost of technology diminishing rapidly, toy manufacturers say their products will soon use technologies once thought too expensive even for the adult consumer market. 'We have to keep an eye on the technology market, because it can help us provide that element of magic which is so important in play,' says Hartley. 'And as these technologies get cheaper, they should become increasingly easy for the toy market to tap.'</p>

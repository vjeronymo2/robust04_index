			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Health chief quits in Brazil trip row The director of Health Promotion Wales, a government-funded body, resigned last night after Labour alleged he had claimed fraudulent expenses for foreign travel, Roland Adburgham writes. Professor John Catford was accused under parliamentary privilege by Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West and a Labour frontbench spokesman on Wales, of taking a trip to Brazil for personal reasons. Mr Morgan said: 'It is yet another unacceptable face of Welsh quangoland.' The professor, who had been executive director of the body since 1987, also resigned from the chair of health promotion and education at the University of Wales. Last night, he said his resignations were because a 'silly and regrettable' affair with a female colleague while on a professional trip to Brazil, had become public knowledge. 'There was no abuse of public funds,' he said.</p>

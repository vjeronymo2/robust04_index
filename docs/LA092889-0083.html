			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> HEARING SLATED ON COUNTY PESTICIDE WAREHOUSE  </P> <P> Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Norwalk) has scheduled a public hearing on a  laboratory and pesticide warehouse that the county is building on its Rancho  Los Amigos property in Downey.  </P> <P> Epple told the Downey City Council on Tuesday night that he opposes county  plans to use the warehouse to store pesticides and rodent poison. He said he  will invite state health and agricultural officials to the meeting to help  determine if the facility will pose a danger to the surrounding community.  </P> <P> The laboratory and warehouse will be used by the Agricultural Commissioner and  Department of Weights and Measures, which will move from its facility in nearby  Pico Rivera.  </P> <P> County officials contend that the facility will be safe. But city officials and  residents say it could be dangerous in the event of a pesticide spill or fire  because it will be near residential neighborhoods and the Rancho Los Amigos  Medical Center.  </P> <P> A handful of placard-carrying residents demonstrated against the facility in  front of Downey City Hall on Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The public hearing will be held at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 11 in the City Council  chamber. The facility is scheduled to be completed in April.  </P></p>

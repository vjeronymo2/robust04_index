			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y in default on CDollars 17m payment HOLDERS of a series of Olympia &amp; York bonds have declared the cash-strapped property developer in default, and are threatening legal action if overdue interest payments are not made next week. O&amp;Y failed to make interest payments of CDollars 17m (Pounds 8m) last Monday on CDollars 325m worth of bonds secured by First Canadian Place, a 72-storey building in Toronto. Under the bonds' trust indenture, O&amp;Y is barred from taking rent from the property for itself before debt-service payments have been met. Following a meeting on Tuesday, representatives of about three-quarters of the bondholders have delivered a formal notice of default. O&amp;Y has until May 14 to make the payments. The bondholders, which include several US and European institutions, are due to meet their trustee, Royal Trust, in Toronto today. They are expected to demand that Royal Trust assigns rents or seizes the building if O&amp;Y fails to meet the payments by next Thursday. Royal Trust will put forward a compromise proposed by O&amp;Y. Alternatively, the bondholders are asking a group of Canadian banks, which hold a third mortgage on the property, to meet the interest payments. They contend that the banks have more to lose if the bondholders sell the building in the current depressed market. One investment adviser who represents several pension funds, said yesterday he had 'a fiduciary duty to go after this vigorously'. He said the bondholders were angry O&amp;Y had not consulted them in advance. O&amp;Y faces the dilemma, however, that if these creditors are paid, others are likely to demand equal treatment. For instance, a group of Japanese institutions agreed last month to defer USDollars 62m (Pounds 34.4m) in interest due on a Eurobond secured by part of Manhattan's World Financial Centre. Meanwhile, GW Utilities and Gulf Canada Resources, both controlled by O&amp;Y, said they were jointly seeking a buyer for their combined 63.5 per cent stake in Home Oil, a Calgary-based energy producer. The two companies have appointed First Boston to arrange a sale. At current market prices, GW and Gulf's stake in Home would fetch about CDollars 600m.</p>

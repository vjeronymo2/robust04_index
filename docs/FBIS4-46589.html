			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: "MIGs for India?"] </F>   [Text] DELHI, 31 May. (ITAR-TASS). Russia is to provide the  Indian Air Force with the first lot of MIG-29M fighter-bombers  in the near future under the terms of a contract calling for  selling to India 30 of these units and six MIG-29UB (combat  training) types costing a total of 25 billion rupees (about 780  million dollars). This was disclosed here by high-level Indian  sources. According to these sources, MIG shipments will be  initiated as early as this summer. The aircraft will effect a  considerable improvement in combat capability of the Republic's  Air Force, since "they can effectively both perform interception  and deliver strikes against ground targets located in an enemy's  deep rear."    Sergey Anishchenko, the Delhi representative of the state  company Rosvooruzheniye, made a corroboration of the above to  the ITAR-TASS correspondent, stating that the Russian side did  indeed dispatch to its Indian partners an offer to supply the  MIGs, with 10 units to be furnished via state credit and 20  units on commercial credit. Since Moscow has not yet received an  official reply, he characterized the abovementioned delivery  time as "overly optimistic." However, S. Anishchenko expressed  the hope that a reply may be forthcoming in the next few days as  a result of an official visit to Russia to be made by Prime  Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao in the end of June.    Russian military cooperation has definitely been on the rise  in the last few months after several years of a downward slide.  In the middle of May, the Indian Ministry of Defense announced  that the MIG Aviation Scientific Production Complex imeni A.  Mikoyan, operating in an atmosphere of stiff competition with  English, French, and Israeli companies, won a bid for  refurbishing more than 100 MIG-21BIS aircraft, which constitute  the backbone of the Republic's Air Force. Rosvooruzheniye  General Director Viktor Samoylov recently signed here a series  of agreements relating to constructing in the docks of Goa and  Bombay a series of fast attack watercraft and frigates.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Lloyd's Names face Pounds 200m loss: Stricken syndicate sees debt estimates rise sharply in recent months ABOUT 1,000 Names, including the actress Ms Susan Hampshire, face possible losses between them of up to Pounds 200m in one of the biggest syndicate collapses at the troubled Lloyd's insurance market. The Names, individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's, are members of syndicate 475, whose underwriter, Mr Roy Bromley, committed suicide last month. Syndicate 475 specialised in 'spiral' reinsurance - in which syndicates and companies insure each other's exposures to high level catastrophe loss. Although relatively small with a capacity, or capital base, of Pounds 25m in 1989, its losses are proportionally worse than the better known 'spiral' syndicates such as those managed by the Gooda Walker and Feltrim agencies. Its losses are far worse than agents feared two months ago when Names were told to expect a deficit of about Pounds 50m. Overall Lloyd's losses are expected to amount to about Pounds 5bn over the past five years. Despite recent management changes, the market is weighed down by its past losses and growing legal actions between Names and their agents. Mr Trevor Bradley, managing director of Knightstone Group, which took over management of the syndicate last October, said that 1989 losses could amount to between Pounds 74.8m and Pounds 175.7m, with Names losing a maximum of Pounds 70,000 for every Pounds 10,000 traded on the syndicate. Further losses of between Pounds 18m and Pounds 32.6m are forecast for 1990, when Names stand to lose up to Pounds 13,000 for every Pounds 10,000 traded. 'It is a very sad affair,' said Mr Bradley, who predicted losses would fall midway between best and worst case estimates. The syndicate's own reinsurance was insufficient to cover losses stemming from hurricane Hugo in 1989, the European storms of 1990 and a string of other losses. Mr Bradley said that claims would continue to affect the syndicate for many years. Names would be asked to pay only Pounds 21.3m of the 1989 loss this year, following a request for about Pounds 12m last year. Mr Bromley lost his job as underwriter in May 1991 and had become dispirited about the way the syndicate's losses had mounted. 'Things were going badly for him. There is no doubt he was very distressed about the way things were going,' said Dr Paul Knapman, the coroner, at his inquest last week. Mr Bromley's son, Nicholas, told the inquest: 'He was calm on the surface, but underneath it there was a degree of panic and fear.'</p>

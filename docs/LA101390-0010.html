			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A'S HAVE ATTITUDE, BUT IT'S WRONG ONE  </P> <P> A true champion is a person or team that wins with class, dignity, integrity  and humility.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, these qualities are altogether lacking in the chemistry of the  Oakland Athletics. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Dennis Eckersley's  finger-pointing and fist-waving, Rickey Henderson's selfish quest for the  batting title, Jose Canseco's public comeuppances, and especially Dave  Stewart's verbal trashings of opposing players and teams.  </P> <P> The Athletics can lay claim to having won the most games of any team in the  past three years, to defeating opponents in the past three championship series  and to winning last year's World Series. But true champions?  </P> <P> Try the 1988 Dodgers.  </P> <P> TIM DUMENJICH  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

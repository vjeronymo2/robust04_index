			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIMITZ FREEWAY DEATH TOLL SHARPLY LOWERED;  </P> <P> DISASTER: POWERFUL AFTERSHOCKS AWAKEN BAY AREA RESIDENTS BUT THERE ARE  INCREASING SIGNS OF A RETURN TO SOME OF THE ROUTINES OF NORMAL LIFE.  </P> <P> As if Bay Area emotions were not already tattered enough, residents were shaken  awake Thursday by powerful and destructive pre-dawn aftershocks, but as the day  went on there was good news in the collapsed rubble of the Nimitz Freeway and  the return to some routines of normal life.  </P> <P> Crews digging with jackhammers and cranes found many fewer cars than expected  crushed in the rubble of the Nimitz Freeway's upper deck, which collapsed on  motorists below in Tuesday's catastrophic 6.9-magnitude quake.  </P> <P> Disaster officials felt confident enough late Thursday to revise their fears  that more than 250 people may have died on the Nimitz.  </P> <P> "Now they are going lower, much lower in fact," said Lisa Covington, a  spokeswoman for the Office of Emergency Services. So far, 45 automobiles have  been pulled from the rubble and 18 bodies recovered, Oakland Mayor Lionel  Wilson said.  </P> <P> Another 27 automobiles were sighted but workers cannot yet tell if they contain  victims, Oakland Asst. Fire Chief Andy Stark said. About 720 feet of the  freeway upper deck lies too tightly on the lower level for searchers to look  underneath.  </P> <P> In all, at least 34 deaths have been confirmed in the Bay Area since the quake  that struck minutes before the start of a World Series game in San Francisco.  Unofficial reports have put the death toll as high as 39. There have been at  least 2,483 injuries, state officials said Thursday night. Oakland police said  167 people remain missing.  </P> <P> Damage was estimated at $4 billion and climbing. In Washington, House Speaker  Thomas S. Foley said Congress will consider a $2.5-billion aid package for the  Bay Area. Gov. George Deukmejian said an emergency, temporary tax increase --  probably in the form of higher gasoline or sales taxes -- may be needed.  </P> <P> President Bush was planning to leave Andrews Air Force Base before dawn today  to survey the quake damage and meet with officials on the scene.  </P> <P> As the second day of recovery began in good weather, many parts of the Bay Area  tried to pick up the normal pace of Northern California life.  </P> <P> Power was restored to all but about 100,000 customers, and many people returned  to offices and schools. Unlike Wednesday, when most people stayed home, there  was even commuter traffic snarls. By mid-afternoon the Bay Area Rapid Transit  system, which briefly shut down its transbay tube for inspection Wednesday  night, was running at 70% of normal and considering extending its hours to  operate all night.  </P> <P> But earthquakes are fickle phenomena, and word also came Thursday that the Bay  Bridge -- an integral institution of "normal life" in the Bay Area -- will be  closed indefinitely.  </P> <P> A thorough look at the damage inflicted by the quake found that an earlier  estimate of reopening the bridge in three weeks was unrealistic, said Anita  Yoder, a Caltrans spokeswoman in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Deukmejian issued an executive order that indefinitely suspended the collection  of tolls during morning rush hour on three bridges that remain open over the  Bay: the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge and the  Dumbarton Bridge. He requested that the independently run Golden Gate Bridge  also suspend toll collection.  </P> <P> The aftershocks, which shuddered as many as 5 million Bay Area residents out of  their first restful night's sleep since Tuesday, hit especially hard in Santa  Cruz County and put more urgency behind plans to airlift disaster aid into the  Santa Cruz area and Watsonville.  </P> <P> California 17, the main link used by 20% of Santa Cruz residents to reach jobs  in the San Jose area, suffered new damage and will be closed at least three  more weeks, county spokeswoman Dinah Phillips said.  </P> <P> Sewage from broken lines is being diverted into Monterey Bay and the county  declared Santa Cruz beaches unsafe for swimmers.  </P> <P> Water, gasoline, medical supplies and shelters for displaced families who may  be drenched by rains in the forecast were in short supply Thursday. More than  1,000 people are staying in shelters in the Santa Cruz area.  </P> <P> Food was also running short at local markets.  </P> <P> "All they had was Twinkies," said Kristen Jensen, a UC Santa Cruz student.  </P> <P> Three separate airlifts were planned to bring medical supplies and provisions  into Santa Cruz County. A plane from Santa Barbara left in the morning to ferry  medical supplies to three hospitals in the Santa Cruz area. The Air National  Guard plans to dispatch two helicopters from Mather Air Force Base to bring  supplies into Santa Cruz and nurses to Watsonville. The Salvation Army also  sent 9,500 gallons of water into Santa Cruz County  </P> <P> "Santa Cruz County is partially isolated," said Tom Mullins of the state  Emergency Medical Services Authority. "An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 residents  are using trucked-in water and large numbers are also without power."  </P> <P> At least 201 homes and apartment buildings and 72 commercial structures  sustained serious damage. Emergency shelter is needed because rain -- predicted  to fall in the next few days -- would make camping out more difficult for  displaced families.  </P> <P> Towns in the hills above Santa Cruz where the big earthquake was centered took  the worst brunt of it. Two-thirds of the 450 homes in the hamlet of Loma Prieta  were damaged, in Boulder Creek 60 buildings had major damage or were destroyed  and in Scotts Valley, 35 buildings were damaged. Nearby in Zayante 25 buildings  had major damage.  </P> <P> Electricity was expected to be restored in the hills by the weekend but water  supply remained a problem.  </P> <P> In Watsonville farther south, hundreds of people took to the streets after the  strongest aftershock at 3:15 a.m. Seismic labs estimated that the shock was  between 4.5 and 5.0 magnitude. It collapsed an historic church steeple, forced  closure of a bridge and set a fire that destroyed a mobile home.  </P> <P> "We had lived in very poor houses and had saved all we could. We don't know  where we are going to live now," said Berta Sandoval, whose farm worker family  took refuge in Callaghan Park after their home -- just purchased in May after  10 years of saving -- was knocked off its foundation.  </P> <P> Standing in Main Street looking at the damaged, 100-year-old St. Patrick's  Catholic Church, Watsonville police officer Jim Ihlen said: "It breaks our  hearts." The church almost certainly will have to be demolished. "It's our town  symbol, a piece of history that's gone."  </P> <P> Long lines formed at the few markets and gas stations open for business.  Phillips said much of downtown Watsonville is closed, a one block area of the  main street was virtually demolished and a levee was seriously damaged. More  than 150 homes probably will be condemned, said City Clerk Lorraine Washington.  Older brick and unreinforced concrete structures suffered the worst damage.  </P> <P> Also in Watsonville, the Green Giant frozen food processing building lost 20 to  40 million pounds of frozen food. That's a $5 million to $15 million loss,  Phillips said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Angry Residents  </P> <P> Sixty miles away in the Marina District of San Francisco, Mayor Art Agnos  mounted a van and tried to calm angry residents. They were upset that officials  had kept them out of their homes and that bulldozers had begun changing the  face of the trendy, well-to-do neighborhood by razing damaged buildings.  </P> <P> The neighborhood has some of the nicest views in the city, but was built on  fill over what used to be a cove on San Francisco Bay. The area suffered the  city's worst quake damage.  </P> <P> "Please understand we are doing our best to respond to the biggest crisis this  city has faced since 1906," Agnos said. But the mayor was booed when it became  clear that 50 to 100 buildings would be condemned, and that other residents  would be kept out of their homes indefinitely.  </P> <P> At the Nimitz Freeway in west Oakland, a large crowd of onlookers watched the  retrieval efforts, and hot dog vendors -- who began arriving soon after the  freeway collapsed -- did a brisk business feeding rescue workers and  spectators.  </P> <P> Police and fire crews from Los Angeles and other cities were also on the scene  shooting videotape to be used in training their own disaster teams.  </P> <P> Construction workers using blow torches and jackhammers and a "mini-max"  concrete cutter hoisted atop the rubble by helicopter methodically broke up  concrete slabs of freeway. Cranes eight stories high then plucked out the  chunks of concrete and the flattened cars. Workers said it could take six days  of around-the-clock work to dismantle the huge pile of debris.  </P> <P> Andy Stark, assistant chief of the Oakland Fire Department, said that the  meticulous process begins with two teams of 10 firefighters who map and measure  each 80-foot pillar-to-pillar section of the freeway, plotting where cuts in  the top level must be made to reach vehicles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mapping Code  </P> <P> Searchers quickly developed a code for that mapping process. Where they found a  car 40 feet toward the center of a section, they spray-paint "40" on a pillar,  and where no cars are found, they write "MT" for "empty." The letters "DOA" for  "dead on arrival" designate location of a body.  </P> <P> When cars were extricated, police and coroner's deputies worked to identify the  human remains. But the process was going slowly.  </P> <P> Stark said the teams were finding only about three cars in each of the  approximately 40 smashed sections of the freeway -- fewer than officials  originally estimated. But dozens of the "DOA" symbols were painted near the  southern pancaked portion of the wreckage.  </P> <P> "There are a couple of cars up there that are six or seven inches high. It's  pretty gruesome," said Brock Settlemier, president of Biggie Crane &amp;  Rigging Co. of San Leandro, which provided the cranes.  </P> <P> "It's unbelievable how the cars are crushed," Oakland police Sgt. Bob Crawford  said. "It looks like somebody took some tinfoil, just wadded it up and threw it  away."  </P> <P> At dawn Thursday, near the end of the 1 1/4-mile-long collapsed stretch of  Interstate 880, workers hauled out a crushed Japanese Acura automobile  virtually unrecognizable except for the steering wheel, which was intact. A  human arm was the only identifiable body part seen.  </P> <P> "It looked like if he had a few more seconds he would have been out of there,"  said Joe Everett, a construction worker.  </P> <P> Dan Getreau of the Milpitas Fire Department said he helped remove a mother and  a little girl, about 7, whose book was stuck on the inside of their car's  intact windshield. Workers, wearing gloves, needed a little more than an hour  to lift out the bodies after the tops of cars were cut off.  </P> <P> "It's not difficult," Getreau said, "except for the emotional part."  </P> <P> The morning's aftershocks did no apparent new damage. But Oakland Police Capt.  Jim Hahn said some space between layers had settled through the night. Crawl  spaces that were once four feet high had shrunk to inches, he said.  </P> <P> In downtown Santa Cruz, friends of Robin Ortiz, 22, stood watch Thursday as  workers searched for her inside the fallen-down Santa Cruz Coffee Roasting Co.  For many it had been a two-day vigil, marred when five of the friends were  arrested for objecting when police called off the search Wednesday night  because of darkness and danger from aftershocks.  </P> <P> About 30 friends had gathered outside the shop in the Pacific Garden Mall,  chanting her name, "Robin, Robin," and singing folk songs. Ortiz, a popular  employee of the shop, was last heard yelling at patrons to evacuate during the  main quake, which caused the roof to collapse.  </P> <P> Her body was finally pulled from the debris Thursday afternoon. The body of one  man had already been pulled out, and his injured girlfriend was rescued.  </P> <P> In Salinas in Monterey County, David Harris of the Office of Emergency Services  said the earthquake and its aftershocks had damaged 50 homes and seven  commercial structures.  </P> <P> For the first time, state officials also described the extent of damage to the  Bay Bridge, which connects San Francisco with the East Bay.  </P> <P> Before heavy equipment can be taken onto the bridge to make repairs, engineers  have decided that the Oakland reach of the four-mile-long bridge needs to be  reinforced. That process will take about a week, the state Department of  Transportation announced.  </P> <P> Once the bridge is stabilized, crews will use a crane to remove part of the  upper deck and place it on a barge moored in the bay. A 30-foot piece of the  upper deck, which carries cars headed into San Francisco, collapsed during  Tuesday's main quake onto the lower deck where traffic was bound for Oakland.  </P> <P> The upper deck will be repaired on the barge, then lifted back into position on  the bridge. But before the repaired section can be fitted back on the bridge,  engineers must fix the lower deck too.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the East Bay is linked with San Francisco by ferries, the  underwater Bay Area Rapid Transit system tube, and by long drives around the  bay to the Golden Gate or San Mateo bridges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Art Museum Damage  </P> <P> The San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner printed special, smaller  editions without ads again Thursday.  </P> <P> The quake toll in San Francisco was found Thursday to include at least $5  million damage to the Asian Art Museum, the largest collection of Asian art in  the Western world, and unspecified but serious damage at the the Mexican  Museum, home to one of the worlds' largest Mexican collections outside of that  country.  </P> <P> But the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum and the California Palace of the Legion  of Honor, two of San Francisco's best-known institutions, did not suffer  serious damage.  </P> <P> Some damage may not be detected for months. State officials inspected hundreds  of miles of fragile levees in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, finding  only minor cracks and seepage in isolated spots.  </P> <P> Officials fear that the quake could have weakened already leaky levees that are  vital to Northern California's recreation and ecology and California's water  system. Coming rains could add further strain.  </P> <P> This story was written by Times staff writers Kevin Roderick and Myrna Oliver  in Los Angeles based on staff reports from the Bay Area.  </P> <P> The following contributed to today's quake coverage: Times staff writers Louis  Sahagun, Maria L. La Ganga, Hector Tobar, Janny Scott, Lily Eng, Edwin Chen,  Jack Cheevers, Paul Jacobs, John Hurst, Jim Newton, Robert L.

Rabin, John  Glionna, Cathleen Decker, Carl Ingram and Michael Connelly; and Times  researchers Norma Kaufman, Tracy Thomas and Cecilia Rasmussen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REPAIRING THE BAY BRIDGE  </P> <P> Caltrans engineers have devised a novel plan to repair the San  Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the transportation backbone of the area that is  used by 480,000 commuters daily. A Caltrans spokeswoman said the repair -- in  which a crane will move the damaged span to a nearby barge -- will take from  three weeks to two months.  </P> <P> 1. Support towers and lower roadway will be reinforced in order to stabilize  damaged area.  </P> <P> 2. The damaged upper span will be picked up by barge-mounted crane and moved to  a second barge alongside the bridge for repair.  </P> <P> 3. While work proceeds on upper span, another crew will repair holes in the  lower span. The upper span will then be replaced and reattached to tower  supports.  </P></p>

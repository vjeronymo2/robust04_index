			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Floating to development and expansion - Maggie Urry reports on Parkdean's plan to shake off restrictions on growth GRAHAM Wilson twice tried to buy out the business he runs. The second time he succeeded. But now he is as keen to escape from the buy out structure which is cramping his plans to grow. The business is Parkdean Leisure, which operates seven caravan and chalet holiday parks in the UK - five in Scotland and two in East Anglia - and Mr Wilson's escape route is a flotation which is planned for next month. He aims to raise between Pounds 7m and Pounds 9m, with most being new money to repay the group's debt and preference shares. That will give the company a market value of up to Pounds 15m and leave Mr Wilson with the flexibility to develop the existing parks or buy more. Mr Wilson joined the company in 1981 when it was part of William Leech, the Newcastle based house builder. Leech had seen leisure parks as an asset-play, but, says Mr Wilson, did not want to put money into developing them. He was working on a management buy-out when Leech was taken over by Beazer in 1985. Beazer decided to keep the business and invest in it. But as its ambitions spread, Parkdean became less important to its parent once again. Mr Wilson achieved his aim with a Pounds 6.9m mbo in January 1989, when Parkdean had 5 parks. That involved a Pounds 2.5m term loan, Pounds 2m of deferred payments to Beazer and equity, including Pounds 2.17m worth of preference shares. Despite the hefty debt, Parkdean has managed to buy three new parks, while selling one; set up a telesales operation to market the holidays better; and develop the parks' accommodation and leisure facilities. But it has not been easy. Mr Wilson first approached brokers about a float only a year after the buy-out. He was told to 'come back when you're a grown up company'. In 1991, he raised another Pounds 1m of venture capital and eliminated part of the deferred payment to Beazer, since taken over by Hanson. But, Mr Wilson says, venture capital is expensive and the banking climate has been poor. There have been times when Parkdean's directors have had to 'hang on to our hats and go for it'. The alternative, he says, would have been to wind the group down, running it for cash to service the debt and preference shares. Now, Mr Wilson says, 'we have got to the point where we can't go any further because of the structure'. In the financial year to end November 1992, Parkdean achieved an operating profit of Pounds 1.3m, up from Pounds 1.03m in 1991. But from that interest charges of Pounds 800,000, tax, and preference dividends of Pounds 200,000, left little to repay debt and invest in the business. Despite the stringencies Mr Wilson and his team have demonstrated an ability to buy and develop parks, significantly increasing their profits in the process. With the industry highly fragmented there should be plenty of opportunities to apply the skills to more acquisitions, and spread the overheads - such as the telesales operation - more widely. Only a few months after the buy out, in June 1989, Parkdean bought Grannie's Hielan' Hame, a caravan park on the north-east coast of Scotland. By April 1990 a new indoor heated swimming pool, with jacuzzi, sun beds and sauna, had been built. The cost of Pounds 330,000 was partly paid for by a Pounds 100,000 government grant designed to help tourism. The addition of the pool extended the number of weeks the park is fully let from 15 to 23, and the number of vans for hire has been increased from 66 to 90 this year. On top of that, the number of owned vans - where owners pay a rent - has risen from 3 to 30, with Parkdean making additional profits from trading vans. Mr Wilson aims to increase from the 120 hire and owned vans to 160 in the next three or four years. Even that will make the park small by the standards of many park operators, and the aim is to retain the 'personal service' which contributes to repeat and recommendation business - that accounts for over 55 per cent of the holidays sold. Touring pitches are available too, and Mr Wilson has plans to develop these for the new generation of caravans which 'hook up' to mains services. He reckons he can double the overnight rate for such pitches. He puts the success of a park down to three factors: location, facilities and marketing. Grannie's, for example, is on a good sandy beach, near a town, but not surrounded by other caravan parks. As well as the pool, the facilities include bars and a restaurant, a grocer and a fish and chip shop, amusement machines, and a launderette. 'First we sell them holidays, then we sell them other things,' Mr Wilson explains.</p>

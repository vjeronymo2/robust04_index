			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nitrate level incompetence Sir, Alison Maitland's article on livestock farmers threatened with being forced out of business by the government's plans to cut nitrates in drinking water was accurate ('Farmers attack proposals on nitrate levels', September 13). But it did not include the latest incompetence. The government says it must reduce the level of nitrates (to 50mg per litre instead of about 55) because the EC nitrate directive says it must. But it does not admit it signed this directive in 1991, knowing that it was based on false statistics. If it had not signed, it would not be binding. Its own statistics are that, if you lower nitrates, you increase the risk of cancer. It has known this since 1985 (CMD 85/14 spells it out). It also says that the level was based on World Health Organisation figures, which it must obey. The published WHO document (in 1993) states that the lower limit is solely because of methaemoglobinaemia (blue baby syndrome); and it says that in areas where there have been no cases over many years the limit need not be applied. There have been no cases in the UK for more than 20 years. The government has publicised that the reason for the new nitrate level is because of cancer risk and blue baby syndrome - I have been to just such a public meeting. It lies, and it knows it.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First part of two-part interview with Forestry Minister </F> Lieutenant General Chit Swe by Yindi Loetcharoenchok in Rangoon;  date not given]    [Text] What is the new Burmese forestry policy?    [Chit Swe] We are revising our national forest policy. Our  present policy is an old one, based on the Indian national  forest law. The Indian authorities have already revised it five  times. We have never revised ours that is why we are doing it  now. Anyhow, we have enacted a new forest law on November 30,  1993. Our old one has been in use since 1902.    We are now trying to reduce state enterprise business, and  to  encourage the private sector to engage more in forestry  business. Also instead of just selling, we are going into more  value-added downstream industries. For those who want to carry  out forestry-related business, they now have a choice of a 100  per cent investment or a 50-50 per cent joint venture. Now we  mostly welcome value-added business. We have got a lot of good  and bad experiences in the last 4-5 years. For those, who want  sawn timber and finished goods, there are plenty of  opportunities. There is no problem.    So it means that after 31 December 1993, no more  logging concessions have been granted to foreign companies?    [Chit Swe] Yes.    What kind of value added industries are you  promoting?    [Chit Swe] There are many kinds of timber businesses. Some  factories have to start from veneer or plywood and some go  straight to finished goods such as furniture or handicraft. If  it is the furniture business, it is very easy to submit a  project proposal to the Foreign Investment Commission, and  within months or weeks we can make a decision.    If they want a factory with a 100-hoppus tons a year  capacity, a very big amount or big volume by international  standards, then it is not easy for us. But if they want a  medium sized factory of 30-40,000 hoppus tons a year, I think we  can supply our raw material by tenders. In our country, to  travel from the North to the South is a long journey. Most of  our logs are in the upper of Myanmar [Burma], so to take them  from upcountry to Yangon [Rangoon], sometimes takes years. Our  climate is a little different from that of Indonesia and  Malaysia. For them, they can extract logs all year round, but  we get the rainy season for nearly six months and we lack  harvesting equipment and our transport is also very poor.  Sometimes you have to wait to harvest after November because in  October there can be swamp-like conditions and it is not easy to  put skidders inside.    You have a number of saw mills, plywood and furniture  factories. How are they being operated -- by your Govermnent or  by the private sector?    [Chit Swe] We have got some saw mills owned by our Myanmar  Timber Enterprise. Some are in good condition, but some are in  a bad state. If somebody wants to hire or enter into a joint  venture with the saw mills, we have got more than 80 of them.  Also if they want to enter into a joint venture with our timber  enterprise we can supply them with raw material.    We have got five plywood factories and only two foreign  companies, one is Daewoo of South Korea and the other SEA Lumber  Company of Malaysia. Both are doing joint venture businesses.  So there are three left and many companies are proposing to  enter into joint ventures with them. Anyhow there is no  commitment as yet. We are still negotiating.    What is the investment percentage of the joint ventures  by Daewoo and SEA with your Government?    [Chit Swe] Our side is 45 per cent, and their side is also  of  the same percentage. But then, they also bring in another 10  par cent from other company. It means there are two companies  from their side. So Daewoo is 45, our side is also 45 and 10 is  from another third partner. It is the same with SEA Lumber.  The third partners are mostly investors or financiers.    What about those 80 sawmills?    [Chit Swe] Some saw mills are a little far away from the  forest, so it is not easy to enter into a joint venture with  other companies. We are also in short supply of harvesting  equipment. We need money to buy machines, so instead of buying  and selling our raw material, foreign investors can bring in  their extraction equipment, and we will supply them with raw  material. This means we can both together produce sawn timber  for export to other countries. This is a joint venture.    What about furniture factories?    [Chit Swe] We have got three. For these three furniture  factories, some countries from the West, some from Singapore and  some from other countries have put up proposals. I think we  have already agreed with one company from Singapore, that is  Lambir Company.    Do foreign investors have to bid in running these  factories, or do they each have to submit a proposal which is  then considered individually?    [Chit Swe] Yes, one by one.    Apart from this downstream value-added industry, are  you still selling logs?    [Chit Swe] Yes, we still got some commitments that will last  for another 2-3 years, but we are reducing and phasing out these  activities.    Who are your main buyers?    [Chit Swe] Our timber enterprise earns a total of about  US$200 million a year from logs and the valued added industry.  This is an average income. We want to sell more but we have to  adhere to the annual allowable cut. For teak it is only 350,000  hoppus tons (630,000 cubic metres) a year, and 1.3 million  hoppus tons (2.34 million cubic metres) for hardwoods and other  species. We cannot cut more than these amounts.    Forestry is the second most important industry after  agriculture. Among the ministries we are the number one foreign  exchange earner, but it is not easy now because other sectors  are competing such as fisheries and manufacturing.    You are now facing increasing probbms related to  smuggling snd illegal cutting of trees. How are you going to  deal or resolve these problems? Are you going to enact a new law  or amend existing ones?    [Chit Swe] If there is a will, there is a way. Smuggling in  our country is very small when compared with other countries,  such as Malaysia and Indonesia. I think in Malaysia, the  imprisonment term is up to 20 years, but in our country it is  only seven years.    What was the percentage of your forest cover before and  after you gave out logging concessions to Thai companies?    [Chit Swe] There was less than 50 per cent forest cover  before the concessions. Now it is nearly that figure.  According to the FAO statistics, Myanmar forest cover area in  1969-1971 was 32.2 million hectares and in 1989 was 32.4 million  hectares. There is some expert opinion that by the year 2000,  every country should have a forest cover area of up to 30 per  cent. Most countries have less than 20 per cent, but ours is no  problem because we have got about 50 per cent of forest left.</p>

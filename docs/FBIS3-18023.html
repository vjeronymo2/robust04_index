			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MPK/GGD: "European Parliament Says European </F> Union Should Eventually `Absorb' Western European Union"; as  released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 24 Feb (BELGA) -- On Thursday [24  February], a large majority in the European Parliament [EP]  voted in favor of a gradual rapprochement between the European  Union [EU] and the Western European Union [WEU], leading  eventually to "the absorption" of the WEU by the EU. The EU  would then assume full responsibility for foreign policy, Common  Foreign and Security Policy [CFSP], and relations with NATO.    In his report, Mr. Karel De Gucht, (Belgian EP member [MEP]  representing the VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] -- BELGA  editor's note) advocates the gradual establishment of a single,  coherent institutional framework for the EU's CFSP. According  to the rapporteur, the establishment of such a framework implies  the increased use of a majority vote regarding CFSP, the  exercising of democratic control by the EP, and an enhanced role  for the European Commission.    To this end, the report suggested that the institutions of  the EU and the WEU should gradually define their relations in  specific terms, and merge at the practical level, notably by  organizing simultaneous meetings between the Council of the EU  and the Assembly of the WEU, as well as between the European  Commission and the General Secretariat of the WEU.    In the final phase, the EU should completely absorb the WEU  and assume full responsibility for foreign policy, security, and  defense, as well as for relations with NATO, indicated the  report.    After having completed the final phase, in the event of  "serious difficulties," Mr. De Gucht foresees the possibility of  member states not participating in certain decisions made by the  Council or in their implementation.    This final phase could be completed as of 1996, the year of  the next intergovernmental conference of the EU which could  decide purely and simply to "incorporate" the WEU on the basis  of the future CFSP. Furthermore, the treaty founding the WEU,  signed in 1948, will expire in 1998.    Regarding relations between the European Union and NATO, Mr.  De Gucht believes that the WEU must continue to strengthen its  operational capabilities so as to be able to act independently  of NATO "in the long term," even if he recommends that the  Allies and the Atlantic Alliance should "consult" each other  first. He also advocates the "sharing of tasks" by the WEU and  NATO, as well as the definition of various kinds of action.    Moreover, he envisions a future "adaptation" of the North  Atlantic Treaty, or the signature of a new treaty between the  United States and the EU "which better reflects the new  egalitarian relations established on both sides of the Atlantic."</p>

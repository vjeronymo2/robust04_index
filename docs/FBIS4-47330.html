Shalin, Moscow; UDC 629.7] </F>   [Abstract] Materials now being developed will make it  possible to improve the weight efficiency of aircraft and  helicopters being built for use in 1995-2010 by 15-20 percent  and extend their life by a factor of 1.5. High-strength aluminum  alloys of the system Al-Zn-Mg-Cu and medium-strength alloys of  the system Al-Cu-Mg are now being developed that will make it  possible to produce molded components with strengths up to  540-600 MPa and forged components with strengths up to 450-550  MPa. One area receiving particular attention is that of  developing lithium-alloyed aluminum alloys (the alloys 1441 and  1430) with a reduced density (2.58 g/cm[.sup]3[/]), increased  elasticity modulus, and a 10-20 percent longer life. The  weldable structural alloy 1151 is much more heat and corrosion  resistant than its foreign counterpart 2219 and is even superior  to many nonweldable structural alloys. The process for producing  casting aluminum alloys is also being improved. The  high-strength alloys VAL12 and VAL14 are stronger than their  foreign counterparts and do not contain silver, and their  strength should reach 600 MPa by the end of the century. The  high-temperature alloys ATsR1U and VAL18 may be used at  temperatures up to 540, and corrosion-resistant and  impermeable alloys with respective strengths of 420 and 480 MPa  should be available by the year 2000. New strong casting and  wrought magnesium alloys have made it possible to dramatically  reduce the weight of aviation-related products. Work is under  way to create magnesium-based composite alloys reinforced with  B, C, and SiC fibers. The Mg-B composite has a density of 2.44  g/cm[.sup]3[/], strength of 1,500 MPa, elasticity modulus of  260 GPa, and ultimate strength of 61.5 km, which makes it  significantly stronger than high-strength aluminum, magnesium,  and titanium alloys. In the future, these materials will have a  strength of 2,000 MPa, elasticity modulus of 300 GPa, and  working temperature of 400. The main goals of research in  the area of titanium alloys are to increase specific strength  and heat resistance, increase reliability and life, and expand  the temperature range in which such alloys may be used. VT36 is  among the most promising developments in the area of titanium  alloys. When compared with VT18U, it is 15 percent more heat  resistant at 600C. The alloy VT8M, which is alloyed with  tin and zirconium, is more crack resistant than VT9. The alloy  VT35 has an ultimate strength of 1,150 to 1,200 MPa. Another new  direction is that of creating high-strength and high-temperature  structural titanium alloys on the basis of a triphase structure  involving _a_- and _b_-solutions and intermetallide  dispersion  strengthening. Titanium alloys of this type make it possible to  increase their operating temperature from 300-350 to  450-500C and ultimate strength to 1,400 MPa. A great deal  of attention is being paid to developing fundamentally new  alloys based on titanium aluminides (Ti[.sub]3[/]Al and TiAl)  that, at a density of 3.8 g/cm[.sup]3[/], make it possible to  increase the working temperature to 750-800C and elasticity  modulus practically to the level of steel (170 GPa). Research is  also under way to use the method of granular metallurgy to  produce a new class of steel-steel composites that, by the year  2005, should boast an ultimate strength of 2,500 MPa and a five-  to tenfold increase in fracture toughness. The general trend in  modern aviation instrument making has demanded the development  of increasingly miniaturized permanent magnets with complex  configuration, and materials based on intermetallic compounds of  rare earth elements and transition metals have been developed  for such purposes. High-temperature nickel alloys appear to be  the most promising material for turbine disks and the final  stages of gas turbine engine compressors in the next decade.  Principles of producing a controlled microstructure in stampings  of disks providing the required set of service properties for  new materials have been developed and implemented. A new class  of disk materials based on nickel intermetallides is being  developed that should become the primary material for gas  turbine engine disks in the 21st century and that can be used at  temperatures up to 950C. The single-crystal alloys ZhS32,  ZhS36, and ZhS40 are also promising. Another important problem  of aviation engineering is that of protecting the surface of  turbine blades from high-temperature oxidation. New  high-temperature multicomponent protective coatings have been  developed that have proved effective in solving the problem. New  combined condensation-diffusion plasma-ion coatings have been  developed that are characterized by good protective properties  at temperatures of 1,100-1,200 and that result in a turbine  blade life of more than 1,000 hours. In the area of ceramic  coatings, new coatings with a low heat conduction, high  temperature coefficient of linear expansion, and heat resistance  higher than that of familiar metallic coatings of the system  Ni-Cr-Al-Y have been developed and are considered promising for  use in the turbines of high-temperature gas turbine engines.  Work to create metal-matrix composites is proceeding in the  directions of improving their service characteristics and  maximum realization of the starting components' properties. A  boral composite material has been created that has an optimum  combination of tensile strength (1,400 MPa), shear strength (an  elasticity modulus of 230 GPa), fatigue resistance, and fracture  toughness. The method of vacuum-compression impregnation has  been used to develop promising fiber-reinforced composites.  Another promising direction in aviation materials science is  that of layered metal-polymer composites. The new layered  composite alor (aluminum and acrylic plastic) is 10-15 percent  less dense than aluminum sheets and more resistant to the  development of fatigue cracks and has better static strength and  damping properties. Bionics is another fundamentally new  direction in creating aviation materials. Figures 3, tables 6.</p>

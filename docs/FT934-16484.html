			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Fresh feather in their caps: Brazil's constitution has slowed economic growth. Reform is in sight Five years after adopting a new constitution, Brazil's congress today sits down to discuss important changes to a document now blamed for some of the country's most serious problems. If adopted, the changes could help stabilise the country's economy. If not, the government's attempts to tackle inflation of almost 2,000 per cent a year are unlikely to succeed. Many of the ideals behind the 1988 document were admirable, but have proved unrealistic for a developing country such as Brazil. The constitution was designed to reverse a process of centralisation imposed during 20 years of military rule, and restore individual rights. Instead, it reflected the utopian dreams of its drafters and now looks awkwardly socialist and nationalist in character. To entrench workers' rights, the constitution imposed a country-wide minimum wage, ruled that public employees could only be sacked through the courts, and forced through a retirement system based on length of service, which let female teachers retire after only 25 years' work. Five years later, the minimum wage is driving employers in the poorer, northern half of the country to hire and fire through the informal economy, outside the government's tax net. The public sector salary bill has doubled to 11 per cent of the government's creaking budget, and the social security system is nearly bankrupt because more people will soon be receiving benefits and pensions than are contributing. Mr Mailson de Nobrega, finance minister when the constitution was approved, says the government was powerless to avert these problems because it lacked support in congress. 'We could only cry, and pray,' he says. Brazil finally has the chance to address its constitutional weaknesses over the next few months. Except for clauses that guarantee the basic federal structure and individual rights, every aspect of the constitution is open for discussion. Amendments will be passed by simple majority among the combined members of Brazil's congress, the senate and house of deputies. The most important area for change is the relationship between the federal government, the states and municipalities. The constitution, in a bid to decentralise power and spread wealth to the poorer regions, forced the federal government to transfer more resources to states and municipalities. For example, the federal government's share of total tax revenues fell 10 percentage points to 33 per cent in 1988 as a result of the changes. But there was no corresponding decrease in the federal government's responsibilities, and it remained burdened with spending commitments in areas such as schools, health and public services. Transfers to states and municipalities and wage bills accounted for 70 per cent of the federal government's revenues last year, while a further 17 per cent went in interest costs on its debt. As a result, the government could only fund its commitments by borrowing at high, short-term interest rates and printing money, both of which are highly inflationary. The constitution also made compulsory the earmarking of certain expenditures. For example, 18 per cent of total tax revenues has to be spent on education. These rules make government efforts to cut its budget deficit difficult and will have to be relaxed for the revision to be successful. Equally, observers note, resources should be better related to responsibilities. This means the federal government should be allowed to claw back some transfers, or the states and municipalities should assume more responsibilities. 'We have to get a fair sharing of revenues and expenditures to restore feasibility to the federal government and tackle inflation,' according to Mr Nobrega. Persuading congress of the need for fiscal reform will be tricky, especially since the largest political party, the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, is suspicious of the intentions of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister. It fears that he is planning a 'shock' economic plan, the fifth since 1986, which could bolster his chances of running for president next year. The biggest obstacle to constitutional reform will be the states, which would suffer through either smaller transfers or more spending commitments. For this reason, the government is likely to call for a political consensus to make the sacrifices necessary to solve the federal budget deficit. 'Without a political pact on how to distribute resources, you won't get the ball rolling. You won't do much by simply changing the rules of the constitution,' according to one minister. The chances of reaching such a pact are mixed. There is widespread support for the revision process in congress but it is opposed, sometimes violently, by a coalition of leftwing and church groups which fears workers' rights are at stake. Although this group only involves about 25 per cent of congress, it can delay progress and has threat-ened to challenge the revision through the courts. Perhaps more important, the coalition government of President Itamar Franco is weak and seems unlikely to be able to generate enough support within congress for the more unpopular measures that are needed, including thorough fiscal reform. With only a year before presidential and congressional elections, there is a danger some members of congress will place their re-election interests ahead of those of the government's budget. Mr Roberto Campos, federal deputy for Rio de Janeiro and a leading critic of the constitution's weaknesses, is cautious about what the revision can accomplish. 'It can't worsen the constitution, and that's the only cause for optimism,' he says. Areas that could see important change, according to Mr Campos and others, include foreign access to the economy. The constitution discriminated against foreign investment in fields such as mining and transport, and guaranteed state monopolies in petroleum and telecommunications. These are today hindering new investment because of the government's lack of resources. Following vocal lobbying from organisations such as Fiesp, the Federation of Sao Paulo Industries, it seems likely the discrimination clause will be dropped and foreign-controlled companies will be allowed once more to exploit Brazil's mineral reserves. It is also possible that Telebras, the monopoly telecommunications company, will slowly be forced to face private sector competition. Less likely to be questioned is the monopoly over petroleum exploration and refinery enjoyed by Petrobras. A newspaper poll of congress members at the weekend showed them divided over the Petrobras issue, mainly for nationalist reasons, and the government appears equally split. There could also be much-needed reform of the retirement system. Because of generous provisions in the constitution, and special treatment for groups like teachers, there are now some 14.5m Brazilians receiving state retirement benefits and pensions, at a cost of about USDollars 6bn a year. But contributions to the system are too low, and the shortfall has been met with money meant to pay other types of benefit. The government wants to delay the retirement age, which would be the same for men and women, and privatise some services. However, opposition will be formidable, both inside and outside congress, from groups who see Brazil's retirement system as one of the few successes for workers in recent years. Progress in these areas will be difficult because of the government's political problems and the unfortunate timing of the revision, one year ahead of elections. Brazil should emerge with an improved constitution, but this is likely to remain far from ideal. As an indication of the difficulties, congress seems split on the constitution's most notorious ruling, that real interest rates should not exceed 12 per cent a year. The clause is widely ignored, but its removal would have important symbolic effect. However, the poll of congress members showed a small majority, 46 per cent to 42 per cent, in favour of keeping the rule in place - probably reflecting popular mistrust of the banks.</p>

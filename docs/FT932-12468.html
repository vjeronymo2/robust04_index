			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: F&amp;C forced to sell 11% stake in own trust Foreign &amp; Colonial Management, the manager of the UK's largest investment trust, is to sell its 11 per cent stake in the ordinary shares of F&amp;C High Income Investment Trust as a result of breaching Inland Revenue rules. High Income Investment holds 30 per cent of its assets in ordinary shares and can no longer be included in a personal equity plan, following new Inland Revenue rules. 'Non-qualifying' unit and investment trusts have to hold investments of at least 50 per cent in ordinary shares to qualify for a Pep subscription up to Pounds 1,500, instead of the full Pounds 6,000 allowance.</p>

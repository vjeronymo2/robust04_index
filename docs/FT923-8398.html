			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Russians say Serbian concentration camps a myth TWO prominent members of the Russian parliament who have just returned to Moscow from the former Yugoslavia yesterday described reports of concentration camps there as 'myth'. One of them, Mr Yevgeny Ambartsumov, the chairman of parliament's international relations committee, spoke out against United Nations sanctions against Serbia on the grounds it created greater suffering for ordinary people. With parliament on holiday and public opinion largely indifferent to events in the former Yugoslavia, Mr Ambartsumov's comments are unlikely to carry much immediate weight. But they are symptomatic of moves to break away from an exclusively pro-western orientation in Russian foreign policy. Yesterday the foreign ministry expressed 'surprise' that a UN draft resolution authorising the use of all means to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid to Bosnia had been drawn up without Russia's participation. The ministry said it should have involved at least four permanent Security Council members, and not just the three western members. But reports from New York later suggested Russia would co-sponsor the resolution agreed by the US, France and Britain on Monday. The Russian comments coincided with a visit to Moscow by Mr Douglas Hogg, minister of state in the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He said Russia would react 'sympathetically' to a request to send troops to Yugoslavia to accompany convoys of humanitarian aid. Mr Hogg confirmed that London would be sending a team of UK customs experts to Romania to help authorities tighten up on potential breaches of international sanctions.</p>

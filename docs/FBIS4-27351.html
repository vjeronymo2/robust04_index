			<p>CSO     [Text] Hokkaido Gas has firmed up a plan to make a  facilities investment of 11.898 billion yen during fiscal 1994.  The company's plan is to begin supplying natural gas in fiscal  1996, and it made large facilities investment (about 12 billion  yen in initial plan) last fiscal year, an increase of about 30  percent over the previous year. It will maintain a high level  this fiscal year also and will invest about 10 billion yen for  two consecutive years. It seems that the large investment by  Hokkaido Gas will serve as a motive force for the economy in  Hokkaido which partially has begun to seem bright ahead.    The amount of facilities investment on natural gas-related  construction this fiscal year by the company will be 4.01  billion yen. It has begun construction on the Hiroshima Supply  Station (Hiroshima-cho in Ishikari jurisdiction), Moere Governor  Station (Sapporo city), the "Sapporo Trunk Line," a  high-pressure pipeline (about 41 kilometers) connecting them to  the Ishikari plant (Ishikari-cho in Ishikari jurisdiction), and  the "Moere Trunk Line" (about 10 kilometers) that will supply  gas from Moere to within Sapporo city. Moreover, full-scale  construction will also begin on the "Atsubetsu Trunk Line" for  the Hiroshima Supply Station and Atsubetsu Supply Station (about  5.5 kilometers) on which construction started last year.    Aside from natural gas-related construction, it will invest  2.077 billion yen in manufacturing facilities, 3.69 billion yen  in supply facilities, 2.085 billion yen in business facilities,  and 34 million yen in incidental facilities. In the  manufacturing facilities, besides enlargening the gas generation  facility which makes city gas from LPG [liquefied petroleum gas]  at the Ishikari plant, they will continue additional  construction of gas tanks at the Atsubetsu Supply Station.    The company is proceeding with a program to change city gas  in Sapporo city to natural gas over about 10 years starting in  fiscal 1996. It plans natural gas-related investment of 30  billion yen in the three-year period from fiscal 1993 to 1995.  In a survey by the Hokkaido Regional Bureau of International  Trade and Industry, while the facilities investment programs for  fiscal 1994 by major firms in Hokkaido have decreased 34.5  percent over the previous year in the manufacturing industry and  5.4 percent in the nonmanufacturing industry, the facilities  investment of gas enterprises have increased 38.8 percent, and  become bright news. It seems that the facilities investment  involving the company's change to natural gas will have an  effect on reflating the economy of related industries.</p>

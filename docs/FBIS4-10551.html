			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Soraya de Alencar] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- On 15 April, Brazil will conclude an  agreement with private creditor banks and exchange the old debt  certificates for renegotiated debt bonds. This will give Brazil  30 years to repay the principal, which amounts to $45 billion,  of which $35 billion is owed to foreign banks, and $3.8 billion  is "fresh money" -- from previous agreements -- loaned after  1983. The rest is owed to Brazilian banks abroad.    The new bonds, which will be issued by the national  Treasury,  are like promissory notes that will be delivered to creditors in  exchange for the old promissory notes the country failed to  honor. Those promissory notes will be transformed into six new  types of bonds: discount, parity, temporary interest reduction,  capitalization, conversion, and "fresh money" bonds. However, to  implement the exchange, Brazil tomorrow will have to present  $2.8 billion in guarantees of a total of $4.6 billion. The  balance will be paid over a two-year period in six-month  installments.    In order to calculate the total renegotiated amount, the  Central Bank added all public sector debts -- overdue and about  to fall due -- plus $28 billion that state institutions already  have paid to foreign creditors but has remained deposited at the  Central Bank. This has happened since 1983, when the debt crisis  began, and when the country had few international reserves and  could not make any payments. That money will be transferred to  the Treasury, which may use it only for reducing the domestic  debt, which in February stood at $48 billion. The government has  not decided yet how this payment will be made.    According to Central Bank technicians, with the new  agreement, the foreign debt will stop being a problem because  the government will be able to schedule the payments.  Technicians believe that by that time, the country will have  reached economic stability, a condition that will facilitate the  repaying of obligations owed to international creditors.</p>

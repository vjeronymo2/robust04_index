			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 21 Jun (MENA) -- Following his meeting with  President Mubarak today, Yemeni Presidential Council Member  'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani expressed his pleasure, noting that  he had conveyed a message to President Mubarak from Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on the present situation in Yemen  and bilateral ties, which he described as strong and solid.    The Yemeni official hoped the Yemeni problems would remain  among the Yemenis alone. If foreign intervention stops, we will  be better able to solve the Yemeni problems through dialogue, he  said, noting that there was a dialogue for nine months before  military operations broke out.    He added that the Yemeni Government is prepared to continue  that dialogue and stop all military operations, provided that  the other side stops and abides by the cease-fire.    'Abd-al-Ghani pointed out that the Yemeni Government has  repeatedly announced a cease-fire, but the other side has always  violated it and not respected it. He reiterated his country's  compliance with the UN Security Council resolution, affirming  that they are doing their utmost to facilitate the mission of  the UN Secretary General's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi. He added  that his government has voiced its readiness to cooperate with  all the parties in stopping the fighting in the Republic of  Yemen and its readiness to sit with the other side in any place  in the Republic of Yemen to resolve the present situation  peacefully.    Asked to comment on the recent U.S. statement on the  situation in Yemen, he said: We have always abided by the  cease-fire and are prepared to stop fighting immediately if the  other side complies. We are also prepared to sit at the  negotiating table within the framework of legitimacy and the  Republic of Yemen, he added.    Responding to a question on north Yemen's position on the  presence of UN observers, the Yemeni president's envoy said that  the UN Security Council resolution does not provide for the  presence of international observers. He said: To spare the  blood of the Yemeni people, we suggested to the UN secretary  general's envoy the enhancement of the role of the Military  Committee that was formed by Yemenis in the past, and which  included the Sultanate of Oman, Jordan, and the U.S. and French  military attaches in Sanaa. We are willing to expand this  committee in order to work for a cease-fire through it. That  committee, which is actually in existence, can monitor the  suspension of military operations until a cease-fire is  enforced, he said.    'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani thanked President Mubarak and  big sister Egypt for its constant efforts to stop the loss of  Arab blood and for its eagerness to establish peace and  stability in Yemen and the entire Arab region.    Asked whether it is possible to hold a referendum on unity  in  south Yemen, the presidential envoy said that unity was  established by popular decision and that such a referendum was  conducted under the umbrella of the multiparty system and  political pluralism. Noting that the results of the referendum  reflected support for unity by an overwhelming majority, he said  that "the secessionists are a few who do not represent Yemen and  want to impose secession by force."    The Yemeni envoy added that it is up to the Yemeni people to  decide. Had the Yemeni people not protected unity, it would not  have existed in its present form, as represented by the  legitimate forces' control over most of the country. He  emphasized that these forces are capable of silencing "the  rebels" wherever they might be and settling the matter  militarily if they want. "But they do not want to shed more  blood," he said.    In an implicit reference to Aden, 'Abd-al-Ghani accused the  other side of striking at vital installations and petroleum  establishments. The last thing they did was bombard the trade  center in Mocha and the adjacent city, which led to the  martyrdom of 17 persons and the injury of more than 30 persons,  he said.    Commenting on President Mubarak's ideas during the meeting  that continued for well over two hours, the Yemeni envoy said:  President Mubarak put forward valuable and useful ideas that  all focused on stopping the bloodshed and turning to dialogue.  I will convey these ideas to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    Stating that he would convey the message fully to President  Salih, 'Abd-al-Ghani expressed his optimism that the ideas  President Mubarak put forward would have a positive impact in  the future.    We hope all Arab brothers will help us stop fighting and sit  at the negotiating table. They can also help us by refraining  from interfering politically in the problem, either by Arabizing  or internationalizing the issue, he stressed.    Touching on the role of the Arab League, the Yemeni envoy  said: We are against subjecting any internal Yemeni affair to  discussion at an Arab or international forum, because the  League's Constitution does not entitle it to look into the  internal affairs of any state. Yemen is a founder of the Arab  League and a signatory of its Charter, he said, adding: We have  explained that this issue is none of the League's business. We  are not belittling the League; we are respecting its Charter, he  said, stating that the UN Charter as well does not entitle the  organization to look into states' internal affairs.</p>

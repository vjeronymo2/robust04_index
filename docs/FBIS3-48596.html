Speaking to reporters after meeting with his Spanish  counterpart Javier Solana at Shangri-La hotel here tonight,  Abdullah said Spain wanted to have an increased presence in  ASEAN due to the region's rapid economic growth and peaceful  situation. He said the commission would carry out activities  towards improving bilateral ties with the signing of several  agreements on economic and technological cooperation later this  year.    Abdullah said during the one-and-a-half-hour meeting,  several  agreements on investment agreement guarantee, culture, partial  abolition of visa and air service were discussed.    Solana who was accompanied by four senior officials, arrived  here today for a one-day visit on the invitation of the  Malaysian Government.    Abdullah said Solana was also receptive to his idea that  Spain organise a Spain Week here to showcase its products and to  provide information to further boost two-way ties.    "Spain plans to organise the event sometime this year in  conjunction with Visit Malaysia Year '94. This is good because  there would be many tourists here."    Abdullah said he would also like to see other countries  wishing to establish bilateral ties with Malaysia to organise  similar events.</p>

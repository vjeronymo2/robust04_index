			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / North Sea oilfield projects approved The government yesterday approved the development of the Fife and Birch oilfields in the North Sea. The development of Fife, east of Aberdeen, is of particular significance, as it will use a floating production and storage system on a converted tanker. The floating production systems are among the latest innovative methods to tap small reserves which would not be economic using a fixed platform. Amerada Hess and Premier Consolidated Oilfields, partners in the Fife field, will lease a vessel which will be moored over the field for the four years or so that it will take to drain the estimated 34m-barrel reservoir. The vessel will be secured to the seabed by nine chains attached to undersea piles. It will rotate around a turret through which pipelines attached to the wells will pass. The ship's normal propulsion unit will be retained to allow it to move if very severe storms arise. Normal winter weather should not affect production. Mr Tim Kieft, Fife project manager, said the field would not have been developed without the advent of the floating systems. Under the chartering arrangement the two partners will avoid costly capital outlays and the cost of abandoning structures, which are considerable in the case of fixed platforms, will be minimal. The owners of the vessel, Bluewater Offshore, will pay for its conversion. After Fife they will be free to charter it to other companies for similar developments. Birch, the other field approved yesterday, is in the central North Sea.</p>

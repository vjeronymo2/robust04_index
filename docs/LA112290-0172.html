			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 PR FIRMS FALL FOR PRANK TO MARKET BUNNY BURGERS  </P> <P> The hoppin' good low cholesterol food of the '90s -- Bunny Burgers, made with  rabbit meat -- was merely a wascally pwank by those guys at Spy magazine, who  persuaded four public relations firms to promote it.  </P> <P> The cottontail con was conceived for "Spy TV Pranks," a pilot for a potential  weekly program.  </P> <P> PR firms were contacted for advice on the right way to market Bunny Burgers, a  rabbit patty garnished with carrots, said Spy features editor Bruce Hardy.  </P> <P> The phony fast-food joint also offered Hareballs -- a sort of rabbit McNuggets  -- along with carrot fries and milkshakes.  </P> <P> "We came up with a product that was pretty far-fetched," said Hardy.  </P> <P> Not far-fetched enough. Four firms offered real advice on pitching the  "low-sodium, low-cholesterol fast-food of the '90s," said Spy show producer  David Kaminsky. Among other things, Bunny Burgers was advised to drop the  Hareball idea.  </P> <P> The PR firms were later told of the scam and were paid for their time and  advice. Spy agreed not to reveal which companies were involved.  </P> <P> One firm, Fleishman Hillard, did not go for the hare-raising meal, according to  the New York Post.  </P> <P> The company considered showing up with a presentation for "Double Bugs,"  "Double Bugs with Cheese" and "Thumper Cajun Style" sandwiches, the Post  reported.  </P> <P> "Bunny Burgers smelled fishy, and besides, we had a conflict with our  Puppy-on-a-Stick (account)," company Vice President Jan Van Meet told the Post.  </P></p>

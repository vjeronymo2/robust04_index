			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GARDENA CHECKS RESTAURANTS THAT MAY BE BARS;  </P> <P> REGULATION: GARDENA OFFICIALS ASK STATE TO INVESTIGATE TWO RESTAURANTS  SUSPECTED OF VIOLATING THEIR LIQUOR LICENSES BY NOT OFFERING BONA FIDE MEALS.  </P> <P> Gardena city officials have asked the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage  Control to investigate whether two restaurants are violating their liquor  licenses and are operating as bars.  </P> <P> Officials said they want to find out if the Kyoto and Nami restaurants, both on  Western Avenue, have curtailed or shut down their kitchen operations and are  concentrating on serving drinks. Both restaurants are licensed by the state  agency to serve alcohol as long as they are also serving bona fide meals,  officials said.  </P> <P> Councilman Mas Fukai, who said he had received complaints from other restaurant  owners that the restaurants were operating illegally, raised the issue at  Tuesday's council meeting when both restaurants came before the council for  entertainment permit renewals.  </P> <P> Walter Hayashi, owner of Kyoto, told the council that the management has had  difficulty finding and retaining Japanese cooks, but that food is available in  the dining area of the restaurant and at a sushi bar downstairs.  </P> <P> Through an interpreter, the owner of Nami, Moon Kyeong Koh, told the council  that her restaurant serves Korean and Japanese home-style meals as well as  alcoholic drinks, but that meals account for less than 50% of her business.  Moon said she is trying to advertise the menu in Japanese- and Korean-language  newspapers to increase the restaurant clientele.  </P> <P> Fukai asked Gardena City Manager Kenneth Landau to request the state  investigation, and Landau said Thursday that the request had been made.  </P> <P> In an interview, Fukai said there appears to be a trend among some restaurants  in Gardena and elsewhere -- particularly Japanese and Korean establishments --  to start out as full-fledged restaurants and then convert into more lucrative  Asian hostess bars, serving only light appetizers or sushi but earning most of  their money from the sale of alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> "I notice most of these are people who come from Korea and Japan, opening up a  restaurant and calling it a restaurant, and they turn it into a bar" even  though their license does not permit it, Fukai said.  </P> <P> Fukai said two or three other restaurants in the city may be violating their  liquor licenses, and that the city may ask the state to investigate them when  their entertainment permits come up for renewal.  </P> <P> Emanuel Espinoza, chief deputy director of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage  Control, said the agency issues two types of licenses, Type 47 for restaurants  and Type 48 for bars. State law defines restaurants as places "that regularly  and in a bona fide manner are used and kept open for the serving of meals to  guests for compensation," he said.  </P> <P> Restaurants serving only light meals, such as sandwiches or salads, would not  be eligible for a restaurant liquor license, he said.  </P> <P> "If they want to serve hot dogs and potato chips and operate with a microwave,  that's not going to make it either," Espinoza said.  </P> <P> Suspected violations are given high priority, Espinoza said. "If it comes to  our attention, we get on it right away." Penalties could include suspension or  revocation of the license, he said.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's meeting, the council voted to renew the entertainment permits for  both Nami and Kyoto but set a condition that the restaurants must serve full  meals. In addition to the state investigation, Landau said, city officials will  inspect both restaurants over the next two months to confirm whether they are  selling meals. If they are not, the city could suspend or revoke the  entertainment permits, officials said.  </P> <P> In their permit renewal applications, both establishments said they offer live  piano music and patron dancing as entertainment, and Kyoto also listed a  popular form of Japanese entertainment called karaoke, or singing along with  recorded music.  </P> <P> Gardena residents and city officials have traditionally taken a strong stance  against the sale of alcohol. The city passed an ordinance about five years ago  requiring new business owners who plan to sell liquor to apply for a  conditional-use permit, Landau said. Since then, the city has granted such  permits only for bona fide eating establishments and not for bars, he said.  </P></p>

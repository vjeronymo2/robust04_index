			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Code of practice relies on threat of public censure AT ITS heart, the Cadbury committee report on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance relies on the threat of public censure to force companies to improve the way they are governed and to tell shareholders more about their affairs. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council and a member of the committee, concedes that the final document, presented as a draft for public comment, is a consensus view and will fall short of the sort of reforms that some have been seeking. The report, for instance, stops short of urging companies to give shareholders greater say over executive pay. It also does not challenge the House of Lords' ruling in the Caparo case that auditors have a duty of care only to a company's management, not to individual shareholders. Sir Ron said more radical reforms would not be complied with voluntarily and would therefore require legislation, which would stifle innovation and enterprise. He said: 'We felt in the end that the best way to go was the co-operative route encouraged by the Stock Exchange.' The main body of the report consists of a code of practice that seeks to force companies to disclose the extent to which they comply with the code and to explain themselves where they do not. 'Had such a code been in existence in the past, we believe that a number of the recent examples of unexpected company failures and cases of fraud would have received attention earlier and might have been avoided,' the committee says. The Stock Exchange, which was represented on the committee by Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, exchange chairman, intends to add a new rule to its 'yellow book' which will make such disclosure a listing requirement. The rule will take effect almost immediately and will cover accounts filed for the year ending December 31 1992 and beyond. The 19-point code of practice covers four main areas: responsibilities of boards of directors; the role of executive directors; the role of non-executives; and accounting controls and reporting mechanisms. Among its main points are: Corporate boards should have a clearly accepted division of responsibilities. When the roles of chairman and chief executive are combined, there should be 'a strong independent element' on the board, with an appointed leader. Non-executives should be of a high enough calibre and appointed in sufficient numbers to give their views weight on a board. The majority of them should be free of any business or financial connection with the company and it is advisable that they should not be eligible to participate either in stock option or employee pension schemes. Their nomination should be approved by the board as a whole and should be the result of a formal selection process. Non-executives should be able to seek financial or legal advice from professionals outside the company at company expense. The Companies Act should be amended to reduce the maximum period of a director's service contract to three years from the present five - a rule that may be circumvented with shareholder approval. Directors' pay should be determined by a remuneration committee composed wholly or mainly of non-executives. The remuneration of the chairman and the highest-paid director should be fully disclosed and split into their salary and performance-related-pay elements. The basis upon which performance-related pay is measured should be explained. Boards must establish effective audit committees within the next two years, composed entirely of non-executive directors, a majority of whom are completely independent of the company. The audit committee should be able to seek external professional advice and consult advisers. They should also meet at least annually with the outside auditors, without any executive board member present. Fees paid to audit firms for non-audit work conducted worldwide should be fully disclosed and regulations under the Companies Act should be reviewed and amended as necessary. Interim financial statements should include balance sheet information. Although it is not necessary for interim statements to be audited, they should be discussed with auditors, and Stock Exchange listing requirements should be amended to include that requirement. The accountancy profession is urged to draw up guidelines to guarantee a periodic change of partners involved in the preparation of any particular company's audit over a period of years. However, the committee rejected a proposal to change auditors every few years to prevent relationships between management and auditors from becoming too comfortable. Boards should state that it is a reasonable expectation that their company will continue as a going concern, with supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary, and auditors should be required to report on that statement. The committee has urged the accountancy profession to develop guidance on the 'going concern' rule. Legislation may be an option if voluntary compliance appears ineffective. Although detecting fraud remains the responsibility of boards, the committee recommends new legislation allowing auditors to report suspicion of fraud to government authorities without breaching client-confidentiality rules implied by their contracts. Such laws are already in place for auditors for banks and other regulated entities. The committee also lays out what it believes to be the proper role of shareholders and their relation to boards of directors. In what is likely to be a disappointment to many institutional shareholders, the report said the committee considered, but rejected, a formal role for shareholders in the appointment of directors and auditors. The report noted that there had been suggestions that shareholders should be allowed to form committees that would have a say in the drawing up of director service contracts and the selection of external auditors. Mr Michael Sandland, chairman of the Institutional Shareholders Committee and a member of the Cadbury committee, said such committees often did not work because institutional investors were unwilling to turn over their proxies to be exercised by someone else. Other shareholder groups, though, have sought such a mechanism because individual shareholders typically held too few votes to force management changes. Instead, the Cadbury committee urges shareholders to back up its recommendations by 'requiring' companies they invest in to implement the code. The report also acknowledges the disparity in power between institutional and individual shareholders. It stops short of urging any mandatory public disclosure requirements when significant developments occur, although it urges companies to ensure that any 'significant' statements concerning their company are made publicly and are available to all shareholders. The report also suggests ways to use the annual meeting as a forum for shareholder concerns. It says: 'If too many annual general meetings are at present an opportunity missed, this is either because shareholders do not make the most of them or because boards do not encourage them to do so.' Possible ways forward include providing forms in annual reports in which shareholders could send in written questions before the meeting so that prepared answers could be given at the AGM. After the meeting, the board could circulate a summary of questions and answers to all shareholders.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Zharinov: "From the Nonparty Bloc?"] </F>   [Text] All elections, whatever you say about them, have  their own birthmarks. For example, an obligatory and unfailing  attribute of past elections was the slogan concerning the  indestructibility of the "bloc of communist and nonparty  candidates." Anything else at that time was inconceivable for  the party and people were united.    Today this slogan seems inappropriate and illogical. In  actual fact, the Russian people here are united, and there are  several dozen parties, each of which is endeavoring to "merge"  with them and express their interests. If the formation of  parties continues to be so dynamic, there is a fear that the  people will not be enough to go round.    The people themselves, it has to be assumed, are beginning  to  understand that the parties standing in line to defend their  interests at times represent no one and nothing. And have  sometimes been created merely in order to "state," "protest,"  and "demonstrate."    We are persuaded that this is the case by the preliminary  results of the elections to the oblast soviet of deputies. At  least 10 political organizations, blocs, and movements have  loudly stated their aspiration to fight for deputies' seats. The  oblast organizations of Democratic Russia, the Free Russia  People's Party, the Economic Freedom Party, the Russian  Communist Workers Party, the Working Novosibirsk and Fatherland  movements, and the Unity Association have actively begun to  introduce their candidates.    The electorate remembers their periodic appearances on  television and radio and in local publications. SOVETSKAYA SIBIR  ran a serious of publications devoted to election associations.    Let us leave in the background for the time being the  original lack of coordination (the amendments to the Election  Statutes, revision of the district boundaries), which  undoubtedly contributed to the false start. Let us take a closer  look at the problem.    Of the deputies elected, only three represent political  parties and movements. From the Communist Party of Russia,  Viktor Kuznetsov, secretary of the oblast party committee, and  Vladimir Karlov, director of Vocational-Technical School 16  (both ran in Berdsk), and from Russia's Choice, Nikolay  Krasnikov, chief of the administration of the Koltsovo community.    However strange, well-known and respected people, skillful  politicians, are among those who have withdrawn. Account was  taken of the candidates' political past and an ability to think  in a manner out of the ordinary and present one's position  interestingly. And of the subjective, psychological factor, of  course.    Nonetheless, the ability to organize the campaigning was, I  believe, determining in the election. It was frequently  undertaken in talentless manner, with the old methodological  baggage. The cliche that the Russian Communist Workers Party  defends the interests of the working people and supports a  change of political and economic course was bandied about, for  example. And the party members evidently believed that this said  it all. The people would be aroused and would head for the  polls. They did not. For almost the same slogans had emanated  from other political forces.    The philosophy of campaigning self-sufficiency (we are for  the people!) proved unproductive in the general chorus of  people's defenders. Having had a surfeit of slogans concerning  protection unrealized with each new election, the people  preferred to ignore them and to vote, at best, for those whom  they know best, not showing their affection for any party.    Nor was the tried-and-tested, reserve campaigning echelon:  the arrival in Novosibirsk of political leaders of Russia V.  Anpilov, V. Lipitskiy, and I. Malyarov, any help. The electorate  greeted them warmly, but many people simply failed to show up at  the polls.    The program of the oblast organization of the Communist  Party  of the Russian Federation would seem to be the most  constructive, balanced, and specific of the election material.  It does not summon to the "far blue yonder" but offers a  resolution of socioeconomic problems at the oblast level. And  this, I believe, was appreciated by the electorate of Berdsk,  which cast its votes for the communists.    Social psychologists say that a candidate who organizes his  campaign not on real, constructive matters but on withering  criticism of his opponents fails, as a rule. This was evident to  some extent. One likable party candidate from Tsentralnyy Rayon  so fulminated in his election speeches against the communists as  to introduce into his vocabulary the terms "communist Vendee,"  "red faces," and so forth. In a word, the voter knew where  everything stood with this politician. And rejected him.    One further campaign method: the flashed-message effect. As  many people believe, in November V. Zhirinovskiy's multiple  television meetings made him not only a star of the screen but  of the electorate also. The method was employed actively by  local candidates also. The pithy phrase broadcast daily on the  radio: "Konstantin Zheleznov is a man of action! He is your  candidate!" is still implanted in the minds of many  Novosibirskers. The politician candidates did not dare take such  a step. In order to be, if not elected, at least, known.    Granting SOVETSKAYA SIBIR an interview, Kirill Volobuyev,  leader of the local Liberal Democrats, complained at the  discrimination in relation to political parties: We were forced  to collect signatures for the candidates.    "People should be nominated for the oblast soviet by party,  by slate!"    As it transpired, the party could today barely "cover"  several electoral districts with its candidates. None was  elected to the oblast soviet. From the viewpoint of party  representation and the apportionment of political forces this is  not, as they say, to the benefit of democracy. But how can the  electorate's interests be represented in the soviet if it is as  yet denying this representation?</p>

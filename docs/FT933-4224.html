			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury speculation More talk of a rights issue to accompany results from Cadbury Schweppes this morning was heard. Rumour-mongers attempting to put more gloss on the story were speculating that the company would be looking to raise an additional Pounds 300m to buy either a beer producer in the US, or to increase its stake in Dr Pepper. Suggestions of a bid for United Biscuits also resurfaced amid the chatter. However, Cadbury shares withstood the uncertainty, rallying to close 2 up at 470p in turnover of 2.2m. UB lost 8 to 376p. Airtours shares moved forward 6 to 413p. Later in the session the company announced it was changing its broker from BZW to Hoare Govett. It also emerged that it was sacking its financial PR and adding Morgan Grenfell as bankers. Earlier this year, Airtours narrowly lost a bitter battle for control of rival holiday operator Owners Abroad. The latter's shares nudged up a penny to 87p. Pharmaceutical stocks slid in early trade, following weaker drug stocks in the US and stronger sterling overnight. Glaxo, which is to announce full-year figures today, fell 12 to 601p as small investors in the US decided to take profits. SmithKline Beecham lost 7 1/2 to 444 1/2 p as US brokerage Wertheim Schroder published research arguing that SmithKline's growth will slow dramatically. Wellcome shed 4 to 729p. The falls followed profit-taking in US drug stocks, including Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer. A strong pound, which rose almost two cents against the dollar on Tuesday to its highest level for more than three months, depressed the translation value of US earnings. The drugs sector had gained last week on a report suggesting that the US government would not impose compulsory price controls on health care companies in its forthcoming reforms. The composite insurers bucked yesterday's lacklustre trend, with Royal Insurance particularly buoyant after announcing the Dollars 59m disposal of its US subsidiary. The shares gained 10 at 317p. Media conglomerate Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, rose after BSkyB, in which Pearson has an interest of 17.5 per cent, unveiled first full-year profits of Pounds 62.3m before interest payments. Also, SG Warburg raised its 12-month forecast for the share price by 80p to 620p. Pearson shares closed 12 higher at 529p and Granada, which also has a stake in the satellite TV channel, put on 3 at 445p. Carlton Communications, whose video duplication business is likely to suffer from the new pay per view video services that have been discussed by BSkyB, fell 12 to 752p. Oil issues slipped in reaction to lower crude prices, which fell sharply after the International Energy Agency cut global demand forecasts on Tuesday, and on concern about an Opec meeting in Geneva on September 25. Enterprise led the fall, losing 12 at 475p after a good run in the past three weeks. Shell was down 5 at 658p and BP 4 1/2 to 299 1/2 p. British Gas was firm ahead of first-half results due today, closing 1 1/2 ahead at 329 1/2 p. The company announced last month that it expected to report a profit of not less than Pounds 503m on a current cost basis, after Pounds 498m a year ago, and Pounds 634m on an historical cost basis, after Pounds 635m. Stores shares responded to reports of continued recovery in retail sales. Kleinwort Benson was also steering investors in search of short term gain towards selected consumer shares. Among stores stocks, Boots moved ahead 8 to 493p, GUS 38 to 2103p and WH Smith 'A' 4 to 458p. With the army and navy equipment exhibition currently being held in Aldershot, VSEL were in demand and the shares climbed 11 to 877p, with several investors having visited the company at the show. Bargain hunters reassessed Williams Holdings, whose figures earlier this week had disappointed the market. The shares recovered 4 to 330p in volume of 2.7m. Shares in British Airways put on 6 at 367p in active trade of 5.9m, with Kleinwort Benson said to have recommended the stock. Ocean Group disappointed the market by reporting interim figures unchanged from a year earlier at Pounds 20.8m and a dividend held at 4.7p. The shares lost 9 to 325p. RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, fell 5 to 718p ahead of first-half results today. General trader Inchcape gained 3 at 563p as Gartmore, the investment fund, announced it had increased its stake to 4.01 per cent. UK Land, which underwent a financial reconstruction involving a 22-for-one rights issue on Tuesday, continued to rally sharply. After opening at 1 3/4 p on Tuesday and closing at 29 1/2 p, the stock advanced 20 1/2 yesterday to finish at 51p. Nervous trading in international conglomerate BTR left the shares 2 lighter at 399p ahead of today's figures. Volume was 4.3m at the close. Agency broker Panmure Gordon was said to have advised investors to sell Cookson group. The shares relinquished 4 to 211p.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Bosses urged to help fight asthma Companies were urged yesterday to give employees better protection against asthma-causing chemicals after a report disclosed that 1,000 asthma cases a year are developed in the workplace. The warning was issued by the Health and Safety Executive, which has launched an education campaign aimed mainly at small and medium-sized businesses. Dr Tim Carter, HSE director of field operations and medical services, said some 200 asthma - inducing substances had been identified, ranging from isocyanates, found in paints, to grain dust.

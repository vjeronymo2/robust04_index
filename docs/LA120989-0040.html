			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ERS WIN DATE WITH INDIANA;  </P> <P> LONG BEACH: A 68-47 VICTORY OVER NEW HAMPSHIRE SETS UP GAME AGAINST NO. 14  HOOSIERS IN TOURNAMENT FINAL.  </P> <P> Assembly Hall was nearly empty by the time Cal State Long Beach wrapped up its  fourth consecutive victory, 68-47, over the University of New Hampshire Friday  night in the Indiana tournament.  </P> <P> Most of the game was played before only a few hundred quiet fans, those that  remained from a crowd of 13,702 that had watched Indiana defeat South Alabama,  96-67, in the opening game.  </P> <P> The atmosphere will be different tonight when the 49ers and 14th-ranked  Indiana, both undefeated, meet in the championship game. The Hoosiers, who have  a 31-0 record in this tournament, will be trying to win it for the 16th year in  a row.  </P> <P> Long Beach, scoring in spurts, led all the way against New Hampshire, which  shot only 36.7% from the field. But the 49ers made 19 turnovers, 15 in the  second half. And their five steals were 10 below their average.  </P> <P> "We were somewhat lethargic," Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington said. "It was  probably hard for us to get up, we might have been looking ahead to Indiana. I  think we felt we could turn it on anytime we wanted. The small crowd didn't  bother us; we always play in front of small crowds."  </P> <P> The 49ers had a difficult time pulling away from the Wildcats until guard  Lucious Harris scored five points in the last six seconds of the first half.  After hitting a three-point shot, he stole the ball and made a layup at the  buzzer to make the halftime lead, 36-22.  </P> <P> The Wildcats never got closer than 13 points in the second half.  </P> <P> All 13 players scored for Long Beach, which was led by guard Tyrone Mitchell,  who scored 11 points, and forward Frankie Edwards, who had 10.  </P> <P> Bryant Davis scored 11 points to lead New Hampshire (1-3).  </P> <P> In the first game, Indiana (5-0) outscored South Alabama, 53-33, in the second  half. Calbert Cheaney, one of four starting freshmen for the Hoosiers, scored  20 points.  </P> <P> "I think we've escalated our play in each game," said Hoosier Coach Bob Knight,  whose team is 5-0. Indiana shot 56% from the field and had a 49-26 rebounding  advantage over the Jaguars (2-3).  </P> <P> "Indiana looked strong," Harrington said. "They pass the ball well and play  good defense. I think it will be a great experience for us, playing in a  championship game before a full, hostile house."  </P></p>

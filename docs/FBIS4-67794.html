			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Diplomatic Editor] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, April 2 -- Indian defence planners have  questioned the Clinton Administration's claim that the 36 F-16  multirole combat aircraft proposed to be transferred to Pakistan  under a one-time Pressler waiver are not capable of carrying  nuclear weapons.    An assertion to this effect by the Deputy Secretary of State  Strobe Talbott before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  last week was challenged by one of the members who pointed out  that ``even a garage mechanic'' could refit the F-16 to carry  nuclear weapons.    The U.S. intelligence agencies, as also disarmament experts,  have confirmed that the F-16s supplied previously to Pakistan  have been refitted to carry nuclear bombs. Former CIA Director  Robert Gates had in a Senate testimony in 1992 acknowledged that  Pakistan had equipped its F-16s to deliver nuclear weapons. The  renowned disarmament expert Mitchell Reiss, consultant at the  Woodrow Wilson International Centre too has asserted that the  uranium-based Pakistani bomb could be delivered by any of the  advanced fighter jets in Islamabad's inventory including the  F-16.    India's opposition to the sale of F-16s is based not only on  the consideration that Pakistan's offensive capability will  increase to the extent of upsetting the balance of power, but  also that it will boost its capacity for nuclear adventurism.  It has also been revealed that despite the ban on military  sales to Pakistan under the Pressler Law, the U.S.  Administration has quietly permitted the Pakistani Armed Forces  to buy American made arms from commercial firms. Among the  items sold are spares for F-16s, which form the nucleus of  Pakistan's Air Force.    It is argued that the spares were intended to help Pakistan  to maintain its current arsenal. Although for years Pakistan  was engaged in a massive, covert effort to build atomic weapons,  U.S. governments were reluctant to take strict measures against  it because of its assistance to Washington's efforts to arm the  Afghan rebels who were fighting Soviet troops. Thus, Islamabad  was rewarded for building nuclear weapons and given favoured  treatment.    Official sources said here that it was too simplistic a  proposition that Pakistan will cap its weapon-oriented nuclear  programme for anyone to take seriously. If past performance is  any guide no reliance can be put on Pakistan's word. Therefore,  India cannot be expected to accept a corresponding obligation of  capping its capability and throwing its facilities open to  international inspection in the face of Pakistan's record.    There is talk of offering ``incentives'' if India agrees to  verifiably cap its nuclear fissile material production. It is  pointed out that due to the sanctions imposed on the Indian  Space Research Organisation, India is forced to develop  indigenous capabilities for manufacturing Cryogenic engines. It  has also built parallel computers capable of performing the  functions of super computers. There is now talk of U.S.  allowing exports of computers with the capability of 500 MTOPS  to 1000 MTOPS, to provide India access to high resolution  satellite pictures and even to supply commercial nuclear  reactors subject to international safeguards. These carrots will  not tempt India which feels its security threatened.    However, there are no differences between India and the U.S.  over a universal test ban and capping production of fissile  materials for weapon purposes provided it is globally  applicable. In fact, New Delhi co-sponsored with Washington a  UN resolution proposing an international convention for fissile  material cut-off.    India believes that it will commit itself to cut-off when  all  countries including the five declared nuclear powers, accept it.  The U.S. Administration proposal is however, seen to be  discriminatory as it will create two categories of nations, one  that will be allowed to retain their huge stockpiles of fissile  materials, and other who will have to cap, roll-back and  ultimately eliminate their production.    During her recent New Delhi visit Assistant Secretary Ms  Robin Raphel sought to convey the impression that the U.S. was  interested in a comprehensive dialogue with India without which  its South Asian policy would not carry much weight. She  refrained from unfolding new policies to get the Indian reaction.</p>

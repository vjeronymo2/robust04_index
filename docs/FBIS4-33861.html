			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Joani Esposito from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] This morning, two inmates from El Marite Prison were  taken to Maracaibo's University Hospital. Upon arriving at the  medical center, a commando group intercepted the policemen  escorting the inmates in an attempt to free them. A shootout  ensued and, unfortunately, a student was shot and killed. Masin  Chirino Serrano, 23, was a student at the Biology School of the  University of Zulia. She died immediately.    As a result of this death, university and secondary school  students began demonstrations that turned into angry riots in  the school of engineering, medicine, and sociology and on  Cecilio Acosta and Delicias Avenues. The riots so far have  resulted in eight private sector trucks being burned.    The disturbances continued until this Friday afternoon when  Zulia State Governor Lolita Anillar de Castro ordered the  militarization of the unversity area. Fortunately, there is no  report of any other student casualties. At this moment,  however, students are still shouting slogans.    [Begin recording of unidentified person] We have noticed  that  since this government took power, insecurity has increased in  our region. How can it be that the police, instead of being in  the neighborhoods fighting criminals, are here killing students  who have something to offer the country? [end recording]</p>

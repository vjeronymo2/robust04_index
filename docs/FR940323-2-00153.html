Dow has also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice of receipt of a petition is published under section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits of the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph S5.1.9, Water Tolerance, of Standard No. 116 states that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> At low temperature, after humidification, ``(1) The [brake] fluid shall show no sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or stratification; (2) Upon inversion of the centrifuge tube, the air bubble shall travel to the top of the fluid in not more than 10 seconds; (3) If cloudiness has developed, the wet fluid shall regain its original clarity and fluidity when warmed to room temperature.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Between September 4, 1992, and October 29, 1993, Dow produced and sold 11 lots of DOT 5 silicone base brake fluid (SBBF) that do not comply with the requirements in Paragraph S5.1.9 of Standard No. 116. These 11 lots were broken down into 191 55 gallon drums, 1,112 one gallon retail packages, 11,458 one quart retail packages, and 33,091 12 ounce retail packages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At some point near the end of the low temperature portion of the water tolerance test, these lots contained a very small amount of a soft, slush-like crystallation. The crystallization usually formed around the top of the specimen, where the SBBF met the vial headspace. The smallest amount of warming made the crystallization flow back into a liquid state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dow supports its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> First, the low temperature portion of the water, tolerance test was designed to [simulate] excessive water in non-SBBF brake fluids. But as applied to SBBF, the humidification step results in a water content level for test samples that is nearly double that of in-service SBBF. SBBF test samples clearly do not accurately represent in-service SBBF. [Dow b]elieves this built-in error results in unrealistic and excess water. During this portion of the test, that excess water becomes a seed for crystallization of the SBBF itself. Without the humidification step, SBBF does not crystallize. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the soft, slush-like crystals are identical to the liquid SBBF; that is, 20 centistoke polydimethylsiloxane, some organic additives, and 350&hyph;400 [parts per million (ppm)] water. The SBBF crystals should not be considered as water-based ``ice'' crystals. These SBBF crystals do not exhibit any of the negative safety impacts that result from ice formation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dow also submitted the following additional material: (1) A 1982 petition for rulemaking it filed to amend this portion of the standard; (2) data to support this petition; (3) test data showing that the subject SBBF would pass the requirements of S5.1.9 when the humidification step is eliminated; and, (4) a statement by Ron Tecklenberg, Ph.D, a Dow chemist, supporting Dow's petition. This additional material is available for review in the HNTSA Docket Section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the petition of Dow, described above. Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date will also be filed and will be considered to the extent possible.

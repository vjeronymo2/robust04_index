			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / West Germany's production falls Industrial production in west Germany fell by a provisionally estimated 0.7 per cent in May, tempering hopes of a rapid economic recovery, and confirming expectations of a new slowdown in consumer spending. The figure published by the federal statistics office coincided with a recalculation of April's industrial production growth, reducing the initial estimate of a 2.5 per cent increase to just 1.3 per cent. The May figure was the first monthly drop this year, and the underlying trend remains clearly positive. However it follows a sharp fall in retail sales in April - down a real 6 per cent - as the combined effects of tax rises and wage restraint have squeezed disposable incomes. The sharpest drop in output in May was for consumer goods, down 2.8 per cent, and capital goods, down 1.9 per cent. Overall manufacturing production was down 0.8 per cent. Analysts described yesterday's figures as 'slightly disappointing', but most doubt they will have any effect on the Bundesbank's monetary policy. There was some suggestion yesterday that the markets might still speculate on a possible cut at the central bank council meeting next Thursday, because of the coincidence of the G7 meeting in Naples, and the confirmation of an apparent slowdown in the pace of recovery. Moreover, the bank could be influenced by fears that the strengthening D-Mark might undermine the classic export-led recovery still under way. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said this week that a 'significant' move in interest rates at this time would not be 'appropriate'.</p>

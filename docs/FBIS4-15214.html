			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul April 6 TASS -- The South Korean Government  does not intend to grant a political asylum to former North  Korean workers who fled timber-felling sites in Russia,  President Kim Yong-sam said at today's meeting with Korean  industrialists devoted to the results of his recent trip to  Tokyo and Beijing.    An official of the South Korean presidential staff quoted  the  president as saying some 90 timber cutters from North Korea had  applied recently to the South Korean embassy in Moscow and the  country's consulate in Vladivostok, asking for a political  asylum. "However, these requests will not be met in order not to  irritate North Korea", the official said. According to him, Kim  Yong-sam also stressed that "the government's stand on this  matter has not changed" and the possibility of North Korean  workers' resettlement to South Korea is not being considered.    According to information of the South Korean Government,  about 16,000 North Koreans are presently working at  timber-felling sites in Russia's Khabarovsk territory. They are  attracted by relatively high wages, as compared with those in  North Korea. Some 170 North Korean workers have fled Siberian  labour camps with a view to avoid returning to their native  land. At the moment, they have to knock about Russia without  even any passports. Some of them managed to illegally cross the  border into China, where a lot of ethnic Koreans live at present.</p>

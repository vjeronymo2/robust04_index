			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Engineers win BA single-union deal THE AEU engineering union has won a single-union deal for the Boeing 747 maintenance base which British Airways is building at Cardiff Airport. The Pounds 70m plant will employ up to 1,200 people by 1994 and is due to open in April next year. There is a worldwide shortage of 747 hangars and the company is hoping to attract work from other airlines. The single-union deal is the first to have been agreed by British Airways and will not affect current multi-union agreements at other maintenance bases at Gatwick and London's Heathrow airports. Four other unions competed for the Cardiff deal. They were the TGWU, MSF and GMB general unions, and the EETPU electricians' union. Mr Bill Jordan, the AEU president, said the proposed amalgamation with the EETPU had counted in the AEU's favour with British Airways because the combined union would represent the full range of skills needed on the project. The AEU is by far the largest of the maintenance unions within British Air-ways. Mr Jordan said the agreement was a 'prototype for the sort of deals that are going to transform British industry'. The government is expected early next week to announce details of the pay review bodies' recommendations for doctors, nurses, professions allied to medicine, teachers and the armed forces. Most groups are expected to receive 6 per cent.</p>

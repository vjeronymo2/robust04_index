			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Pension fund returns improve PENSION funds enjoyed high annual investment returns last year, according to initial estimates, in spite of the poor state of the economy. Investment returns - capital gains plus income - of 19 per cent to 20 per cent on average were the best annual result since 1989. Most of the gains were earned in the final few months of the year, following the withdrawal of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism in September. According to WM Company, performance-measurement specialists, the best-performing asset category was overseas bonds, with returns of more than 31 per cent boosted by the devaluation. Equities returned about 20 per cent, both at home and overseas, and UK bonds 15 per cent. The only disappointing category was property, which returned just 1 per cent or 2 per cent. Funds owning no property will therefore have performed better, and are likely to show an overall average return of 20 per cent. But according to Hymans Robertson, the pension consultants and actuaries, last year's returns could prove illusory, because although share prices were strong dividends fell slightly. On an actuarial basis returns are likely to be closer to 5 per cent, and are 'less than adequate' when compared to inflation-linked liabilities. Hymans Robertson said: 'A typical pension fund with a healthy surplus at the end of 1991 is likely to see part of that surplus eroded in 1992, reducing markedly its flexibility.' WM said that although stock market returns were good last year the 1990s still look like being the decade of the bond. Over the three years 1990, 1991 and 1992 UK and overseas bonds have produced annualised returns of 14 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, but UK equities have returned only 9 per cent and overseas equities a disappointing 2 per cent. WM added that 1992 was likely to prove another bad year for pension-fund cashflows, reflecting the number of companies taking contribution holidays. Cashflow was only 3 per cent of assets in 1991 and will have been even lower last year. These estimates and comments are based on market returns. Actual pension-fund returns will be calculated individually over the next few weeks. Lex, Page 22</p>

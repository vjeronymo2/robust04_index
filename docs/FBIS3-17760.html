A source in Satarov's office told Interfax the meeting had  focused on the position of ethnic Russians in various former  Soviet republics, such as the Baltic states, Ukraine and  Kazakhstan.    Satarov said that, despite some obstacles, conditions had  taken shape for solving these problems, because "the potential  of political stability in the life of society has increased and  good mutual understanding has been established between the  Federal Assembly and the president, including on that problem."    During his three-day visit to Russia, van der Stoel, who  arrived in Moscow on Monday, also plans to meet Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev, Minister of the Affairs of Nationalities and  Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray, and the chairmen of the  parliamentary commissions on human rights and international  affairs, Sergey Kovalev and Vladimir Lukin.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on Association of Russian Banks press conference by </F> Boris Boyko and commentary by Financial Turnover Department:  "The Sixth Paragraph Has Become Hated as Much as the Fifth One"]    [Text] Less than a week after signing of the  president's edict "On improving the operation of the Russian  Federation's banking system," which has been received with  widespread public reaction both in Russia and in the West, the  Association of Russian Banks (ARB) issued an official commentary  on this decision by Boris Yeltsin. The main object of analysis,  it was easy to assume, was not so much the edict itself as its  sixth paragraph, which removes a number of the restrictions on  foreign banks' activity set forth in November 1993.    Sergey Yegorov, president of the ARB; Aleksandr Smolenskiy,  president of the "Stolichniy" Bank; Garegin Tosunyan, president  of the Tekhnobank; Leonid Nevzlin, vice president of the  "Menatep" Bank; and Vladimir Gusinskiy, president of the  Most-Bank, took part in a press conference.    The overall tone of the press conference showed that in  their  choice of reasoning the representatives of Russian banks were  quite familiar with the attitudes prevailing in the higher  echelons of political authority. In criticizing the hated sixth  paragraph, the emphasis was put on the danger it represents for  the work of state construction in Russia. It is interesting that  the political factor became almost dominant in the statements  made by members of the banking elite. Thus, in the ARB's  opinion, the president's decision gives an opportunity to  "rightist forces" to take advantage of the presence of foreign  banks in the Russian market "to inflame political passions."    The edict provided a reason for the association to declare a  fundamental change in the state's policy of protectionism,  which, in Vladimir Gusinskiy's words, should be no less than in  Western countries, where it is quite difficult for a foreign  bank to open a branch because of the numerous restrictions.  Leonid Nevzlin was more dramatic: in his opinion, the  president's decision threatens the very structure of Russian  statehood--four or five large foreign banks are enough "to cut  off oxygen to the Russian banking system." In addition, the  example given by "Menatep" may illustrate the increasing force  of this dangerous trend--under the threat of a breakdown, plans  have appeared to attract foreign investments by selling some of  the Russian banks' stock shares to foreign banks.    Despite the good preparation, the sense of proportion  changed  at times for the press conference participants: in the words of  Garegin Tosunyan, a campaign is under way to discredit Russian  banks connected with the general tendency "to turn pink and turn  red" in domestic policy. As a result, proposals are showing up  at the state level to nationalize all banks altogether on the  grounds that they allegedly have been tainted by crime.    The argument that the Russian banking system was unprepared  for severe competition with foreign banks sounded more  meaningful. There are now 2,000 commercial banks and 4,800 of  their branches operating in Russia now (one bank for each  administrative rayon). At the same time, the oldest Russian  commercial bank is only 5 years old. Because they are relatively  new, Russian banks can offer clients only 70 to 80 types of  service, whereas their foreign competitors are able to provide  up to 3,000 types of service. In this connection, subsequent  statements by a number of the press conference participants that  they did not fear foreign competition appeared to be somewhat  contradictory. Especially as reputable Western banks such as  Deutsche Bank believe their presence in Russia is premature,  according to Sergey Yegorov.    The conclusion that the presence of foreign banks would  serve  no purpose for the Russian economy appears to be more logical.  In the opinion of the press conference participants,  opportunities are being made available to pump rubles out of  Russia instead of to attract foreign investments. As Mr.  Gusinskiy stated, the conditions for reservation of banking  capial in Western countries do not make it possible to invest  more than $20 million to $30 million per year in the Russian  economy because of the high degree of political risk. In this  connection, the KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts would like to emphasize  one thought expressed in the statement by Garegin Tosunyan: in  spite of the frequent declarations by the government, the  conditions needed for investments by Russian banks in the  Russian economy have not been created. Compensation for the  absence of a normal investment climate in the country cannot be  provided by financial institutions from the West.  <H8>  * * * </H8> <H5>  From the ARB appeal to the international banking community </H5>   Consolidation and development of the banking business are  almost decisive in beginning the successful formation and  development of a market economy. However, the Russian banking  system is only coming to its feet, and all the capital of our  banks is less than the capital of any foreign bank. This does  not mean a fear of competition, but apprehension about the  restoration of Russia's national economy and its entry into the  world community as an equal partner. The international banking  community should also take something else into  consideration--there are forces in Russia which take advantage  of the presence of foreign banks in our market in order to  instill in people's consciousness that national property is  being sold off and to break through on this wave to the  structures of authority and their powers.    This is why the widespread presence of foreign banks in  Russia is premature today. Not only Russia, but the entire world  community will lose. We appeal for the declaration of a  moratorium on opening branches of foreign banks in Russia for a  year and a half.  <H5>  From the ARB letter to the President of Russia </H5>   In gaining access to our financial market, foreign banks are  accumulating a substantial part of Russian funds. It is obvious  that they will make use of foreign banks to extend credit to  their traditional clients, the foreign companies in Russia,  which will not attract the expected Western investments for this  reason, but take advantage of our financial resources. This will  lead to a significant outflow of Russian national capital and  intensify the already critical situation in domestic industry.    We hope the admission of three more of the largest foreign  banks into Russia's financial market is the only exception to  the procedure which you established, that the government and the  Central Bank will require states in the European Community to  allow adequate representation in their countries by branches of  the largest Russian commercial banks.  <H8>  * * * </H8> <H5>  Commentary </H5>   It is generally known that the position of Russian  commercial  banks on the presence of foreign banking structures in the  domestic market varies. In this sense, the ARB position reflects  only the views on this problem of most Russian banks, presenting  a certain average opinion, and it does not take into account the  most extreme positions for this reason. A number of banks (for  example, the International Moscow Bank and TOKOBANK) consider it  possible to open the Russian market for their foreign colleagues  now, but others (in particular, the Most-Bank) believe even the  period up to 1996 is too liberal.    In the opinion of the ARB leadership, the differences in  views are explained chiefly by the different priorities (tactics  or strategy) given preference by the banks. For example, the  ones which are planning to open foreign branches in the near  future or which have substantial foreign funds in their capital  prefer not to force the situation.    However, even fervent opponents of the presence of foreign  banks in the Russian market would probably soften their position  if they had adequate opportunity to open their own branches  abroad. But this is not happening at present. It is sufficient  to remember the "Stolichniy" Bank's opening of its subsidiary  bank in Holland, which was replete with all kinds of nuances. In  the words of the bank's president, Aleksandr Smolenskiy, when  the "Stolichniy" Bank was finally granted a license, the Central  Bank of the Netherlands imposed serious restrictions on it: two  of the three bank directors had to be Dutch; the ratio between  Russian and Dutch personnel was set at 5 to 1; and restrictions  were introduced on service for physical persons and an increase  in assets and capital, as well as on the opening of additional  branches. According to the bankers, similar conditions apply  with respect to foreign banks in most European countries.    But the main apprehension of Russian bankers is that foreign  banks will "take over the market," that is, they will win over  their clients (to which the mentality of Russian citizens, who  are very timid in dealing with anything foreign, will contribute  to a substantial degree). But the foreign banks will direct the  funds attracted in the market mainly to extend credit to their  traditional clients--foreign firms. At the same time, in the  bankers' words, four or five of the banks are enough to  completely "cut off the oxygen" to the Russian banks. It is  obvious in this case that the foreign banks will not be  establishing branches and offices in Russian regions--Russians  will have to occupy these. This is already quite apparent today,  but with the reduction of an unfavorable base for banks, the  establishment of branches will become unprofitable altogether.  In following the Russian bankers' logic, it may be said that  this will mean stagnation of the national banking market.</p>

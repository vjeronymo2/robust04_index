			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> More Traders in Trouble: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has charged  22 traders with profiting through a scheme to prearrange trades for U.S.  Treasury bond futures contracts. The agency, in a six-count administrative  complaint, said the 22 executed a series of bogus transactions with a floor  broker on the Chicago Board of Trade in July, 1986. The CFTC said a hearing  will be scheduled before an administrative law judge. The accused traders face  possible penalties ranging from fines of $100,000 per violation to revocation  or suspension of their licenses and trading privileges.  </P></p>

"It is a black day in the struggle of Kashmiri people, who  are rendering unprecedented sacrifices for their rights and have  been stabbed by an unpopular government, he added. [no end  quote as published]    Chaudhury Sujjat Hussain said that the PPP [Pakistan  People's  Party] Government had been blaming the Pakistan Muslim League  Government for isolating Pakistan internationally but today it  had been established that it was not the PML but the PPP  Government that brought global isolation to Pakistan.    Gauhar Ayub Khan, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the  National Assembly, has also condemned the government for  withdrawing the resolution and said that the Prime Minister  should immediately step down as she had brought an embarrassment  to Pakistan, which had no parallel in the history of the country.    He said that it was criminal negligence on the part of the  government that a fit case of human rights violation of Kashmiri  people had been destroyed by the government in Islamabad.    Gauhar Ayub Khan appealed to the patriot workers of the PPP  to rise against the policies of the government and act being  above from the party politics. "I am sure now the whole nation  has seen the true face of Benazir Bhutto's government", he added.    He announced that the opposition would give its official  version about the fiasco on Thursday afternoon.    Mian Shahbaz Sharif, leader of the Opposition in the Punjab  Assembly, while condemning the withdrawal of the resolution said  that it had proved that Benazir government was engaged in  patronising and helping out India.    "She is not prepared to lose any single opportunity to  please  India by playing with the national interests of Pakistan, which  are no way dear to her," he said in a statement.    He said that track record of Benazir government had made it  clear that as long she was sitting at the helm of affairs, the  security of the country would remain in grave danger.    Mian Shahbaz Sharif appealed to the people to stand up  against the "pro-India" government.  *</p>

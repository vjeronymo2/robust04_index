			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In Gihogazi, Karuzi Province, a military  detachment was attacked this morning by as yet unidentified  assailants. The attack was finally repulsed but two soldiers  have been wounded. According to the Karuzi governor, whom we  managed to get on the phone, the assailants were well-armed.  Also, the Karuzi-Bugenyuzi road is still obstructed by  roadblocks.    Measures taken by Karuzi authorities include: strengthening  the military detachment stationed in Gihogazi and Karuzi,  clearing blocked roads, and, finally, calling on the population  to dissociate themselves from the wrongdoers.

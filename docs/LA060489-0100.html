			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WESTERN MONOPOLY ON TRUTH?  </P> <P> Karl Schoenberger's title for his review of "The Enigma of Japanese Power" was  careless and in very poor taste. By referring to Salman Rushdie's book that  totally misrepresents the words of God, he is obviously calling the Islamic  faith a "myth" just as he accuses Japanese authoritarianism of the same. Way to  go! It offended and abused Japanese and Muslims in one fell swoop.  </P> <P> When will The Times stop printing articles that promote racism, bigotry and  stereotyping?  </P> <P> KATHLEEN M. NAJJARINE  </P> <P> YORBA LINDA, CALIF.  </P></p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Books: Marble gods conquer stuffed elephants ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND AESTHETES by Ian Jenkins British Museum Press Pounds 25, 264 pages A FOGGY day in London town. What the British Museum loses on such days is not so much its charm as the details of its exterior decoration. The conspiracy of fog, fumes and general metropolitan chiaroscuro explains why most people entering the British Museum, including museum staff, never notice that its portals are topped by a pedimental facade - and if they have noticed it, the chances are that they have never bothered to see its significance. This pediment deserves more attention. It was designed in the mid-19th century by Sir Richard Westmacott, whose earlier work elsewhere in London includes the virile but fig-leafed statue of Wellington as Achilles in Hyde Park. Westmacott's theme for the British Museum entrance was The Progress of Civilisation. The viewer is intended to begin at the Eastern end, where man is seen crawling out from the primal slime. Man sheds the slime to indulge in hunting and farming; then, in a pagan but intellectually enlightened state, he studies astronomy, as personified by the central figures of the pediment. Thence issue mathematics, manufacturing, drama, poetry and music. Finally, there is the discipline of natural history. By the time he reaches the Western angle of the Westmacott pediment, man is reckoned to be well on the way to a civilised existence. Since the British Museum was originally founded for 'the advancement of the study of Natural History', this was an appropriate order of things. But natural history was already having trouble in retaining its eminence within the Museum. The arrival of the Elgin Marbles, and the steady accumulation of other antiquities throughout the first half of the 19th century, undermined the original raison d'etre of the Museum. A contest ensued, between marble gods and stuffed elephants: the gods won and, while the elephants were trundled off to Kensington, ample new premises were designed for statues previously accustomed to the ambrosial heights of the Athenian Acropolis. Well: this was, after all, the same period in which John Stuart Mill asserted that the fifth-century BC Battle of Marathon (when Greeks held off a Persian invasion which might conceivably have proceeded into Europe) was a more important event in British history than the Battle of Hastings. British public schools were Spartan and the British constitution, an empire-building structure operating from a restricted democratic base, was obsessed with its Classical Athenian prototype. Though Gothic put up a good fight, the Classical architectural orders were bullying their way all over the country. Small wonder that the fossils and the stuffed elephants were dislodged from their Bloomsbury home. Almost as soon as it went up, Westmacott's pediment was outmoded by an aesthetic of reverence for the Parthenon sculptures. The story of this process is unfolded with great expertise in this book by Ian Jenkins, one of the curators of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum. Jenkins explores the dilemma posed for Classically-educated Victorians: whether to salute fifth-century BC Athens as an absolute, an apogee, or recognise the linear inevitability of Darwinian progress. And he traces the development of another problem for museum directors: if Classical Greek art was perfection, where was one to put the also increasing quantities of Oriental and Near Eastern relics? Lord Elgin, as is now generally recognised, was driven not so much by aristocratic cupidity as by a wish to place before the British public exemplars of perfection, and a desire to encourage a renaissance of the arts in Britain. He would have been comforted by some of the statistics revealed by Jenkins: for instance, that in I879 permission to sketch Classical sculptures in the Museum was granted to some 15,000 art students. But creating a grand chain of progress in art, whereby Egypt was linked to Greece via Assyria, proved beyond Victorian ingenuity; and the hope that Greece might one day be capped by the glories of British art was never remotely sustained by the virtuosi of the day, however assiduous in their Neo-classicism. 'No longer is the art of one people judged the inferior of another, but each is taken on its own terms.' Thus Jenkins nods towards present canons of intellectual respectability, which dictate that anyone who visits the British Museum ought to spend as much time in front of the colossal monsters from Nimrud as with the Elgin marbles. But, having displaced the stuffed elephants, the Athenian gods and and heroes still enjoy a special status within the Museum. Although the 'Valhalla' designed for them in 1933 at the expense of Lord Duveen was modified to make them more accessible to the public gaze, the present setting of the Elgin marbles continues to nourish a sense of particular veneration for them. The sheer spaciousness of the Duveen gallery argues that its contents are examples of very rare and difficult art. It may be that, a century hence, the dynamics of taste and cultural relativism will have caused further reorganisation within the Museum; possibly, the Elgin marbles will not be there at all. But a museum, over time, becomes a relic in its own right. What Ian Jenkins has done is a self-reflexive exercise. He is a curator involved, as it were, with the curatorship of past curators. The results of his research are worth reading by anyone for whom the British Museum has ever furnished delight and discovery.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies It has not taken long to shatter France's ambitions of breaking free of German interest rates. Ever since Germany called off bilateral discussion of monetary policy two weeks ago, that hope was looking hollow. This week's economic data has reinforced the perception that the French recession is getting worse while that of Germany has bottomed out. So it is not surprising that the franc is suddenly weak again. Against a backdrop of rising unemployment, France cannot possibly raise interest rates to defend its currency. It must hope that German cuts will be sufficient and rapid enough to prevent the franc sinking to its floor. Judging by its previous behaviour, the Bundesbank will now seek to deliver just enough relief. The rally in both the German equity and bond markets suggest expectation of some acceleration in the pace of cuts. The strength of the D-mark may make this easier: it has regained something of its safe haven status, fuelled admittedly by premature expectations that the German constitutional court will rule against the Maastricht treaty. But the Bundesbank may also find it hard to ignore yesterday's upward revision in both the latest money supply and inflation figures. It may be tempted to make a basically cosmetic gesture before its summer recess, such as a cut in the now scarcely relevant Lombard rate or a slightly stronger downward push to money market rates. By fuelling expectations of further cuts, similar moves have calmed exchange markets before. But France needs a large fall in interest rates - probably to 5 per cent or lower - to secure the recovery that its businessmen and voters want. As long as that is not in sight, its long-term ability to stay the ERM course remains in question.</p>

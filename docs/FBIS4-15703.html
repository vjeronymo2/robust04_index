			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 8 Apr -- "Relations between our two  countries have good prospects. The Russian leadership, and not  extremist circles, is a good and reliable friend of the  leadership of the Serb Republic," Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev said today during the talks with Radoman Bozovic,  chairman of the Chamber of Citizens of the Federal Assembly  (parliament) of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is  possible to reach such a settlement which could be implemented  in practice, the Russian minister said.    "The settlement in Bosnia is not possible without the Serbs.  The Russian side advocates lifting the sanctions, which have  already become an anachronism, as soon as the agreement on the  settlement in Bosnia has been signed," the Russian minister  said. Andrey Kozyrev appreciated Belgrade's goodwill to  continue a political dialogue in Bosnia.</p>

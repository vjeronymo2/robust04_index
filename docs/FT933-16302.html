			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Internal disputes hinder Socialist pursuit of power AFTER the ruling Liberal Democratic party was brought down last month, Mr Sadao Yamahana, leader of the country's Socialist party, confidently assured the US ambassador to Japan that an election win by his party would not create policy divisions between Tokyo and Washington. A few days later, with closed-door condemnation from colleagues still echoing in his ears, Mr Yamahana headed down a different path, explaining his party 'has its own foreign policies' and will take a different approach to the US from that of the LDP. Mr Yamahana's clumsy performance was another sign to Japanese voters that his party, known as the Social Democratic party in English but still the Shakaito (Socialist party) in Japanese, has been unable to settle the ideological disputes which have ensured it is the natural party of opposition. After a brief period in office in the late 1940s, the SDP has become the party the Japanese occasionally vote for when particularly annoyed by the excesses of the LDP. Following the Recruit scandal four years ago, when cut-price stocks were swapped for political favours, the party had a remarkable opportunity to capitalise on dissatisfaction with the LDP. In the wake of the scandal, Ms Takako Doi led the party into an upper house election, denying the LDP a majority and heightening expectations of a similar result in the more powerful lower house. She appeared to have the authority to change the rigidly leftist policies which had alienated voters: the embrace of totalitarian North Korea, the refusal to recognise the existence of the Japanese military, and hostility towards the US. At that moment Ms Doi may have had the authority, but she did not have the will. The brilliance soon faded, and the SDP left voters disappointed again. The party was then humiliated in a 1991 Tokyo gubernatorial election, where its candidate lost his deposit, and was crushed in a succession of local government contests. Wasted chances in the past and the emergence of new political groups have made Mr Yamahana and other SDP pragmatists realise the party no longer wins the protest vote. But as his backtracking on US relations showed, the watering down of traditional policies alienates the party's core supporters. Both trends were behind the SDP's dismal performance in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly elections a week ago, when its representatives were cut from 29 to 14 and the local party chairman and general-secretary lost their seats. The SDP reaction was to move both forward and backward. Officials emphasised there had been no fundamental change in the traditional policies, and also promised to pursue more pragmatic policies in an attempt to prove the party was the real alternative to the LDP. One leader suggested that the 'leftists holding us back can be counted like moles on a body'. But Mr Yamahana's problem is that most of the moles are in the upper part of the body. The pragmatists, those uncomfortable with the cosiness towards North Korea, are said to comprise more than 70 per cent of the party, but the remaining 30 per cent, the true believers, have an inordinate influence at the top of the hierarchy and, particularly, on policymaking committees. The SDP is getting itself in trouble because, on the eve on an election, the party is debating sensitive policies which should have been resolved over the past few years. Mr Yamahana, who recently replaced the indecisive Mr Makoto Tanabe, who in turn took over from the indecisive Ms Doi, finds himself attempting to hold together a party instead of exploiting the LDP's weakness.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EASTERN PILOTS VOTE TO CONTINUE STRIKE;  </P> <P> STAND RE-EVALUATED IN N.Y., ATLANTA, MIAMI MEETINGS  </P> <P> Striking Eastern Airlines pilots in New York and Atlanta voted to continue  their walkout against the carrier, while pilots in Miami voiced support for the  5-month-old strike.  </P> <P> The pilots met separately Sunday in the first of a series of local meetings  intended to assess the mood of the union membership.  </P> <P> Leaders of the Air Line Pilots Assn. at Eastern voted unanimously Saturday to  continue the strike, but the leadership wants to gauge the depth of support for  that action within the rank and file.  </P> <P> The Miami Herald today quoted union sources as saying pilots in New York and  Atlanta voted to remain on strike, but vote totals were not available. The  meeting in Miami was recessed until Tuesday, when leaders expect to take a  straw poll.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not the Only Option'  </P> <P> "There are number of options before the (leadership council), and the options  do include returning to work," said a spokesman for the pilots union, who asked  not to be quoted by name. "That is not the only option (and) it is not the  strongest option."  </P> <P> The pilots' union has supported the strike, which was called March 4 by the  International Assn. of Machinists, the union that represents the airline's  ground workers, and the union representing Eastern's flight attendants.  </P> <P> Only about 200 of Eastern's 3,500 pilots initially crossed the picket line, but  Eastern claims that striking pilots have been returning to work in growing  numbers. As of Aug. 1, Eastern said 367 pre-strike pilots were working.  </P> <P> The union spokesman said the re-evaluation of the strike was not prompted by  pilot defections.  </P> <P> "I would not -- I could not -- characterize that as a reason for meeting," he  said. "I don't think anything has brought this to the fore other than there are  options before us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rebuilding Schedule  </P> <P> Eastern, which was forced by the strike to suspend much of its service and file  for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code,  has since begun to rebuild its flight schedule, in part with replacement  pilots.  </P> <P> If the striking pilots were to return to work, a key issue would be how many  jobs remain at Eastern.  </P> <P> The airline says it has jobs for only about 1,700 pilots.  </P> <P> As of Aug. 1, the company had trained 291 replacement pilots to fly for  Eastern, and another 750 new hires were attending training classes.  </P></p>

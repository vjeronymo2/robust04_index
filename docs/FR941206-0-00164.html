			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) An organic destruction, biological degradation, or organic removal process that reduces the organic content of the hazardous waste and is designed and operated in accordance with certain conditions specified in the rule; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A hazardous waste incinerator that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 264 subpart O or 40 CFR 265 subpart O; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A boiler or industrial furnace that is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 266 subpart H. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A process that simply mixes, blends, combines, or aggregates a hazardous waste stream with other materials does not destroy the organics in the waste stream or remove the organics from the waste stream. While diluting a hazardous waste stream having a volatile organic concentration greater than 100 ppmw with sufficient quantities of other hazardous waste streams having a volatile organic concentration less than 100 ppmw (or water or other low organic content materials) would reduce the volatile organic concentration of the resulting hazardous waste mixture to a level below 100 ppmw, the total mass quantity of organics in the waste does not change since no organics were removed or destroyed from the waste. The potential for organic emissions from handling the waste mixture is essentially the same as for the individual hazardous waste streams prior to being mixed. Therefore, the EPA does not allow dilution of a hazardous waste as a means for complying with the requirements specified in the subpart CC standards for placing treated hazardous waste in affected tanks, surface impoundments, or containers not using the required air emission controls. Consequently, when a hazardous waste is treated by an organic destruction or removal process and the hazardous waste has been mixed or aggregated together with other hazardous wastes or materials with a volatile organic concentration less than 100 ppmw prior to the point of waste treatment, the subpart CC standards require that TSDF owners and operators meet special requirements to ensure that organics in the hazardous waste have actually been removed or destroyed. An owner or operator can choose from several alternative provisions to comply with these requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One provision requires that mixed hazardous wastes be treated by an organic destruction or removal process that reduces the volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste to meet a site-specific treatment process exit concentration limit. This limit is determined by the TSDF owner or operator on a case-by-case basis using an equation specified in the rule that accounts for the portion of the reduction in the volatile organic concentration in the resulting treated hazardous waste stream due to dilution. To use this equation, the owner or operator must first determine the volatile organic concentration at the point of waste origination for each individual hazardous waste stream that is mixed together prior to entering the treatment process. As an alternative to calculating the exit concentration limit for a treatment process, the subpart CC standards allow the owner or operator to treat the mixed hazardous wastes to a volatile organic concentration level that is less than or equal to the lowest waste volatile organic concentration at the point of waste origination for all of the individual hazardous waste streams mixed together prior to entering the treatment process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another alternative in the subpart CC standards available to owners and operators allows mixed hazardous wastes to be treated using a single process that achieves an organic reduction efficiency of 95 percent or greater on a mass basis, and reduces the average volatile organic concentration of the resulting hazardous waste stream exiting the process to a level less than 50 ppmw. This alternative does not require the owner or operator to perform any volatile organic concentration waste determinations for the hazardous wastes prior to mixing, yet still accommodates the mixing of wastes that have different volatile organic concentrations. For a waste stream having a volatile organic concentration greater than 2,000 ppmw, requiring only a minimum 95 percent reduction of the organic content in the waste stream would not lower the volatile organic concentration of the treated waste stream to the 100 ppmw level of the rule. However, if such a waste stream had been mixed together prior to treatment with other waste streams having lower volatile organic concentrations, then the volatile organic concentration of the treated waste exiting the process could be less than 100 ppmw. The EPA does not consider such situations to be unlikely, and has therefore chosen for this alternative to require an exit concentration for the treated waste lower than 100 ppmw. The EPA considers an exit concentration of 50 ppmw, combined with a 95 percent treatment efficiency, to be an appropriate demonstration that the reduction in volatile organic concentration for a mixture of hazardous waste streams has been achieved through destruction or removal of organic constituents in the waste, rather than by dilution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final subpart CC standards also provide another alternative that does not require the owner or operator to perform any volatile organic concentration waste determinations for the hazardous wastes prior to mixing when the waste is treated by a biological process that destroys or degrades the organics contained in the hazardous waste to meet certain performance requirements specified in the rule. These conditions are either of the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Achieve an organic reduction efficiency for the biological treatment process equal to or greater than 95 percent, and achieve an organic biodegradation efficiency for the process equal to or greater than 95 percent; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Achieve a total actual organic mass biodegradation rate for all hazardous waste treated by the process equal to or greater than the required organic mass removal rate for the process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance with these parameters is determined using the procedures specified in rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA may at any time measure or request that the owner or operator measure using Method 25D the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste that is placed in a tank, surface impoundment, or container not using air emission controls in accordance with the requirements of the subpart CC standards. Measurement results showing that the volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste is equal to or greater than 100 ppmw constitutes noncompliance with the subpart CC standards. However, in a case where the owner or operator has used an averaging period greater than 1 hour for determining the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste, the Regional Administrator may consider information that was used by the owner or operator to determine the average volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste (e.g., test results, measurements, calculations, and other documentation) together with the results of the waste determination in determining whether the owner or operator is in compliance with the subpart CC standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

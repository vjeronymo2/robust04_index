			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Lanchashire County Council decides to join Greenpeace Lancashire County Council yesterday decided to join Greenpeace, the environmental group, in pressing for judicial review of the government's approval for the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. Greenpeace has indemnified the council against any costs. The Labour-controlled council passed the resolution in spite of opposition from Conservatives and from some unions which say Thorp will generate jobs in Lancashire as well as Cumbria. The Lancashire coast is between 35 and 50 miles south of Sellafield. The council can appeal for review under the Local Government Act 1972 over what it believes are possible public health issues. Mrs Louise Ellman, council leader, said Radmil, an independent radioactive monitoring service, had said that opening Thorp and changing discharge authorisation levels at Sellafield could increase health risks for people in Lancashire. But Mr Nick Johnson, clerk to the Nuclear Workers' Thorp campaign, asked Greenpeace not to proceed. 'In the name of the 8,400 nuclear workers at the Sellafield nuclear site, their families and the further 12,000 jobs that depend on Sellafield, we call on you to accept the outcome of the democratic process,' he said. Labour-controlled Copeland Borough Council, where most people likely to be employed at Thorp live, has also backed the government's move.</p>

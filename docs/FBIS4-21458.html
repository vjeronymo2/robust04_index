			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy -- The Maritime Kray  interdepartmental commission to monitor the observance of  radiation safety norms has deemed it expedient to dump liquid  radioactive waste from the TNT-5 tanker in designated areas in  the Sea of Japan in May. The commission checked the condition  of the two tankers where liquid radioactive waste from the  Pacific Fleet is stored and established a worsening in the  radiological situation at the place of their anchorage in the  Bolshoy Kamen Bay. The commission is especially concerned by  the TNT-5 tanker, which is in critical condition after a repeat  winter storage of liquid radioactive waste aboard it. The  integrity of the tanker's drainage, pipe, and valve systems has  been disrupted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified studio announcer and Reporter Juan </F> Carlos Atoyo; from the "Vector 21" newscast]    [Text] [Announcer] The Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN] sent to all party presidential candidates and to members  of the political parties an invitation to participate in the  meeting -- the initiation of the peace dialogue. The EZLN  argues that their participation is a matter of interest to them,  as one of these candidates will be president of the Republic.  The EZLN indicated they want the presidential candidates to  make a commitment to respect the agreements that might be  reached with the current Mexican Government. Some presidential  candidates have already replied that they will attend the  meeting while others will do so through delegates.    Now, back to the communique sent last night by members of  the  Indian revolutionary clandestine committee, the EZLN General  Command, to the presidential candidates of National Action Party  [PAN]; Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]; Party of the  Democratic Revolution [PRD]; Cardenist Front for National  Reconstruction Party [PFCRN]; Labor Party [PL]; Authentic Party  of the Mexican Revolution [PARM]; Mexican Green Ecologist Party;  and the Popular Socialist Party [PPS]. The UNO [National  Opposition Union] was not mentioned because it is not registered.    We now go to Congress where Reporter Juan Carlos Atoyo went  to obtain the so-called opposition party's response to the EZLN  invitation.    [Atoyo] The presidential candidates from the PRI, PARM,  Mexican Green Ecologist Party, PL, and PFCRN, have already  accepted the EZLN invitation to attend or to send delegates to  the encounter with Manuel Camacho Solis, special commissioner  for peace and reconciliation, in Chiapas. Meanwhile, the PPS  rejected the invitation and the PAN will issue its response  through its national executive committee which is analyzing the  EZLN invitation.    [Announcer] At first, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos [PAN  candidate] had stated that he considered this invitation to be  inconvenient.    [Atoyo] That is right. From the beginning, Diego Fernandez  de Cevallos said the invitation was inconvenient, nevertheless,  he left this decision to be made by his party's national  executive committee. This has also been confirmed.    I will go one by one on what each political party said: PRD  candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas Solorzano said he accepted this  invitation as this guarantees continuity in the commitments to  be made during the pacification dialogue in Chiapas. When  disclosing his candidate's reply, PRD leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo  said the following:    [Begin Munoz Ledo recording] This is an invitation addressed  to the party candidates. I have consulted with our candidate,  Engineer Cardenas, who is in favor, as I am, of accepting the  invitation. Of course, I have called for a meeting of the party  executive committee to define the terms of our participation and  to appoint our representative. [end recording]    [Atoyo] Meanwhile, PARM candidate Alvaro Perez Trevino said  he officially accepted the invitation. Nevertheless, he sent a  message to the EZLN to issue a personal and direct invitation  for him to directly accept. In the interim, the PAN said that  in a few hours it will disclose its position. Here is what PAN  deputy candidate Gabriel Jimenez Remus said:    [Begin Jimenez recording] From a positive point of view,  this  invitation is of interest. Theoretically speaking, no one knows  who will be the winner on 21 August. It is obvious that the  EZLN needs to talk to or engage in a dialogue with the  presidential candidates. I have no doubt the actions that the  federal government takes and the participation of the diverse  commissions will lead to the adoption of emergency actions to  benefit Chiapas. There is no doubt, however, that these actions  will have a bearing on the coming administration. [end recording]    [Atoyo] Meanwhile, PL candidate Cecilia Soto said that the  EZLN invitation was another sign of this armed group's goodwill.  Soto said she accepted the invitation but it would be her  party's leadership that would decide if she would attend  personally or if a delegation would be sent.    In the interim, PPS candidate Marcela Lombardo declined this  invitation outright. Lombardo said that above all she did not  accept the invitation because she did not agree with the  attitude assumed by the EZLN to take up arms to solve diverse  problems. Meanwhile, the UNO members indicated they had no  comment to make given that their candidate has not been invited  to the dialogue.    [Atoyo] In another turn of events, today during a meeting  of the Chamber of Deputies' permanent commission, the Chiapas  issue undoubtedly had to be brought up. The debate concentrated  on permanent attacks between the PRI and the PRD. The first to  take the podium was PRI Deputy Laura Lizia Gaza Galindo who  launched severely criticized the PRD. Gaza Galindo said that  the PRD has called on the EZLN to form an alliance to struggle;  it speaks about laws and then turns around and supports the use  of weapons to achieve goals, she noted. After indicating that  the call to violence is a way of violating the peace and  democracy agreement signed by all the presidential candidates,  Laura Lizia Gaza Galindo challenged the PRD members as follows:    [Begin Gaza Galindo recording] They [PRD] want to break the  political agreement signed by all the political forces. This  implicitly means: Either they accept we have won on 21 August  or there will be violence. They will get involved [word  indistinct] through the armed struggle. All of these comments  have been made by their top party leaders, who appear to take as  their own a declaration of war; the EZLN's declaration was one  of war. To Mexico's good fortune, this declaration seems to  have been left behind. Is the PRD taking over this declaration  of war as its own? What is this all about? Does this mean that  the PRD will become the EZLN's political arm? Or does this mean  that the EZLN becomes the armed body of the PRD? [end recording]    Afterward, PRD Deputy Jose de Jesus Martinez Campos launched  his reply. Martinez Campos said that his party's call for the  EZLN members to join the party seeks to incorporate them into  the struggle through democratic means, by granting them  representation. The PRD deputy said they had the right to their  differences but to talk of the situation that could arise on 21  August if the votes are not respected has serious implications,  as this is closely tied to the Chiapas case.    [Begin Martinez Campos recording] If we do not guarantee  that  the election will be honest, that votes will be respected and  well counted, that these issues can be discussed, the outcome of  these 1994 elections will not be legitimate. Then, there will  not be an EZLN but many civilian outbreaks and maybe unwanted  violent outbreaks if this right is not guaranteed to be secure.  [end recording]    [Atoyo] This is what happened today at the Chamber of  Deputies during the session of the Congress of the Union  permanent commission's session and the political parties'  reaction to the EZLN invitation to participate in the first  dialogue of the special commission for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas with Manuel Camacho Solis.</p>

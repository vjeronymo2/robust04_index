			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Expenses come under tax reforms Companies will be required to provide employees with details of their expenses and benefits-in-kind each year under proposals for the new tax system of self-assessment unveiled yesterday by the Inland Revenue. They will have to provide full information to staff on pay and tax deducted by May 19 after the end of the tax year, and submit expenses and benefits information by July 6. The details are contained in a consultative document on the implications of self-assessment for employers and employees just circulated. Self-assessment, which begins in the 1996-97 tax year, will affect an estimated 9m taxpayers who submit tax returns, including many in the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system in the upper-rate tax band or with complex tax affairs. The system was proposed in 1991, ratified by the last two chancellors, and many of the details were passed in the most recent finance act which became law last month. The focus so far has been on the self-employed, but the latest proposals provide further details for those on PAYE who will still be ensnared by the new system. The Revenue recommends that the employer should include information on the cash equivalent for any benefit-in-kind provided to the employee. Companies would face fines if they fail to provide employees with the information. Comments on the document are invited by July.</p>

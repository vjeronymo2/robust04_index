			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 15 (CNS) -- The Chinese Academy of  Social Sciences [CASS] invited tenders for the first time for  some of its key research projects in order to encourage  researchers to take up difficult subjects and to produce  substantive success. Such a practice is aimed at enabling the  academy to further build up a competitive and incentive  mechanism.    The Director of the Scientific Research Bureau of the  academy  Mr. He Bingmeng, said in an interview with this agency that the  academy had formulated regulations of such bidding on a trial  basis. He added that the regulations stated that the academy  would offer public bidding each year for some key research  projects in order to ensure high quality results.    The traditional practice employed by the academy for key  projects started with applications by each of its institutes  which would be discussed by the Scientific Research Bureau. The  applications were then submitted to the academy for final  appraisal and approval. The main shortcoming of such practice  lay in failure of highlighting the key projects which in turn  led to fewer number of researchers who took up such projects.    The Vice President of the academy, Mr. Ru Xin, said that  there were some 460 treatises last year as the result of  research on specific topics, together with 530 investigative  reports, 2,500 academic papers not including translated and  academic references. All these totalled 150 million Chinese  characters. Mr. Ru frankly acknowledged that the success in  terms of quantity was rather great but there were not many of  high quality while most of them were of general level and some  even were of low quality.    The bureau made public some guidelines for the bidding which  covers 12 research projects including research on situation of  and solution to state-owned enterprises which are in serious  loss, research on loss of state-owned asset seen in the  transaction of property rights of state-owned enterprises,  research on division of revenue and expenditure by governments  at various levels and a shift of revenue between governments,  legal protection on the build-up of clean administration, policy  on absorption of surplus of rural labour force in main urban  areas and research on relationships between China and Japan as  well as the United States in economic cooperation in Asia and  Pacific region.    The 12 items make up one seventh of key projects set by the  academy for the entire year. The period of time for such  bidding was between May 10 and June 30 which is open to all  researchers of the academy on a basis of fair competition and  the most suitable candidates will be chosen. The academy  specially appropriated RMB [renminbi] 680 000 to fund the  research items under the bidding. Mr. He said that in order to  ensure high level outcome from these projects, the academy  suggested to carry out joint research on these items and  organized research teams featuring various disciplines and  institutes as well as experts and scholars.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Bosnian winter will place 2m at risk THE bitterly cold winters which sweep across the Balkan peninsula will claim the lives of many more people in Bosnia-Hercegovina unless conditions rapidly improve in the former Yugoslav republic, officials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday. The people most affected will be the thousands held in detentions camps, but as many as 2m people in the Bosnian war zone could be at risk. 'Not only is there massive destruction of buildings but there are no windows left,' said Mr Charles Lamuniere, director of the UN department of Humanitarian Affairs. 'So when those winds start blowing  - you know, Sarajevo is in a valley and the wind will start blowing  - people will die of cold, water will freeze.' Mr Lamuniere said he was particularly concerned about those prisoners in detention camps. He specifically referred to 3,000 Moslem men he saw in the Serbian-run camp at Manjaca, northern Bosnia. He said the detainees were forced to sleep on cold concrete floors. Ms Sylvana Foa, of UNHCR said that about 200 homes were being destroyed every day. 'We're really worried about everyone in the war zone. That's about 2m pople. Time is very pressing. We probably have another eight weeks before it gets cold.' The UNHCR needed personnel, supplies, heating equipment, blankets and plastic sheeting to cover up the windows, she said. Getting massive aid supplies into Bosnia will require guarantees of safe passage, particularly by the Bosnia Serbs and Serb irregulars, a western diplomat said. Meanwhile, there was a hopeful sign in the Bosnian conflict last night when leaders of the warring factions agreed to UN supervision of all heavy weapons around Sarajevo. 'If this agreement works, there will be no shelling in Sarajevo,' Mr Zaim Backovic, a deputy commander of the Bosnian forces, said. The agreement, concentrating heavy weapons in areas under UN supervision, would enable monitors to determine who is responsible for shelling and to pressure violators to stop. It was signed by Serb nationalist and Bosnian government leaders. However, western caution about the conflict could be enhanced by a threat yesterday to an RAF relief flight at Sarajevo airport. UNHCR suspended humanitarian relief flights after the incident, but the airport remained open. No military intervention was planned against the forces who apparently 'locked on' to a RAF Hercules transport with radar equipment designed to target objects for attack, the UN said in New York. It said other flights would continue, including one due to bring Gen Satish Nambiar, head of UN peacekeepers in Yugoslavia. A senior UN source in Sarajevo said earlier that UN headquarters was evaluating the incident and that it could lead to an air strike against the gun position. The incident, less than a week after a UN Security Council resolution allowing the use of force to get supplies to trapped civilians, seemed sure to heighten tension and increase the probability of foreign military action in the area. A strike would have been the first direct foreign military intervention against one of the warring parties in the four-month-old Bosnia conflict. In addition to the problems posed by the pending winter, western diplomats say that Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, continues to sanction the process of 'ethnic cleansing', by which whole communities are forced to leave their homes. In addition the diplomats say he is not prepared to lift the siege of Sarajevo, the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde, and the northern city of Bihac. 'We must not forget that Sarajevo, a European city, is still being bombarded. People, most Moslems, are being forced to sign away their property, then they are forced to flee. UN or European Community resolutions have not stopped the killing,' an EC diplomat said.</p>

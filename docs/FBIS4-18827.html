			<p>BFN     [Text] The diplomatic and political cooperation which has  existed so far between Poland, France, and Germany is to be  extended to security, the defense ministers of these three  countries agreed in Paris.    [Reporter Grzegorz Dobiecki] A joint communique, the details  of which are still being worked out, confirms the decisive  support of France and Germany for the idea of Polish association  with the Western European Union [WEU], the military arm of the  Community. A binding decision in this matter can be expected in  May.    The defense ministers of the three countries are to hold  annual meetings, just as the foreign ministers of France,  Poland, and Germany have been doing for the past two years.  Military cooperation is to be equally regular: constant contact  between general staffs and joint exercises for army units.    One should emphasize that the Paris communique speaks only  of  Poland as regards the prospect of association with the WEU and  of direct cooperation with France and Germany. It generally does  not speak about the countries of Central and Eastern Europe or  about the Visegrad group. The French defense minister, opening  the meeting of the Weimar Three quite clearly said: There is no  Poland without Europe, just as Europe without Poland is  unimaginable. Polish participation in all European structures  is obvious in a time perspective. Today we shall be talking  among ourselves about how to achieve the fastest possible  rapprochement of Poland to the WEU.    [Announcer] Our correspondent found out unofficially that  Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk met yesterday the special army  representative of the French president who said: Poland will not  remain for long in the gray area of security in Europe. It will  swiftly enter a field of the same colors as those protecting the  western area of the continent.</p>

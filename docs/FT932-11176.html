			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (4): Struggle to cut debt - Anthony Robinson meets a key negotiator DEBT reduction is crucial to Bulgaria's future economic growth and political stability. So the government has put the responsibility for carrying out debt negotiations with both the Paris and London creditor clubs in the hands of Ms Mariana Todorova. She has joined Ms Hanna Suchocka, Poland's prime minister, and Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Walz, the governor of Poland's central bank, in that small group of high-powered women decision makers who have emerged in former communist Europe. Her combination of charm, intelligence and toughness will soon be focused on foreign commercial bankers, who hold the bulk of Bulgaria's total Dollars 10.96bn foreign debt, when the negotiators and their London Club bank creditors, led by Deutsche Bank, meet in Frankfurt later this month. At issue is the Dollars 8.5bn owed to a group of more than 300 foreign banks, most of it accumulated over the last five years of the Zhivkov regime. During this period the communist government borrowed heavily both to service its existing debt and to pay for the import of components and equipment. Much of the imported components were then incorporated in goods which were exported to the former Soviet Union for soft roubles or sent to slow-paying countries such as Iraq, which still owes Bulgaria Dollars 2bn. Large-scale borrowing, amounting to Dollars 1,200 a head, helped to prop up the Zhivkov regime and disguise the declining competitiveness of the economy since the mid-1970s. The loans were provided mainly by European and Japanese banks on the assumption that the former Soviet Union stood in the background as lender of last resort to its former satellites. That illusion was smashed in 1990 when the Socialist party (communist) government, faced with the need to repay over Dollars 3bn in capital and interest, first stopped interest payment and then capital repayment. By that time the Soviet Union was in no position to bail out anybody. 'There was no alternative to declaring a debt moratorium,' says Ms Todorova who, as a senior research fellow at the Institute for International Relations in Sofia, had been compiling facts on the debt situation and knew that the refusal of western banks to roll over credits made default inevitable. Since then, however, Bulgaria has been cut off from access to international capital markets and has had to rely on financing from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and aid sources such as the European Community Phare Fund. The first step towards normalising financial relations came with last year's rescheduling agreement for the Dollars 1.8bn Paris Club debt. This provided for no debt reduction but a seven-year capital repayment grace period followed by repayment over four years. In return, Bulgaria started repaying interest totalling Dollars 74m since March 1992. But previous meetings with the London Club left both sides far apart. The Bulgarian side proposed 75 per cent debt reduction while the banks counter-offered with a proposal for a 38 per cent cut. In this month's London Club negotiations in Frankfurt Ms Todorova will be seeking a Brady-type debt relief with big reductions in both capital and interest obligations. Technically, Bulgaria will offer a full menu of possibilities - including discount bonds, par bonds, front-loaded interest reduction bonds, debt-equity swaps and buy-backs. 'All the countries of eastern Europe are different and their treatment should reflect this as in Latin America where the case-by-case approach has been applied,' Ms Todorova argues. Given the parlous state of an economy whose GDP has virtually halved over the last three years and whose hard currency earning potential is severely limited, Ms Todorova appears most interested in reaching agreement on debt buy-back. She quotes the example of Costa Rica which, with help from the Inter American Bank, was allowed to extinguish its debt by buying back at a discount of 78 per cent. Bulgarian debt is currently priced on the secondary market at 16 to 20 per cent of face value. Many smaller creditor banks have already offloaded their Bulgarian debt in this way. But it is far from clear that other banks, which also face demands for a 50 per cent reduction in Poland's commercial bank debt, will be ready to write off so much of their Bulgarian book as the price of their previous imprudence.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  EXTERNAL DEBT STOCK IN CONVERTIBLE CURRENCIES 1990-1992 (IN DOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     1990       1991      1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Paris Club (official creditors)    1,479      1,118     1,205 London Club (commercial banks)     7,277      7,875     8,508 Comecon countries                  1,150      1,188     1,250 TOTAL                              9,796     10,181    10,963  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: National Bank of Bulgaria and International Monetary Fund  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

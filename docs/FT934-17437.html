			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: European and US drug sales growth declines EUROPEAN and US drugs sales growth decelerated rapidly during the first six months of this year. The Japanese market continued to recover following price cuts last year. The European prescription drugs market, hit by healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy, actually fell from Dollars 25.2bn (Pounds 16.3bn) to Dollars 23.4bn, although the figures were affected by exchange rates. In local currencies, drugs sales in pharmacies in the seven largest European markets rose only 1 per cent, according to IMS International, the specialist market research group. That compares with 10 per cent last year. The German market fell from Dollars 7.1bn to Dollars 6.3bn - a drop of 11 per cent in D-Mark terms. The decline in Germany is even more serious for the research-based drugs groups selling patented products. This is because the headline figures mask a considerable increase in prescribing of off-patent medicines by generics companies. The 11 per cent overall drop in sales compares with an increase of 9 per cent in West Germany during the first six months of 1992. Prescriptions sales in France continued to grow, up from Dollars 5.9bn to Dollars 6.2bn, a rise of 7 per cent in local currencies in spite of government efforts to restrict prescribing. The UK market fell in dollar terms from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.5bn, but rose in local currencies by 11 per cent. The US, the largest single drugs market, was sluggish, with growth of only 3 per cent, from Dollars 17.5bn to Dollars 18.5bn. That was in spite of an ageing population and the launch of innovative products. The Japanese market was up from Dollars 6.1bn to Dollars 7.7bn - a rise of 13 per cent.</p>

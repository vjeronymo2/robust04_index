			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> $500 DONOR LIMIT;  </P> <P> FOE ACCUSES BERNARDI OF SKIRTING LAW  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, co-author of the city's campaign  reform law, was accused by a political foe Thursday of violating the spirit, if  not the letter, of a $500-per-donor limit on campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Bernardi denied any wrongdoing, but admitted making an error in reporting one  of the questionable contributions. He said he returned another questionable  contribution last week.  </P> <P> Lyle Hall, a firefighter who is challenging Bernardi in the April 11 election  in the northeast San Fernando Valley's 7th District, called for a city  attorney's investigation of a possible violation of the city's elections law. A  spokesman for the city attorney said the office has not received the request  and would not comment on the allegations.  </P> <P> Hall cited two $500 checks that Bernardi reported receiving Dec. 23 from Gelb  Enterprises, a property management firm in Encino. A 1985 voter-approved law  limits contributions to council candidates to $500 per source.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $500 Contributions  </P> <P> Hall added that Bernardi reported receiving $500 each on Dec. 14 from Santa  Monica developer Ray Watt, his brother Donald, Donald's wife Florence,  Watt/Parker Inc. and Watt Pac Inc.  </P> <P> It is not uncommon or illegal for several employees of a company or several  members of a family to contribute $500 each to a council candidate. But if an  employer requires an employee to make a contribution or reimburses an employee,  it could violate the law, according to the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> Speaking at a City Hall news conference, Hall accused Bernardi of "using the  same tactics that he has publicly denounced." He was referring to Bernardi's  criticism of his colleagues for accepting $500 contributions from several  employees of the same company.  </P> <P> "While this technically may comply with the letter of the law, it clearly  defies the spirit," Hall quoted Bernardi as writing in a letter to the editor  of a newspaper.  </P> <P> Bernardi said he erred in reporting two $500 contributions from Gelb  Enterprises. He said the contributions were made independently by two employees  of the company, which is permitted under the law.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tickets to Dinner  </P> <P> Rickey Gelb, general partner of Gelb Enterprises, confirmed Bernardi's account.  He said he and his brother each bought two tickets to Bernardi's $250-a-plate  dinner Thursday night at the Sportsmen's Lodge.  </P> <P> Gelb said he contributed to Bernardi because Bernardi was the only council  member who attended a party held several years ago to honor Gelb's mother.  </P> <P> "I thought it was very nice of him," he said. Gelb said his firm conducts no  business with the city.  </P> <P> Bernardi said he returned $500 to Watt Pac last week after learning that the  funds are controlled by Donald Watt, who already had given him $500. But he  said he kept $500 contributions from Donald Watt, his wife Florence, his  brother Ray and Watt/Parker because "they are all separate accounts."  </P> <P> Bernardi said he follows the law scrupulously.  </P> <P> "There are some $7,000 in checks over the legal limit that we have returned  since we started this fund-raising," Bernardi said.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to get into a debate with Lyle," Bernardi added. "He needs to  get name recognition and this kind of material makes headlines."  </P> <P> It was the second attack on Bernardi this week by Hall, who had pledged last  year not to conduct a negative campaign. On Monday, Hall criticized Bernardi  for his poor attendance at council meetings in the last year. Bernardi said he  missed about 21% of the meetings because he and his wife were ill.  </P> <P> Last year, Councilwoman Joy Picus, co-author of the city's campaign reform law,  returned $3,000 she received from six employees of a development firm because  of "the appearance of a possible attempt to skirt the law."  </P> <P> In her case, some of the contributions came from secretaries. She said it is  not customary for secretaries to make contributions.  </P></p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: One-man band strikes a familiar note  -Zhirinovsky's rise has strong parallels with pre-war Germany The remarkably strong showing of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party yesterday prompted Mr Yegor Gaidar, architect of Russia's economic reforms, to make a historical comparison which is looming large in the minds of many frightened observers of the country's political scene. In a domestic radio broadcast Mr Gaidar, who once dubbed Mr Zhirinovsky 'a little Hitler', drew parallels between Russia's tenuous political and economic climate and the situation in inter-war Germany which propelled the Nazis to power. The similarities are certainly striking. Like Adolf Hitler, Mr Zhirinovsky has benefited from his country's simultaneous collapse of political muscle abroad and living standards at home. And like the Nazis, Mr Zhirinovsky's strictly hierarchical, well-organised party, adept at producing rhetoric which appeals to many Russian people, has capitalised on the internecine quarrels among Russian democrats and their failure to woo tired voters with the promise of quick-fix solutions to Russia's woes. The Liberal Democratic party is very much the creature of Mr Zhirinovsky, its leader. Party enthusiasts sometimes go by the name of 'Zhirinovsky's eagles' and the main party broadsheets all bear their chief's name rather than the party's official title. None of the other members are prominent figures in their own right in Russian politics. However, far from apologising for his organisation's focus on a single man, Mr Zhirinovsky sees it as one of the secrets of his success. 'A party should have a single leader, with whom no one can quarrel. This is crucial to party discipline and to our strength,' he said in a pre-poll interview. Unlike the Communist party, which could draw on the extensive network still in place from the days when it ran the Soviet Union, or Russia's Choice, which was effectively the party of government, the Liberal Democrats have had to create a structure from scratch. Building on the supporters Mr Zhirinovsky first rallied to his side in his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1991, the Liberal Democrats swiftly assembled an organisation depending less on a strong network throughout Russia's regions than on their leader's charismatic message. The Liberal Democrats' principle campaign weapons were highly emotive paid television advertisements and Mr Zhirinovsky's extensive personal appearances at rallies throughout the country. Party officials yesterday said they had spent Rbs1bn on the campaign which the party treasurer last week said had come from 'God himself'. He later explained that the funds were entirely based on small contributions of Rbs2,000 and Rbs3000 each from individuals. Mr Zhirinovsky has benefited, in particular, from pockets of intense support in areas, such as the break-away Abkhazian region in Georgia, where ethnic Russians or small minority groups feel threatened by one of the newly independent post-Soviet states. In places like these his promise to protect ethnic Russians everywhere is compelling. The remarkable electoral success of the Liberal Democrats is likely to test how a political structure so closely tied to a single man - so effective on the campaign trail - will adapt to the more formal challenges of parliamentary politics. In marked contrast to the outrageous statements Mr Zhirinovsky issued with evident relish during the campaign, the morning after his unexpected victory was taking pains to position himself as a reasonable man, willing to work within Russia's existing political framework. Best known for taking unashamedly extremist positions (he promised last week to shoot the presidents of Russia's 5,000 commercial banks), Mr Zhirinovsky is now portraying himself as the great conciliator who can weave a compromise out of the patch-work of Russia's political parties. In this somewhat incongruous role as Russia's centrist force, Mr Zhirinovsky said his party would be willing to form a government to serve under President Boris Yeltsin or to take up two or three ministerial posts within a coalition. Alternatively, his confusingly named party would be willing to act as 'a constructive opposition'. The soul of compromise, Mr Zhirinovsky - who makes no effort to conceal his ambition to become president one day - said he would not oppose Mr Yeltsin if he chose to postpone presidential elections until 1996, nor would his party object to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin's continued tenure as prime minister. The only post the Liberal Democrats - are scoring between 20 and 26 per cent in projections of the election results - say they will insist upon is chairmanship of the lower house of parliament, the State Duma. With Mr Yeltsin's chief spokesman yesterday telling Interfax that parts of Mr Zhirinovsky's platform 'quite correspond to the social aspects of the president's policies - that is the social policy of the state, patriotism, making Russian great', Russia's beleaguered democrats must now ask themselves who is more dangerous: the demagogic Zhirinovsky of the campaign trail, or the victorious parliamentarian, extending a hand in co-operation.</p>

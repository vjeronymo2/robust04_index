			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow trades narrowly after Tuesday's drama Wall Street AFTER the dramas of Tuesday, US stock markets were calmer yesterday, with share prices spending most of the day in a narrow range either side of opening values. Secondary stocks, however, continued to be plagued by heavy selling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.70 better at 3,312.19. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.61 off at 433.30, while the American SE composite finished 4.45 lower at 401.36 and the Nasdaq composite 5.96 weaker at 659.43. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 302.2m shares. The markets opened in a solemn mood, with dealers and investors digesting the implications of Tuesday's 83-point fall in the Dow, which had been triggered by President Bill Clinton's announcement that he will raise taxes levied on both middle-class and higher paid Americans. Although few observers believe that the sell-off presages a sizeable correction in the market, some investment strategists yesterday recommended that aggressive investors should shift some of their assets from stocks to cash for the immediate term. As expected, there was some sporadic buying early on as bargain hunters went in search of stocks which might have been oversold during Tuesday's frenzy. Otherwise, there was little demand in the market, with most investors choosing to sit out the day until the president's State of the Union address to Congress in the evening. Among individual sectors, selected cyclicals staged a modest rally: Alcoa firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 72 3/4 , International Paper added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 65 1/2 and Goodyear Tire rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 67 5/8 . Many leading drug stocks, which were hardest hit on Tuesday, remained under pressure. Bristol-Myers Squibb fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 57 3/8 , Merck slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 37 3/8 in volume of 4.6m shares, Johnson &amp; Johnson gave up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 42 and Pfizer shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 59 1/4 . One of the day's biggest gains was posted by Hewlett-Packard, which jumped Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 in volume of 2m shares after announcing better than expected first-quarter profits of Dollars 1.03 a share. Analysts said they were pleased with the company's control of expenses and its order growth. Hewlett's strong showing gave a modest lift to other computer stocks, Digital Equipment improving Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 , IBM Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 50 1/2 and Motorola Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 54 3/8 . On the Nasdaq market, healthcare and medical stocks continued to suffer, with US Healthcare weakening Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 3/4 and Amgen Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 48 1/4 . Canada TORONTO closed mixed yesterday as North American markets anxiously awaited US President Clinton's address that night on his economic plan. The TSE 300 index gained 7.2 at 3,417.7, but declining issues led rises by 328 to 284 after volume of 35.7m shares. The real estate group gained 1.8 per cent, buoyed by acceptance of Bramalea's restructuring plan by two of the company's creditor groups. Bramalea put on 7 cents at 59 cents. The 'A' shares of Trizec, which owns 67 per cent of Bramalea, rose 19 cents to CDollars 2.40.</p>

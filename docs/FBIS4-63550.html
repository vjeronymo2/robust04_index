			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow, May 24 (TASS) -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the  situation in the Crimea:    "One can speak about President Leonid Kravchuk's desire to  strain the situation to the limit in order to secure  cancellation of a presidential election. But if the limit is  exceeded, Kravchuk would lose one of his main trump cards -- the  image of a person who has been able to keep Ukraine peaceful  following the proclamation of independence.    "In the event of such a conflict, Russia and Ukraine would  risk losing the image of normal members of the internatioal  community. However, neither can one fail to recognise that a war  of nerves, during which one can manage to solve certain private  internal political tasks and show adherence to principles  without much expenditure of efforts or means, is utterly  beneficial to all the sides."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an article on the  political situation in the Crimea under the headline "It Is  Clear in the Crimea so Far, Although the Weather-Gauge Pointer  Approaches the `Storm' Mark."    Covering the latest developments there, the newspaper draws  the following conclusion: "All things considered, it is clear so  far that Kiev has not abandoned attempts to put strongarm  pressure on the 'mutinous' peninsula".    The newspaper believes that an escalation of tension is of  benefit to Ukraine. On the one hand, in the event of a  successful undoing of the `Crimean knot' (a peaceful way is  meant), this would influence Kravchuk's rating at the  forthcoming presidential elections of June 26. On the other  hand, an aggravation of the situation may lead to cancellation  of the elections, which would also suit the president and his  entourage".    PRAVDA on the situation in the Crimea:    "The Crimea is becoming an explosive region nowadays. Only a  return, even if a staggered one, to a single common fatherland  will save the Crimea, Ukraine, Russia, and the entire  Commonwealth of Independent States from confrontations which are  fraught with bloodshed".    ROSSIISKIYE VESTI publishes remarks made by Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin at a meeting with the directors of  industrial, building and transport enterprises and organisations  on May 20.    Explaining the contents of a package of draft normative  documents to resolve economic reform problems, Chernomyrdin said  in particular: "With a view to attracting foreign investments,  the government intends to exempt enterprises with a considerable  amounts of foreign investments from paying a profit tax to the  federal budget for three years. In subsequent two years, the  profit tax is to be exacted at a lowered rate".    "Provision is made for a considerable reduction in the  export  customs tariffs on staple Russian export commodities, such as  oil and oil products, gas, electric power, aluminium, and pulp,  and for the abolition of fixed quotas for and licensing of those  commodities' export," Chernomyrdin said.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA frontpages a report on the repatriation  of two former Soviet servicemen taken prisoner in Afghanistan.    "About 290 Soviet servicemen are now listed as missing in  the  war in Afghanistan. Approximately 20 captives are held by  Afghan rebel groups. Seventeen captives returned home following  the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in February  1989. Prior to the Soviet withdrawal, 111 POWs had been  released, with 53 freed through intelligence channels, and the  rest through diplomatic ones".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes a column of comments by  influential Russian politicians on the arrival of prominent  writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in Russia.    RABOCHAYA TIRIBUNA runs an article written on the strength  of  remarks from academician Andrey Sakharov's speeches, reports and  articles.    TRUD draws readers' attention to the political life of  parties and movements that are in opposition to the government.  The writer of an article, headlined "A Springtime  Exacerbation", analyses Aleksandr Rutskoy's chances to head a  mass, organised party.</p>

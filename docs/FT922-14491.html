			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Observer: Talking point There's nothing like a lender knocking on the door to encourage secretive entrepreneurs to open up a bit. Take Canada's Reichmann brothers whose family firm, Olympia &amp; York, now famously needs help from its creditors. The brothers always used to keep their cards close to their chests despite retaining high-powered public-relations advisers. They include Sir Tim Bell's Lowe Bell Communications in the UK, and Peter Rosenthal of Manhattan's Howard J Rubenstein Associates in North America, with Canada's Paul Costello also active at the Toronto hq. Suddenly, however, there are signs of change. Last Thursday alone O&amp;Y issued three press releases about its financial affairs, and the Reichmanns will bare more secrets to bankers due in Toronto on April 13 to hear O&amp;Y's debt-restructuring proposals. There's even talk of background briefings for the media after the meeting. Reasons for the change may include the arrival at O&amp;Y of ex-president of Manufacturers Hanover Tom Johnson, and former Chrysler vice-chairman Steve Miller now a partner at New York investment bank James D Wolfensohn. Among titbits emerging from the new regime is that these days decisions are taken collectively by Johnson, Miller, and Paul and Albert Reichmann.</p>

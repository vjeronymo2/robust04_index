			<p>BFN     [Text] French industrialists have for a long time been  wanting to renew commercial ties with Iraq. With this in mind,  a CNPF [National Council of French Employers] delegation will go  to Baghdad on 24 or 25 June. Some 20 companies will be  represented, among them Renault, Citroen, Alcatel, Schneider or  EDF [Electricite de France]. Officially, however, Iraq remains  under UN embargo. Olivier Dalage:    [Dalage] Everyone these days thinks that the lifting of  sanctions is only a question of time, only months perhaps.  French companies, like many others, are taking their places at  the starting block to be ready to sign contracts the moment the  UN Security Council lifts the sanctions. The first to do so  were the oil companies, Elf and Total, who were on the scene in  the months after the defeat of Iraq -- discreetly of course, but  with the blessing of the French authorities.    Before the Gulf war Iraq was an important market for France.  Since then, the United States has taken most of the Gulf  markets. Only Iraq remains, if of course the embargo is lifted,  but also if the French companies play their cards right against  the competition. The French note that American managers have  been much in evidence in Baghdad lately. These French-Iraqi  contacts, which started off very discreetly, now take place in  full daylight.</p>

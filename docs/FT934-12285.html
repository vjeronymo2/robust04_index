			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Price rises help reinforce recovery at US Steel THE SUCCESS of US steel makers in pushing through price rises this year, together with stronger demand for their products, helped reinforce the recovery at US Steel, the country's largest producer, in the third quarter. The company reported net income of Dollars 36m, or 44 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 28m, or 48 cents, a year ago. Continuing turnround at US Steel helped parent company USX report after-tax profits for the period of Dollars 66m, compared with a Dollars 4m loss in the same period in 1992. Raw steel production rose by 8 per cent to 2.8m tons. At this level, US Steel said it was operating at 95 per cent of capacity, compared with 88 per cent a year before. With higher prices, sales rose by 12 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 1.4bn. The figures were flattered by the change in the US corporate tax rate, which led to a one-off addition to income of Dollars 20m. This was largely offset by a further Dollars 14m charge for interest expense relating to a litigation judgment made earlier this year and against which the company is appealing. USX also benefited from a 25 per cent rise in net income at Marathon Group, its oil subsidiary, to Dollars 30m or 10 cents a share. The figures were held back by one-off charges, in part to reflect the lower market values of the company's inventory. Lower oil prices and higher margins in refining led to a sharp increase in operating income in the company's downstream operations from Dollars 24m to Dollars 146m. Exploration and production activities recorded an operating loss of Dollars 9m, compared with a profit of Dollars 43m as a result of Dollars 4 fall in oil prices over the year.</p>

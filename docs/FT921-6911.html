			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Brussels aid inquiry over Dutch Volvo deal THE European Commission is today expected to launch a state aid investigation into what it believes are unduly generous terms on which the Dutch government admitted Mitsubishi of Japan as a shareholder into Volvo of the Netherlands, write David Buchan in Brussels and Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. In December, the Dutch government reduced its 70 per cent stake in the local Volvo car-making operation by selling 33 per cent to Mitsubishi and 3 per cent to Volvo of Sweden which previously held 30 per cent, putting all three partners on a par. The government has committed itself to pulling out altogether by 1998 by selling its one-third stake (at 1991 prices) equally to the two car-makers. The government is also understood to be giving soft loans to the two car-makers' joint venture to replace the '400' series of Volvo with a new model. Brussels believes the prospects for the venture are too good to justify any subsidy. Failure of a government to behave like a rational investor has become a key test Brussels applies to judge whether state 'aid' is involved.</p>

Khudayyir observed to  him that Iraq and Jordan are bound by deep ties of brotherhood.  Their cooperation in the transportation industry has come a long  way and will grow deeper still, the prime minister said.  Khudayyir stated his satisfaction with the status of  cooperation in transportation between the two brotherly  countries and Iraq's preparedness to assist Jordan in this and  other areas. Transportation, he noted, is a significant element  that must be factored into national development plans. The  Jordanian minister said he will do all he can to advance  bilateral cooperation in transportation and to prepare for the  post-sanctions era, which he predicted will see relations gain  strength.    The meeting was attended by Iraq's Transport and  Communications Minister Ahmad Murtada Ahmad; Hamid Salih  al-Rawi, head of the Cabinet secretariat; and the Jordanian  ambassador in Baghdad.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto reaffirmed that the  upcoming meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum  (APEC) leaders is important for maintaining and enhancing  regional cooperation.    In a speech delivered after receiving the credentials of New  Zealander Ambassador to Indonesia Timothy Groser here at the  Merdeka Palace Thursday, President Suharto expressed his  appreciation to New Zealand, which has taken an active role in  the region through the ASEAN-New Zealand cooperation forum and  the APEC forum.    The six member countries of ASEAN in cooperation with the  Asia- Pacific countries have made an effort to maintain regional  stability and improve the standard of living, he added.    He also expressed his appreciation to the New Zealand  Government for supporting Indonesia's move to become a  non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.    President Suharto also welcomed the planned visit of New  Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger to Indonesia this month,  saying he hoped the forthcoming visit would be beneficial for  both countries in enhancing bilateral cooperation as well as  giving them an opportunity to discuss a number of international  issues.    In his speech, Suharto said the end of the Cold War and the  East- West dispute has given the world an opportunity to  consolidate economically and politically.    He also stated that relations and cooperation between  nations  could no longer be based on the old pattern of "donor and  recipient."    "Relations between nations should be based on mutual  responsibility, coexistence, mutual benefit, and respect for  national sovereignty," he said.    On the occasion, President Suharto also received credentials  from the Australian ambassador to Indonesia, Richard Demel, and  from the representative of the European Commission to Indonesia,  Klaus Peter Schamallenbach.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report in the "Law" column: "Parties </F> Should Compete With Each Other. The State Will Maintain Only  the Winners" -- last paragraph is Gleb Cherkasov report]    [Text] The draft law on political parties worked out by  the Duma's Social Organizations Committee was yesterday  presented to journalists. The main novelty compared to the  analogous law of the Soviet period, according to the draft  authors, is that political parties have been separated from the  general mass of public organizations. As of now, to register, a  party should have a membership of 5,000 and regional branches  with more than 10 members in more than half the Russian  Federation components. The draft also provides for a  complicated system of party re-registration after each federal  elections. Only those parties that have surmounted the  5-percent barrier will have their registration automatically  extended. The others must re-register for next election  campaigns.    The draft, furthermore, allows registration of regional  parties that are expected to be barred from contesting  federal-wide elections. Which, by the authors' admission,  clearly infringes their interests because the "will for power"  is the main objective of all parties.    In full accord with this thesis, the draft builds a party  state financing system. Funds will be made available only by  election committees and only for purposes of conducting election  battles. Funds will also be provided to the factions of those  parties which have emerged victorious from these battles.    Parties are forbidden to receive donations from foreign  citizens or organizations as well as from the state (with the  above exception).    As has become known, a group of deputies has prepared an  alternative draft law on political parties. According to one of  the "alternative" authors, Vitaliy Savitskiy, who is a member of  the Duma's Public Associations and Religious Organizations  Committee, one of the main distinctions of the second draft is  the predominant role of the state. Under the alternative draft,  the main financing for public organizations is provided by the  state while the volume of monetary infusions depends on how  successful a particular party has been in the elections.  According to Mr. Savitskiy, such a mechanism can contribute to  the gradual evolution of large political organizations.</p>

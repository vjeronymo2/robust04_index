Bentsen has stated that  Moscow's abandonment or slowing of the course of reforms will  inevitably lead to a scaling down of the volume of foreign aid  offered to it.    "Russia's future is in the Russians' hands," he remarked at  a  meeting with journalists in the White House. "The assistance  which we and international financial organizations are giving  will match the pace of the Russian reforms, which means that the  choice is Russia's."</p>

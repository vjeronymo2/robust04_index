			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Jardine Strategic net profits up 7.9% JARDINE Strategic, the chief holding company of Hong Kong trading group Jardine Matheson, yesterday unveiled a 7.9 per cent rise in net profits to USDollars 113m for the first half to June, from Dollars 105m a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. Jardine Strategic said the profits would continue to grow at a similar rate over the rest of the year. First-half turnover advanced 5.3 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn from Dollars 2.28bn. The directors announced that the interim dividend was being increased by 64 per cent to 5.42 US cents a share from 3.3 cents, even though earnings per share fell by 9.5 per cent to 15.23 cents from 16.83 cents. Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, attributed the rise in earnings to the strength of the Asia-Pacific region, where most of the group's activities are concentrated. 'Jardine Strategic's balance sheet is strong and the first-half rise in the market value of its underlying holdings reflects investor appreciation of the growth potential of companies operating in the region,' he said. 'Results for the full year are expected to be in line with the interim figures and the company remains confident of its future prospects,' Mr Keswick concluded. Analysts expressed little surprise at the results, explaining they were largely known once the figures for its affiliated companies' were disclosed earlier this week. Sun Hung Kai, a Hong Kong investment holding and securities trading company, yesterday revealed net profits 120 per cent ahead at HKDollars 201m (USDollars 26.00m) for the six months to June, from HKDollars 91.4m a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. Earnings per share were also 120 per cent higher at 33 cents, compared with 15 cents, and the directors are recommending a doubled interim dividend of 10 cents a share. Turnover rose 53 per cent to HKDollars 464m from HKDollars 304m.</p>

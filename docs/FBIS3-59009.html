			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Council President Pangalos To Tour </F> Scandinavia"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database]    [Text] The president-in-office of the General Affairs  Council and Greek minister for European affairs, Theodoros  Pangalos, announced on Monday [17 January] that he was off this  week on a round of the capitals of three of the four states  currently negotiating their accession to the European Union  (Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden), i.e. the Scandinavian  countries, with a view to opening the final phase of  negotiations. Due to what October's special European Council  agreed in Brussels, these negotiations should be over for 1  March, so that the European Parliament can give its assent under  the current legislature. The outcome of this trip will, to a  great extent, determine the possible convening of extra  ministerial negotiations sessions in February, after the General  Affairs Council of 7/8 February, or even a special summit. As  we already mentioned, Sweden seems close to this result, already  having most of the difficulties behind it (thus, it did not ask  for many exemptions in the field of the Common Agricultural  Policy [CAP] and, as for regional policy, obtained recognition  of "Objective 1" status of an area -- connecting Norwegian and  Finnish regions which have been guaranteed this status -- for  which it appears it had had no intention of fighting). Norway,  however, (came later than the three other countries in the  negotiating process) continues to raise a certain number of  sticky issues (fishing CAP, mainly), even if the energy dossier  now seems to be moving forward smoothly; according to well  informed European sources, the Norwegian Government has  benefited from a kind of right to have a look in at the "joint  position" adopted by the Council over the right of exploiting  resources and is alleged to be prepared to accept it as long as  this question is the subject of an annex in the accession  treaty; this latter requirement is said to still be causing  problems for some member states which intend to be sure that  this clause should only be valid for Norway, thus in the case  where this country actually does accede at the end of  negotiations and, especially, the referendum which (as in the  other candidate states) should give the "green light of the  people." Concerning this, EUROPE recalls that the dates for  these different referenda have still not been set. It does,  however, seem that Sweden would like to organize its own in the  wake of the Finnish referendum (the latest events in Russia  could encourage the population to see accession with a little  more enthusiasm), and, in any case, before the Norwegian  referendum (this country seems the least certain seen from the  population's point of view). The Norwegian authorities  responsible for managing whaling explained to the press their  country's position as regards this; in their opinion, this could  lead to complications in accession negotiations but without it  posing an obstacle to their conclusion. EUROPE will return to  this aspect.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Repsol offering postponed Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's economy minister, said he was not expecting any additional revenue from privatisations before the end of the year, due to market conditions. However, the minister has budgeted for income totalling Pta300bn (Pounds 1.5bn) in 1995 through the disposal of government-held equity. Mr Solbes' disclosures suggests that Repsol, the government-controlled oil, gas and chemicals group, is now likely to postpone for several months an international share offering which it had planned for the last quarter of this year. Repsol, which is 41 per cent government-owned and has a broad international investor base, said it would consult its advisers, Goldman Sachs of the US, and Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. The two banks co-ordinated an offer of 13 per cent of the government's equity in the energy group last year which realised Dollars 866m. Repsol said in May that it hoped to raise between Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars 2.2bn in a further offering before the end of this year.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): PCs move into telephone sales Power-dialling equipment is widely used by telephone salesforces to trawl through a database of numbers, logging successful calls and returning to numbers later if they are engaged. As a cheaper alternative to buying dedicated power-dialling equipment, Exepos Software Solutions, a UK software company, has launched a package called EasySpeak which allows personal computers to be used as power-diallers. The package, which runs on PCs using Windows software, costs Pounds 995. Exepos: UK, tel 0628 533143; fax 0628 533145.</p>

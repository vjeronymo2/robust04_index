			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Bunds rally on speculation of end to 10-day strike THE GERMAN government bond market staged a rally yesterday, buoyed by speculation that talks today would end the 10-day-old strike by public sector workers. The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London exchange, closed at 87.16 from an opening level of 86.89 and close to the day's high of 87.21. Volume was a heavy 71,000 contracts for the second day running. In the cash market, the benchmark 8 per cent Unity Fund 10-year bond issue closed at around 100.08, from an opening of 99.85, for a yield of 7.99 per cent. Employers and union officials are due to hold talks today aimed at ending the dispute over pay. The Bundesbank council also meets today, although analysts are not expecting any change in monetary policy. Yesterday, the Bundesbank kept monetary conditions tight, draining a net DM5bn from the money market in regular repurchase operations. As a result, call money crept up to 9.70 per cent, from 9.65 per cent, and close to the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate - the emergency funding rate for financial institutions. The rise in the bund market helped other European markets to rally. For example, the benchmark French government 8 1/2 per cent OAT maturing 2002 closed the day  1/2 -point higher for a yield of 8.68 per cent, from 8.76 per cent on Tuesday. The French market also rose on speculation that the government would use today's money market tender by the Bank of France to signal a cut in interest rates following Tuesday's  1/2 point cut in UK base lending rates. As a result, the French market out-paced German bonds. The yield spread between the two markets at the 10-year maturity narrowed from 73 basis points at the opening to 69 basis points by the close. The Italian market was also lifted by speculation that interest rates may be lowered in line with the UK. The benchmark 12 per cent Italian government bond maturing January 2002 closed at 98.61, up from 98.42 on Tuesday. Trading volume in the cash market was L14,200bn, the highest recorded. THE UK government bond market was led higher by the strength of continental European markets yesterday, with trading volume light in the absence of new domestic factors. The long-dated cash benchmark, the 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011, closed up  5/16 of a point on the day at 99 23/32 for a yield of 9.02 per cent. On Liffe, the June gilts futures contract finished at 98.20, from an opening level of 98.13. Trading volume was light at 29,000 contracts. US TREASURY prices firmed across the length of the yield curve following the successful completion of the second stage of the Treasury's Dollars 36bn refunding auctions yesterday afternoon. In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up  15/32 at 100 7/16 , yielding 7.96 per cent. Gains were less pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, where the two-year note was  1/32 higher to yield 5.22 per cent. The Federal Reserve, as the market had expected, refrained from operating in the open market. Fed funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, were changing hands at 3 per cent during the Fed's usual intervention period. Short-covering contributed to the higher prices after the afternoon's sale of Dollars 11bn of 10-year notes, which had a better-than-expected average yield of 7.53 per cent. JAPANESE government bond prices firmed overnight in Tokyo, having been closed for public holidays on Monday and Tuesday and suffering a run of negative sentiment last week. The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a yield of 5.635 per cent, a touch higher than the 5.675 per cent seen on Friday. Dealers said the authorities indicated that an auction of 10-year bonds scheduled for today would carry a higher coupon than last month's sale of 5.5 per cent paper. Analysts are now expecting a Y800bn auction of 5.7 per cent paper, although a smaller Y600bn issue of 5.6 per cent stock is still possible.</p>

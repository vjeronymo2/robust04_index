			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Ramos and Santiago level in poll battle THE BATTLE of nerves among leading candidates in last Monday's Philippine general election heightened yesterday as counting of votes proceeded at a snail's pace. The camp of Mr Fidel Ramos, the administration-backed candidate for president, yesterday claimed it would fortify its slim lead over Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago once the returns from nine of the country's 13 regions were tallied. Mr Ramos' Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats party said Mrs Santiago's lead in metropolitan Manila and other urban centres could easily be offset by Mr Ramos' winning margins in the nine regions. Mrs Santiago, however, said votes from the countryside 'will further widen' her lead in the Media-Citizens Quick Count, an independent tabulation sanctioned by the watchdog Commission on Elections. (Comelec). Other estimates put Mr Ramos slightly ahead. The camp of Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, third in the count, yesterday also expressed confidence of emerging as winner. Vice President Salvador Laurel, trailing in the seven-member field, conceded defeat. Mr Ramon Mitra, Speaker of Congress, also acknowledged he had no real chance of success.</p>

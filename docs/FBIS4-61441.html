			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk received  Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Union  Commission and commissar for external economic affairs of the  European Commissions, who is on a visit to our country at the  invitation of the foreign affairs minister to familiarize  himself with the situation in Ukraine and to find out about the  course of reforms. A conversation took place in the course of  which a wide variety of issues relating to cooperation between  Ukraine and the EEC was raised. Ukraine attaches significant  importance to the development of cooperation with the European  Union, said President Kravchuk. We seek to have good relations  with every country on the continent.    I am happy that work on preparation for the signing of an  agreement between Ukraine and the EEC on partnership and  cooperation is over. This cooperation will be on the basis of  temporary accords.    President Kravchuk expressed the wish that the agreement  should be signed as early as the beginning of June. This, he  said, is necessitated by our economic and political problems.</p>

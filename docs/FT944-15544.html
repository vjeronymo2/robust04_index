			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / People: O'Shea moves up at Halma group Stephen O'Shea has been appointed to the new post of deputy chief executive at Halma Group, the fast-growing safety and environmental technology concern. The promotion of O'Shea, 48, below, is designed to give more 'central horsepower' according to David Barber, who remains chairman and chief executive. Over the past two years, the number of companies within Halma has grown from 30 to about 45. The appointment suggests the beginnings of a succession policy. Barber, 62, chairman since 1973, said no further changes are planned in the short-term but added that O'Shea, in his new position, was clearly 'the favourite candidate' to replace him. Barber has turned Halma into one of the UK's most successful specialist engineering companies, with subsidiaries in environmental control, fire detection, gas detection, safety and security. In June, it announced a 20 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 25.1m. O'Shea was previously Halma's divisional chief executive responsible for both the fire detection and gas detection divisions; he will have overall responsibility for these businesses and the security division. He is replaced by Neil Quinn and Ralph Jessop at fire detection and gas detection respectively.</p>

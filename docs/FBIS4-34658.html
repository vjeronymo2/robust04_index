			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "An Irrational Embargo"] </F>   [Text] Irrespective of the angle from which one looks at  the situation in Cuba, Fidel Castro's regime is a dictatorship.  Even so, it is difficult to disagree with the Cuban president  when he complains, as he did at the Ibero-American Summit held  recently in Cartagena (Colombia), about his counterparts --with  the exception of Itamar Franco -- remaining silent about the  blockade the United States has imposed on the island for 32  years.    There are at least two strong reasons to substantiate the  claim that the embargo entails an unacceptable act of violence.  The first is humanitarian. It has become crystal clear during  the past 32 years that it is the Cuban people, not their  leaders, who have suffered the blockade's effects.    The embargo has not provoked the regime's downfall but  rather  a steady decline in the people's standard of living in general,  especially now that Cuba can no longer count on the resources it  used to receive from the now-defunct Soviet Union.    The second reason has to do with being consistent. There is  no way of justifying the U.S. Government's decision to maintain  its embargo against the Cuban dictatorship after having granted  preferential trading status to another even more brutal  dictatorship, that of China.    It should be admitted that a dictatorship is a dictatorship  under any circumstance, or that a dictatorship can be more  readily accepted when it offers a more profitable business.  There is no denying that this factor introduces a great deal of  cynicism in relations among countries and makes the embargo of  Cuba all the more unacceptable.    It is appropriate to note another inconsistency here: The  Latin American political map was plagued by military  dictatorships during the 70's and part of the 80's. This fact  did not cause the United States to impose an embargo on any of  those regimes that were unwilling to cooperate with it. Again,  a dictatorship -- whether from the right or the left -- should  be considered a dictatorship. Otherwise, the "democratic" logic  behind the embargo would be untenable.    The truth is that the blockade of Cuba is a remnant of the  Cold War. The United States appears to remain watchful despite  the failure of communism, despite the theory that socialist  regimes are tolerated in other parts of the world, although not  in what used to be called its "back yard."    Obviously the fact of living under a dictatorship has  overshadowed Cuba's merit of having some good social  accomplishments compared to other countries in the region,  Brazil included. One cannot absolve, however, totalitarian  regimes only because one of them may have obtained some rather  positive statistics.    It will not be by strangling Cuba through the embargo that  we  will make it a democratic country. The correct reasoning is  exactly the opposite: It is by reincorporating Cuba into the  inter-American system, instead of leaving it isolated, that we  would make it more democratic. By coexisting with countries  that today are mostly democratic, Cuba would be decisively  influenced by the example of these countries.</p>

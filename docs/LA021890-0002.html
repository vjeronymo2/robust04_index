			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTIONS OF LAST RESORT  </P> <P> Those who so righteously protest against abortion ought to see (Dr. James T.)  McMahon as having a just cause -- to save lives, not take them. Surely these  women are victims, and it does no good to try and save the unborn until the  living are saved first.  </P> <P> If third-trimester abortions nauseate us (as they should) we should be even  more shocked by the reasons they occur.  </P> <P> With the prices McMahon charges, he's certainly no saint, but at least he  offers hope to the desperate. His assertion that the soul of a person enters  the body when the fetus is accepted by the mother is very telling. Women who go  to him don't want the babies and will do anything to get rid of them. We all  know that abortions will take place with or without a doctor, but with a  doctor, at least one person survives.  </P> <P> Saving human life must start with saving the women who will do what sickens us.  Until these women are given souls themselves by finding acceptance, lives will  continue to be lost, and abortions will continue to cycle generation after  generation.  </P> <P> PATRICIA BRUGMAN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

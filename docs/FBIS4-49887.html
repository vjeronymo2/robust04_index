			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 11 (XINHUA) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) announced today that it will send a mission  to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Saturday  [14 May] to continue its inspection of the DPRK's nuclear  facilities.    Tests will be conducted at a reprocessing plant if the DPRK  government gives a positive reply or does not raise any  objection to the move before the weekend, IAEA Spokesman David  Kyd said.    IAEA Director General Hans Blix said in a message sent to  DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam on Tuesday that it was  crucial for international experts to inspect spent uranium fuel  rods at the nuclear reactor when the plant is refueled.    Blix also requested the DPRK to send a team of experts to  Vienna to discuss measures and a timetable for inspections of  the reactor.    Last week, an IAEA spokesman said last week that the agency  will not send inspectors to the DPRK until the government gives  the green light to an overall inspection of its nuclear  facilities.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson/Costain Poor old Costain seems unable to get anything right. Having agreed to sell its Australian coal to Hanson, it then accepted a better offer from Altus. When Hanson sued, Costain confidently decided to fight. When Costain lost, it appealed. Now it has backed down and settled on the original terms with Hanson. Shareholders may receive slightly more in sterling since the pound has fallen and the net worth of the assets has gone up. But that hardly makes up for such a public display of cack-handed management. Hanson, by contrast, must be relieved to have won something after a rather lean spell. The deal usefully expands Peabody's low-sulphur coal interests outside the US. But whatever the wrangles with Costain, buying Australian coal looks easy compared to getting involved with British Coal. Any further expansion of Peabody is unlikely to involve the UK. Costain's bankers will be pleased to see the money safely in. But given that US legal action was always going to be a drawn out affair, Costain should have made sure it could stay the course before it went to court.</p>

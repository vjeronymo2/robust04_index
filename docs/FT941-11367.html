			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / News Corp up 27% mid-way: BSkyB and Ansett Airlines offset pain of newspaper price war in the UK News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media, film and publishing group, posted a 27.5 per cent increase in profits for the six months to December, with the help of higher earnings from Ansett Airlines and the BSkyB satellite broadcaster. News Corp said that it made a profit of ADollars 624.9m (Pounds 300m) after tax but before abnormal items, up from ADollars 490.1m. First-half sales were ADollars 5.82bn, against ADollars 5.33bn, and earnings per share (before abnormals) increased by 13 per cent to 34 cents. The results were ahead of expectations and the shares jumped 52 cents to ADollars 10.56. Operating profits were slightly lower at ADollars 861.1m after the newspaper division declined to ADollars 266.3m from ADollars 349.1m, and the magazines and insets business fell to ADollars 169.5m from ADollars 208.2m. However, there was a strong performance from the film division, including Twentieth Century Fox. Operating profits more than trebled to ADollars 101.1m, helped by the recent box-office hit Mrs Doubtfire. The book publishing division posted profits of ADollars 126.2m, against ADollars 113.6m, helped by 'brisk' sales of Margaret Thatcher's memoirs. Associated companies - Ansett, which News owns jointly with TNT, and BSkyB, of which News holds 50 per cent - doubled their contributions to ADollars 190.1m. Net interest charges fell to ADollars 343.9m (ADollars 387.4m). News also benefited from an abnormal gain of ADollars 144m, part of it from the sale of a 34.9 per cent interest in The South China Morning Post. This left profits after tax and abnormals at ADollars 768.9m, against ADollars 452.8m. Lex, Page 18</p>

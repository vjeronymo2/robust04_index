			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions IN FEBRUARY last year, Peter Nicholson, a non-executive director of Crest Nicholson, the housebuilder, bought 100,000 shares at 30p. Since then the shares have proved volatile, but fellow non-executive director Geoffrey Fox reduced his holding recently by 100,000 shares, selling at a price of 51p. Crest Nicholson is forecast to return to profit in the year to end-October 1993; shares have outperformed the market by more than 60 per cent over the past three months. Keith Carnelley, chairman and chief executive of Polar, the electronic components group, has sold 450,000 shares at 126p. Michael George, his managing director, sold 50,000 shares at the same price. A third director then sold 70,000.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      No of Company                 Sector     Shares   Value  directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ABI Leisure             Motr       36,000      30      4 AIM Group               EngA        7,678      12      1 Allied Leisure (NP)     H&amp;L     4,131,999      83      5 Allied Textiles         Text       37,000     174      1* Benson Group            EngG       96,000      24      1 Brandon Hire            C&amp;C       350,000      77      1 Cater Allen             OthF       42,870     195      3* Cosalt                  Misc       17,500      30      1* Courts Furnishers       Stor        3,470      14      1 Crest Nicholson         C&amp;C       100,000      51      1 Ivory &amp; Sime            OthF       25,000      33      1 Malaya Group            Motr       90,000      24      2 Polar Electronics       Elns      517,000     651      3 Royal Bank of Scot      Bank      187,500     440      1* Securiguard Group       BuSe      250,000     500      1 Tepnel Diagnostics      Hlth       27,000      59      1 Vaux Group              Brew       12,000      27      1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Berisford               FdMa        8,000      10      1 Citysite Estates        Prop       comb**      94      2 Essex Furniture         Stor       10,000      11      2 Mercury Asset Man       OthF       10,000      43      1 Molyneux                Prop      125,000      36      1 Pegasus                 Elns      100,000     157      1 RIT Capital Partnrs     InTr      135,000     157      1 Towles                  n/a        14,030      29      1 West Trust              Text    1,550,000      63      2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Welfare sent out to work: How the UK chancellor might use the Budget to encourage employment The lowest inflation in a generation, rising exports and productivity, falling public borrowing - Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, must be feeling pleased at the UK economy's recent performance as he prepares his second Budget speech. Despite all the good news, however, there is a group that is being left behind: a hardcore of long-term unemployed individuals and families without earners. Falls in headline unemployment have not been accompanied by similar falls in either long-term unemployment or the number of families dependent on welfare. 'Unemployment,' said Mr Clarke earlier this year, 'must be the main pre-occupation of economic policymakers in the 1990s. We must look more closely at how those on the fringes of mainstream society can be brought back in . . . ensuring that they do not get trapped in a web of dependency and exclusion.' With a tenth of the population dependent on state benefits, trade unions, employers and pressure groups are arguing that Mr Clarke's priority of last year - improving public finances - would best be served this year if he introduced Budget reforms to bring greater numbers into work. As far as these groups are concerned, the challenge is clear. 'Stable economic conditions may not be sufficient in themselves to tackle the structural problem of long-term unemployment,' says Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry. He argues that the government should take the lead in creating more jobs for more families. In 1993, nearly 15 per cent of non-pensioner households in the UK were without a working member, compared with less than 5 per cent in the 1970s. Officially, unemployment in the UK has fallen by 455,100 since its peak of nearly 3m at the end of 1992. But the number of people unemployed for over a year remains as high as it was two years ago, at a little under 1m, while the number out of work for over two years has risen sharply. In fact these figures understate the problem because many of the long-term unemployed have been so discouraged , that they have left the workforce altogether. Researchers have found the main factor determining whether a man will be unemployed is not his education or previous job but whether he was unemployed the previous year. 'When someone has been out of work for over a year, the chances of him or her finding work within three months are currently less than 5 per cent,' says Dr Madsen Pirie of the free-market Adam Smith Institute in London. There are two main reasons why the long-term unemployed find it difficult to get work. Being 'out of the loop', they are less likely to hear about openings, and lack of recent experience makes them unattractive to employers. The second is being in the benefit system. The structure of benefits can make it unattractive for a household member to be the only one to find a job, as benefits for the whole family will be withdrawn. 'Jobless men are generally accompanied by jobless women,' says Dr Jonathan Wadsworth, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London. He says only 20 per cent of unemployed men live with a working partner, against 60 per cent of employed men. Social security provision, by its nature, always implies a disincentive to work. When people are poor and unemployed, they qualify for support. The fact that benefits are withdrawn when they start earning means their new earnings are effectively taxed at a much higher rate than the rest of the population. This problem has been exacerbated, in recent years, by changes in the kind of jobs available. Only 20 per cent of jobs filled by the unemployed are full-time, permanent positions. Half are part-time and many are low-paid. This means they have less chance of earning enough to take them beyond the high marginal tax rates on the first pounds earned. In the 1980s, reducing the relative value of benefits was expected to lessen the disincentive to work. But benefit cuts did little to stem the rise in the number of individuals and families dependent on benefits. US-style 'workfare' proposals raise the stakes further, by forcing people to 'work off' their benefits after a set period. But these are highly controversial, and would imply large and costly public jobs programmes which a Conservative government might object to. Many in both the Conservative and Labour parties believe that a better, and cheaper, approach to the problem is to give private employers more of an incentive to offer jobs to the long-term unemployed, and to update the benefits system so that they have more incentive to take work. Dr Pirie argues that the government should give all people out of work for over a year a 'green card' entitling them to two years' exemption from national insurance and income tax payments. In addition, cardholders' benefits would be phased out over the first two years of employment, rather than withdrawn immediately. Such a scheme would create jobs as well as encourage employers to select the long-term unemployed over others, says Dr Pirie. 'There are whole categories of work which are uneconomic at present, but which would become worthwhile if labour costs were significantly lowered.' The cost in lost tax and NI contributions and continued benefits would be considerable. But so, too, are the costs of supporting the more or less permanently unemployed, says Dr Pirie. Budgetary worries are still likely to deter Mr Clarke from entirely exempting the long-term unemployed from NI and income tax. But he is said to be considering more modest tax changes along these lines. There might be an NI 'holiday' for the long-term jobless, and a lowering of the tax burden for all of the low-paid, through either an increased personal tax allowance or a wider lowest income tax band. Tax measures would encourage employers to take on workers, but, critics argue, Mr Clarke needs to tackle the benefits system as well, if he wishes to reduce disincentives on the employee side. 'It is simply wrong to say that a lower-rate band of income tax, or lower NI contributions, help people escape very high marginal withdrawal rates at the lower end of the income distribution,' argues Mr Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. 'They are primarily a feature of the benefit system, not the tax system.' Some people, especially those without children, can still earn enough to move out of means-tested benefits, believes Mr Johnson. 'But lone parents and many couples with children can be trapped on benefit, because of the way their limited job opportunities interact with the benefit system.' Family credit - introduced by the government in 1988 - was one response to the expenses of raising a family that made it hard to accept low-paid jobs without being made worse off. Another was the additional childcare credit introduced in last year's budget. Both effectively restore lost benefits once people are working 16 hours a week, although after that the credit is withdrawn at a 70 per cent marginal rate. At least for the 60 per cent of eligible families who receive it, family credit has taken the welfare system a step towards fitting the new world of work to the new world of non-work. But more credits - to take account of housing expenses, perhaps, or give a specific incentive for a second member of the family to work - would further smooth the transition from welfare to work. Improving the take-up of family credit would smooth it further. If this is the stuff of Mr Clarke's budget, he will not be able to declare an end to long-term unemployment. Every country in Europe is facing high structural unemployment. Budget changes alone will not eliminate the problem. His challenge next week will be to find ways to stop the tax and benefit system from making it worse.</p>

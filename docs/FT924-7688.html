			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / The Week Ahead: Results Due BRITISH Airways is expected to report a 40-45 per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits on Tuesday confirming its position as one of the world's most profitable airlines. However, the City expects the figures to show a small decline in the company's second quarter profits reflecting the increasingly difficult outlook in the airline industry. BA's first half pre-tax profits are expected to be in a range of Pounds 250m-Pounds 260m compared with Pounds 185m in the first half of the last financial year. But profits in the second quarter are expected to total around Pounds 160m-Pounds 170m compared with second quarter profits of Pounds 176m the previous year. British Steel, struggling in face of the depressed worldwide steel market and a floods of cheap metal entering the EC particularly from Eastern Europe, is expected to report on Monday a significant pre-tax loss this week. Analysts put it at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m in the half year to September, compared with a a Pounds 13m profit last year. The big question is whether the steel group will maintain or cut its interim dividend, held at 3p last time. There is no financial reason to maintain the pay-out, but British Steel may want to keep its options open, and wait to play with the final dividend. The market is expecting on Monday another solid year to September from BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, but the slow-down in earnings growth is likely to continue. Analysts expect pre-tax profit of Pounds 345m (Pounds 310m) and earnings per share of about 45p (40.98p). BOC has forecast a 22p (20.4p) dividend. Whitbread is expected to report flat first half profits of about Pounds 142m when it opens the brewers' reporting season on Wednesday. The company's retail operations have continued to suffer from tough trading conditions, particularly in south-east England. The first half results of electricity company have only limited value as they take in the spring and summer months when activity is low. However this year's crop, which start on Tuesday, are bound to attract attention because of the coal mine closures programme. National Power starts off the month-long electricity results season with analysts expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 230m, against last year's Pounds 202m. PowerGen reports on Wednesday with expectations at about Pounds 100m (Pounds 97m). Dividend rises of about 10 per cent are likely. Cable and Wireless, the international telecommunications group, is expected to report flat pre-tax profits of around Pounds 355m compared to Pounds 351m for the half year to the end of September 30 when it announces its results on Thursday. Strong performances from HongKong Telecom and Mercury Communications in the UK have been offset by the weakness of the US dollar. Storehouse, the high street retailer, is expected to report a break-even interim result on Thursday. Analysts are already looking forward to a better second half pre-tax profits of around Pounds 30m. Analysts will be keen to hear if Storehouse is making any progress on selling the loss-making US operations of Habitat, having sold the rest of the business last month.</p>

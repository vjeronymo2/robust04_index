			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Regent Inns seeks full listing to raise funds REGENT INNS, the pubs chain, is to seek a full listing to raise new funds, after yesterday reporting a sharp rise in interim profits. Regent, an ex-Business Expansion Scheme company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 603,500 for the six months to January 2, against Pounds 371,390, after a Pounds 9,400 profit (Pounds 30,865 loss) on disposal of fixed assets. Turnover was Pounds 6.47m (Pounds 6.17m). Earnings per share were 5p (2.5p) and a maiden interim dividend of 2.25p was declared. A share issue accompanying the full listing, to be sought at the end of April, is intended to raise about Pounds 5m. Gearing at last June's year-end was 56 per cent. Mr Clive Watson, finance director, said the flotation would enable the group to expand its pubs business. 'It will also provide shareholders with a better market for their shares and provide greater liquidity,' he said. Regent Inns operates 36 pubs, hotels and restaurants, mainly in London and the home counties. Its largest new venture in the period was Dingwall's Building at Camden Lock, north London.</p>

Talks between the  government, the ANC, and the Freedom Alliance reached a deadlock  in Pretoria last night.    ANC Chairman Thabo Mbeki said that he would take right-wing  proposals for constitutional amendments to the 26-member  National Working Committee today.    Meanwhile ANC media spokesman Carl Niehaus has said that the  organization does not fear outright civil war. He was  commenting on remarks by Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front]  co-leader General Constand Viljoen in an SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] television interview last night. Gen.  Viljoen said that an uprising could be unavoidable if a  volkstaat [homeland] was not proclaimed before the election.</p>

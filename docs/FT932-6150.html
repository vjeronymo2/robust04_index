			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Fall in Euromarks DEALERS in German interest rate markets yesterday took the view that the Bundesbank would keep monetary policy tight for some time, following a succession of hawkish comments from the central bank's council members, writes James Blitz. A common theme of trading in all money markets in the last five days has been the growing belief that Germany will put its interest rate cutting on hold because of fears that the D-Mark could weaken. That caution on policy was underlined very strongly yesterday as three more council members voiced fears about renewed growth in German monetary supply. The 3 regional central bank presidents, all speaking separately, expressed concern about the deteriorating fiscal health of the state and federal governments because of the economic slowdown. 'What this means is that the external pressure to lower interest rates has gone and the Bundesbank is concerning itself with domestic issues,' said one London-based money market dealer. The comments triggered a strong fall in Euromark futures yesterday in remarkably heavy trading. The September contract was at one stage 25 basis points lower from its opening level, at 93.21. It later recovered to close at 93.23 with nearly 80,000 lots traded on the day. At this level, the market is pricing 3-month D-Mark interest rates at 6.79 per cent, 70 basis points below yesterday's cash level. French franc futures were also lower in the wake of the German move, although by a smaller margin. The September contract dropped 8 basis points to close at 93.06. In sterling markets, dealers remained uncertain whether Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment as UK chancellor would increase the prospects of another cut in UK base rates this year. The September short sterling contract was more-or less unchanged yesterday at 94.14, while the June contract was 2 basis points higher at 94.06. According to one sterling dealer, the market is unsure what Mr Clarke stands for. 'He has never worked in the Treasury before,' he said. Three-month sterling cash closed yesterday  1/16 per cent softer at around 5 7/8 per cent. There was a Pounds 2bn shortage, which was easily despatched with no late assistance.</p>

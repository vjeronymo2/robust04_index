The newspaper pointed this out in particular  following the recent visit to Russia by Somsavat Lengsavat, LPDR  foreign affairs minister.    The newspaper said that the relations between Russia and  Laos  at the governmental level was suspended for some time. But now  these relations have been restored. It noted: Russian Foreign  Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Lao Foreign Affaires  Minister Somsavat Lengsat held talks in Moscow in early March.  As a result of the talks, in addition to revitalizing past  relations, the two sides also signed a treaty on fundamental  relations and an agreement on cultural, scientific, and  technical cooperation between the two countries. The paper went  on to say that implementing an open-door policy and mechanisms  of the market economy, Laos achieved peace and development.  This policy has brought self-sufficiency in food supply and  monetary stability to Laos and has reduced its inflation rate to  only between 5 and 10 percent. Comprehensive changes in the  social sector have also contributed to bolstering Laos' economic  relations with other countries. Laos is currently utilizing  foreign investment to build the infrastructure and to expand  communications routes to the neighboring countries, namely  Vietnam and Thailand.</p>

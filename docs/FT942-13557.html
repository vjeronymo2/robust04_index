			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Berlusconi likely to need watchdog Italy may need an impartial watchdog to guard against conflicts between the political and business interests of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate who should this week be chosen as the country's prime minister. That was the strong message given to Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Italian president, at the weekend by allies and opponents of Mr Berlusconi. It was echoed by the media magnate himself, who heads the right-wing Freedom Alliance which won last month's election. After meeting Mr Scalfaro on Saturday, Mr Berlusconi said 'at the moment of receiving the invitation (to be prime minister) or shortly afterwards' he would have ready a solution to the possible conflicts of interest. Mr Berlusconi's new party, Forza Italia, was established on the back of its leader's publicity and television interests and spearheaded the election victory. Mr Scalfaro is likely to name Mr Berlusconi to form a new government later this week, following today's commemoration of the 49th anniversary of Italian liberation from fascist rule. The event is seen by some left-wingers as an opportunity to demonstrate against the new government. Mr Berlusconi himself has proposed a US-style 'blind trust' as one way of distancing himself from his businesses, which range from television to retailing. Last week he described the first step in this process - the planned sale by his Fininvest business empire of a majority of its publishing interests - as a 'considerable sacrifice'. But allies and opponents do not believe this will be enough. One suggestion is a statutory 'watchdog' to oversee the new government.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> VOTING DAY CHANGE SOUGHT  </P> <P> Acting under rules laid down in state law, the Beverly Hills City Council set  April 10, the first day of the Jewish Passover holiday, as Election Day to fill  two City Council seats.  </P> <P> Responding to concerns expressed by some residents, City Clerk Jean Ushijima  said the date could be changed if state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles)  persuades the state Legislature to waive the requirement to hold the election  on the second Tuesday in April.  </P> <P> Mayor Max Salter and City Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum, who was mayor in  1988-89, said they would run for reelection. Both were elected for the first  time in 1986.  </P> <P> It will cost $30,000 to $35,000 to hold the election, said Fred Cunningham, a  city spokesman. Voter turnout in recent elections has ranged from 26.4% in 1978  to 46.9% in 1982, when a rent control initiative was on the ballot.  </P> <P> In the latest election, held in 1988, 36.5% of the electorate of about 20,000  voted, at a cost of about $4 each. A smaller turnout is expected this year.  </P></p>

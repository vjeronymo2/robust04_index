Laboratory certification. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Today EPA is proposing that only certified laboratories be allowed to analyze samples for compliance with the proposed MCL for sulfate. EPA recognizes that the effectiveness of today's proposed regulations depends on the ability of laboratories to reliably analyze contaminants at low levels. EPA has a drinking water laboratory certification program that States must adopt as a part of primacy. (40 CFR 142.10(b)) EPA's Manual for the Certification of Laboratories Analyzing Drinking Water, EPA/570/9-90/008, April, 1990, specifies minimum criteria which States must use to implement their drinking water laboratory certification program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance evaluation (PE) samples are an important tool in EPA's laboratory certification program. The samples are provided by EPA or the States to laboratories seeking certification. To obtain and maintain certification a laboratory must use an approved method, and at least once a year successfully analyze an appropriate PE sample. Successful analysis requires that a laboratory report a concentration of sulfate in the PE-sample that is within the acceptance limits. Specification of these proposed limits, which are listed in drinking water regulations at &sect;141.23(k), is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e. Setting PE sample acceptance limits for sulfate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Acceptable performance has historically been set by EPA using two different approaches: (1) Regressions from performance of preselected laboratories (using 95 percent confidence limits), or (2) specified accuracy requirements. Acceptance limits based on specified accuracy requirements are developed from existing PE study data. When there are insufficient PE data to determine expected laboratory performance, EPA determines acceptance limits from individual study statistics based upon 95 percent confidence limits. After sufficient performance data are generated from PE studies, EPA will develop fixed acceptance limits using a ``plus or minus of the true value approach.'' The true value approach requires each laboratory to demonstrate its ability to perform within pre-defined limits. Laboratory performance is evaluated using a constant yardstick independent of performance achieved by other laboratories participating in the same study. A fixed criterion based on a percent error around the ``true'' value reflects the experience obtained from numerous laboratories and includes relationships of the accuracy and precision of the measurement to the concentration of the analyte. It also assumes little or no bias in the analytical methods that may result in average reporting values different from the reference ``true'' value. This concept assures that reported results can be related to the percentage variance from the PQL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance data are available for sulfate at concentrations proposed for regulation. The data are sufficient to set fixed acceptance limits of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  15% for sulfate PE samples. The acceptance limits are estimated using the approach described in 54 FR 22132. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Establishment of a NPDWR <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Today's Proposed MCL. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Today EPA is proposing an MCL for sulfate of 500 mg/L, which is equal to the proposed MCLG. EPA believes that costs for large systems are reasonable and affordable, and that it is technologically feasible for PWSs to achieve this level for sulfate. EPA also believes that the flexibility afforded by Option 1 allows small systems to comply with the MCL in a way that is reasonable and affordable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examination of the BATs identified above (RO, IE, and ED) indicates that each can reduce the levels of sulfate from the maximum expected occurrence levels to levels below the proposed MCLG of 500 mg/L (minimum removal efficiencies of 86%, 75%, and 80%, respectively). The maximum reported occurrence level for sulfate in a national study (RWS) is 1,000 mg/L, although individual State data have shown levels twice as high. Each of these technologies is currently available, has been installed in PWSs, is compatible with other water treatment processes, and can remove sulfate from the maximum occurrence level to below the proposed MCLG. EPA is proposing an MCL for sulfate based upon an analysis of several factors, including: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The effectiveness of BAT in reducing sulfate levels from influent concentrations to the MCLG. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The feasibility (including costs) of applying BAT. EPA considered the availability of the technology and the costs of installation and operation for large systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The performance of available analytical methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Lead option for implementing the MCL requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As described in the Regulatory Background section, EPA determined that sulfate is found primarily in small PWSs in the western part of the U.S., and that compliance with the sulfate MCL would place a significant burden on these systems. EPA decided that a requirement for PWSs to comply with the sulfate MCL by treating all of their source water might be excessive since high sulfate levels affect only persons who are not acclimated to the water. Therefore, the Agency decided in 1992 to defer the regulation for sulfate in order to consider ways of allowing PWSs to comply with the MCL that would not require central treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To develop alternative options for complying with the MCL, EPA held a meeting with interested States and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA). In November 1992, officials from Texas, South Dakota, Colorado, and New Mexico, ASDWA staff, EPA Regional staff, and EPA Headquarters staff met to explore regulatory options for sulfate. They discussed the regulatory process, a toxicological profile of sulfate, and State perspectives on sulfate regulation, health effects and implementation options. Neither the issue of whether or not to regulate sulfate nor the MCL/MCLG levels were topics of discussion. The participants felt that the sulfate regulation should give the States flexibility. After the discussions at this meeting, most of the States present supported the conclusion that PWSs should be allowed to protect their customers from the risk of sulfate levels exceeding the MCL either by centralized treatment or through public education/notification and provision of Alternative Water. The outline of a regulatory option that included all of these elements was formulated. Each of the components was directed at a certain population and the majority agreed that those components, together, would be adequately protective. The option developed at that meeting is essentially Option 1, being proposed today. In the past, EPA has not generally set restrictions or conditions on the means of compliance with the MCL. Traditionally, EPA simply identifies the central treatment technologies that are considered BAT and then sets the MCL based on the capabilities of those technologies to remove the contaminant. PWSs are not required to use the identified BATs but must achieve compliance with the MCL. EPA regulations prohibit PWSs from using bottled water or POU devices to achieve compliance with the MCL. In addition, the regulations prohibit PWSs from using POE devices to achieve compliance with the MCL unless the PWS meets certain conditions for ensuring effective protection of all consumers. See 40 CFR 141.100 and 141.101. In Option 1, EPA proposes to override the general prohibition on the use of bottled water and POU/POE devices and to allow States to authorize PWSs to use these methods to achieve compliance with the MCL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Method of compliance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The State would have the authority under Option 1 to allow PWSs to achieve compliance with the sulfate MCL by one of two methods. The PWS could comply either by using conventional central treatment or by providing Alternative Water. With the State's authorization, PWSs would have the choice of supplying bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs, POU or POE devices to target populations. Under Option 1, PWSs that provide Alternative Water would also need to meet certain public education/notification requirements. Transient systems would also have to provide Alternative Water, but their public notification requirement would be posting of signs, unless POE/POU devices brought all taps into compliance. This approach directly focuses protection on the sensitive populations: Infants, travelers and new residents. Under Option 1, any program developed by a PWS would need to contain the following provisions or others which it can demonstrate are at least as stringent and protective: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Renuka] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- A senior  Malaysian minister is hopeful the Malaysia-initiated East Asia  Economic Caucus (EAEC), initiated by Malaysia and which is  currently on a membership drive, will take off before the end of  next year.    Rafidah Aziz, who is trade and industry minister, said the  grouping would comprise the ASEAN members in the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation, and Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the new  market economies in Indochina.    She hoped that the grouping would be launched before the  18th  PECC [Pacific Economic Cooperation Council] general meeting  which will be held in 18 months' time.    The decision to form this loose informal grouping was born  out of the necessity to maximise the potential in the East Asian  region and opposing perceptions to the EAEC are coloured by  non-economic factors, she said here.    The ASEAN Secretriat is in the midst of talks with the  potential launch members towards determining the objectives of  the grouping.    The reasons behind the formation of the EAEC are basic and  sane, she reiterated while assuaging fears that the grouping  would evolve into a trade bloc.    Speaking from the perspective of East Asia and open  regionalism, she pointed out the trade and investment  inter-dependence in East Asia was equally significant when  compared with the region's trade with the rest of the world.    We are all export-led economies, she said to underscore the  fact that the proposed grouping would remain a loose  consultative forum and consistent with the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    On APEC, she said that group had strayed from its original  objective into a new format, heightened by the informal leaders  summit in Seattle.</p>

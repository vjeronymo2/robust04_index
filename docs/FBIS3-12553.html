'I have not seen it. You have to be well aware of what's  going on. You have to look at the design, operation, people  involved and maintenance of the reactor'. 'In India. there is a  well knit group with a lot of morale, which has worked together  for long, has good experience an advantage over other  countries', he said.    'In developing countries, the equipment may not be the  latest  but if you can adapt the machine to the given conditions, it is  good enough. It is very easy to take a camera into people's  homes and point out the dirt', he added.    Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, Dr R Chidambaram  described the American television news programme as malicious,  mischievous and a deliberate mis-representation of facts'.    The report purports to expose ill-effects of radiation due  to  our reactors by focusing on some village ten miles away from the  power plant. It seems a deliberate campaign to misrepresent our  nuclear programme " he said.    Th operational radiological exposure to workers in our  reactors is within specified limits, our main objective is to  reduce the collective dose, he added.    The CBS show had criticised the functioning of Indian  nuclear  reactors by suggesting that safety guidelines were being  violated in their working.    Pakistan was conspicuous by its absence at this meeting  which  was expected to bring together technical experts of the six  member states which operate PHWRs, namely Argentina, Canada,  India, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea for an exchange of  information on safety standards.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Tories' battle plan avoids an economic front: The defence dilemma facing the Labour party THE pre-election trench warfare in Westminster switched fronts yesterday as the Tories attempted to soften up Labour's defences on nuclear and military policy with a bombardment of briefings, interviews and open letters to Mr Neil Kinnock. As an early warning of today's defence debate, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had already been strategically deployed in newspaper articles at the weekend. And last night, the prime minister himself rounded off the day's manoeuvrings with confirmation of his initiative on nuclear proliferation at the United Nations - a not overly subtle reminder of his electorally valuable seat on the international stage. Yet if the sheer fury of Labour's response - 'cheap', 'squalid' and 'pathetic' were just a few of the adjectival hand-grenades lobbed in reply - was evidence of the party's continued sensitivity about defence, there is no doubt that the issue has dropped far down the voters' list of concerns. At the 1987 general election, the Tory poster depicting Labour's defence policy as a British 'Tommy' holding up his hands in surrender was regarded as one of Conservative Central Office's few hits. Today, however, it is questionable how much real mileage the Tories can make from the issue. Still, by shifting the political focus back on to what are, in effect, international issues, the government's strategy aims at playing to Tory strengths and keep Labour on the back foot in what military tacticians would describe as 'offensive defence'. In short, it deflects voters' attention from the economy. The Conservative leadership, none the less, argues that its attack has more substance than merely stirring up voter anxieties. The joint assault launched by Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, and Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, yesterday concentrated heavily on the charge that Labour continues to be vague on its plans. It is, they claimed, specifically unclear on its policy stance on a fourth Trident submarine and sub-strategic nuclear weapons for Nato. In spite of more than 72 policy launches in the last two years, there is still no document on defence, they added. Furthermore, opinion poll findings and votes at Labour's conference suggest that the opposition cannot be trusted not to order substantial defence cuts once in power, they said. In fact, Labour has answers to most of the charges. The leadership has already emphasised that it will ignore the demand from last year's conference to harmonise UK defence spending with the European Community average - a cut calculated as equal to Pounds 6bn off the Pounds 24bn defence budget, according to the Tories. It has also said it will keep the Trident nuclear submarine programme, although it continues to promise to abandon commissioning a fourth boat if savings can be made by doing so. Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, confirmed last night that the party would now reluctantly go along with a new sub-strategic weapon system if a majority of its Nato partners insist it is essential. Furthermore, Labour's support for the government's line at Maastricht on denying the European Commission a role in formulating EC defence and foreign affairs policy and its successful efforts in dissuading its EC socialist partners from backing an EC deterrent last December suggest that the party's policy is not far removed from that of the government. Yet all that does little to defuse defence as a certain winner for the Tories in much the same way as the National Health Service is a guaranteed trump for Labour. But if there is no rapid worsening of instability in the former Eastern bloc or elsewhere when the election is finally called, it will probably prove little more than a peripheral skirmish to the main event.</p>

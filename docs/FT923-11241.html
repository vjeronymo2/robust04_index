			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: Holiday wrinkles IF YOU are packing your bags and heading for costa or plage then you will not need to be told that too much sun is very demode these days. Not only will too much sun age the skin as surely as it wrinkles the prune, but it is dangerous to boot. Now that we have got that out of the way, on to the good news - these days there is a vast range of sophisticated products that cater for every niche problem which the holiday in the sun or by the sea is likely to raise. Tired of suntan oil getting in your hair, on your clothes and on to the sandwiches? Estee Lauder's oil-free spray is the sun protection for you. With an SPF (sun protection factor) of 8 (not high enough for very pale skin or babies) it really is light and is quickly absorbed into the skin. (Pounds 12). For babies or very delicate skin go for a complete sun block - Lauder's Baby Block, for instance, has a 20+ protection factor. (Pounds 15). Lancaster is another good name to look for. This summer it has developed three products with bio-Melanin that give increased protection from UVA rays, such as Melanin Sun Wrinkle Cream (SPF 8) which can be worn under make-up and costs Pounds 21 for 50 mls. Also useful are the Melanin Lip Protector (SPF 12), Pounds 8.50 and a light, non-oily Sun Eye Treatment (SPF 8) aimed at the delicate eye area, Pounds 10.50.</p>

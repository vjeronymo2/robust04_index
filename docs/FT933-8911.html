			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Bank ahead of schedule with Pounds 29bn gilt sales to fund deficit THE Bank of England is ahead of schedule in financing the large UK budget deficit - earning it praise yesterday from City economists. Just 4 1/2 months into the financial year, the Bank has sold enough gilt-edged securities to cover nearly 60 per cent of this year's likely Pounds 50bn gap between government spending and revenues. In spite of volatile conditions in the gilts market, the Bank yesterday sold a further Pounds 400m in UK government bonds out of Pounds 1.2bn of tap stocks announced on Wednesday afternoon. About Pounds 29bn of gilts have been sold this year, with the biggest buyers being pension funds and other institutions attracted by prospects of relatively low inflation and falling interest rates. Another factor has been the high yields associated with UK government bonds  -at about 7 per cent for the 10-year maturity this is significantly higher than for equivalent French, German, US and Japanese bonds. Overseas investors have been keen to buy gilts, on beliefs that sterling would gain against the D-Mark. The Bank's effort to sell a record volume of gilts this year has been helped by soaring gilt prices in recent weeks - even though they slipped back slightly yesterday. Earlier this year many economists were worried that the Bank would be unable to find buyers for such a big amount of bonds without a large increase in yields. Mr Michael Saunders, economist in London for Salomon Brothers, the US bank, said he was impressed by the Bank's system of monthly gilt auctions which helped investor planning. Mr David Mackie of US bank JP Morgan said: 'The Bank has been astonishingly successful (in its gilt sales).' But 'it's been fairly easy for them', as retail price inflation has fallen to its lowest level for nearly 30 years. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist of Midland Bank, said the Bank had made a tactical mistake by issuing too much longer dated stock, pushing up the national debt more than was necessary, because of the higher yields on these classes of bonds. The Bank said the bulk of the new issuance has been in medium-dated gilts - in other words, those with a maturity of between seven and 15 years. Government bonds, Page 21</p>

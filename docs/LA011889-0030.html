			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RELATIONS WITH NICARAGUA  </P> <P> Leland's and Nelson's columns leave me chagrined and ashamed at the criminal  acts that are being perpetrated on the Nicaraguan people (particularly the  children) in the name of the United States.  </P> <P> It is an anomaly that at the same time public support has mounted in the U.S.  to send aid from all levels to "Communist Armenians" we make demands on how  funds authorized by Congress are to be distributed to children in Nicaragua. In  all of the rhetoric the point may be missed that Sandinista Nicaragua has a  Communist Party which is part of the opposition to the Sandinista government  while the Armenian Republic, containing many non-Armenian nationalities, is  part of a Communist state.  </P> <P> Perhaps those who were so anxious to help the Armenians with food, clothing,  medicine and money might be willing to have the excesses that are not needed  there diverted to help the people of Nicaragua in their added misery brought on  by Hurricane Joan.  </P> <P> ROBERT L.

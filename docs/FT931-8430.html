			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Date for first unified Budget brought forward THE DATE for the first unified budget has been brought forward from early December to late November to give government departments and councils more time to plan for the following financial year. From summer 1994, ministers are also likely to begin making a summer economic forecast, to make up for the compression of the existing two forecasts - at the Budget and at the Autumn Statement - into one occasion. The form of the summer forecast has not been finalised, but using one of the periodic Treasury bulletins is one option. Ministers are expecting to concede a request from Labour that this should be accompanied by a commitment to providing time for Commons debate. Until now, the Autumn Statement has been in the first half of November. Local authorities had warned that if announcement of spending plans slipped into December, their budget process would be hard pressed. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, also gave details yesterday of two related changes to legislation. The September retail prices index, rather than the December RPI, is to be used for indexing income tax personal allowances and uprating other tax limits and thresholds. Published in mid October, it is already used for indexing social security benefits. The deadline for parliament's discussion of the finance bill will be moved forward from August 5 to May 5. Other changes as a result of the move to a unified Budget are likely to include a shorter, and perhaps more relaxed, period of pre-Budget purdah, which will not start until after the party conference. The government may also try to compress the week-long general debate at the start of the parliamentary session in November, since it will be followed almost immediately by the week-long economic debate after the Budget.</p>

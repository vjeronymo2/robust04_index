			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Leeds firm heads earnings table DIBB Lupton Broomhead, the Leeds-based firm of commercial solicitors, has emerged as the UK's most profitable regional law firm in 1991-92, according to a league table of earnings published by Legal Business. Dibb Lupton had average net profits per partner of Pounds 166,000 on turnover of Pounds 28.8m and fees per fee-earner (lawyer) of Pounds 87,000. The firm has 333 fee-earners. Its nearest rival was Birmingham-based Pinsent &amp; Co with profits per partner of Pounds 165,000 on turnover of Pounds 17.1m. Pinsent has only half Dibb Lupton's number of fee-earners. In contrast the most profitable City law firm, Slaughter and May, had average net profits of Pounds 377,000 on turnover of Pounds 113m in 1991, according to figures published by the magazine last March. Slaughter has 542 fee-earners. The magazine says regional firms suffered almost as much in the 1991-92 financial year as London firms: 'Overall, most regional firms have been happy to note modest increases in turnover while profit margins have not held up well.' It notes that the finances of law firms appear to be dependent on the strength of the local economy. Firms in Leeds have fared better than their counterparts in other regions, providing four of the top 10 most profitable firms. Of the six firms examined in the Leeds area, average profits per partner were Pounds 139,000 compared with East Anglia where average profits per partner was only Pounds 79,000. Legal Business said many provincial firms reported a drop in fee income since the end of the 1991-92 financial year and many say they will struggle to meet their budgets this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------      TOP 10 REGIONAL LAW FIRMS RANKED BY PROFITS PER PARTNER 1991-92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm                        Profits per      Gross            Number of                             partner          fees             lawyers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Dibb Lupton Broomhead    (Leeds)                  Pounds 166,000   Pounds 28.8m      333  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2 Pinsent &amp; Co (Birmingham) Pounds 165,000   Pounds 17.1m      160  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 3 Hammond Suddards (Leeds)  Pounds 163,000   Pounds 20.1m      206  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4 Simpson Curtis (Leeds)    Pounds 150,000   Pounds 11.7m      129  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5 Addleshaw Sons &amp; Latham     (Manchester)            Pounds 147,000   Pounds 12.2m      119  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6 Booth &amp; Co (Leeds)        Pounds 139,000   Pounds 17.4m      179  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7 Wragge &amp; Co (Birmingham)  Pounds 123,000   Pounds 14.9m      165  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8 Edge &amp; Ellison     (Birmingham)            Pounds 122,000   Pounds 16.9m      194  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9 Eversheds Phillips &amp;     Buck (Cardiff)          Pounds 118,000   Pounds 8.2m        96  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 McGrigor Donald     (Glasgow)                             Pounds 116,000   Pounds 14.5m      133  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Legal Business, Jan/Feb 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

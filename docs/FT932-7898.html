			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Labour is urged to boost training EDUCATION and training should go to the top of a future Labour government's spending priorities, Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said yesterday. Mr Edmonds was speaking at a forum attended by representatives of Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer government-financed training programmes in England and Wales, and by young members of his union. The GMB is among the small number of unions seeking to raise the issue of training among its own members and the trade union movement. Last year it and the TGWU general union proposed that all workers should have an entitlement to five days' training every year. Mr Edmonds said no political party had grasped the importance of training and education, and he questioned some Labour policies, such as obliging companies to spend a certain amount on training. He said the Labour party should be capable of switching its spending priorities in favour of education and training. 'In the short term it would mean taking money from other spending areas, but there would be a payback in the medium term,' he said. Mr Michael Nixon, chief executive of North London Tec, said the agenda for Tecs was getting longer and broader. 'But we must not take our eye off youth training and training for unemployed adults,' he said. Mr Nixon said Tecs had lobbied hard for more money for training - not always with success. Tecs were still aware that there was concern about the quality of programmes, but they had improved since Tecs were set up.</p>

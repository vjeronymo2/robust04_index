			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Review awards may cost 40,000 jobs More than 40,000 jobs will have to be shed from those parts of the public sector covered by the pay review bodies if the government were to stick to its planned pay bill freeze, wage analysts estimated last night. When the government announced the public-sector freeze in September it said pay rises were still possible but only as a result of job cuts and increased productivity. The pay rises averaging close to 3 per cent for more than 1.5m workers announced yesterday are higher than the government would have liked, and several City analysts doubted whether the required savings could come from productivity increases and job losses alone. Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets, said: 'Settling for 2.7 to 3 per cent means one hell of a productivity gain and a lot of people being sacked.' Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, estimates that about 40,000 jobs will have to go to cover the pay rises for the 1.5m. But in the whole of the public sector last year - when there was a 1.5 per cent pay limit - the total job loss was only 120,000 and much of that was the result of contracting-out of services. The government has stressed that it will not dip into the contingency reserve to fund the rises, but it has recently softened its position on the funding of the pay rise by saying that savings from running costs can be used as well as savings from the pay bills. Mr Trinder said: 'A lot of recent policy - the 1.5 per cent norm, the pay bill freeze and then its extension for another two years - has been made on the hoof. With elections coming up and tax increases cutting people's real pay, the government has decided to be pragmatic.' Union leaders said inflation and tax rises would leave most people covered by the review bodies with a wage cut of 1 per cent or 2 per cent in real terms, but they were privately pleased that the government had not tampered with most recommendations. The pay review rises are roughly in line with current earnings in the private sector, where some upward pressure is now expected. The review body rises will set a ceiling of 3 per cent for the other 4m public-sector workers, who are likely to get rises of between 1 per cent and 3 per cent. Public-sector pay increases overall are likely to lag behind private-sector pay this year, but less than they did last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC SECTOR WAGES: WHAT THEY GOT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year    Doctors   Nurses    Other health     Armed   Teachers     Top                            professionals    forces             people  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994         3%       3%              3%   3%-4.4%       2.9%   2.75%* 1993       1.5%     1.5%            1.5%      1.5%       1.5%      3%* 1992       5.5%     5.8%            6.3%      5.9%       7.5%      4%*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Three-year staged award Sources: Government departments/*FDA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

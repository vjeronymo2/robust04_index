			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov under the rubric "Russian-Latvian </F> Business Ties": "Entrepreneurs Are Ahead of Politicians"]    [Text] At the meeting of entrepreneurs of Russia and  Latvia held yesterday at the Congress Center of the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry, representatives of business circles from  the two countries reached an understanding on strengthening  bilateral ties. The businessmen's initiatives may create a  favorable climate for normalizing Russian-Latvian political  relations.    One gets the feeling after every meeting of Russia's  entrepreneurs with their colleagues from the republics of the  former USSR that the system of interstate relations created is  not focused on developing entrepreneurial activity among  countries. Yesterday's event organized by the efforts of the  chambers of commerce and industry of Russia and Latvia was no  exception either. Nonetheless, the meeting fulfilled its  priority task, which, judging from the heightened interest shown  toward the event by the Russian government, was expanding  unofficial channels of economic cooperation.    At this time the main obstacle in the way of expanding  trade-economic cooperation between Russia and Latvia is the lack  not only of a free trade system (Russia has concluded such  agreements with all the CIS countries), but also of most favored  nation status. As a result, double export-import customs duties  are imposed on goods crossing the border. Conditions of Latvian  export became especially difficult after the Russian government  authorized new import customs tariff rates. But Latvia  instituted favored nation status for Russia unilaterally.    In the opinion of both Russian and Latvian businessmen, at  this time cooperation in the financial sphere is most promising.  Russian bankers believe that Latvia is the only country on the  territory of the former USSR where the economy drives politics.  In Latvia favorable conditions have been created to conduct  banking transactions. This is confirmed by the fact that with a  population of less than 3 million people on the republic's  territory, more than 250 commercial banks are in operation and  the confidentiality of deposits and free transfer of capital  abroad are ensured. Starting in 1994, foreign banks are allowed  to open branches in Latvia; they must register at the Bank of  Latvia to do this. On the whole, there are no legislative  restrictions on transactions of nonresidents in Latvia's  financial sphere. In the opinion of Russian financial experts,  as a result of a liberal currency policy, Latvia is acquiring  the pronounced features of a financial "offshore" zone, which  makes its commercial banks attractive for placing hard currency  deposits and carrying out transfers of hard currency to third  countries.    Russian-Latvian trade relations are based on importing raw  materials from Russia, above all for them to be re-exported  later, and exporting to Russia finished output which is produced  on the basis of Russian components. The formation of this trade  structure is the result of the constantly rising rate of the lat  in relation to the dollar, which even with high customs duties  makes re-export more profitable as compared to the export of  Latvian goods. It is very likely that this is precisely what  keeps the Russian authorities from establishing liberal trade  conditions with Latvia.    But businessmen believe all the same that the economic  relations of the two countries can be moved ahead. That is  feasible in the area of joint operation of oil and gas industry  installations which are on Latvia's territory. The development  of cooperation in this area will not only provide direct  financial benefits to the two countries, but will also make a  contribution to solving the pressing problem of creating new  jobs for the Russian-speaking population.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-040-08A>      Structure of Russia's Trade with Latvia in 1993 </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-040-09A>      Dynamics of Russian-Latvian Foreign Trade Turnover </FIG></p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEART SERVICE PERFORMANCE REVIEW URGED;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS COULD BE SUBJECT TO PROBATION, SUSPENSION OR  LOSS OF LICENSE IF THEIR MORTALITY RATES FOR CARDIOVASULAR PROCEDURES ARE TOO  HIGH.  </P> <P> California hospitals with high mortality rates or low volumes of cardiovascular  procedures such as open-heart surgery and angioplasty would be subject to  independent performance reviews and possible revocation of their permit to  offer such services, under regulations being proposed by the state Department  of Health Services.  </P> <P> The regulations would authorize the department to "place the cardiovascular  service on probation, or if appropriate, suspend or revoke" its license to do  certain procedures when "substantial quality of care problems are identified."  A copy of the draft regulations was obtained by The Times last week.  </P> <P> Current regulations "don't really give us any kind of clout," said Teresa  Hawkes, the department's deputy director for licensing and certification.  Hawkes termed the proposed regulations "a positive step forward" because they  put facilities on notice when "there is going to be a review" and possible  action.  </P> <P> The draft regulations are in part a response to a series of articles in The  Times in 1988 and 1989, which identified low-volume and high-mortality heart  surgery hospitals. The articles suggested that many lives could be saved and  complications averted if more patients were cared for at high-volume,  low-mortality facilities.  </P> <P> The Times found that about 15% of the state's approximately 100 heart surgery  hospitals had heart-bypass surgery mortality rates at least 50% above the state  average. In addition, about a third did not meet the 150-cases-a year minimum  for all heart surgeries recommended by the state and the American College of  Surgeons. The minimum is designed to maintain the skills of doctors and nurses.  Under the proposed regulations, such hospitals would be subject to state  review.  </P> <P> "It is the first time in California that regulation of cardiovascular services  has included explicit quality standards related to the volume and outcome of  the procedures," said Jonathan Showstack of UC San Francisco's Institute for  Health Policy Studies. Showstack helped The Times prepare its studies and  served on an expert advisory committee that assisted the state in drafting the  guidelines.  </P> <P> A public hearing on the draft regulations is likely in about 90 days. If the  process continues on schedule, the final regulations will take effect in early  1991.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, all hospitals would report to the state annually on their  total number of procedures and mortality rates in categories such as heart  surgery, angioplasty, and catheterizations. Newly approved cardiovascular  services would make quarterly reports during their first year of operation.  </P> <P> (Angioplasty is a method in which a balloon-tipped catheter is used to unclog  heart arteries and catheterization is a technique for diagnosing heart  diseases).  </P> <P> Hospitals would be required to maintain detailed data on cases. The data would  include the reasons procedures were performed, elective or emergency status,  all diagnoses, complications and mortality rates that are adjusted for the  severity of illness of the patients before the procedure.  </P> <P> For adults, the recommended annual minimums for each hospital are 200  catheterizations, 100 interventional procedures such as angioplasty and 150  surgeries. For pediatric heart services, the recommended yearly minimums are  100 catheterizations and 50 surgeries.  </P> <P> Hospitals that "do not meet the recommended minimums and/or whose mortality  rates are 50% above the state average for that year" would be reviewed by the  state, according to the proposal. A hospital also could be required to conduct  at its expense and forward to the health services department "an independent  review of its cardiovascular service" by an expert group approved by the state.  </P> <P> The proposed cardiovascular regulations are part of an ongoing review by the  state of all its regulations of acute care hospitals, including nursing,  emergency services and neonatal care.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Packaging.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NDMA specifically requested that FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deny the request made by the AG petition to require that iron-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing products containing 30 mg or more of iron per tablet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be packaged in child-resistant individual blister packs. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support of this request, NDMA pointed out that its voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program calls for the packaging of all iron-containing products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with 30 mg or more iron per dose in complying CRP (i.e., there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be no CRP-exempt sizes for this type of product). (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion on CRP requirements of CPSC in section II.B. of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document.) NDMA noted that its voluntary program is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carried out in conjunction with a national consumer education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> campaign that it launched with CPSC on September 27, 1993, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with CPSC's Conference on Pediatric Iron Poisonings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Fatalities, which was held on September 28, 1993, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Formulation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NDMA stated that iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products with greater than or equal to 30 mg iron per solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dosage form will not be formulated with sweet outer coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Consumer Product Safety Commission Conference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPSC held this conference because of the increase in iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisonings of children. The objective of the conference was to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a forum for health care professionals and representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of government and industry to identify solutions to this problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conference included invited speakers from CPSC, AAPCC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Georgetown University, FDA, NDMA, the National Nutritional Foods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association (NNFA), and the Office of the New York State Attorney General. This conference highlighted the seriousness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pediatric iron poisoning problem and the steps that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being taken to address the problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Factors that may have contributed to the increased incidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of pediatric iron poisonings were discussed, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement by many women for iron supplementation during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnancy; the use of iron-containing products in homes where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small children are present; the ability of older siblings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential victims to open CRP; the misconception that vitamin and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mineral products are inherently safe; improper use or failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly close child-resistant closures; and the formulation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some iron-containing products to appear like candy, potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explaining why some children consumed large quantities of tablets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (30 to 100 tablets).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPSC described the regulations that it issued in 1978 under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, which require CRP on most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drugs and food supplements with more than 250 mg of iron per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container (see section II.B. of this document). CPSC noted that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its Office of Compliance and Enforcement recently discovered that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several manufacturers of iron-containing products were not using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CRP, and that some of these manufacturers had voluntarily agreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to recall these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this conference, FDA explained that most iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products are regulated as dietary supplements under the food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA noted that, although there are currently no specific regulations for iron-containing supplements, the general food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety and food labeling provisions of the act require that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foods, including iron-containing supplements, be safe under their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended conditions of use, and that their labeling be truthful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and nonmisleading. FDA also noted that iron-containing products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are regulated as drugs under the drug provisions of the act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be approved before marketing as safe and effective for their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended conditions of use and are subject to labeling and good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing practice requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The industry's voluntary efforts in response to the iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning problem were described by representatives of NDMA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NNFA. NDMA described its newly initiated voluntary program of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging, labeling, and formulation changes which it had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioned FDA to adopt into regulation. NDMA also described the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newly launched joint consumer education campaign that it had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed in cooperation with CPSC to inform adults how to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect children from accidental iron poisoning. (See section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV.B. of this document.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NNFA stated that its members were adopting a voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program similar to NDMA's, with the added provision that iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be limited to a maximum of 30 mg per dosage unit and 30 mg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per recommended dose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an open discussion of possible solutions, several ways to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the problem of pediatric iron poisoning were suggested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These suggestions included: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

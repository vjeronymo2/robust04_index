			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Nampak ahead 14% to R123.4m INCREASED volumes, improved market share and higher exports allowed Nampak, South Africa's largest packaging company, to record increased turnover and earnings in the six months to the end of March. Turnover at the Barlow Rand subsidiary was 13 per cent up at R2.21bn (Dollars 770m), while operating profit was 16 per cent higher at R250.3m. Improved margins were the result of 2.4 per cent volume growth, improved productivity, plant rationalisation and tight cost controls. Attributable profit rose 14 per cent to R123.4m. Earnings per share were 13 per cent higher at 258 cents, while the dividend was lifted 5 per cent to 79 cents per share. Mr Brian Connellan, chairman, said most divisions in the packaging segment had achieved real growth. Looking ahead, Mr Connellan said although lower interest rates and improved export prospects would help the economy, these benefits were outweighed by the impact of continuing unrest, unemployment and the drought. He said the level of increase in earnings for the full year was likely to be below the first-half level. Two other companies in the Barlow Rand group reported higher interim profits. Attributable profits at Tiger Oats rose 13 per cent to R154.4m, while earnings at Imperial Cold Storage (ICS) were 29 per cent higher at R30.8m. Mr Robbie Williams, chairman of Tiger Oats, said the higher profits, achieved on a 4.4 per cent rise in turnover to R4.4bn, reflected the group's diverse base, strong brands, and the benefits of upgrading plant and technology. ICS benefited from a restructuring programme introduced 18 months ago, with the 29 per cent rise in earnings achieved on a turnover increase of 8 per cent to R1.2bn.</p>

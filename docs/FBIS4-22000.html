			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Six people were killed this morning and 30  others wounded in a bomb explosion aboard a bus in Hadera.  Among the six killed was apparently the terrorist himself.  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has claimed responsibility  and says more attacks can be expected. Most of those hurt  sustained light injuries, and most of those have already been  released from hospital. In Hadera demonstrators protested  against the violence and government policy.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Geneva, 14 May -- The proposals that Boris Yeltsin  sent to the heads of state before the Geneva meeting of  ministers on Bosnia were, in fact, laid down in the foundation  of its final communique. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said  this to journalists after the meeting with his American  counterpart, Warren Christopher. They managed to work out a  single position since all the participants -- the heads of the  diplomatic departments of the Russian Federation, United States,  and the five countries of the European Union -- sensed an  objective necessity to work out a joint position.    Replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Andrey  Kozyrev said Russia would inform Belgrade about the ministers'  meeting in Geneva. Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the  Russian president, will leave for the FRY's capital with this  task on 15 May.    In its turn, the American side will also take steps to  inform  the participants in the Bosnian conflict about the results of  the meeting. Warren Christopher told journalists that he would  meet representatives of Croatia and the Bosnian Government.  Russia, the United States, the European Community, and the  United Nations "are acting as a united front for the first  time", he said. This is "the most significant result of the  Geneva meeting."</p>

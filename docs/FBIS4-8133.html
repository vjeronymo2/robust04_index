			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the news item broadcast last  night by the Israeli Television and quoted by AFP, according to  which a meeting between PLO leader Yasir `Arafat and Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will be held in Bucharest on 15  April, a possibility assessed by Palestinian sources in Tunis as  not very likely, our correspondent Eugen Baboi, who is  accredited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, contacted  Ministry spokesman Mircea Geoana, who said the following: The  Romanian Foreign Ministry has no knowledge of such an event.  The Foreign Ministry sent an invitation to `Arafat and Peres to  participate in the proceedings of the Crans Montana Forum that  will be held in Bucharest on 21-24 April, but it is still  waiting for confirmation regarding the participation of the two  officials. Therefore, the Romanian side cannot comment on the  information regarding an `Arafat-Peres meeting in Bucharest on  15 April because it has no knowledge of such a meeting.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Alitalia strike for today Mr Publio Fiori, Italy's transport minister, failed yesterday in an attempt to avert an airline workers' strike that threatened to ground most Alitalia flights and cause delays at some airports, AP reports from Rome. The 24-hour strike scheduled for today affects all international and domestic flights from Rome and Naples, where the Group of Seven summit finished yesterday. It could hamper the departure of some delegations and journalists. But state-run Alitalia said it would guarantee a minimum number of flights, including routes to New York, Bangkok and most European cities. Mr Fiori also requested that Alitalia improve passenger services, such as flight information and medical care for travellers, to help ease inconve-niences caused by the strikes. In a meeting called by Mr Fiori yesterday, union officials representing flight personnel and ground crews failed to come to terms with Italy's national carrier on job cuts. Unions are protesting at Alitalia's cost-saving plan to shed 4,000 jobs and rewrite work contracts. Last week, a two-day strike by flight crews forced it to cancel half its flights. A planned walkout by air traffic controllers was delayed until later this month.</p>

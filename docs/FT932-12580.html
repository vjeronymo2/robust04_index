			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / World Trade News: Russia signs satellite deal THE Russian space industry yesterday signed its first contract to launch a western satellite in what it hopes will be the first step into a lucrative western market. The Dollars 36m (Pounds 23m) deal between Inmarsat, the international telecommunications satellite operator, and Russia's Salyut design bureau, is for the launch in 1995 of a mainly US-built satellite on a Russian Proton rocket. Mr Olof Lundberg, director-general of Inmarsat, said the launch would cost 'several million dollars' more than the Dollars 36m once his organisation had paid extra costs including those of adapting its satellite to a Russian launch. But it would still be cheaper than a western launch - according to one Inmarsat official, up to Dollars 10m less. Mr Lundberg also made a plea in favour of more generalised Russian access to the western commercial satellite launch market. 'The Russian economy cannot only be somewhere where westerners invest and sell goods.' Fear of powerful Russian competition for western satellite launchers like Arianespace, which charges Dollars 62m for a similar service, has meant that the west has yet to remove obstacles to Russia competing in this market. The Inmarsat deal was only made possible by a US promise to grant an export licence so that the Inmarsat-3 satellite, whose main contractor is Martin Marietta of the US but which also has some European components, can be exported to the former Soviet Union for launch from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. A draft agreement on the terms for this licence provides strict safeguards to guard the technological secrets in the satellite from Russians who will be working on the project. The Russians have started parallel talks with the US and the European Community on a possible tripartite deal allowing them a certain number of launches a year and even setting price floors for their services. Mr Dmitry Polukhin, Salyut's director general, said he expected agreement soon on what share of the Russian side's profits would go to Kazakhstan, which now owns the Soviet-built Baikonur.</p>

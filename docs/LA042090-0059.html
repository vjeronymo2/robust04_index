			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SQUAD CRANKS WITH DELIGHTFUL, WILD ABANDON  </P> <P> Perhaps all of us are haunted by those shows that got away, legendary one-time  events that occurred while we were somewhere else. While others worry about  missing Springsteen in a biker bar or Peter Gabriel at the Bear, for well over  a decade this writer has been irked about missing an Orange County group called  Gumby at Costa Mesa's killed-in-action Cuckoo's Nest.  </P> <P> According to those who were there, Gumby's performance was a fearless merger of  art and utter ineptitude: Over the sort of pure dissonance that only the  unschooled can create, the group's singer reportedly spent one song flailing  about, clutching his forehead and pathetically repeating, "Mom, I hurt my  head!" as catsup oozed from his hair. For a finale, the band hurled partially  eaten sandwiches into the audience.  </P> <P> Lightning rarely strikes twice, but hearing of a Pomona Valley band featuring a  hand truck as a percussion instrument, a vocalist who sometimes sings through a  sad panda mask, and such lyrical expressions as "I keep bonking my head. . . .  Oooo, ow, that hurts," one had reason to hope.  </P> <P> Performing at Club Tangent on Wednesday night, Desperation Squad may not quite  have competed with the mists of time and opportunity lost, but it proved to be  a unique and amusing outfit. In the 11-song set, the Squad's sound seemed to be  part Pere Ubu, part early Kinks and one part cleansing cream.  </P> <P> The six Squad members actually had a fairly sharp musical expertise, but didn't  let it get in their way. Instead, they whacked away at their songs with an  abandon well suited to the moves of their frenetically kinetic lead singer Mr.  P., who looked to be running at about the same bruise-to-skin ratio as the  early Iggy Pop.  </P> <P> They opened the set with Pere Ubu's "Street Waves" and followed with originals  (most from their "Hot Diggity Dogs!" album, produced by David Lindley guitarist  Ray Woodbury) that mixed a raw melodicism with a powerful sound best likened to  a toxic-laden locomotive.  </P> <P> "Serious Love" twinned biting guitar hooks from guitarists Jeff Hayes and Bob  Jones around a lyric where Mr. P asked: "Why would I drive my car through a  brick wall,/And pound the steering wheel many times onto my face? It must be  serious love."  </P> <P> Problems with love and automobiles were central to several of the songs. The  yearning for automobility in "I Need a Girl (With a Car)" -- on which  percussionist Becky Hamm appropriately played a hubcap -- was offset by "I Died  (in a Car)." On the latter tune, Mr. P careened about the stage under a sheet,  and his vocal imparted some of the indignation one might feel after such an  abrupt and terminal change in lifestyle.  </P> <P> Girls who like thugs was the topic of "She Don't Love Me (I'm Not a Criminal),"  while "Mr. Fireworks" offered a hilarious glimpse into the mind of a  dance-floor egotist. It also was the band's musical high point, kicking with  the intensity of the Kinks' "I'm Not Like Everybody Else." The pathetic panda  mask made an appearance late in the set, looking all-the-more deranged with Mr.  P's long hair flying out of its mouth as he flailed about the stage.  </P> <P> While reportedly something of a sensation on its home turf, the band pulled in  few O.C. listeners Wednesday. The low attendance, coupled with the venue's odd  policy of leaving the house lights on during performances, may have lessoned  the band's impact.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Clear evidence has emerged of direct ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] support for the so-called LPC [Liberian Peace Council].  A captured LPC soldier told LPN [expansion unknown] News that  it received direct supply of fresh and ammunition from ECOMOG in  River Cess, where they used canoes to take delivery.    The LPC prisoner of war said the head of their group, Dr.  (George Bulley), is in direct contact with ECOMOG. He said he  was sent on a mission along with a group of others to map out  strategic locations in the southeast for possible attack. The  LPC POW was arrested recently in Sinoe County by the NPFL task  force commander for the southeast, Lieutenant General Joseph  Bako, and the deputy chief of operations, Colonel Lawrence  Young, when they went on an inspection of the frontline.</p>

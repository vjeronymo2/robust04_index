			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> REBELS APPEAL NCAA PLAY BAN  </P> <P> UNLV has filed an appeal seeking to overturn an NCAA ban that would prevent the  Runnin' Rebels from defending their national basketball championship.  </P> <P> The appeal was prepared over the last two weeks after the NCAA ruled July 20  that the Rebels could not compete in postseason play next year.  </P> <P> The penalty was an outgrowth of a case involving UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian and  the NCAA dating back to 1977.  </P> <P> UNLV appealed the penalty on the grounds it is a case of double jeopardy, since  the university already served two years probation in the case, from 1977 to  1979. The NCAA placed UNLV on probation for two years and ordered Tarkanian  suspended for two years in 1977 for a series of violations. The university  served the probation but Tarkanian obtained a court injunction preventing his  suspension and continued coaching, compiling the best record, percentage-wise,  among active college coaches.  </P> <P> In a related matter, Big West Conference athletic directors, meeting in Los  Angeles, delayed taking action that would prevent the Rebels from playing in  the conference postseason basketball tournament next year. Conference officials  say they want to await the outcome of UNLV's appeal before making a decision.  </P></p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Appleyard calls for Pounds 16.4m APPLEYARD GROUP, the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer, announced a 3-for-10 rights issue yesterday to raise Pounds 16.4m for acquisitions. The cash call at 120p a share came as the group reported a jump in interim pre-tax profits and agreed to acquire WSM Motors, a Bristol-based Mercedes-Benz van and truck dealership for Pounds 1m from Union Traffic. WSM made operating profits of Pounds 123,000 in the six months to June 30. Appleyard's shares closed down 2p at 148p yesterday. Mr John Atkin, business development manager, said that while the proceeds of the rights issue would initially be used to reduce gearing, the longer-term aim was to make 'selective and complementary acquisitions.' The group now has 57 franchises on 39 sites in the north of England and Scotland but wants to improve the balance of its portfolio and add BMW, Citroen, Fiat, Honda, Mazda and Toyota marques. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from a restated Pounds 263,000 to Pounds 2.61m on turnover of Pounds 177m (Pounds 158m). Earnings were 3.9p (0.9p) and the dividend is held at 2.6p. COMMENT Appleyard is beginning to benefit from the effects of operational gearing. After cutting costs a relatively modest 12 per cent increase in turnover resulted in a 65 per cent improvement in operating profit to Pounds 3.29m. Overall, the group's return on resources employed has improved from 6.8 per cent for the 1992 first half to 17.2 per cent in the latest period and the group now has its sights on a 20 per cent plus return. Appleyard has managed to squeeze more out of 12 of its existing sites through multi-franchising. Now the group is planning to expand through acquisitions. Pre-tax profits this year should reach Pounds 5.2m producing earnings per share of 7.4p and a prospective p/e of 20.</p>

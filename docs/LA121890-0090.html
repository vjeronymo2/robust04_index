			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIAN LEADERS MEET OPPONENTS, DISCUSS COALITION  </P> <P> The Romanian government began unprecedented coalition talks Monday with a key  opposition party in a bid to defuse political tension and form national unity.  </P> <P> President Ion Iliescu told local radio he had begun mediating with National  Liberal Party leader Radu Campeanu and Prime Minister Petre Roman in an effort  to pull Romania out of its political and economic crisis.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, anti-government protests broke out in the western city of Timisoara,  cradle of the Romanian revolution a year ago, with about 15,000 people calling  for Iliescu's resignation. At the same time, all major factories were hit by  strikes, with workers protesting against the government's economic reform  program, price liberalization, low wages and food shortages.  </P> <P> Iliescu said, "The talks concentrated on a dialogue and negotiations to be  conducted over the next few days. The NLP pledged to contact other opposition  parties to find possible solutions for co-participation in government by  opposition parties."  </P> <P> Roman said there is a good chance the talks will yield concrete results. "We  shall see ways to share responsibilities at a moment which is by no means easy  for the country."  </P> <P> Campeanu and four National Liberal Party colleagues were negotiating with  Roman, ruling National Salvation Front Vice President Claudiu Iordache and the  front's parliamentary leaders, Alexandru Barladeanu and Dan Martian.  </P> <P> Political sources said that Campeanu hopes to gain four Cabinet portfolios --  possibly the ministries of trade, agriculture, education and labor. Campeanu  ultimately wants Roman's job.  </P> <P> The main grudge against Roman is that he unleashed harsh austerity by  liberalizing prices last month and ending four decades of Communist-style price  subsidies. Iliescu's chief flaw in the eye of his opponents is that he is an  unrepentant Communist with autocratic ambitions.  </P> <P> The National Liberals are one of six major parliamentary opposition parties  that formed a united front last Saturday as the ruling front faced popular  opposition and labor and student strikes.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "The crisis in the Russian economy and society has  reached its apogee and the country is approaching a period of  instability," leader of the Russian National Assembly Aleksandr  Sterligov declared at a press conference on Wednesday in Moscow.    In his opinion, "one cannot rule out social cataclysms in  the  near future." Under this situation, Sterligov indicated, the  RNC deems it possible to create a Russian Power Union bloc as an  association of the opposition "which could participate in the  presidential elections if they take place." In his words, in  the near future the RNC intends to create "a national council --  a kind of council of the Elders -- which would proceed with the  consultations with different opposition forces to coordinate  their positions and to form a single bloc." "We addressed  Varennikov, Achalov, and Starodubtsev with a proposal to form  such a council," said Sterligov.    As he said, "one should agree to the president's idea on  national accord, however, this accord cannot be reached as a  result of adopting one act." "Public recognition of serious  mistakes on the part of the president and his circles and their  resignation could be a step on the way to national accord in  society," stressed Sterligov.    He indicated that "for their part, the opposition forces  could publicly take pledges to ensure stability in society and  to rule out any political persecutions." "Russia must reject the  present system of elections which has recognized its bankruptcy  and start formation of a power structure at a `Zemstvo  Assembly'," declared Sterligov.    As he said, "the first `Zemstvo Assembly' should be convened  in 1996 instead of elections scheduled for this time." Sterligov  pointed out that delegations of Russia's territories and regions  representing different strata of the population would be able to  elect new power structures and, probably, abolish the institute  of the presidency.</p>

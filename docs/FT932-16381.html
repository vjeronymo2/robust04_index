			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Mirror Group Newspapers loses Pounds 84m: Loss blamed on restructuring as operating profits advance 16% and shares rise 11p RESTRUCTURING costs at Mirror Group Newspapers were responsible for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 84m in the year ended December 27. This compares with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 47.3m. But operating profits rose 16 per cent to Pounds 97.5m (Pounds 83.7m) on turnover of Pounds 466.1m (Pounds 459.9m). The shares rose 11p to close at 115p. Mr David Montgomery, chief executive, said: 'Our objective is to be treated like any other business.' While reaffirming the Daily Mirror's support for the Labour Party he attacked what he called the paper's 'cosy culture' between management, employees and unions: 'In large part this was due to management's failure to manage.' Costs were reduced by tackling 'overmanning', reducing part-time casual staff and reorganising the group's resources. Profits before exceptional items fell from Pounds 47.3m to Pounds 32.5m after Pounds 17.9m was charged towards refunding the deficit in the group's pension scheme. There was an exceptional charge of Pounds 116.5m to meet reorganisation costs. These included the rationalisation of the print operations (Pounds 46m), including the closure of three presses in Stamford Street; the 600 job cuts, half of which have already been announced (Pounds 16m); and costs associated with move to a new print site in Glasgow (Pounds 54m). In addition MGN has provided Pounds 6.4m mainly in respect of continuing costs relating to the pension fund. Mr Montgomery acknowledged there had been 'a period of traumatic change' in promoting 'a new corporate culture' although he denied that industrial relations at MGN were a problem. He said those who had left the paper had been unable to embrace the new 'entrepreneurial, enthusiastic spirit'. He said he did not regard the departure of Lord Hollick, a non-executive director and chairman of MAI Group, as a loss. MGN is renegotiating the lease on its Holborn headquarters but may decide to move to another site. The group's gross debt, including finance leases, was reduced by Pounds 58m to Pounds 395m. A loss per share of 19.7p compares with earnings per share of 9.5p. There is no dividend compared with an 0.8p interim payout last time. Lex, Page 16</p>

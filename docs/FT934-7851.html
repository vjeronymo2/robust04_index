			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Observer: Common cause Among all the clamour in Sweden over the planned Volvo-Renault merger, there has been a deafening silence from the Wallenberg family, the titans of Swedish industry. But at last Peter Wallenberg, the current doyen of the dynasty, has pronounced - and it is welcome news for Volvo boss Pehr Gyllenhammar, who has long been the most powerful rival to Wallenberg industrial dominance. In a newspaper interview, Wallenberg backed the merger in principle, saying the three-year-old alliance between Volvo and Renault was a 'half-cooked egg'. His comments are a considerable disappointment to the anti-merger camp, led by Aktiespararna, the small shareholders association. Everyone in Sweden remembers the occasion in 1979 when Marcus Wallenberg, Peter's late father, dealt a knock-out blow to Gyllenhammar's grand scheme of the time, to sell 40 per cent of Volvo to the Norwegian government in exchange for North Sea oil concessions. Peter Wallenberg's comments should dispel rumours that he was working quietly against the current deal. But in fact any other public stance would have been strange, given that the Wallenbergs sold 50 per cent and management control of Saab cars to General Motors a few years ago.</p>

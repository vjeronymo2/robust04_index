This happened one year ago, at the time of the NSP  investigation into the "South Korean Workers Party Incident."  NSP anti-Communist investigators set out, unarmed as always, to  arrest suspected spies. It is said that even though clearly  aware of the fact that the suspects were armed with pistols  brought in from North Korea and metal pipes with 30-cm blades,  the investigators went empty-handed.    Why did they do this? The reason is simple. It was a silent  protest against the social climate in which if during the arrest  process a suspect happens to be injured, he is suddenly treated  as a "champion of democracy." "So what if he fires his gun. He  only has a few rounds in it. If you're unlucky and you get hit,  you die...this was the mood of the anti-Communist team at that  time," said one investigator.    This is an example showing the image of the NSP one year  ago.  A year has passed since then and the situation is worse now, say  NSP personnel. A year ago, they could work even if it meant  being prepared to take a bullet. Now, however, things have grown  so bad they have to worry more about being "prison bound" than  work, they say. This is because prison sentences are clearly  stated in the penal regulations of the revised NSP Law.    Since the passage of the NSP-Law Reform Bill in the National  Assembly last 7 December, NSP personnel have lost heart and  their morale has dropped. However, they all sympathize with the  "broad principle" that the NSP must change, casting off its old  image. Thus, they seem not to be particularly dissatisfied with  the revision of the NSP Law itself.    Since the birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration, however,  due to the fact that the NSP's own reform efforts, centered  around NSP Director Kim Tok, are not acknowledged in political  circles and to the adoption of inequitable penal regulations  effecting only NSP personnel, they are saddened on the one hand,  and worried about the enormous psychological burden they will  have to bear in the investigation process on the other.    The main framework of this revised NSP Law tied the hands of  the NSP in two stages. The first greatly reduced NSP  jurisdiction; the second called for penalties heavier than those  given to ordinary public servants when, due to an abuse of power  by NSP personnel, there is an infringement of civil rights or  involvement in politics. Representative of this reduction of  NSP jurisdiction are the establishment of an Intelligence  Committee, the abolition of security-inspection authority, the  prohibition against involvement in politics, and a reduction in  investigative authority.    The establishment of the Intelligence Committee signifies  the  birth of a genuine surveillance organization of the legislature  for keeping watch on the NSP. To makes its appearance after the  revision of the National Assembly Law, the Intelligence  Committee, by its function of examining the NSP's budget, can in  actuality observe all NSP activity.    Security-inspection authority has been understood as the  NSP's "means of control" over the various ministries and offices  of government and organizations at each level. With the  disappearance of this jurisdiction, the NSP lost its influence  over these organizations. With the expansion of the prohibition  against participation in politics, no NSP employee may be  involved in any political activity, such as support for or  obstruction of the formation of political parties or entrance  into such parties, or support for or obstruction of a specific  political party or specific politician. With the reduction of  the NSP's investigative authority, investigations into the  crimes of encouragement and praise of the enemy  [komuchanyangjoe] and negligence, provided for by NSP Law, will  be handled by the public prosecutor's office.    Of these, the establishment of the Intelligence Committee,  abolition of security-inspection authority, and prohibition  against political involvement are included in the revisions to  the law made by the NSP itself. They are also part of the  self-reform being pursued by the NSP since NSP Director Kim Tok  took office.    Actually, since the appointment of Director Kim Tok, the NSP  has been walking the path of transformation by the large-scale  reshuffling of its organization and adjustment of its  operational direction. Unlike former presidents, after taking  office President Kim Yong-sam has made clear on several  occasions that he would prevent the NSP from carrying out  political operations.    The NSP's abolition of the Intelligence Coordination and  Deliberations Council [Chongbo Chojong Hyopui Hoe], known as the  "Council for Countermeasures on Agencies Concerned [Kwangye  Kigwan Taechaek Hoeui]," was one change made following the  president's intentions. Misunderstood as organizations  exclusively responsible for political surveillance, some  "associated bureaus" were eliminated during the agency's  reorganization. The number of nationwide branch offices, set up  separately from province and city branch offices, was also  greatly reduced.    Since the security-inspection authority provided room for  criticism, the over 200 organizations subject to such authority  was greatly reduced to over 100. To cast off its bad name of  being a veiled organization, a public information office was  created within the NSP. In its Public Service Center, phone  lines were opened for dealing with various civil appeals  connected with the NSP.    Through this series of self-reform measures, the NSP was in  the middle of transforming from the negative "power-agency"  image of the past to a new one as an "intelligence agency."  These NSP efforts are all included in the NSP Law Revision Bill  laid out by the government ruling party, said the NSP director's  special aid on legal affairs Cho Man-hu.    "The government ruling party's bill on NSP-Law reform was  prepared by the NSP itself," said Cho. "The purpose of the  revision is to give the NSP jurisdiction as an intelligence  agency directly subordinate to the president, but to prevent the  misuse of power." Cho also said, "As proposals for blocking the  abuse of authority, the regulation against the infringement of  civil rights and the article calling for control by the National  Assembly's Intelligence Committee were put there by the NSP,"  and, "The parts about abolishing security-inspection authority  and punishing personnel who have become involved in politics  were also first proposed by the NSP."    "Isn't the call for unconditionally heavy penalties for the  wrongful exercise of authority and political involvement of only  NSP personnel, despite this, a severe legal inequality?"  countered Cho. For the most part, NSP personnel are  disinterestedly accepting the reduction of their authority, but  concerning the penal regulations on wrongful use of authority  and political involvement, they are very perplexed.    It is a well-known fact that the NSP and its predecessor,  the  Korean Central Intelligence Agency, were able to wield unlimited  power as the highest power organizations not because of the law,  but because of a problem of administration. It is true that,  because "the interests of the president were the interests of  the NSP director," the NSP has moved centered around one man,  the ruler. NSP personnel came to be involved in politics and to  abuse their authority to protect a regime with a weak support  base.    The revised law, however, requires a maximum of seven years  confinement for NSP personnel involved in politics and a maximum  of seven years confinement for wrongful exercise of authority.  This is some five years longer than penal codes applying to  general public servants, says Cho. Also, in the case of  political involvement, even if personnel do not directly involve  themselves in politics, the law requires that they be punished  if only traces of involvement are found. It even calls for the  punishment of attempted political involvement. The morale of NSP  personnel cannot help but drop.    These are the articles that will have the most influence on  the NSP's future activities. There is a strong probability that  political involvement being a crime will restrict intelligence  collection and that the wrongful exercise of authority is  dealing a psychological blow to anti-Communist investigations,  worry NSP sources.    These are the words of special assistant Cho Man-hu:    "The NSP must not be involved in politics. However,  intelligence collection is a normal NSP activity. The NSP is  being vilified for the wrongs of past governments, but after  taking office, Director Kim Tok has prohibited NSP personnel  from entering other organizations and has eliminated bureaus  associated with politics. With the opportunity provided by the  birth of the civilian government, a mood is forming centered  around Director Kim Tok, in which NSP personnel want to do  right. We led the revision of the NSP Law as well. But many are  secretly disappointed because of the penal regulations. However,  the NSP should not be a burden to the nation or the president.  So, although unsatisfactory, I believe we have no choice but to  accept it. I'm sorry for our personnel, but the only words we  have to give them concern principle: `Please work with a sense  of mission, with a feeling of being reborn.'"    Another area to be influenced every bit as much as  intelligence collection is anti-Communist investigations. The  newly created regulations on the wrongful exercise of authority  prohibit illegal arrest and confinement and call for confinement  of up to seven years for the violation of this. For cases in  which a person was not allowed to see a lawyer, the notification  of arrest was not made, or a person was prevented from seeing  family, the regulations call for confinement of up to one year  or a 5-million-won fine.    One anti-Communist investigator explained the difficulty of  anti-Communist investigations this way:    "The persons arrested by the NSP are high-level, hard-core  criminals. Because they generally use assumed names, even if  they are arrested, usually only their faces and the fact of  their crimes is known, not their names and addresses. A long  time is required just to verify their identities, such as taking  finger prints and sending them to the police to learn their  names. This is why aliases rather than true names are used in  the espionage incidents reported by the NSP. According to the  revised NSP Law, notification of arrest must be made immediately  and violations are punished by up to a one year's confinement.  How is it possible to notify someone when you don't know the  arrested person's name or address?    "It also calls for punishment if a subject's right to see a  lawyer and family is infringed. If a lawyer or family member  comes to visit, but just leaves after waiting for a while and  then accuses the investigator in charge of not allowing them to  visit, an investigation into the matter is neglected while the  investigator is up till dawn being accused and charged. If we  permit a subject to see a lawyer without any justifiable reason,  regardless of the time, we can't even carry out an investigation  properly. It is my understanding that in general criminal  investigations as well there are times when the subject is not  permitted to see a lawyer. I believe there is a problem with  indiscriminately making public an investigation into political  offenses such as espionage."    There is a high probability that the revised NSP Law will  limit the activity of NSP personnel due to the strictness of its  penalties, he says. However, just because the NSP-Law Revision  Bill passed the National Assembly does not mean that the NSP  will change right away. It must be followed by the revision of  associated legislation, such as the National Assembly Law, for  establishing an Intelligence Committee and must afterward be  officially announced by the government to have authority.    "Having been dragged out seven years, beginning in 1987 when  the opposition had a majority in the National Assembly, we  actually feel unencumbered now that the NSP Law has finally come  to an end," react some NSP personnel to the NSP-Law revision,  "We hope the NSP will no longer be brought up by the political  sector as an object of denunciation."    How will the NSP change in the future?    "With the improvement of its manpower-management system, the  specialization of its staff, and the reform of its operations to  make them scientific as core tasks, we will directly link all  the NSP's capabilities with the national interests and security,  developing the NSP into an institution of the people," said  special aid Cho Man-hu, "We will do our best to develop the NSP  into an organization which is loved by the people and which  concerns itself with the national interests, into an advanced  intelligence agency living and breathing among the people."</p>

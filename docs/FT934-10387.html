			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Raglan back in profit and calls for Pounds 19m RAGLAN Property Trust yesterday called for Pounds 19.3m net via a 2-for-1 rights issue and also reported a swing from losses of Pounds 1.47m to profits of Pounds 89,000 pre-tax for the six months to end-September. The proceeds of the issue will enable Raglan to acquire selective investment properties 'on attractive terms'. It is currently negotiating the acquisition of a number of commercial property portfolios which, if completed, would have an aggregate cost of Pounds 31m. A contract for the purchase of one of these portfolios, comprising 16 shops and five offices, is expected to be exchanged before the end of the year at a cost of Pounds 12m. The group recently agreed to acquire a 150-year leasehold interest in the existing Castle Centre shopping precinct in Banbury, near Oxford, from Cherwell district council. The stake will entitle Raglan to 39.5 per cent of the total rents received from tenants in the centre. The shopping precinct is located immediately adjacent to land and property that Raglan proposes to develop. Some Pounds 8.5m of the money being raised has been earmarked to acquire the interest in the Castle Centre and to fund Raglan's development proposals in Banbury over the next two years. The rights issue, which is being underwritten by NM Rothschild, is of 62.45m new ordinary shares at 32p per share. The existing shares slipped 2p yesterday to 45p. Brokers to the issue are Cazenove &amp; Co. Turnover for the opening half year totalled Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 187,000). Interest charges were cut from Pounds 337,000 to Pounds 67,000 and earnings per share emerged at 0.3p (losses of Pounds 20.91p). Mr Charles Cecil, the chairman, said the return to profitability was a 'welcome sign that the plans put in place at the time of the restructuring in April were beginning to bear fruit'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aziz Filho and Daniella Sholl] </F>   [Text] The days of [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel  Brizola's silence are numbered. In his second race for  president of the Republic, Brizola is preparing himself to leave  the governorship on 2 April and take up what he describes as  "the most overwhelming discourse since 1964." Interviewed by  JORNAL DO BRASIL, Brizola for the first time acknowledged that  he is a candidate, admitted the PDT's [Democratic Labor Party]  isolation in the field of national political alliances, and  explained that his reserve is part of a strategy: "My candidacy  represents a duty to the party. We will not follow the  conventional rules. We will seek to unite all Brazilians  against everything there is."    Brizola added: "I even believe it will be possible for a  candidate to challenge everything, win in an unconventional way,  and still achieve a majority in Congress. So you can see what  kind of plans I am making." In Brizola's opinion, "the people  united, without politicians," could repeat the upset victory of  the presidential system during the plebiscite, when most party  leaderships favored a parliamentary system. Brizola thinks that  for the PDT to run with its own candidate as a third option --  after the PT [Workers Party] and the anti-PT faction -- it is  more important to assemble "strong and austere tickets in all  states" than to seek leadership alliances.    The governor said that the economic plan and the movement  around Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy have encouraged him  to run and show voters that everything "is just one more  manipulation of the economy for electoral purposes."    "The plan did not attack the most important causes of  inflation, the financial system or banks, which need to be  better supervised," Brizola attacked, giving advance notice of  one of his hottest campaign issues. He denied any concern over  the high rejection rate of a Brizola government. "The stronger  the wind, the higher the eagle can fly," he answers.    At 72 and in his third term as governor, Brizola still  believes he can run as a candidate of renewal. He bets that  this time the people will learn about and compare the  candidate's backgrounds. "Brazil is like a ship that has sprung  a leak and cannot be handled by an inexperienced sailor,"  Brizola said.    "In order to overcome the crisis we need renewal, the  promotion of new people. That can be accomplished only by a  candidate from outside, a candidate who is not moving in the  contaminated climate of politicians of which the people are  tired," the governor said, trying to justify his isolation.    He was discouraged about the possibility of getting support  from the small PC-B [Communist Party of Brazil] and the PSB  [Brazilian Socialist Party] of Miguel Arraes, with which the PDT  is trying to form an alliance. "We would like that, but it  seems that the PC-B will join the PT. Arraes is also leaning  that way to strengthen his candidacy in Pernambuco." Brizola  said he was not surprised. He compared himself with Getulio  Vargas, recalling that "Communists were against Vargas in 1954  but changed their minds following his suicide, when they saw the  people burning communist newspapers and attacking the  multinationals."    Brizola characterized his candidacy as "a duty to the party"  and promised to dedicate more time to it than he did 1989. "In  1989 I did not run to win. It was just training." Brizola  ruled out the possibility of joining the PT at some point during  the presidential campaign. He treated Lula [Luis Inacio Lula da  Silva] with the virulence of a person attacking his number one  enemy.    "The euphoria of the past elections did not permit us to see  that neither one of the two candidates were fit to rule. I will  tell Lula to his face, the first time I see him, that only an  ignorant person would vote for someone who does not have the  minimum administrative experience, and who has spent four years  without working, traveling at the party's expense. Why doesn't  he go back to his lathe? Perhaps he finds that demeaning,"  Brizola fired. Asked about his activities during the period he  was out of public office, between 1986 and 1990, he said that he  spent that time working as "a rural producer" at his Uruguayan  ranch.    If Lula is his number one enemy, Fernando Henrique Cardoso  seems to be number two. Brizola characterized the minister's  possible presidential candidacy as "a color balloon, not of the  kind that people let go of during the Sao Joao celebration, but  of the kind that only exist on television screens." "Cardoso is  a toucan [nickname for Cardoso's party, the Brazilian Social  Democracy Party, PSDB] with a lot of feathers, a ballroom bird  who will not withstand the campaign heat."</p>

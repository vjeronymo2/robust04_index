			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambia to decide on ZCCM privatisation by end of year THE Zambian government is likely to make a decision by the end of the year about privatising Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the company that dominates the country's economy. Mr Mathias Mpande, deputy minister of mines, confirmed that a German company contracted to investigate and comment on the privatisation options for ZCCM was scheduled to report by October or November. 'Government should then be able to make a decision by the end of the year,' he said. Mr Mpande said that privatising ZCCM had become urgent because of the economic need to attract foreign investment. In particular, a decision would have to be made by early next year on the financing of the Konkola deep mine in the north of the copper belt. That project, which will probably cost about USDollars 550m, must proceed if the company is to achieve a sustainable annual production level of 450,000-500,000 tonnes of copper. It will have to be equity-funded because ZCCM and the Zambian government already have high debt burdens. ZCCM has a debt of about Dollars 700m. Mr Mpande suggested that a sell-off in stages was more likely than a one-off auction as the former course would allow for an increased number of shareholders and thus enhance the acceptability of 'corporate capitalism'. He said that putting the whole of ZCCM into private hands was a sensitive issue as the company accounted for more than 90 per cent of the country's export earnings and was regarded as a 'national treasure'. Foreign investors also favour the government keeping a stake, he added. Mr Mpande confirmed that South African mining group Anglo American was at the front of the queue for a stake in a privatised ZCCM. He described the company as 'very, very keen' and he said discussions had taken place nearly every month. Given the large stake of 27.3 per cent that Anglo already holds in ZCCM, Mr Mpande said 'it would not be right for them to be outplayed by a newcomer'. He predicted that Anglo would increase its stake to the limits of its equity capacity but that it would not be able to go it alone. 'Other important mining companies should be involved,' he said. Dismissing speculation that some mining houses might have blotted their copybooks by being too closely involved with the discredited Kaunda government, Mr Mpande said: 'What will dictate who gets what will be their offer and strategic plans, rather than their past dalliances.'</p>

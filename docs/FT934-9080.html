			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Exchange head considers overhaul ANY OF the London Stock Exchange's functions may be modified or abandoned after Mr Michael Lawrence, the newly-named chief executive of the stock exchange, takes up his duties next February. 'I don't see that there is anything that is fixed in stone. There are no no-go areas,' Mr Lawrence, said yesterday. Mr Lawrence, finance director at Prudential, the UK's largest life insurance company, and a former partner at accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, who is to review the exchange's activities once in place, said he had been attracted to his new job because of the widespread view that the role of the exchange needed to change. He refused to offer a view about some of the most difficult issues facing the exchange, such as whether it should own and operate its own settlement system, such as the proposed Pounds 57m successor to its SEAQ price display mechanism. 'I want to start with a white sheet,' he said. The only criterion, he said, was that the exchange should remain the central market in the UK for equity trading. Mr Lawrence spelled out what he sees as the role for the new chairman who will succeed Sir Andrew Hugh Smith next November. The new chairman - whose identity is known to Mr Lawrence but not yet announced - will be a part-time employee who will act largely as ambassador for the exchange in the City and in foreign markets. 'I see a major role in recasting the vision for the exchange and carrying that vision to the City at large,' he said. He and other exchange officials would influence the development of that vision although his own duties would focus on operational matters. As finance director for a large company and chairman of the 100 Group of Finance Directors Mr Lawrence is thought to be much closer to the interests of the companies whose shares are traded on the exchange than his predecessor, Mr Peter Rawlins. Also, he is thought likely to be more sensitive to the interests of investors than the present senior management of the exchange. Mr Lawrence does not consider himself a City outsider but concedes that he has not worked in a dealing room. His background is already prompting some expressions of concern from market-makers. On said: 'Listed companies and institutional investors are basically our clients. If he starts getting in the way it's going to go wrong.' Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

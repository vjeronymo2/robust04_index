			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Midlands Electricity to shed 1,200 jobs Midlands Electricity is to shed 1,200 jobs in the next three years as part of a restruct-uring aimed at cutting costs by more than Pounds 30m a year. The cutbacks of more than a fifth of the core business's 5,300 workforce are the latest in a series among electricity companies following a recent regulatory review. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer spokesman, demanded a parliamentary inquiry into the regional electricity companies. 'The companies are out of control,' he said. 'Workers and customers are being made to pay for soaring profits.' Midlands' announcements follows similar moves at Norweb, also shedding 1,200 jobs and Manweb, where 500 are going. Mr Bryan Townsend, Midlands chairman, said he expected the company to be able to increase dividend payments by a minimum of 5 to 6 per cent in real terms for the five-year duration of the regulatory regime. Some 700 of the job losses will result from the replacement of six geographic operating division by four next April and changes in the company's headquarters functions. Midlands intends to achieve the cuts through voluntary means. Over the past three years manpower has fallen by 900. Unlike Manweb, Midlands is not making any additional financial provision for the restructuring. The regulatory review resulted in a 14 per cent cut in Midlands' allow-able charges from next April. However Midlands is one of the few companies which does not charge the full allowable amount in the current year. As a result, it says, the initial reduction in regulated income in 1995/96 will be some Pounds 20m, a nominal reduction of 6.1 per cent.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Fears of forestry sell-off sparked THE government was accused yesterday of planning to privatise the Forestry Commission after Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, who is also responsible for the commission, revealed that he had set up a committee 'to review options for the ownership and management of Forestry Commission woodlands'. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's shadow environmental protection secretary, said privatisation of the commission's woodland would mean less public access and diminish the drive for conservation. Mr Lang said in a Commons written answer that a committee of officials from the Treasury, Ministry of Agriculture, Welsh Office and the Environment Department under the chairmanship of the Scottish Office was also reviewing the effectiveness of forestry investment incentives. The commission is the biggest landowner in Britain, possessing 1.14m hectares or 5 per cent of the land area of the UK.</p>

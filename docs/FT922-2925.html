The May consumer price index, which indicated that prices are increasing very modestly, was welcome news to a market which has been battered this week by a sharp drop in April's consumer borrowing and unexpectedly weak retail sales for May. Both stock and bond markets rallied in the morning following the release of the consumer price index, which rose 0.1 per cent, or 0.2 per cent excluding food and energy prices. Analysts had expected an increase of about 0.3 per cent. The report sparked speculation that might encourage the Federal Reserve might ease monetary policy. In the bond market, the treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was quoted 9/32 higher at 101 21/32 , to yield 7.88 per cent in late trading.

The transportation sector regained some of its recent losses, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average climbing 14.39 to 1,346.23. AMR, parent of American Airlines, firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 63 3/4 , Delta Air Lines rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 and United Airlines was Dollars 1 1/2 higher at Dollars 117 1/4 .

Salomon added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 , Merrill Lynch rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 and Morgan Stanley held steady at Dollars 48 5/8 . In Nasdaq trading, shares in Ross Cosmetics tumbled Dollars 9 1/2 to Dollars 5, after the company said that it was the subject of an informal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.

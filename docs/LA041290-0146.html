			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARINERS LEARN LESSON THE HARD WAY;  </P> <P> NO-HITTER: THEY SAW LANGSTON PITCH BEFORE, BUT NEVER FROM THIS ANGLE.  </P> <P> Harold Reynolds was the first Seattle Mariner to bat against Mark Langston.  </P> <P> On May 21, he stood behind Langston at second base in a game against New York,  a teammate in Langston's final game as a Mariner.  </P> <P> He was no teammate Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "He threw that first pitch, it was probably the hardest ball I've ever seen in  my life from a left-hander," Reynolds said. "The next one was even harder. You  don't see that when you're playing behind a guy."  </P> <P> Langston began his career as an Angel by throwing four consecutive balls to  Reynolds, sending him to first. It did not seem a debut to merit $16 million.  </P> <P> Then he didn't allow a hit over seven innings, combining with Mike Witt on a  no-hitter.  </P> <P> "He threw the ball good, good stuff, that was evident," Reynolds said. "It felt  like once they started giving him the high strike he was hard to hit. He  pitched a great game. I knew once he settled down he'd be all right."  </P> <P> It was different from playing behind Langston.  </P> <P> "You play behind a guy, you don't face him," Reynolds said. "The only advantage  I felt I had was on the bases. I knew his moves. He was on. He pitched a great  game. He's one of the best. He's the best left-hander I've ever faced."  </P> <P> They were friends and teammates, but there was no joy in the Mariner clubhouse  after the 1-0 loss to the Angels.  </P> <P> Is it possible, Reynolds was asked, to be happy for Langston?  </P> <P> "No," he said. "He pitched a great game. That's good for him. I wish we'd worn  him out, actually . . . I don't think he's worried about how we feel about it.  We'll get him again."  </P> <P> Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre was wearing a stern face.  </P> <P> "Mark threw good," he said. "He had a good hard slider. . . . When he needed to  get the out, he got it. . . . On the whole, the only thing I feel upset about,  not upset, disappointed, is we had great pitching ourselves. Good pitching on  both sides. Unfortunately, it would have taken a no-hitter to beat them."  </P> <P> Only the Angels had one.  </P> <P> "He was on," Reynolds said. "What can I say? We knew he would be."  </P> <P> They knew he would be on, but that didn't make it easier.  </P> <P> "He threw a no-hitter, man," Lefebvre said. "I don't give a . . . if he's  throwing power or not. Even a no-hitter isn't hard to swallow. Losing 1-0 is  hard to swallow."  </P> <P> There was nothing they could do.  </P> <P> ANGEL NO-HITTERS  </P> <P> No-hitters thrown by Angel pitchers:  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.66IN:3.65IN:2.11IN:1.67IN:2.99IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Date  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Pitcher(s)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Opponent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Score  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Site  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> May 5, 1962  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bo Belinsky  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Orioles  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dodger Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> July 3, 1970  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Clyde Wright  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Athletics  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anaheim Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> May 15, 1973  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nolan Ryan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Royals  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Royals Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> July 15, 1973  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nolan Ryan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tigers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tiger Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sept. 28, 1974  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nolan Ryan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Twins  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anaheim Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> June 1, 1975  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nolan Ryan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Orioles  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anaheim Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sept. 30, 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mike Witt  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rangers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Arlington Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> April 11, 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mark Langston/Mike Witt  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mariners  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anaheim Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

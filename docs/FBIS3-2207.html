A top Chinese Government official said the law would be  ready  after it is approved by the National People's Congress this  month.    Foreign trade management will be one of the major topics of  the Congress, which convenes in Beijing next week to take up a  wide range of economic issues.    The impending trade law will be the first comprehensive one  passed by China.    "The law will unify the national foreign trade policies and  create a fair environment for competition among all domestic  enterprises," said the official, who spoke on the condition of  anonymity.    Disparities between central and local government policies  regarding foreign trade and investment have turned away many  potential investors from overseas.    In the past local governments have extended tax breaks to  foreign investors that run counter to central regulations and  resulted in considerable losses to the State.    "The foreign trade law will also set the stage for open and  fair competition between domestic companies," the official said.    Many Chinese enterprises are prohibited from dealing in  foreign trade, but the official said foreign trade rights would  be granted to more companies and scientific institutions in the  years to come.    But she did not say if the law would open the way to  extending "national treatment" to foreign investors.    National treatment means applying the same policies to all  enterprises operating in a country or region. Such treatment is  required by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt),  which China is seeking to rejoin.    However, she maintained that foreign investors now enjoy  nearly the same treatment as their Chinese counterparts,  especially in taxation.    China has been drafting the foreign trade law for many  years.  At times policy makers have been split over difficult issues,  like whether to allow individuals to conduct foreign trade .    The official declined to comment on that point.    But one thing is clear: More units will be able to have  foreign trade rights under the macroeconomic control of the  State.    China is ready to allow more scientific institutions to  engage in foreign trade. Conservative statistics show that less  than 10 percent of China's scientific findings have been applied  to making products for export.    Approval of the law is timed to coincide with China's latest  move to unify its two-tier foreign exchange rate system, which  cancels discriminatory measures for different types of  enterprises.    Chinese analysts believed the foreign trade law will hasten  China's re-entry into Gatt.    China will sign the final package of the Uruguay Round of  GATT talks in Morocco in April, paving the way for the country  to rejoin GATT.    In another development, the official said China this year  will revise its regulations guiding the use of foreign  investment.    A national meeting on foreign investment is to end in  Beijing  on Monday.    Reliable sources said that the conference will signal some  changes of policy in favour of foreign investors.    China has been planning to open its service sectors, like  banking and transportation, wider to foreign investors. And it  is ready to invite more foreign investment to develop its vast  inland regions this year.    An unsettling factor is that the bulk of foreign investment  still ends up in the coastal regions, leaving the hinterland  farther and farther behind.</p>

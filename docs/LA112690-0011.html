			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DEAL WITH MEXICO;  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH NEEDS TO BE AS AGGRESSIVE AS VISIONARY PRESIDENT SALINAS  </P> <P> President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will hold their  sixth summit meeting this week in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey.  That's more than a little symbolic. While Mexico City is far bigger, most  Mexicans regard Monterrey as their nation's business capital. And the business  of business has come to dominate the Bush-Salinas agenda.  </P> <P> The two presidents are expected to move closer to launching negotiations on a  free-trade agreement between the United States and Mexico similar to the trade  pact this country signed with Canada in 1988. Formal talks may begin next  spring -- a lot sooner than many observers had expected, but nowhere near soon  enough.  </P> <P> The world is moving into an era in which economic clout is every bit as  important as military might, and superpower status belongs not just to  underdeveloped giants like the Soviet Union and China, but to financially  strong nations like Japan and economic blocs like the European Community. Most  economists agree that if the United States is to remain a world leader in this  new economic order, it will do so only if it remains a major trading nation  that exports as much as it imports. And when it comes to U.S. trade, and the  economic growth that comes with it, there is literally no country more  important to us than Mexico. It's our third-largest trading partner, behind  only Japan and Canada. But those two countries don't send us millions of  unemployed workers as migrants. And the United States is just as important to  Mexico, buying 69% of its exports in 1989.  </P> <P> The remarkable thing about these little-known statistics is that such a  significant level of economic interdependence has come about despite formidable  obstacles. We have been futilely trying to expel illegal migrants from Mexico  for generations. And until recently, Mexico was one of the world's most closed  economies, with most key industries controlled by the state and those in  private hands protected from outside competition. If so much was achieved with  little encouragement from Washington or Mexico City, imagine the economic  potential if both governments started knocking down trade barriers rather than  erecting them. For years, farsighted Mexican and U.S. political leaders could  only dream because the concept was not politically feasible. All of that has  changed under Salinas, who is making over his country almost as radically as  Mikhail Gorbachev is altering the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE ECONOMIC INSTINCT:  </P> <P> Salinas did not come into office two years ago intending to launch a second  Mexican revolution. After taking over from Miguel de la Madrid, Salinas' main  problem was trying to resuscitate a Mexican economy that was stagnant after  almost seven years of recession. A trained economist (who studied at Harvard,  among other places), Salinas knew the only way to get Mexico back to financial  health was to repay the country's massive debt and stimulate new investment by  foreigners and the many Mexicans who hid their money abroad when the economy  took a nose dive.  </P> <P> Initially, Salinas focused on traditional economic remedies for Mexico's  troubles -- he cut government spending, curbed inflation and sold off  state-owned companies. It was a painful austerity program but it did reverse  the downward trends of Mexico's economic indicators. It also helped Salinas  renegotiate Mexico's foreign debt and get more favorable terms from its  creditors. That boosted business confidence in Mexico somewhat, but not enough  to bring in all the new investment Salinas wanted.  </P> <P> During a trip Salinas took earlier this year to generate more European  investment in Mexico, he was jarred to learn that the newly freed nations in  Eastern Europe were drawing investment dollars away from his country. He  realized Mexico would have to find economic help closer to home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE WORTHY RISK:  </P> <P> When he campaigned for Mexico's presidency, Salinas shared the view most other  Mexican political leaders still hold -- that the disparity between the two  economies is so great that Mexico would inevitably get the short end of any  free trade agreement with the United States. He now is convinced this is a risk  worth taking in exchange for all the benefits a free trading system will  produce in North America. Still, when Salinas sent representatives to  Washington to broach the idea of a free trade pact earlier this year, it was an  act of genuine political courage.  </P> <P> That's why it was not just surprising, but disappointing, that his pitch got  such a cool reception from the Bush Administration. U.S. trade officials said  publicly that the process of getting a signed free trade pact with Mexico could  take much longer than the four years of negotiations it took with wealthier  Canada. They reminded the Mexicans about the many economic U.S. interest groups  that would likely raise objections to it, among them industries that compete  with Mexican imports, like steel and textiles, farmers who compete with Mexican  winter crops and labor unions that worry about manufacturing jobs moving south  of the border.  </P> <P> There was irony in a Republican Administration sympathetic to business -- and  dominated by Texans -- suddenly being reluctant to press forward with a free  trade proposal made by Mexico. But as time has passed, it is becoming clear  that unless the opportunity to draw up such an agreement is seized now, the  dream of free trade across the borders of North America could be stillborn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE POLITICAL STORM:  </P> <P> Already the free trade proposal is an issue for Salinas' political opponents in  Mexico, who are hoping to weaken his hold on the federal government in  congressional elections next year. And the longer the idea of a free trade pact  is debated in this country, the easier it will be for interest groups to  nit-pick it to death. This is not to say that none of the objections to the  free trade pact have merit -- only that the potential long-term benefits of  free trade far outweigh the problems.  </P> <P> So, despite the political and diplomatic complications involved, it is possible  to get the trade pact talks moving quickly, and that's where Bush and Salinas  should focus their efforts. To begin with, they should agree to put off the  most sensitive issues -- oil and migration -- for later. Oil is symbolically  important to Mexicans, representing what they consider their national  patrimony. And the idea of a free flow of Mexican workers into this country  drives labor unions crazy. Both are non-starters. And to meet the objections  that the two economies are so different, negotiators should agree to phase in  reduced trade barriers faster in the United States than in Mexico. Even in its  present uneasy condition, the U.S. economy is larger and stronger than Mexico's  and more capable of flexibility on such issues.  </P> <P> As always happens in U.S.-Mexican relations, extraneous issues will manage to  get in the way of trade negotiations -- from drug trafficking to border  incidents to controversies over water rights. People with reasons to scuttle  the trade talks will have lots of opportunities. So it will be up to Bush and  Salinas to stay above the petty frays and remind people on both sides of the  border of the long-term potential of a free trade pact, and why it's so  important. The Canadians certainly share this vision. They have been so pleased  with the free trade pact they signed with the United States that they are  talking about a three-way pact to cover all of North America.  </P> <P> The Canadian proposal raises one troubling philosophical question for those who  believe in free trade. What is to keep a U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact from  becoming an economic bloc? Sort of a Fortress America to compete against rival  blocs in Europe and East Asia, undermining all the work that is being done to  broaden the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That is a danger. But we  are among those, like former U.S.Trade Representative William Brock, who  believe a U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement would enhance GATT. It would serve  as a model to the entire world of how well different nations cooperate when  trade barriers fall.  </P> <P> That's why the time for Bush to go along with Salinas' initiative is now, while  the Mexican president still has time to get it through his increasingly  contentious political system. If not, it may be another generation before a  Mexican political leader shows the vision and courage Salinas has.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MEXICO'S ECONOMIC PARTNERS  </P> <P> President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will meet this  week to discuss negotiations toward an eventual free-trade agreement.

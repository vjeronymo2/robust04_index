			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMATEUR BASEBALL DRAFT;  </P> <P> MARINA'S NEWFIELD SIGNS CONTRACT WITH THE MARINERS  </P> <P> Marc Newfield of Marina High School said on Sunday that he has signed a  contract with the Seattle Mariners, but refused to disclose his signing bonus.  </P> <P> Newfield, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound first baseman, was drafted sixth overall by the  Mariners in the free agent amateur draft last Monday.  </P> <P> Because Newfield is only 17, his parents, Richard and Dee, signed the contract  with him. Players under age 18 must have parents' signatures.  </P> <P> "My mom said she doesn't want me to announce my (signing) bonus yet," Newfield  said. The sixth pick in last year's draft, Paul Coleman of Frankston, Tex.,  received a $160,000 signing bonus from the Cardinals.  </P> <P> Newfield will report next week to the Mariners' rookie camp in Tempe, Ariz. He  said he will likely end up playing for the Mariners' Class-A team in  Bellingham, Wash. He graduates from Marina June 14.  </P> <P> Newfield, who bats right-handed, hit .467 this season with six homers, eight  doubles and 20 runs batted in while helping Marina to the Southern Section 5-A  title.  </P> <P> Mariners' scout Ken Compton also announced the signing of two other local  players -- pitcher John Cummings and second baseman Bret Boone. Both are from  USC.  </P> <P> Cummings, a left-handed pitcher from Canyon High School, was an eighth-round  choice and will report to Bellingham. Boone, a fifth-round pick from El Dorado  High School, will be assigned to Peninsula, Va., Seattle's Class-A team in the  Carolina League.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Steve Kresal contributed to this report.  </P></p>

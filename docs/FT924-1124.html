			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Money Markets: French futures rally A CLUTCH of gloomy economic pointers added weight to the belief that European interest rates will have to come down and ensured a strong performance in currency futures yesterday, writes Peter John. In France, which has been dogged all week by devaluation worries as well as continued commitment by Germany to higher rates, March Pibor recovered a net 12 basis points on the day to close at 90.57. The reversal was partially prompted by disappointing news on French industrial output which rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent in October from September. The output rise sprang from higher energy production caused by cold weather and masked a slump in manufacturing. There was also a feeling that the rise was merely a 'dead cat bounce', a rebound based on nothing more than a technical readjustment of positions and containing no fundamental optimism. In the UK, M4 lending, the broad measure that includes bank and building society lending, had dropped in spite of an expectation that it would increase. The fall demonstrated that present low rates were still not sufficiently enticing to tempt borrowers and gave heart to rate cut enthusiasts. The news was countered by comments from UK chancellor Mr Norman Lamont pledging his support to the status quo. Short sterling's gain to 93.41 was cut back to a net rise of 3 to 93.38, which was further eroded in after-hours trading. Volume was thin with only 10,000 lots recorded compared with 20,000 in the March Pibor and a similar amount in the March Euromark contract, which firmed five basis points to 92.09. Germany has been vociferous in its commitment to clinging to its high interest rates but most economists are convinced that the perilous state of the West German economy makes devaluation inevitable early next year. Bank of England operations were more relaxed yesterday. The clearers, which have been unwilling to take up offers of assistance which would upset the year end balance sheet, were more responsive. The central bank forecast a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.55bn. The Bank provided early assistance of Pounds 569m, morning assistance of Pounds 378m and afternoon help of Pounds 465m. Finally, it gave about Pounds 170m of late assistance bringing total help for the day to Pounds 1.582bn.</p>

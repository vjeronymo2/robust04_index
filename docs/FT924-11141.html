			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / More EC funding for software UK PROJECTS winning funding from the European Community increased strongly this year as a result of a Department of Trade and Industry initiative on R&amp;D in computer integrated software. The success of projects involving UK groups in winning EC funding highlights the significant difference government backing can make in the growth of a particular industry. Out of 235 proposals that were submitted to the EC's European Strategic Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology (Esprit) III programme on computer integrated manufacture and engineering (Cime), 14 projects led by UK organisations and 33 projects involving UK participants were awarded funds by the programme.</p>

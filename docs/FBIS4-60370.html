			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Amira Segev] </F>   [Text] Time and time again Likud Chairman Binyamin  Netanyahu has been rescued by current events from the need to  directly respond to the harsh criticism leveled by his party  associates. It happened against last week.    In retrospective, the assault on Netanyahu seems to be a  well-planned military operation. True to the routine he repeats  every two to three months, Ari'el Sharon tried to check the  party's pulse by launching a direct assault on Netanyahu in a  Qol Yisra'el interview, in which he charged Netanyahu with  failing to lead the Likud as a militant opposition. Sharon's  remarks were carried prominently on two newscasts, but were  forgotten as soon as the unofficial tape of 'Arafat's  Johannesburg remarks arrived. Another item that drowned in the  ocean of reactions to 'Arafat's declarations was the story of an  anti-Netanyahu mutiny which almost broke out in the Likud after  Netanyahu blatantly left the Knesset plenum during the vote on  the peace plan; this story was exposed one week after the fact.    The following day, Sharon exposed "the establishment of the  first organized group since the primaries seeking to replace the  Likud chairman." Sharon said: "Together with several  colleagues, I am planning moves designed to establish a more  appropriate Likud leadership soon."    The following day the level of the Sharon-David Levi talks  rose from tete-a-tetes in the Knesset members' [MK's] cafeteria  to official meetings in Tel Aviv. Political correspondents were  notified of a meeting after it took place, but the communication  came with the abject denials of David Levi -- who has been  persistently refusing to be interviewed on the Netanyahu subject  -- and with an evasive denial delivered on behalf of "Sharon's  confidants" (a quick poll conducted among Likud MK's did not  reveal a single name which could fit in this category). The  denial maintained that the conversation dealt merely with  political issues and their future repercussions. Since a lethal  terrorist attack took place on the day after the meeting, the  matter petered out again.    "All these events," Netanyahu says, "are an attempt by a few  frustrated party activists and a few bored journalists to make  headlines. It is not serious."    [Segev] Are you satisfied with your standing in the Likud  then?    [Netanyahu] Satisfied? Satisfied is not the right term. I  am not worried. [end Netanyahu]    About a month ago Netanyahu asked YEDI'OT AHARONOT for an  interview in order to publicly apologize to David Levi for  having accused him in the famous tape affair. As will be  remembered, Levi's reaction was: "Too little. Too late. He  should apologize to the entire nation." "Netanyahu is acting  out of the depths of history," senior Likud officials  rhapsodized off the record.    Limor Livnat, formerly from Sharon's entourage and  currently one of the three MK's officially identified with  Netanyahu, says Netanyahu is preoccupied with planning, not with  history. "Netanyahu wanted to show the Likud voters that he was  taking action, that he was trying to unite the ranks, and if he  fails, everyone should know who is to blame," she says. The  same explanation lies at the foundation of this week's  establishment of the political Likud forum, to which ten MK's,  including Sharon and Levi, were invited. A party spokesman  says: "Now everyone will see who does not want the Likud to  function properly." Sharon and Levi did not come to the forum  meeting.    "There is no serious activity against Netanyahu," Me'ir  Shitrit, Dan Meridor, Beni Begin, Limor Livnat, David Magen,  Moshe Qatzav, Mikha'el Eytan, and Ehud Olmert say. None of them  is able to name a single person capable of mustering a  75-percent Central Committee majority, which is required for any  step from amending the Likud constitution and deciding to hold a  convention more than once every four years, down to a decision  to repeat the primaries.    One of these MK's says: "Netanyahu has exhausted the early  enthusiasm with his election, and he has most likely established  his standing until after the next elections in two and a half  years. Although two and a half years are a long time in  politics, I do not expect Likud figures with contrasting  interests to unite, not even to topple Bibi Netanyahu --  although some of them truly believe this is the most dire need  of the hour."    Thus, there is apparently no anti-Netanyahu activity at the  moment, but the intensity of the charges against him -- voiced  by the radical right wing in and outside the party, by moderate  party members, and even by his own people -- is growing.  Radical Likud figures, such as Ari'el Sharon and Dov Shilansky,  accuse him of sloppy action against the government peace moves  and of relegating the struggle over the integrity of Eretz  Yisra'el to the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea,  Samaria, and Gaza. Central Committee members, such as Meridor,  Begin, and Shitrit, claim that Netanyahu is the victim of  squabbles between Yehoshu'a Matza and Tzahi Hanegbi, who are  competing over proximity to him and are provoking him, with the  assistance of his close aide Yvette Liberman, to extravagant  proclamations in the style of Ari'el Sharon and Rehav'am Ze'evi.  Begin and Meridor, for instance, refuse to attend mass  right-wing demonstrations and to fly slogans such as the  "Treason Government" and "Rabin Is a Traitor." The two men do  not disguise their demand that the Likud action follow its own  course of action, rather than toe the line with Ze'evi.    Meridor refuses to comment on frictions in the Likud in  general and Netanyahu's standing in particular. Begin, on the  other hand, issues temperate statements about Likud unity and  the need to back the elected leader. Shitrit, on his part,  claims that Netanyahu's belligerent, unbridled allusions to the  peace process "removed the Likud from the public debate on the  issue and made the party totally irrelevant in this context. If  Rabin achieves a peace package including Syria and Jordan before  the elections, the Likud, as it is now, will be unable to  survive. Today the party is paralyzed. There is a feeling that  it is a one man's party, and there is no sense of togetherness.    "Despite that," Shitrit says, "I will not lend my hand to  any  move seeking to unseat Bibi. He is the man until the next  Knesset elections. Until then, we must help him to succeed,  because his success is the success of the Likud."    The anti-Netanyahu arguments recently heard in his own camp  stem from his undermined public image. Netanyahu likes American  methods, and public opinion polls are his beacon. And the  latest polls -- one of which was published last Friday -- show  that his popularity is waning. "If this is the situation," one  of the most prominent Likud headquarters functionaries says,  "perhaps he is really not the man who will bring the Likud back  to power. He attracted great support and was elected by a vast  majority. If he is doing so badly in the polls, and the polls  are what matters, then perhaps we made a mistake."    Several weeks ago, the Channel 2 Television Network prepared  a report marking Netanyahu's first year in office. Many Likud  MK's, including Shitrit, Sharon, Levi, Qatzav, Meridor, Begin,  Nisim, and Magen were invited for an interview. The only one  who came was Yitzhaq Shamir. "I do not attach great importance  to talk against Bibi Netanyahu," the former prime minister said  in that report. "Opposition and subversion existed during  Begin's and my time, too. The elected chairman should focus only  on vital issues." Shamir refused to answer a question on how he  explains the fact that barring him, no one agreed to make  complimentary remarks about Netanyahu.    Meridor refuses to comment on frictions in the Likud in  general and Netanyahu's standing in particular. Begin, on the  other hand, issues temperate statements about Likud unity and  the need to back the elected leader. Shitrit, on his part,  claims that Netanyahu's belligerent, unbridled allusions to the  peace process "removed the Likud from the public debate on the  issue and made the party totally irrelevant in this context.

Several weeks ago, the Channel 2 Television Network prepared  a report marking Netanyahu's first year in office. Many Likud  MK's, including Shitrit, Sharon, Levi, Qatzav, Meridor, Begin,  Nisim, and Magen were invited for an interview. The only one  who came was Yitzhaq Shamir. "I do not attach great importance  to talk against Bibi Netanyahu," the former prime minister said  in that report. "Opposition and subversion existed during  Begin's and my time, too. The elected chairman should focus only  on vital issues." Shamir refused to answer a question on how he  explains the fact that barring him, no one agreed to make  complimentary remarks about Netanyahu.    Even if there is no organized opposition to Netanyahu  within the Likud, there are more than enough initiatives which  could be construed that way. Since last November, MK David  Magen (a former Sharon follower) has been promoting the notion  of Dan Meridor as leader of the Likud, trying to summon a party  convention in 1995, and calling for the reelection of officials  at all levels.    Meridor categorically denies being involved. "I did not ask  or initiate anything," he said. "It was the initiative of  Magen, and I believe, also of Ya'aqov Verdugo. I asked them to  get me out of it at once. At the moment, I am not running. In  due course, if the matter comes up I may consider it." And what  about Magen's initiative to summon a party convention? "He has  never discussed the issue with me," Meridor says. A political  correspondent says that Magen recently told him: "Things will  be interesting in the summer. You had better be prepared for  the summer."    [Segev] MK Magen, what did you have in mind?    [Magen] What I had in mind is that my efforts to summon a  party convention would be demonstrated in the summer. Politics  is too dynamic an art to have it reassessed only once every four  years. The Likud should not become fossilized, and all its  levels should be put up for reelection every two years.    [Segev] Did you officially raise this initiative? Has  Netanyahu reacted to it?    [Magen] Not yet. I am now working on the issue, so far  without results. I cannot yet demand it officially. Also, I do  not know what Netanyahu's reaction was to what he has already  heard.    [Segev] Does it have to do with your initiative to promote  Dan Meridor as leader of the party?    [Magen] I have never said I had such an initiative.    [Segev] So, you do not have such an initiative?    [Magen] I am only saying that I have not yet raised it  anywhere.    [Segev] Your initiative to summon a party convention is  perceived as a move against the chairman of the Likud.    [Magen] My effort is positive, not negative. Any other  comment will only harm my initiative, which I consider very  important.    [Segev] Do you have supporters?    [Magen] I do not operate in a vacuum.    [Segev] How do you operate?    [Magen] I use persuasion. I persuade people in key  positions in our party branches. I hope we will manage to  advance the idea. [end Magen]    "One convention more, one convention less," Binyamin  Netanyahu responds, "what difference will it make?"    [Segev] Even with the candidacy of Dan Meridor--who overtly  opposed your move to stalk out of the Knesset plenum during the  vote on the peace agreement--hanging in the background?    [Netanyahu] If that is what you call "opposing me," then it  is not serious. My relations with Dan are excellent, and this  is not the first time that he has voiced views opposed to mine,  especially on this issue. [end Netanyahu]    The Likud's failure in the Histadrut labor federation  elections did not contribute to Netanyahu's position. He took a  lot of criticism on the issue, among others from Limor Livnat,  who is considered a follower. "Whatever I said after the  failure I also told him to his face, loud and clear," says  Livnat.    [Segev] Will you second Magen's initiative?    [Livnat] I supported Beni Begin's move to have an additional  round of primaries before the Knesset elections. The Likud  Central Committee's decision not to have such a round remains in  effect, and as far as I am concerned, this is the end of the  story.    [Segev] And you have no problem with it?    [Livnat] Anybody planning a move against Bibi Netanyahu will  be damaging the Likud. That does not prevent me from leveling  criticism or make me automatically agree to everything. On the  Histadrut elections Bibi made a mistake, and I told him as much.  This does not mean that I will lend a hand to rebellion and  defiance. No way.    [Segev] Does the Likud have an alternative to Bibi  Netanyahu?    [Livnat] He was only chosen a year ago. What's the big rush  to throw the party into a frenzy? I keep hearing about absurd  initiatives, such as to bring back Moshe Arens, the man who got  up and left the Likud one minute after it was beaten. People  who have not come to terms with their defeat in the primaries  feel frustrated and resentful, by way of "if we go down, we will  take you down with us."    [Segev] How is the party dealing with this? Is it up in  arms over it?    [Livnat] You could say it does not make life easy. [end  Livnat]    Ehud Olmert is also opposed to coming out against Netanyahu.  "I am against any action which might harm Bibi," says Olmert.  "He was elected, period. Such actions create a self-fulfilling  prophecy. People predict his downfall, initiate moves to bring  it about, and when they succeed they say: We told you so, he is  on his way out."    Says a senior Likud official off the record: "Constant  subversion by these two lesser players against the head of the  pyramid has become chronic. They did the same to Shamir and  Begin. Magen joined them about six months ago; they embraced  Shitrit's harsh criticism of Netanyahu and accorded a measure of  certain elegance to the whole affair. All the rest is  constructive and legitimate criticism. As far as Bibi is  concerned, the broader the forum the larger the support for him.  His lowest support is in the Knesset, and his broadest is among  the Likud's 180,000 registered voters. Levi and Sharon have no  support from the ranks, and this was confirmed in all recent  confrontations. Sharon has no followers at all, while among  Levi's followers I have heard grumbling that because of his pet  peeves they were left behind and were not given any jobs."    "I do not wish to discuss the issue of Bibi Netanyahu at  all," David Levi says.    [Segev] So, what was the reason for the meetings with  Sharon?    [Levi] Where are those meetings being held? In the  cafeteria here, right?    [Segev] So, are you doing it to anger everybody?    Levi laughs. "You said it."</p>

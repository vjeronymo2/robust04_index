			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Job battle marked by personality conflicts: Robert Graham in Rome charts the course of a bitter five-month wrangle that has inflicted deep wounds on both sides The conflict between Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government and the Bank of Italy over nominating a new director-general for the central bank has left only losers. The dispute was resolved yesterday with the naming of Mr Vincenzo Desario, the junior of the two deputy directors, to take over the second most important post in the Bank of Italy. But the wounds run so deep on both sides they may not heal within the life of the current administration. The five-month long wrangle over the appointment - with the issue of the bank's autonomy at stake - has also damaged Italy's credibility in the financial markets. When a European government falls out with the central bank over the composition of the latter's key directorate, it looks as though serious differences of economic and monetary policy are at issue. These differences do exist. In an economy experiencing a strong recovery and with a huge public debt, the Berlusconi government wants interest rates to fall; the Bank of Italy is concerned to protect the currency and hold down inflation. The government was critical of a decision by Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor, to raise the discount rate in mid-August by half a percentage point, and was furious he observed his governor's charter to the letter, informing of the move only when it was decided. However, conflicts of personality have played a big role in this case as Mr Fazio has fought to preserve the bank's autonomy with the choice of an internal candidate. The seeds of disagreement were sown in April 1993 when Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi agreed to leave the governorship of the bank to become prime minister. Having been governor since 1979, he had clear ideas about the succession, choosing Mr Fazio, then the senior of the two deputy directors. Mr Lamberto Dini, director-general and the natural hierarchical choice, was overlooked. No explanation was ever given for ignoring Mr Dini, who was a better known international central banker. But within the bank and among Italy's banking community, it was no secret that Mr Ciampi and Mr Dini had an awkward relationship. Mr Dini was considered too close to the old Christian Democrat party, including former premier Giulio Andreotti, whose contact with Mr Ciampi was frosty at best. The governor and the three other members of the bank's executive directorate are appointed by the body's governing council (composed of the Bank's regional office chairmen). They are then confirmed by the head of state in consultation with the government which formalises the appointments. Mr Fazio was appointed rapidly because of Mr Ciampi's unique position as a former governor and because of his and Mr Fazio's close understanding with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The situation was more complex when Mr Dini became treasury minister in May. He was anxious to have a say in his successor and he was now in an equal if not more powerful role than the man promoted over him a year previously. Mr Berlusconi, the premier, and his ministers could have won sympathy if the appointment had been placed in the context of a much-needed debate on introducing blood to an institution that had become too complacent and inward-looking. Unfortunately, there was no debate, only sniping conducted in the spirit of a vendetta. This immediately took the form of a veto on Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, technically the next in line as senior deputy-director and a highly respected central banker, who had played an important part in pre-Maastricht work on monetary union. However, he was seen as one of the 'Ciampi boys' - closely linked to the former governor and premier - and whose crime in the eyes of the new government was to have identified too much with the left. The government advanced several outside candidates - Mr Rainer Masera, head of Imi, the state-run financial institution being privatised, Mr Mario Draghi, the brilliant director-general of the Treasury, and latterly Mr Paolo Savona, a banker and former industry minister in the Ciampi government. But Mr Fazio insisted the appointment come from within the bank. As early as July, the governor suggested Mr Desario, promoted by Mr Fazio in 1993 to become the fourth member of the directorate, as a compromise candidate. But the stand-off has lasted until now, aggravated by individual members of the right-wing coalition conducting a smear campaign against the Bank of Italy. The government climb-down is partly the result of pressure from leading members of Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, who have argued the dispute was damaging Italy's international credibility. Equally, Mr Berlusconi may well have recognised the conflict is an unnecessary diversion from securing safe passage for the 1995 budget. Those who know the affair well say Mr Desario, whose career at the Bank of Italy has been in banking supervision, is not of the same calibre as the other candidates. They say the Desario promotion gives Mr Fazio a tight grip on monetary policy. But the price may well be that the government pays less attention to the Bank of Italy's counsels, and turns more to Confindustria and the Treasury. The same battle could also repeat itself over a replacement to Mr Desario.</p>

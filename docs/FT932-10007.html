			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: IBS raising Pounds 752,000 via share issue INTERNATIONAL Bioremediation Services, based in the West Midlands but incorporated in Switzerland, is seeking to raise Pounds 752,000 net on the UK capital market through an issue of shares which will be quoted in Vancouver The company, controlled by Mr Artur Haslimann, uses bacterial cultures to break down waste and treat polluted or contaminated land and equipment. It has operating subsidiaries in the UK, France and the US. Griffiths &amp; Lamb, the stockbroker, is placing 2.02m shares at 47 1/2 p each. The Vancouver quotation is to be arranged through the reverse takeover of Hisway Resources, a shell company whose name will be changed to International Bioremediation Services. After the issue and quotation, Mr Haslimann will hold over 60 per cent of the equity, but has immediate access only to 16 per cent. The rest of his holding will be held in escrow, its release to him dependent on meeting performance targets. In the year to last October, IBS suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 131,000 but the offer prospectus forecasts pre-tax profits for the year ended May 1994 of Pounds 220,000 on turnover of Pounds 1m. Funds raised from the issue will be used to bolster IBS's technical base, now dependent on Wolverhampton University, and expand its markets both through licensing agreements and joint ventures and direct sales of its products and expertise. IBS plans eventually to float its US subsidiary on Nasdaq.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ruslan Bodelan, chairman of the Odessa </F> Oblast Council and people's deputy of Ukraine, by Heorhiy  Vorotnyuk, under the rubric "Election 94"; place and date not  given: "The Rights of a Region: Real Rather Than Declaratory.  Ruslan Bodelan, Chairman of the Odessa Oblast Council and  People's Deputy of Ukraine, Shares His Thoughts on This Problem"]    [Text]    [Bodelan] First of all, regions should participate in a  direct and full-fledged manner in drawing up such local budgets  as would meet all the urgent problems of territories. This is a  mandatory condition, because to this day there are so many  dictates and abuses and so many violations of legislation in  effect by the central structures in this area that oblasts,  cities, and rayons face extremely difficult situations time  after time. The last session was also compelled to adopt an  address to the president, the chairman of the Supreme Council,  and the Government of Ukraine proposing that they immediately  take measures in order to ameliorate the financial situation in  the oblast, which the deputies considered critical. After all,  the banks withhold all of the revenues of local budgets without  recourse toward the payment of their debt to the state budget.  The latter is drawn up in keeping with norms which in no way  take into account the needs of territories and in essence push  them across the disaster line. This is how it happens that the  debt of some rural and rayon budgets exceeds the planned annual  level of revenues. Besides, the state structures force local  organs to finance a number of outlays that are not properly  theirs, and later do not defray the losses. At the same time,  outlays on the maintenance of enterprises owned by the state are  not funded from the state budget. These enterprises fail to  settle with the energy supplier enterprises: The debt of the  state budget to such enterprises has already exceeded 500  billion karbovantsy in our oblast. Delays in the payment of  wages to the employees of organizations have become more  frequent; hospitals have no funds in order to feed the patients;  and many other troubles have developed.    Here are all the "attractions" of excessive centralization  for you. Thus, in addition to taking a number of prompt  measures, the oblast council, which is extremely alarmed by this  situation, proposed to the structures of authority of the  country to leave at the disposal of local budgets all receipts  from the tax on the income of citizens and proceeds from the  privatization of municipally owned facilities, as well as no  less than 30 percent of the proceeds from the privatization of  state-owned facilities. We expect the new parliament to  accommodate the territories in consolidating their financial  standing.    I think that regions should have more extensive rights in  setting quotas and issuing licenses for products that are  exported from their territories, as well as in importing  products from neighboring countries. Here is a specific example  for you. It was long the case that a lot of vegetables, fruits,  and berries were shipped to the Odessa region from neighboring  Moldova for processing at the local enterprises. Some of the  finished product was retained by us, the oblast and Ukraine;  some was returned to the suppliers of raw materials to meet  their needs. Everybody was happy. Insurmountable obstacles have  now arisen in the path of such mutually advantageous relations,  and everything has come to a halt. No, we are not at all against  borderland and customs rules applying in our state, but they  should take into account the specifics of relations and the  feasibility of bans or excessively high customs duties. What  happens otherwise? Ukraine fails to receive a considerable  quantity of canned products; we are forced to reduce production  or altogether close down processing enterprises, laying people  off. All of this could be avoided if regions had an opportunity  to regulate such contacts.    In a word, if we want to create an effective structure of  government in the territory of the state, the new Supreme  Council should adopt without delay an appropriate law which  would clearly set forth the powers of councils at all levels and  endow regions with real rights.    [Vorotnyuk] As a people's deputy of Ukraine, are you  personally prepared to introduce some specific proposals in  conjunction with this?    [Bodelan] They have actually already been developed before,  and have been introduced in the "old" parliament. A special  working group of our oblast council is currently carrying on  such work so that the people's deputies from Odessa will be able  to promptly submit an appropriate draft law, to be considered by  the Supreme Council.    [Vorotnyuk] Understandably, the draft law would apply  equally  to all regions of Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Odessa area has its  peculiarities; the oblast council raised a number of issues that  are strictly its own before the structures of authority of the  country. In particular, I mean proposals for conducting an  economic-legal experiment in the oblast and creating free  economic zones. Have there been any genuine results in this  matter?    [Bodelan] The Presidium of the Supreme Council has  considered  our proposals for conducting an experiment that would grant to  the region additional economic rights and in principle approved  them. The proposals have been referred to the Cabinet of  Ministers for the latter to state its point of view. In the  meantime, legislative acts have already been passed which take  into account some of these proposals of ours. It is possible  that decisions of the new parliament and government concerning  the rights of regions will altogether remove the issue of  conducting the experiment from the agenda. If they do not, we  expect that in the future, meeting our requirements with regard  to one oblast, Odessa Oblast, will provide an opportunity to  ascertain the effectiveness of what we propose and to extend its  effect to other regions.    Now about the free economic zone. Some believe that there is  too much talk about it, and too little action. A certain lack of  coordination was indeed a factor at the first stage. Individual  enthusiastic leaders got the-bigger-the-better "disease": They  wanted all of Odessa, and adjacent territories to boot, to be a  free economic zone. Only after the Cabinet of Ministers set up a  special committee to develop the Odessa special economic zone (I  was appointed to head it) and after this committee began  operations did everything come within a realistic framework.  With the use of prominent foreign specialists, we are completing  the development of a draft law on the special economic zone,  which we are certain the government will submit to the Supreme  Council for consideration. It is based on setting up five local  zones in comparatively small territories: in the Odessa,  Ilyichevsk, Southern, and Izmail ports, and at a 200-hectare  site in the vicinity of Odessa where the creation of an  industrial zone is conceivable. This concept has already gained  the support of the government. The European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development took a positive stance regarding  it; it has resolved to provide assistance with investment in  certain projects in the free economic zone. I believe that  following the passage of the law, we will succeed in drawing not  only domestic but also foreign investors into the creation of  free economic zones. It is just that, once again, the oblast  council should have the appropriate authority to do so.    [Vorotnyuk] Well, does the oblast council intend to run the  free economic zone?    [Bodelan] Not directly. However, we propose to set up, under  the oblast council, a coordinating council which, while  reporting to both our oblast Council of People's Deputies and  the Cabinet of Ministers (in line with the authority of both of  these organs), would facilitate the emergence of the free  economic zones, help them to establish relations with investors  and among themselves, and finally be the transmission element  between the local organs of power and the administrations of the  free economic zones. Such a structure will possibly operate only  at the first stage, and later it will be replaced by a more  feasible one.    Therefore, my firm conviction is as follows: While  preserving  and strengthening the most significant elements of  centralization, we should simultaneously create the most  favorable conditions for the development of territories by  granting to them additional rights and powers. I am certain that  by thus playing, so to say, a duet, we will dispense faster with  the critical phenomena that are now besetting us.</p>

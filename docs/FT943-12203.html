			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Speculators lose taste for coffee Coffee futures yesterday suffered a sharp setback in New York and London as selling by disillusioned speculators ran into a lack of buying interest on the eve of the first Brazilian government estimates of the frost damage to next year's crop. In London, the second position robusta contract dropped Dollars 245 to Dollars 3,383 a tonne, leaving it about Dollars 300 above its level just before the second Brazilian frost two weeks ago and 17 per cent below its 8 1/2 -year peak of Dollars 4,085 in the week following that frost. The New York market, which is more driven by speculative interest and trades in arabica, Brazil's primary coffee variety, has seen an even larger retracement of about 25 per cent from its peak of 274 cents a pound on July 13. In afternoon trading yesterday, the September contract was off 13.20 cents at 206.20 cents a pound. The belief is growing that the crop damage will be less than initially thought from the two severe frosts which struck in late June and early July. 'With the benefit of hindsight, a lot of the ideas put around before are now seen as having been too much too soon,' said Mr Robert MacArthur, head of the tropical trader group at Merrill Lynch in London. He said estimates of damage of between 6m and 9m bags to a crop that could have been 25m-30m bags were now widely believed and had been discounted in prices. 'If Brazil only confirms that, it won't be enough to do much to the market. If it's significantly higher, people might be disbelieving.' He added that more physical supplies had come on to the market and coffee roasters and traders had better cover than during the scramble that followed the second frost. ED &amp; F. Man, the London commodity trader, said yesterday that a loss of 6m to 8m bags could mean a crop only a little smaller than this year's harvest of around 24m. GNI, the London brokers, took a similar line. 'We believe that the final crop figure will come in close to 20m bags,' it said in its daily market report. Yesterday's falls, in fairly thin volume, were fuelled by warmer weather during the weekend. Both previous frosts took place at the weekend, and the potential frost season continues until the end of next month. One London trader commented: 'The real problem is that no one is sure where the market should be.' Zimbabwe has lost up to 20 per cent of its expected coffee output of 7,800 tonnes this season because of frost, reports Reuters from Harare.</p>

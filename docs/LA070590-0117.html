			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: PUTTING MONEY ON INCUMBENTS  </P> <P> For the most part, the main congressional political battles in November will be  between the incumbents and the challengers. The smart money is on the  incumbents, who are leading the challengers by odds of 8-to-1.  </P> <P> I visited the training camp of Sen. Sang Froid, who is up for re-election and  has victory written all over him.  </P> <P> I talked to Artie Maytag, the senator's manager.  </P> <P> "Your boy looks good," I told him.  </P> <P> "We're taking this match seriously. We are asking every political action  committee to double their contribution because we're tired of being known as  the 'Filene's Basement' of the Senate."  </P> <P> While we were talking, a man came up and gave Artie a satchel of bills.  </P> <P> "The senator blesses you," Artie told him. Then he explained to me who the man  was:  </P> <P> "He represents the solid waste hubcap industry, and they consider Sang the best  friend they have on the Hill."  </P> <P> "Doesn't the lobbyist even get to go to a fund-raising dinner for that?" I  asked.  </P> <P> "Dinners went out with narrow lapels. Now it's cash on the barrel, and the  donor goes to the cafeteria of his choice. Frankly, even at $1,000-a-plate, the  food was never that good."  </P> <P> A woman in a jogging suit ran by and stuck a check in Artie's pocket.  </P> <P> "She's from the canned halibut industry. The senator chairs all the legislation  on canned fish. I'm glad she gave because that saves me having to buy her  breakfast."  </P> <P> "Do the PACs ever distribute money to the challenger?"  </P> <P> "Why should they? The senator is their man -- the special interests aren't  going to waste their resources on an unknown rookie. This guy coming by now  distributes all the funds for the fruitcake makers of America.  </P> <P> He knows where Sang stands on fruitcake -- so when he dumps his cash in that  waste-paper basket over there, he's betting on Sang making fruitcake the  national dessert of the country."  </P> <P> "The way things are going with the PACs it appears a challenger may never win  an election."  </P> <P> "I wouldn't know about that. My job is to make sure that those people who  expect the senator to do favors for them when he gets elected do right by him  now. You remember Harry Tudoroff, the lobbyist for the bubble-gum workers of  America?"  </P> <P> "I remember him, but I haven't seen him around," I replied.  </P> <P> "The reason you haven't seen him around is because he split his PAC  contributions during the last election between the senator and the challenger,  and we kicked him out of our Boosters' Club. From then on, it was all downhill  for him. When he couldn't even get his picture taken for National Bubble-Gum  Day with Sang Froid, he wound up sleeping on a bench in Lafayette Park."  </P> <P> A Brink's truck drove up and two guards started to unload the money.  </P> <P> Artie said: "That's the savings and loans' contribution. They bring one over  every day hoping the senator will bail them out."  </P> <P> "Will he?"  </P> <P> "The senator has always believed that, while making a few mistakes, the  S&amp;Ls always had their hearts in the right place. They never said 'no' to us  during their good times. So he's not going to turn his back on them now."  </P> <P> "I wish there was some way I could help, but I really don't have any  legislation I want passed."  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter. We take money from honest citizens, too."  </P></p>

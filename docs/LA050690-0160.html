			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> British soccer fans clashed with police and one another in several cities on  the closing day of soccer season, leaving dozens injured and more than 80  people arrested, authorities said.  </P> <P> The worst violence was in the south coast resort town of Bournemouth, where  hometown fans clashed Friday night and Saturday with police and visiting fans  from Leeds.  </P> <P> At least 50 people were arrested and charged with assault, criminal damage or  public order offenses, police said early today. At least 20 people, including  six police officers, were hurt, police said.  </P> <P> In the hours before Saturday's game, 2,000 fans -- many without tickets or with  forged tickets -- began showering police with rocks, bricks and bottles and  threatening Bournemouth players. Police brought in reinforcements from as far  away as London, 95 miles away.  </P> <P> The trouble began the night before the match, when about 100 soccer fans set  fire to Bournemouth's famous pier and smashed windows at a posh shopping  arcade. About 300 others attacked workers and customers at a seaside pub and  tore apart furniture, authorities said.  </P> <P> At Chesterfield, just south of Sheffield, 12 people were taken to the hospital  and others were treated at the stadium after clashes between rival fans and  police. None of the injuries was said to be serious, but there were 30 arrests.  </P></p>

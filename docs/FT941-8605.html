			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong demand helps Navistar stay in the black Strong demand for trucks and diesel engines carried Navistar International into the black for a second consecutive quarter. The Chicago-based manufacturer, formerly known as International Harvester, yesterday revealed net income of Dollars 16m, or 12 cents a share, in the first quarter to the end of January. The result reverses a Dollars 228m deficit in the corresponding first quarter of 1992-93. Excluding the effect of accounting changes, the company realised earnings of Dollars 2m in the year-earlier quarter. Consolidated sales jumped 9 per cent to Dollars 1.14bn, against Dollars 1.04bn last year, as Navistar continued to benefit from the sharpest upturn in the US truck market for over a decade. Retail deliveries for 19,200 heavy and medium-duty trucks and school-bus chassis climbed 14 per cent in the quarter, while shipments of diesel engines were 17 per cent ahead of 1992-93 levels. The results extended a string of encouraging performances which began last spring, when Navistar edged back in profitability after 10 consecutive quarterly losses. The red ink resurfaced in the three months to the end of July, but the Dollars 312m loss reflected a one-time charge relating to a pivotal agreement with union members to reduce post-retirement benefits. In the quarter to end-October, the company surprised analysts with net income of Dollars 22m, or 22 cents a share. Yesterday Wall Street marked the stock up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 25 7/8 . The company's recent financial restructuring, part of the benefit settlement, made earnings forecasts and comparisons difficult. With demand showing no signs of flagging in the current quarter, the company lifted its forecasts for the 1993-94 fiscal year. Industry sales of trucks weighing more than 33,000lbs are expected to reach 185,000, up from the company's previous estimate of 160,000. The figure would represent an 11 per cent increase on fiscal 1992-93, when 166,000 units were sold.</p>

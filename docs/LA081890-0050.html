			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS BOARD SEEKS TO CUT 21-WEEK WAIT FOR CARE  </P> <P> In an effort to reduce the 21-week waiting period that AIDS patients now face  when seeking help at outpatient county medical facilities, the Los Angeles  County Commission on AIDS on Friday recommended the immediate expenditure of  $500,000 that had been set aside to staff a clinic next spring.  </P> <P> "A 21-week waiting period is a huge crisis . . . it is unconscionable," said  AIDS commission chairman Rand Schrader, a Los Angeles Municipal Court judge.  "We can't keep our money in the bank and tell people we'll help them later."  </P> <P> The money could help cut the 300-patient waiting list at County USC-Medical  Center in half by as early as the fall, according to officials.  </P> <P> Using the money now will cut into funding earmarked for operation of the  outpatient AIDS clinic scheduled to open at County-USC Medical Center next  April, Schrader said. He said the commission will deal with that problem when  it comes.  </P> <P> Schrader said the commission's hope is that once the additional staffing is in  place, the county Board of Supervisors will find it hard to cut back the level  of service and will continue funding it.  </P> <P> In response to the commission's recommendation, the county health department's  AIDS Program Office agreed to earmark the $500,000 to reduce the long waiting  period for initial appointments for patients with AIDS and the underlying human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  </P> <P> Program director Robert Frangenberg said his office will prepare an action plan  for the commission within the next few weeks. Once the plan is approved by the  commission, the health department will begin recruiting additional medical  personnel.  </P> <P> Frangenberg said these employees will be transferred to the outpatient clinic  at USC-Medical Center once it is built. The new facility will handle an  additional 1,000 patient visits per month. County-USC Medical Center now  handles 2,500 monthly visits.  </P> <P> Although the timing is hard to predict, Frangenberg said, he hopes to hire  additional staff within the next two or three months and ultimately reduce the  waiting list by about 50%.  </P> <P> While most of the additional staffing will occur at County-USC Medical Center,  which serves more than half of the county system's AIDS patients, Frangenberg  added that his office will also look into the possibility of distributing some  of the additional personnel at other county medical facilities serving  outpatients with HIV and AIDS.  </P> <P> AIDS advocacy groups greeted the commission's action with little more than a  shrug.  </P> <P> "It won't make a dent in the problem," said Connie Norman of the militant AIDS  Coalition to Unleash Power/Los Angeles (ACT UP/LA), which has staged several  demonstrations to pressure supervisors for additional AIDS funding.  </P> <P> "This little $500,000 is going to get sucked up in no time by a totally  bankrupt system," Norman added.  </P> <P> Schrader noted that the Board of Supervisors' recent appropriation of $3.5  million in new AIDS funding fell far short of the $9 million requested by the  commission, the AIDS Program Office and a coalition of community groups.  </P> <P> Mark Vandervelden, board chairman of the Shanti Project, which offers support  services for AIDS patients, said that the $500,000 expenditure is "a stopgap  measure" that "doesn't address the larger issue the county is facing with  respect to access to (AIDS) care generally."  </P> <P> "Even cutting the waiting time in half still leaves people waiting an  unacceptable period of time," he added. "We still have a long way to go before  people with HIV can receive treatment equal to that enjoyed by most people."  </P></p>

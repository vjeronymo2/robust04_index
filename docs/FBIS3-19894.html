			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dietrich Alexander: "Economics Crash Course for </F> Former Russian Officers"]    [Text] This afternoon, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will  inaugurate the Central Institute for the Conversion of Military  Personnel (ZIKWOK). After the center in St. Petersburg and  another in Moscow, it will be the third permanent institution in  Russia intended to retrain former Russian officers with German  help and prepare them for a civilian career. If everything  works according to plan, then some 700 people will go through  the Moscow center each year and receive commercial and computer  training. The Central Institute is part of a purely bilateral  program between Germany and four countries of the former Soviet  Union: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. It is funded  by the Federal Government with a total of 200 million German  marks [DM]. With this program and a housing-construction  scheme, Bonn has supported the withdrawal of the Soviet forces  from the new laender since 1991. In 1991, the Russian Government  published alarming figures, according to which some 50,000  officers would resign from military service each year until  1995. To this one must add the approximately 30,000 soldiers  who will return home from Germany in August 1994 and will no  longer serve in the Army.    Apart from the other two institutes in Russia and one each  in  Belarus and Ukraine, the ZIKWOK is the fifth functioning  retraining center in the former Soviet Union. At the end of the  year, when the German support program will expire, 14 centers  should be able to offer training and retraining independently:  nine in Russia, three in Ukraine, one in Belarus -- near Minsk,  and one in Kazakhstan -- near Almaty. About 7,000 former  officers per year will then undergo a crash course in economics  in 25 different careers.    At the same time, retraining seminars are being held in the  garrisons of the CIS forces in the new laender, which have so  far been attended by 12,822 officers. After a public  competition, a working group, headed by the German consulting  company Gopa (Corporation for Organization, Planning, and  Training), which is based in Bad Homburg, was commissioned to  implement this program of the Reconstruction Bank and what was  then the Soviet Labor Ministry.    Another retraining program is supported by the European  Union  with 12 million ECU (some DM23 million) as part of the program  for technical assistance for the new independent states (TACIS:  Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of New Independent  States). With these funds, 16,000 officers who are resigning  from military service are to be trained within the next three  years in the field of Western marketing and management in the  republics of the former Soviet Union.</p>

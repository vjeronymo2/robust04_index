			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Serene in Africa's Camelot - Nicholas Woodsworth takes a train ride to the Cape Town of his youth and finds little has changed around Table Mountain THE TRAIN that trundles southwards out of the Adderly Street station every half-hour or so has not changed in 25 years. Its carriages are still a dull rust-red. They still smell of heated metal, faint perspiration, and the fresh, salt tang of air blown in through open windows. Their seats, a rubbery blue vinyl, still stick to the back of the legs on hot February days. We are capable of blurring events which occured only yesterday, but there are childhood images and memories, retained randomly, which keep their definition forever. For me, rattling through the leafy suburbs of Cape Town not long ago, this train was full of such memories. The last time I rode down the curving scythe of the Cape peninsula I was a 12-year-old in shorts, navy blazer and school cap. More often than not these trips were frantic races against the clock, panicky executions of prep not done or last-minute crams for impending Latin tests. But on this particular morning I was anticipating a rather different kind of test. I had changed. Had Cape Town changed? Would I, after an absence of 25 years, be able to recognise the place I had grown up in? In the life of some cities, a quarter of a century is no time at all. But after a political ice age, South Africa is undergoing daily, dramatic transformations. The train I was sitting in had changed not at all. What, I wondered, lay on the other side of these station platforms?                          *       *      * If I was somewhat hesitant and confused about what change is bringing to Africa's most beautiful city, it was partly because Capetonians themselves are currently in the same state of confusion. After more than 300 years, they are prepared to admit, just about, that Cape Town is an African city - not the historic starting point of white, colonial expansion northward, but the end point of a vast continent, culturally and racially diverse, that sweeps southwards. This is a new view. Not far from the railway line, on the slopes of the sharp peak flanking Table Mountain, is the city's memorial to Cecil Rhodes. Here, escorted by eight bronze imperial lions, stands the statue of a mounted rider who stares with determined confidence, out across the Cape Flats, to some distant goal far up the length of Africa. Dedicated to the man who dreamed of creating a white dominion stretching from the Cape to Cairo, the statue is named, simply, 'Energy'. After decades of national division, violence and deep moral malaise, Capetonians seem finally willing to let the spirit of Rhodes rest. Like most other white South Africans, they see the inevitability of finally accommodating themselves to the continent they live on. The energy of white enterprise in Africa may still direct them, but the determined confidence is gone - today they look to the future with a great deal of uncertainty and soul-searching. Perhaps more than other whites, they fear the risk of loss, for until now the Cape has offered them a life quite unlike that found elsewhere in South Africa. Two factors - history and climate - make it unique. Cape Town is an old city. Some 300 years ago, when Dutch colonists first confronted local Hottentot and Bushman tribes here, it may have been on the cutting edge of events. But since then the frontier, and history, has moved on; the great tides of conflict that have swept over South Africa - black against white, Boer against Briton, Xhosa against Zulu - have risen and fallen time and again on the high veldt far to the north. Without a large black population forcing confrontation and change, the city has usually sat on the sidelines of the country's dramas and crises. Its largest group, more than 1m South Africans of mixed race, live in the townships of the Cape Flats and seem hardly to intrude on the life of the peninsula. It is Cape Town's 300,000 whites who have created and enjoy its affluent, privileged life-style. Genteel and old-fashioned, dignified and somewhat aloof, the city today is like a great aunt who has found a chair in a quiet corner of the drawing room. From the calm of the Cape peninsula she can observe, without becoming too deeply involved, the brash and unseemly behaviour of her younger cousins in the Transvaal and Natal; it is Johannesburg and other volatile cities, she knows, that will argue out the future of the feuding family that is South Africa. For her part, she carries on concocting what she has always has - the good life. In politics her white electorate, far from the centres of tension and conflict, can afford a liberal vote, and worry far more about recession, unemployment and rising crime than the prospect of a black president. Politics, in fact, is not really what interests this city at all. Held in thrall by a balmy Mediterranean climate and a stunning maritime topography, Cape Town tends, rather, to a sensual, outdoors view of life. Along the 45-mile length of the Cape peninsula Nature conspires to prove, whatever evidence exists to the contrary elsewhere, that life is rich, generous and pleasurable. Capetonians are only too ready to believe. They flock to the peninsula's beaches, cycle its mountain roads, roam its fragrant forests and vineyards, sail its surrounding oceans. With the massive bulk of Table Mountain looming over sidewalks in the very centre of the city, this is a place where beauty is unavoidable. If Johannesburg worries about the price of gold and Pretoria fusses over the minutiae of administration, that is their problem. What preoccupies Cape Town is cricket, the ambient water temperature off Clifton beach, and the prospects of buying decent sausage for next weekend's braai, or outdoor barbecue.                          *       *      * To me, wandering about the city's southern suburbs, Cape Town's essentially hedonistic character seemed to have changed little. Beyond the railway platforms, I found myself once again in a Capetonian version of Camelot, an idealised, suburban England moved far away to a sunny, affluent antipodes. In Newlands, I walked past ivy-covered houses set in well-manicured gardens. The trees were still as shady, the swimming pools as turquoise, the BMW's as well polished a they had ever been. Not even the clubby laughter and the leisurely thock . . . thock . . . thock sound of tennis in the fresh morning air had changed. In Rondebosch I visited my old secondary school; cheesecutter hats, the fag system and caning still make Tom Brown look like a contemporary there, but what are these inconveniences compared to the joys of a long and glorious rugby tradition? In Kenilworth, I sat in a pew at Christ Church, listening during choir practice to the same Anglican hymns that I had mumbled my way through there. Taking myself off through the winding lanes, elegant estates and white, Dutch-gabled farmhouses of Constantia, I met former schoolfriends, the sons of wealthy professionals, who are now wealthy professionals themselves. It seemed one generation had simply taken over from another. Had nothing changed at all? Physically, there are few dramatic alterations to life in Cape Town so far. A small number of the faces under those cheesecutters are now black. In the high-rise suburb of Sea Point, better-off mixed-race and Indian families have begun buying property. In some of the less expensive restaurants and bars in town there is a scattering of non-white patrons. The places where different races can and do mingle are limited - where apartheid is no longer operative money is, and shall continue to be far into the future. None the less, such minor transformations are signs of enormous shifts in attitude and willingness to change. Where other places have been pushed forward struggling, Cape Town has stepped more or less gracefully. If there is uncertainty and doubt about the future, there is also a good measure of hope. Sitting at Claremont station, waiting for the train back to the city centre, I talked to a young woman with little money, background or education, but a great deal of ambition. In a class of eight in her secretarial course at night school, she was the only white. A few years ago she would never have attended such a course, much less admit that she enjoyed the company. More liberal, under less racial strain, and benefitting from a relaxed attitude to life, Cape Town stands a better chance of success in the new South Africa than her sister cities. Like the train of my memories, the city has hardly changed, and the destination of a non-racial society remains a great distance off. But the passengers now at least seem willing to chance the ride.</p>

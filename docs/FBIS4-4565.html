			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo -- It has been decided that Naha City Mayor  Kosei Oyatomari will meet on 5 April with Prime Minister  Hosokawa to plead with the latter for the return of Naha harbor  facilities [including Naha Military Port]. The Ad Hoc Committee  on General Policy on Okinawa (chaired by Tsuruo Yamaguchi) of  the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan has arranged the  meeting and Kosuke Uehara, director general of the Okinawa  Development Agency, will attend.    It has been 20 years since both Japan and the United States,  at the 25th meeting of the Japan-U.S. Joint Security Committee  in 1974, agreed to return the Naha harbor facilities on  condition that a site was secured for their relocation. In  commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the reversion of  Okinawa to Japanese rule in 1991, Japan and the United States  began full-fledged discussions on how to return the harbor  facilities and the discussions have since continued with no  agreement reached.    In connection with problems arising from U.S. military bases  on Okinawa, Governor Ota met on 1 February with the prime  minister to plead with the latter. During the meeting, the  Okinawa prefectural governor also asked the prime minister to  work for the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield and the  Naha harbor facilities and a halt to live-firing exercise by  U.S. Forces on Okinawa across Prefectural Highway No. 104.</p>

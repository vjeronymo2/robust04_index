The method of constructing a  two-dimensional radar image is analyzed. The method is based on  application of the synthesized aperture method to the  development of a packet of broadband signals when one only knows  the intensity of the reflected signal. The quality of the  resultant image is studied. The limits imposed on the parameters  of the discrete signal (to avoid an ambiguous measurement) are  formulated. Modeling results are presented. Coherent  one-dimensional and two-dimensional portraits are contrasted.  Two-dimensional images are found to have a better resolution.  Noncoherent images are poorer than coherent ones, as noncoherent  images are plagued with false peaks and a decreased signal to  noise ratio. Figures 6; references 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Aiming to succeed where others have failed  -MSU's CD systems look set to find their way into homes world-wide / Growth from Technology The name on the box in the living room may be that of a well known Asian or American manufacturer, but the electronics inside will be British. That, at least, is the hope of MSU, a young UK company with big ambitions in the electronic home entertainment business. Ostensibly, the odds are against it. Japanese companies dominate the world-wide consumer electronics industry while US companies are making the running in multimedia - essentially interactive television - which many believe is the future of home entertainment. Yet MSU, working from a set of overcrowded offices in Milton Keynes, has secured contracts for its technology from big companies in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the US. Confidentiality clauses prevent identification of the companies concerned, but if MSU has read the market right, it can expect to see its systems gracing homes from Taipei to Tallahassee. It claims that its current contracts will ensure that more than 1m products with MSU technology will be sold next year. 'Current negotiations with other companies means it could be more than 3m units,' it says. MSU's expertise lies in compact disc technology. Not just audio CD, now found in almost half all US households, but a range of variations which together define a new generation of CD players. These include video CD, Photo CD, CD plus G (video CD with text and graphics superimposed) and karaoke CD. (Do not be sniffy about karaoke CD; the market in east Asia for these systems is huge and lucrative.) MSU designs the semiconductor chips, the electronic circuitry, and the software which make it possible to integrate all these functions into a single unit which plugs into the domestic television and hi-fi. So the customer will be able hear music, watch a movie, sing along with his or her favourite band and look at holiday snaps using the same machine. The system has also, of course, great potential for business presentations. Critically important from a marketing point of view, MSU's new generation CD machines will not cost appreciably more than existing audio CD machines. Mr Keith Hall, MSU managing director, believes other sophisticated CD systems have failed because they have been seen as an expensive addition to existing equipment rather than a replacement or upgrade for it: 'Millions of people will be planning to buy audio CD machines over the next few years, and many will be happy to pay an extra Pounds 100 for video CD.' The secret of MSU's technology is a set of specially designed semiconductor chips and software which take the heavily compressed information on the disc and expand it so it can be displayed on a television screen. MSU's chips are both powerful and cheaper than competitive products. It accepts it is not immune to competition, but it is already developing the next generation of chips to stay ahead. MSU will not manufacture CD players, however. It lacks the capital. Its strategy is to provide a turnkey service for other equipment manufacturers, providing them with a custom-built electronics package ready to be incorporated in a casing of their own design. MSU calls this 'generic CD'. MSU's chairman, Mr Wyn Holloway, is an old hand at undercutting the competition in electronics. Formerly a carpenter, he was named Welsh Businessman of the Year after setting up a company making low-cost computer game joysticks. Computer games culture permeates MSU. Mr Hall played a big part in launching the Commodore Pet and Apple Macintosh pcs in the UK. Head of research and development is Mr Martin Brennan, formerly chief engineer with Sir Clive Sinclair's Sinclair Research. The software engineers are for the most part ex-games authors: 'They are good at getting a lot of performance out of little computing power. We give them a lot of computing power,' Mr Hall says. Mr Holloway and Mr Hall formed the company in 1992. Its first contract, with the Chinese government, was for a low-cost games machine for the Chinese market. The following year the company contracted with TXC of Taiwan for the design of a games machine. These deals provided the seed capital, some Pounds 2m, for current developments. Last year turnover was Pounds 2m and losses amounted to Pounds 500,000. This year, turnover will amount to Pounds 12m and the company should make Pounds 3m in pre-tax profits. With development contracts in place, including a project for a large US computer maker, MSU does not see an immediate need for new investment, but Mr Hall admits that an extra Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 500,000 would enable the company to pursue extra lines of development. Going public is an option, and MSU is in discussions with stockbrokers. Mr Holloway says no decision has been taken; but if the company decided to go for a quote, the formalities could be undertaken quickly.

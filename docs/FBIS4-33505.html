			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ovidio Bellando] </F>   [Text] [President Carlos] Menem will meet with [U.S.  President Bill] Clinton before the end of the month if the steps  being taken by Raul Granillo Ocampo [Argentine ambassador to the  United States] in Washington are successful in making the  agendas of the two heads of state compatible.    The Argentine president is to attend the Ibero-American  Summit in Cartagena, Colombia, on 14-15 June, and will then make  a state visit to Canada from 20 to 22 June. The meeting being  considered by the U.S. Department of State and the White House  could therefore be held between these dates or on the way back  from Ottawa.    The idea of a meeting between the two presidents originated  at the top levels of government. Yet when some weeks ago the  president made it clear that he would not make a stopover in the  United States on his trip from Cartagena to Canada -- that he  would return to Buenos Aires due to affairs of state, and then  leave from there for Canada -- some circles in Washington  expressed their interest in Menem's reviewing his decision. In  other words, they considered such a meeting to be quite possible.    However, where could the meeting be held?    As all the bureaucratic formalities have not yet been gone  through, it is still not possible to talk about an event that is  certain, but rather about the possibilities, which are the  following:    -- If the U.S. President were to decide to attend the  inauguration of the World Cup of soccer or to go to some of the  matches, he could meet up with his Argentine counterpart.    -- If Clinton decided to spend some days resting in  California, he could play golf with Menem.    -- If Clinton's activities at the White House allowed him to  be free for luncheon, Menem would lunch with him.    Career diplomats, who are always willing to undertake  difficult tasks (like this one, on account of the dates),  believe that the meeting is likely to take place, and will even  be a promising one.    The analysis they make is that Argentina has become a  reliable country and an excellent channel for conveying to big  brother [preceding two words in English] the region's concerns.    In the view of the sources consulted, the Summit of the  Americas to be held in Miami on 8-9 December is just round the  corner, and its sponsor, the United States, has not proposed  subjects that have drawn much interest. Hence, the contribution  of a friend might help the host to offer a more attractive  agenda.    Menem is very much aware of the importance of elections --  even those for electing Constituent Assembly members -- and  knows that his friend -- according to the exchange of letters --  faces a difficult test in the upcoming November parliamentary  elections. The lack of definition concerning Haiti, for example,  may decrease the Democratic Party vote.    In other words, from a domestic standpoint, it would suit  Menem admirably to have another meeting with Clinton. After  all, it would be another proof that the United States takes  Argentina into consideration. Moreover, it would not be  immaterial for Clinton to listen to the opinion of a partner who  knows how to translate into words the thinking and reluctances  of his Latin American counterparts.</p>

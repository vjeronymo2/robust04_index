			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 4 Jan--Journalists of major newspapers are  prepared to suspend their publications beginning 11 January.  This protest action against the government's decision to  reevaluate the assets of national economic enterprises was  announced at a news conference today.    Editors in chief of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, MOSKOVSKAYA  PRAVDA,  VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA,  and many other publications said that Resolution No. 1233 of 25  December would result in a 600 percent increase in printing  costs and would, in fact, be tantamount to stifling the press.    Journalists' unions of Russia and Moscow, the Association of  Publishers and Editors in Chief, and the Fund for the Defense of  Glasnost have demanded the following: that purpose-built  allowances to publications be earmarked in order to continue  issuing the numbers of copies prepaid by subscribers; that a  special procedure for the implementation of the resolution in  printing and communications industries be introduced; and that  editorial collectives be offered real possibilities for  privatizing printing works and related facilities.    Stressing that the planned action was a forced measure,  Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Union of Journalists of  Russia, voiced the hope that the government would go halfway  toward meeting the journalists' demands in the very near future.  He said that a final decision on carrying out the action will  be made tomorrow. Furthermore, the majority of regional  publications in Russia are ready to participate. Radio and  television journalists will back their colleagues.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / G7 Summit in Naples: Russia looks to summit for economic gains Russia expects today's economic communique from the Naples summit to go a long way towards meeting Moscow's concerns, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister, said last night. He said he expected the communique to speak highly of Russia's reform programme and to go a considerable way towards accepting the Russian idea of a new relationship between the G7 economies and ex-communist states. Russia wanted ex-communist countries, including itself, to have greater access to international financial organisations and more access for their goods on world markets. Today's communique should uphold the principle that Russia should in due course join the new World Trade Organisation, said Mr Shokhin, who was speaking after meeting Italian officials. Referring to tomorrow's talks, in which President Boris Yeltsin will take part, Mr Shokhin said Russia wanted to participate in global mechanisms for dealing with such problems as nuclear safety, money laundering and heavily indebted countries. But he did not believe the problem of nuclear safety in Ukraine should be solved by replacing all Russian technology with western technology. Mr Shokhin said Russia would explore with the G7 ways of encouraging foreign investment without automatically providing full government guarantees for projects in Russia. In contrast with previous encounters with the G7, Russia is not asking its partners this time for more government-to-government credits. Its balance of payments improved markedly last year, and officials are confident of a spontaneous inflow of private capital, much of it Russian-controlled but currently held abroad, now that the first phase of a privatisation programme is over.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NEW ZEALAND, JAPAN GAIN IN DUNHILL CUP  </P> <P> Unseeded New Zealand kept the upsets rolling in the Dunhill Cup today and Japan  ousted the French team that had earlier knocked the defending champion  Americans out of the tournament.  </P> <P> The Japanese blanked France 3-0 as the French team of Marc Farry, Emmanuel  Dussart and Jean Van de Velde never showed the kind of play that helped them  eliminate the top-seeded United States in Thursday's first round.  </P> <P> Simon Owen and Greg Turner won bogey battles at the notorious 17th of the Old  Course, the Road Hole, helping lead New Zealand to a 2-1 victory over  seventh-seeded Wales.  </P> <P> Third-seeded Ireland reached the semifinals for the third year in a row with a  2-1 victory over sixth-seeded Spain.  </P> <P> British bookmakers made Ireland the favorite to win the cup Sunday.  </P> <P> Japan's Satoshi Higashi, Yoshinori Kaneko and Hajime Meshiai, last year's  runners-up and seeded eighth, play fifth-seeded England in Saturday's  semifinals.  </P> <P> Even without top-ranked Nick Faldo, sitting out the tournament with an injury,  the English beat fourth-seeded Scotland 2-1, as Mark James edged Sam Torrance  by one stroke in the day's final match.  </P> <P> New Zealand, which eliminated second-seeded Australia in the first round, next  plays Ireland, the highest-seeded squad left in the $1 million medal-match play  tournament.  </P> <P> But the Japanese trio, which calls itself "Team Jumbo" after fellow golfer and  mentor Jumbo Ozaki, never was in trouble against France on a warm, breezy day.  </P> <P> Higashi beat Farry 71-80, the Frenchman taking a triple-bogey 7 on the second  hole and falling from there. Kaneko beat Dussart 71-75, taking the lead for  good with a birdie-3 on the third. And Meshiai completed the sweep with a 70-72  victory over Van de Velde, wrapping it up with two birdies on the back nine.  </P> <P> At Cely, France, Cathy Gerring shot a second straight 69 today and held the  lead after two rounds of the LPGA World Championship, while Japan's Ayako  Okamoto surged into contention with a 6-under-par 66.  </P> <P> Gerring, one of 13 U.S. golfers in the 16-woman field, was at 138, 6-under-par  and one stroke ahead of Okamoto.  </P> <P> Two other Americans, Betsy King and Danielle Ammaccapane, were tied for third  at 141.  </P></p>

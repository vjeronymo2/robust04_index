			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK boffins breed a better lupin Lupins, the early summer stalwarts of most British gardens, could soon proliferate over much of the country's farmland, and contribute to reducing the trade deficit. Government research has developed a new strain of white lupin that is suitable for growing in Britain on a commercial basis and can be made into animal feed. The white flowers could be grown by farmers for sale to cattle feedmakers in two to three years. The new variety grows seed pods that are rich in protein - unlike the poisonous seeds of their country garden counterparts. The seeds, which contain almost 40 to 50 per cent edible protein and 10 to 12 per cent oil, can be crushed to make animal feedstuff. Much of Britain's animal feed is now made from soyabeans, which are imported from the US at an annual cost of around Pounds 350m. Some 30,000 tonnes of lupins are imported from Australia as an additive to livestock feeds. Research at Cranfield University has shown that the new strain of lupin would be suitable for growing on 43 per cent of farmland in England and Wales. 'In the past we had a go at growing the old varieties of lupin, but they couldn't stand the cold and frost,' says Mr John Hollis at the university's Soil Survey and Land Research Centre. The new hardier variety can be planted in September to produce a flower the following summer. The plants have also been genetically manipulated so that the flowers grow closer to the top of the stem and are exposed to the maximum amount of sunlight, with the result that they ripen more quickly. The plants are partial to acid, or poorer soils, but will not grow on lime-rich soil. 'Providing you don't have a natural limey soil and you hit the crop planting window right at the beginning of September, you can expect yields of 4 to 5 tonnes an acre,' says Mr Hollis. Lupins are grown commercially in Australia and parts of South America. In Chile the seeds are fried up and eaten as a snack.</p>

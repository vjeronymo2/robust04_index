			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING WAVES OVER A SEA STORY  </P> <P> It is unfathomable that Fox threw $43 million in the drink to produce "The  Abyss" ("Fox Plunges Into 'The Abyss' ").  </P> <P> The tale of a submersible extraterrestrial spacecraft setting up a bivouac in  Davy Jones' locker has already been filmed twice, in two excellent, albeit  relatively inexpensive, renditions: "The Atomic Submarine" (1959) and  "Destination Inner Space" (1966).  </P> <P> Both of these versions were marked by imaginative scripting, solid acting and  fairly decent special effects, especially considering their skeletal budgets.  </P> <P> Why the need for an updated albatross that seems doomed to sink at the box  office?  </P> <P> FRANKLIN R. RUEHL  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

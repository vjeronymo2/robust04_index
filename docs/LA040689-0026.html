			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK REJECTS ACCUSATION THAT DOSSIN ILLEGALLY TOOK DONATION  </P> <P> Burbank Councilwoman Mary E. Kelsey on Wednesday accused Mayor Al F. Dossin of  illegally accepting a campaign contribution during the city's February election  that he did not report. But city officials said that Kelsey had made a mistake  and that Dossin apparently has violated no laws.  </P> <P> Kelsey, who was defeated in the election, said Dossin's campaign accepted a  $2,371 contribution from a political action committee formed by the Burbank  Firefighters Assn. on Feb. 21, 10 days after the deadline for reporting  campaign contributions to the Burbank city clerk's office.  </P> <P> Kelsey said Dossin was required by the state Political Reform Act to report any  contribution greater than $1,000 within 24 hours of receiving it, or in a  post-election report listing his contributions. The election was Feb. 28.  </P> <P> She said the contribution was used to distribute what she called a "nasty  brochure" that presented a "grossly distorted and misleading comparison of  candidates" running for three seats on the Burbank City Council. The brochure  endorsed Dossin and criticized her.  </P> <P> Dossin finished fourth out of 14 candidates and earned a place in a runoff for  two seats, which will be held Tuesday.  </P> <P> Kelsey said Dossin was trying to avoid disclosing the connection between his  campaign "and the coordinated campaign to defeat me" by the firefighters union.  </P> <P> She said she was considering calling for an investigation into her charges by  the Los Angeles district attorney's office, the Burbank city attorney's office  and the state Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> Dossin called Kelsey's accusations "ridiculous. There's absolutely nothing to  it. I realize she feels bad about not making the runoff, but I had nothing to  do with this."  </P> <P> City Clerk Merle Woodburn said Kelsey was mistaken. She said the firefighters  committee did not contribute directly to Dossin's campaign, but spent the  $2,371 in support of him, which is not a violation of state law.  </P> <P> She said Dossin apparently had no knowledge of the union's action and was not  consulted about the mailer.  </P> <P> Lew Stone, president of the firefighters association, said that through a  clerical error, the committee neglected to mark the $2,371 as an independent  expenditure on a form filed with the city clerk's office. He said that FPPC  officials told him that the committee had not violated any laws and that he  only had to file an amendment to the statement to correct the mistake.  </P> <P> "This is an unfortunate way for Mrs. Kelsey to end her tenure on the council,"  Stone said.  </P></p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Schneider may lift Square D offer GROUPE SCHNEIDER, the French electrical products maker, revealed yesterday it was willing to increase its offer for Square D, of Illinois, if a merger along the lines it has proposed can be agreed promptly. But, according to a trade paper report, Square D is seeking finance for a leveraged recapitalisation. In a letter to Mr Jerre Stead, Square D chairman, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, Schneider's chairman, urged the Square D board not to enter into any commitment or course of action that would deny Schneider the chance to negotiate its proposal 'on an equal basis'. Square D has spurned a Schneider offer made last February of Dollars 78 per share, or Dollars 1.9bn, which it considers inadequate. The offer has, however, lead to Square D's shareholders tendering 78 per cent of the company's shares. In a March filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Square D said it would pursue the possibilities of a leveraged buyout or reorganisation, as well as finding another partner for a merger or alliance. According to a report yesterday in the daily trade paper, The American Banker, the US company recently asked seven US banks to consider providing more than Dollars 1bn in financing for a leveraged recapitalisation. The deal would be the largest leveraged recapitalisation in more than a year. A recapitalisation could be used to declare a special dividend which would serve as compensation for not selling to Schneider. The price of Square D's shares have appreciated some 50 per cent since the Schneider offer. Although a large percentage of shares has been tendered, their purchase by Schneider cannot be completed until the Square D board agrees to two conditions: first, that it lift its legal obligation requiring a hostile takeover bidder to acquire 85 per cent of the shares; and, second, that it remove a poison pill provision from company by-laws. The board has so far refused to do so.</p>

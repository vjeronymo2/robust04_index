			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["ls" report: "Is Berlin Facing a Narcotics Wave?"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Police experts see a new wave  of drugs approaching the German capital. So far, there have  been 8,000 to 9,000 heroin or cocaine addicts in Berlin,  according to official estimates. Says an investigator: "I am  sure that in the future the large East European dealers will use  the distribution network for illegal cigarettes to sell hard  drugs.''    There is also a new route for smuggling drugs into the  capital--the West African route. The drugs come from Ghana via  Zurich to Berlin. Since the end of last year the drug  investigators have been watching this trend. The drug couriers  swallow condoms filled with drugs, so-called containers. Then  they fly to Europe and report to their contacts. At the end of  1993 alone the investigators caught four couriers from Ghana  with forged passports. According to findings by the criminal  police, the hot goods are partly produced in western Africa.  However, South American cartels, too, use Ghana as an interim  storage site for transports to Germany. Behind the African  gangs of smugglers there are mostly old tribal ties with a  strict hierarchy and their own language. Last year Berlin drug  investigators seized 15 kg of heroin and 35 kg of cocaine. In  1992 they caught 12.3 kg of heroin and 26.5 kg of cocaine.</p>
